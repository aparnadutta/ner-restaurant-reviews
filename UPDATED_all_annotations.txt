This O O N/A
review O O N/A
concerns O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
others, O O N/A
a O O N/A
place O O N/A
that O O N/A
stumbled O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A
start, O O N/A
as O O N/A
ungainly O O N/A
as O O N/A
a O O N/A
day-old O O N/A
giraffe, O O N/A
and O O N/A
only O O N/A
recently O O N/A
found O O N/A
its O O N/A
footing. O O N/A

the O O N/A
West B-LOC B-LOC N/A
Village I-LOC I-LOC N/A
in O O N/A
March O O N/A
in O O N/A
what O O N/A
seemed O O N/A
an O O N/A
auspicious O O N/A
location, O O N/A
a O O N/A
corner O O N/A
spot O O N/A
looking O O N/A
out O O N/A
on O O N/A
Abingdon B-LOC B-LOC N/A
Square I-LOC I-LOC N/A
Park I-LOC I-LOC N/A
through O O N/A

Two O O N/A
months O O N/A
in, O O N/A
Einat O O N/A
Admony, O O N/A
the O O N/A
chef O O N/A
and O O N/A
owner, O O N/A
was O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
verge O O N/A
of O O N/A
closing O O N/A
it, O O N/A
she O O N/A
said O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
phone O O N/A
interview. O O N/A
Nearly O O N/A
half O O N/A
of O O N/A
her O O N/A
54 O O N/A
seats O O N/A
had O O N/A
been O O N/A
taken O O N/A
away O O N/A
after O O N/A
the O O N/A
city O O N/A
ruled O O N/A
that O O N/A
one O O N/A
wing O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
dining O O N/A
room O O N/A
was O O N/A
an O O N/A
unpermitted O O N/A
sidewalk O O N/A
enclosure. O O N/A
The O O N/A
disputed O O N/A
area O O N/A
was O O N/A
quarantined O O N/A
behind O O N/A
a O O N/A
velvet O O N/A
rope, O O N/A
although O O N/A
it O O N/A
was O O N/A
hard O O N/A
to O O N/A
imagine O O N/A
a O O N/A
crowd O O N/A
lining O O N/A
up O O N/A
for O O N/A
admission O O N/A
to O O N/A
this O O N/A
patch O O N/A
of O O N/A
bare O O N/A
cement O O N/A
floor. O O N/A
This O O N/A
put O O N/A
a O O N/A
strain O O N/A
on O O N/A
revenues, O O N/A
no O O N/A
doubt, O O N/A
and O O N/A
made O O N/A
the O O N/A
place O O N/A
look O O N/A
pretty O O N/A
weird. O O N/A
Even O O N/A
with O O N/A
reduced O O N/A
capacity, O O N/A
Bar B-EST B-EST N/A
Bolonat I-EST I-EST N/A
was O O N/A
afflicted O O N/A
by O O N/A
suboptimal O O N/A
acoustics. O O N/A
When O O N/A
I O O N/A
ate O O N/A
there O O N/A
early O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
summer, O O N/A
the O O N/A
screeching O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
dining O O N/A
room O O N/A
could O O N/A
have O O N/A
crushed O O N/A
scrap O O N/A
metal. O O N/A
It O O N/A
nearly O O N/A
crushed O O N/A
my O O N/A
desire O O N/A
to O O N/A
come O O N/A
back, O O N/A
too, O O N/A
but O O N/A
I O O N/A
held O O N/A
on O O N/A
because O O N/A
Ms. O O N/A
Admony O O N/A
was O O N/A
up O O N/A
to O O N/A
something O O N/A
original O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
kitchen. O O N/A
The O O N/A
daughter O O N/A
of O O N/A
an O O N/A
Iranian O O N/A
mother O O N/A
and O O N/A
Yemenite O O N/A
father, O O N/A
she O O N/A
was O O N/A
combining O O N/A
the O O N/A
flavors O O N/A
of O O N/A
contemporary O O N/A
multiethnic O O N/A
Israel, O B-LOC N/A
where O O N/A
she O O N/A
grew O O N/A
up, O O N/A
with O O N/A
the O O N/A

of O O N/A
modern O O N/A
restaurants O O N/A
in O O N/A
New B-LOC B-EST N/A

where O O N/A
she O O N/A
has O O N/A

1999. O O N/A

never O O N/A
tasted O O N/A
anything O O N/A
exactly O O N/A
like O O N/A

I O O N/A
wanted O O N/A
more O O N/A

like O O N/A
this O O N/A
in O O N/A
my O O N/A

but O O N/A

Now, O O N/A
with O O N/A
sound-absorbing O O N/A

up O O N/A
above, O O N/A
Bar B-EST B-EST N/A
Bolonat I-EST I-EST N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
quieter O O N/A
restaurant, O O N/A
though O O N/A
it's O O N/A
not O O N/A
entirely O O N/A
library-like. O O N/A
(One O O N/A
small O O N/A
section O O N/A
of O O N/A
ceiling, O O N/A
without O O N/A

It's O O N/A
also O O N/A
bigger. O O N/A
In O O N/A
September, O O N/A
Ms. O O N/A
Admony O O N/A
finally O O N/A
appeased O O N/A
the O O N/A

and O O N/A
returned O O N/A
all O O N/A
her O O N/A
seats O O N/A
to O O N/A
active O O N/A
duty. O O N/A
While O O N/A
fixing O O N/A
up O O N/A
the O O N/A
space, O O N/A
she O O N/A
made O O N/A
other O O N/A

replacing O O N/A
executive O O N/A

until O O N/A
she O O N/A
found O O N/A

When O O N/A
I O O N/A
ate O O N/A
there O O N/A
this O O N/A

the O O N/A

seasoned O O N/A

just O O N/A
enough O O N/A

Like O O N/A
almost O O N/A
all O O N/A

the O O N/A
shoulder O O N/A
ham, O O N/A
layered O O N/A
between O O N/A
fontina O O N/A

want O O N/A
more O O N/A
time O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
oven, O O N/A
or O O N/A
maybe O O N/A
it O O N/A
needed O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
sliced O O N/A
thin, O O N/A
so O O N/A
the O O N/A

could O O N/A
crisp O O N/A
and O O N/A
curl. O O N/A
Few O O N/A

Main O O N/A

they O O N/A

not O O N/A
as O O N/A

managed O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
both O O N/A

and O O N/A
undercooked, O O N/A
while O O N/A
a O O N/A
slow-roasted O O N/A
short O O N/A

needed O O N/A
a O O N/A
more O O N/A

was O O N/A
a O O N/A

exception, O O N/A
but O O N/A
in O O N/A
general O O N/A
the O O N/A
larger O O N/A

A O O N/A

It O O N/A
costs O O N/A
just O O N/A

is O O N/A
helpful O O N/A
because O O N/A
pizza O O N/A

of O O N/A

some O O N/A

taste O O N/A
of O O N/A
fresh O O N/A

in O O N/A
some O O N/A

a O O N/A

of O O N/A

The O O N/A
least O O N/A
Korean O O N/A
thing O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu O O N/A
must O O N/A
be O O N/A
the O O N/A
foie O O N/A

terrine, O O N/A
and O O N/A
it's O O N/A
also O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
only O O N/A
disappointments, O O N/A
with O O N/A
its O O N/A
crumbly O O N/A
Melba O O N/A

washed-out O O N/A

A O O N/A
dish O O N/A
called O O N/A
nurungji O O N/A
gras O O N/A
is O O N/A
something O O N/A
else O O N/A
entirely: O O N/A
a O O N/A
fine O O N/A
seared O O N/A
hunk O O N/A
of O O N/A
foie O O N/A
gras O O N/A
laid O O N/A
over O O N/A
spinach O O N/A
and O O N/A
pickled O O N/A
mushrooms O O N/A
on O O N/A
a O O N/A
springy, O O N/A
crunchy O O N/A
sizzled O O N/A
rice O O N/A
cake. O O N/A
Slabs O O N/A
of O O N/A
pork O O N/A
belly O O N/A
are O O N/A
braised O O N/A
until O O N/A
the O O N/A
fat O O N/A
streaks O O N/A
are O O N/A
nearly O O N/A
liquid. O O N/A
Then O O N/A
they're O O N/A
given O O N/A
a O O N/A
meaningful O O N/A
sear O O N/A
and O O N/A
served O O N/A
alongside O O N/A
a O O N/A
stripe O O N/A
of O O N/A
a O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
I've O O N/A
never O O N/A
had O O N/A
before, O O N/A
made O O N/A
with O O N/A
fermented O O N/A
shrimp O O N/A
and O O N/A
green O O N/A
plums O O N/A

fresh O O N/A
red O O N/A
peppers: O O N/A
spicy, O O N/A
salty, O O N/A
sour O O N/A
and O O N/A
hot. O O N/A
The O O N/A
dish O O N/A
that O O N/A
breaks O O N/A
the O O N/A
$20 O O N/A
barrier O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
short O O N/A
rib. O O N/A
If O O N/A
you've O O N/A
had O O N/A
Daniel's O O N/A
braised O O N/A
short O O N/A
ribs O O N/A
, O O N/A
the O O N/A
tenderness O O N/A
and O O N/A
concentration O O N/A
will O O N/A
be O O N/A
familiar O O N/A
to O O N/A
you, O O N/A
although O O N/A
Soogil's O O N/A
version O O N/A
is O O N/A
pointedly O O N/A
suffused O O N/A
with O O N/A
soy O O N/A
rather O O N/A
than O O N/A
red O O N/A
wine. O O N/A
Underlining O O N/A
the O O N/A
French O O N/A
connection, O O N/A
this O O N/A
block O O N/A
of O O N/A
beef O O N/A
is O O N/A
served O O N/A
with O O N/A
carrots, O O N/A
potatoes O O N/A
and O O N/A
winter O O N/A
squash. O O N/A
If O O N/A
you O O N/A
eat O O N/A
it O O N/A
by O O N/A
yourself, O O N/A
you O O N/A
could O O N/A
make O O N/A
dinner O O N/A
of O O N/A
it. O O N/A
After O O N/A
which O O N/A
you O O N/A
should O O N/A
probably O O N/A
investigate O O N/A
something O O N/A
that O O N/A
goes O O N/A
by O O N/A
the O O N/A
name O O N/A
Jenga O O N/A
Tower. O O N/A
Cigarettes O O N/A
of O O N/A
fried O O N/A
dough, O O N/A
chewy O O N/A
like O O N/A
rice O O N/A
sticks, O O N/A
are O O N/A
stacked O O N/A
like O O N/A
a O O N/A

then O O N/A

You O O N/A
pull O O N/A
out O O N/A
a O O N/A
stick O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A
time O O N/A
until O O N/A
the O O N/A
tower O O N/A
falls O O N/A
and O O N/A
brings O O N/A
down O O N/A
the O O N/A
scoop O O N/A
of O O N/A
honey-and-chestnut O O N/A
gelato O O N/A
balanced O O N/A
on O O N/A
top. O O N/A
The O O N/A
dining O O N/A
room O O N/A
could O O N/A
take O O N/A
a O O N/A
few O O N/A
lessons O O N/A
in O O N/A
balance O O N/A
from O O N/A
that O O N/A
dessert. O O N/A
The O O N/A
lights O O N/A
could O O N/A
be O O N/A
dimmed O O N/A
by O O N/A
a O O N/A
few O O N/A
clicks. O O N/A
The O O N/A
pop O O N/A
music, O O N/A
while O O N/A
not O O N/A
actively O O N/A
awful, O O N/A
is O O N/A
just O O N/A
odd O O N/A
enough O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
subliminally O O N/A
distracting. O O N/A
Soogil O O N/A
can't O O N/A
seem O O N/A
to O O N/A
find O O N/A
the O O N/A
right O O N/A
tone O O N/A
for O O N/A
service, O O N/A
either. O O N/A
Some O O N/A
nights O O N/A
it's O O N/A
very O O N/A
familiar O O N/A
and O O N/A
on O O N/A
others, O O N/A
peculiarly O O N/A
fussy O O N/A
-- O O N/A
a O O N/A
server O O N/A
insisted O O N/A
on O O N/A
giving O O N/A
the O O N/A
book O O N/A
I'd O O N/A
brought O O N/A
a O O N/A
chair O O N/A
of O O N/A
its O O N/A
own. O O N/A
These O O N/A
are O O N/A
minor O O N/A
snags, O O N/A
but O O N/A
sorting O O N/A
them O O N/A
out O O N/A
is O O N/A
tricky, O O N/A
especially O O N/A
for O O N/A
first-time O O N/A
restaurateurs. O O N/A
Somewhere O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
middle O O N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
relaxed, O O N/A

so O O N/A
I O O N/A
asked O O N/A
the O O N/A

next O O N/A
to O O N/A
me, O O N/A
who O O N/A

she O O N/A

"They O O N/A

I O O N/A

Mr. O O N/A

6-year-old O O N/A

They're O O N/A

all O O N/A
of O O N/A

Ms. O O N/A

seems O O N/A
to O O N/A
be, O O N/A
but O O N/A
the O O N/A
same O O N/A

offers O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
most O O N/A
astonishing O O N/A
ice O O N/A
creams O O N/A
around. O O N/A
Made O O N/A
with O O N/A
beeswax, O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
as O O N/A
deeply O O N/A
aromatic O O N/A
as O O N/A
honey O O N/A
but O O N/A
not O O N/A
as O O N/A
sweet, O O N/A
and O O N/A
its O O N/A
texture O O N/A
is O O N/A
intensely O O N/A
creamy O O N/A
but O O N/A
not O O N/A
at O O N/A
all O O N/A
waxy. O O N/A
The O O N/A
rest O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu O O N/A
is O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
hands O O N/A
of O O N/A
Matt O O N/A

until O O N/A
recently O O N/A
in O O N/A

of O O N/A
the O O N/A

at O O N/A
Fedora O O N/A

He O O N/A
does O O N/A
a O O N/A
neat O O N/A
balancing O O N/A
trick O O N/A
here, O O N/A
giving O O N/A
his O O N/A
adventurous O O N/A
side O O N/A
free O O N/A
rein O O N/A
at O O N/A
times O O N/A
while O O N/A
more O O N/A
often O O N/A
using O O N/A
it O O N/A
to O O N/A
add O O N/A
interest O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
standards O O N/A
a O O N/A
hotel O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
probably O O N/A
needs. O O N/A
A O O N/A
winningly O O N/A
over-the-top O O N/A
recent O O N/A
special O O N/A
was O O N/A
a O O N/A
custard-soaked O O N/A
pain O O N/A
perdu O O N/A
under O O N/A
bacon O O N/A
jus, O O N/A
pickled O O N/A
cabbage O O N/A
and O O N/A
speck, O O N/A
like O O N/A
some O O N/A
kind O O N/A
of O O N/A
demented O O N/A
Reuben-croque O O N/A
monsieur O O N/A
hybrid. O O N/A
Liver O O N/A
and O O N/A
onions O O N/A
turned O O N/A
out O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
a O O N/A
less O O N/A
thrilling O O N/A
snack: O O N/A
pickled O O N/A
onions O O N/A
with O O N/A
deep-fried O O N/A
and O O N/A
overcooked O O N/A
chicken O O N/A
livers. O O N/A
Until O O N/A
it O O N/A
swam O O N/A
off O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu, O O N/A
there O O N/A
was O O N/A
an O O N/A
intriguing O O N/A
sideways O O N/A
version O O N/A
of O O N/A
squid O O N/A
ink O O N/A
risotto O O N/A
that O O N/A
had O O N/A
beech O O N/A
mushrooms O O N/A
and O O N/A
very O O N/A
tender O O N/A
squid O O N/A
confit O O N/A
over O O N/A
a O O N/A
black O O N/A
porridge O O N/A
of O O N/A
barley. O O N/A
Now O O N/A
there O O N/A
are O O N/A
spring O O N/A
peas, O O N/A
swirled O O N/A
with O O N/A
mint O O N/A
into O O N/A
a O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
for O O N/A
just-firm O O N/A
shrimp; O O N/A
the O O N/A
combination O O N/A
suggested O O N/A
pasta, O O N/A
but O O N/A
I O O N/A
was O O N/A
glad O O N/A
to O O N/A
have O O N/A
it O O N/A
without O O N/A
any O O N/A
starch O O N/A
getting O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
way O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
clear, O O N/A
sweet O O N/A
flavors. O O N/A
If O O N/A
it's O O N/A
pasta O O N/A
you O O N/A
want, O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Griffin O O N/A
has O O N/A
a O O N/A
glossy, O O N/A
chile-speckled O O N/A
bowl O O N/A
of O O N/A
spaghetti O O N/A
acqua O O N/A
pazza O O N/A
with O O N/A
littleneck O O N/A
clams O O N/A
and O O N/A
cherry O O N/A
tomatoes, O O N/A
and O O N/A
while O O N/A
the O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
is O O N/A
thicker O O N/A
and O O N/A
glossier O O N/A
than O O N/A
a O O N/A
normal O O N/A
acqua O O N/A
pazza, O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
very O O N/A
good. O O N/A
What O O N/A
he O O N/A
calls O O N/A
a O O N/A
pork-collar O O N/A
Milanese O O N/A
is O O N/A
maybe O O N/A
a O O N/A
few O O N/A
millimeters O O N/A
too O O N/A
thick O O N/A
for O O N/A
the O O N/A
name, O O N/A
but O O N/A
I'll O O N/A
take O O N/A
it. O O N/A
The O O N/A
cut O O N/A
is O O N/A
more O O N/A
flavorful O O N/A
than O O N/A
a O O N/A
normal O O N/A
cutlet, O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
apricot O O N/A
mostarda O O N/A
makes O O N/A
a O O N/A
pungent O O N/A
and O O N/A
welcome O O N/A
counterpoint. O O N/A
If O O N/A
you O O N/A
can't O O N/A
finish O O N/A
the O O N/A
whole O O N/A
thing, O O N/A
it O O N/A
will O O N/A
be O O N/A
taken O O N/A
away O O N/A

replaced O O N/A
by O O N/A

No, O O N/A

It O O N/A
has O O N/A
soaring O O N/A
ceilings, O O N/A
a O O N/A
backlit O O N/A
bar O O N/A
with O O N/A
shelves O O N/A
so O O N/A
high O O N/A
the O O N/A

can O O N/A
be O O N/A

only O O N/A

In O O N/A

words, O O N/A
it O O N/A
looks O O N/A

The O O N/A

What O O N/A
the O O N/A

are O O N/A
the O O N/A

that O O N/A
can O O N/A

a O O N/A

When O O N/A
it O O N/A

to O O N/A
sashimi, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
this O O N/A
is O O N/A
not O O N/A
much O O N/A
of O O N/A
a O O N/A
liability, O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
firmness O O N/A
of O O N/A
Wokuni's O O N/A
fish O O N/A
becomes O O N/A
a O O N/A
point O O N/A
in O O N/A
its O O N/A

Before O O N/A

anything O O N/A

specials O O N/A
posted O O N/A
by O O N/A
the O O N/A
chef, O O N/A
Kuniaki O O N/A

They O O N/A
will O O N/A
almost O O N/A
always O O N/A
include O O N/A
several O O N/A
cuts O O N/A
of O O N/A

from O O N/A

to O O N/A

the O O N/A

rice O O N/A
bowl O O N/A

kitchen O O N/A
makes O O N/A
only O O N/A
five O O N/A
Wokuni-dons O O N/A
a O O N/A
day, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
so O O N/A
chances O O N/A
are O O N/A
you O O N/A
will O O N/A
have O O N/A
to O O N/A
content O O N/A
yourself O O N/A
with O O N/A
the O O N/A
kaisen-don, O O N/A

chances O O N/A
are O O N/A
that O O N/A
even O O N/A
though O O N/A
it O O N/A
doesn't O O N/A
include O O N/A
tempura, O O N/A
the O O N/A
$18 O O N/A
you O O N/A
pay O O N/A
will O O N/A
still O O N/A
seem O O N/A
like O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
best O O N/A
raw-fish O O N/A
deals O O N/A
in O O N/A

Things O O N/A
get O O N/A
even O O N/A
more O O N/A
intriguing O O N/A
when O O N/A
Wokuni's O O N/A
seafood O O N/A
comes O O N/A
into O O N/A
contact O O N/A
with O O N/A
heat. O O N/A
Again, O O N/A
the O O N/A
specials O O N/A
should O O N/A
be O O N/A
your O O N/A
starting O O N/A
point. O O N/A
There O O N/A
may O O N/A
well O O N/A
be O O N/A
a O O N/A
grilled O O N/A

this O O N/A
at O O N/A
your O O N/A
favorite O O N/A

it O O N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
good O O N/A

that O O N/A
you O O N/A
will O O N/A
be O O N/A
surprised O O N/A
by O O N/A
how O O N/A
much O O N/A
cleaner O O N/A
and O O N/A
sweeter O O N/A
it O O N/A
tastes O O N/A
here. O O N/A
Bluefin O O N/A
collars O O N/A
and O O N/A
jaws O O N/A
are O O N/A
not O O N/A
served O O N/A
often O O N/A
enough O O N/A
for O O N/A
anybody O O N/A
to O O N/A
get O O N/A
into O O N/A
the O O N/A
habit O O N/A
of O O N/A
ordering O O N/A
them. O O N/A

grilled O O N/A
collar O O N/A
at O O N/A
Wokuni O O N/A
one O O N/A
recent O O N/A
night O O N/A
was O O N/A

of O O N/A
the O O N/A
greatest O O N/A
pieces O O N/A
of O O N/A
cooked O O N/A
fish O O N/A
I've O O N/A
had O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
long O O N/A
time, O O N/A
every O O N/A
bit O O N/A
of O O N/A
it O O N/A
worth O O N/A
chasing O O N/A
into O O N/A
the O O N/A
hollows O O N/A
of O O N/A
bone, O O N/A
skin O O N/A
and O O N/A
cartilage O O N/A
where O O N/A
it O O N/A
hid. O O N/A
It O O N/A
is O O N/A
not O O N/A
always O O N/A
available, O O N/A
but O O N/A
the O O N/A
grilled O O N/A
bluefin O O N/A
tail O O N/A
is, O O N/A
carved O O N/A
into O O N/A
a O O N/A
steak O O N/A
with O O N/A
the O O N/A
backbone O O N/A
sliced O O N/A
open O O N/A
so O O N/A
you O O N/A
can O O N/A
get O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A
teaspoonful O O N/A
of O O N/A
hot, O O N/A
clear O O N/A
jelly O O N/A

Mr. O O N/A
Yoshizawa O O N/A
has O O N/A
had O O N/A
the O O N/A
surprising O O N/A
idea O O N/A
of O O N/A
treating O O N/A
the O O N/A
angles O O N/A
and O O N/A
corners O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
sea O O N/A
bream's O O N/A

fried O O N/A

and O O N/A
served O O N/A
with O O N/A

they O O N/A
are O O N/A

to O O N/A

go O O N/A

either O O N/A

the O O N/A
fish O O N/A
species O O N/A
changes O O N/A
from O O N/A
night O O N/A
to O O N/A
night, O O N/A
but O O N/A
it O O N/A
tends O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
extremely O O N/A
fresh, O O N/A
crunchy O O N/A
and O O N/A
light O O N/A
on O O N/A

The O O N/A
chips, O O N/A
made O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A
Japanese O O N/A
mountain O O N/A
yam, O O N/A
were O O N/A
never O O N/A
crunchy O O N/A
and O O N/A
always O O N/A
needed O O N/A
more O O N/A
salt. O O N/A
Sometimes O O N/A
salt O O N/A
came O O N/A
with O O N/A
them, O O N/A
and O O N/A
sometimes O O N/A
it O O N/A
didn't. O O N/A
Those O O N/A
yam O O N/A
fries O O N/A
are O O N/A
an O O N/A
example O O N/A
of O O N/A
what O O N/A

once O O N/A

venture O O N/A
away O O N/A
from O O N/A

The O O N/A
ingredients O O N/A
aren't O O N/A
doing O O N/A
the O O N/A
heavy O O N/A
lifting O O N/A
anymore, O O N/A
and O O N/A
everything O O N/A
tastes O O N/A
sort O O N/A
of, O O N/A
well, O O N/A
ordinary. O O N/A
Certain O O N/A
things O O N/A
are O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
right O O N/A
side O O N/A
of O O N/A
ordinary, O O N/A
like O O N/A
the O O N/A
fried O O N/A
tofu O O N/A
in O O N/A
dashi; O O N/A
the O O N/A
warm O O N/A
rolled O O N/A
omelet, O O N/A
particularly O O N/A
when O O N/A
topped O O N/A
with O O N/A
grilled O O N/A
freshwater O O N/A
eel; O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
tender, O O N/A
ghost-white O O N/A
baby O O N/A
sardines O O N/A
with O O N/A
grated O O N/A
daikon. O O N/A
Others O O N/A
are O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
wrong O O N/A
side, O O N/A
like O O N/A
the O O N/A
grilled O O N/A
scallops O O N/A
in O O N/A

and O O N/A
the O O N/A
monkfish O O N/A

If O O N/A
I O O N/A
worked O O N/A

as O O N/A
possible O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
fish O O N/A
specials. O O N/A
I O O N/A
doubt O O N/A
I'd O O N/A
get O O N/A
bored, O O N/A
but O O N/A
I O O N/A
would O O N/A
keep O O N/A
my O O N/A
eye O O N/A
out O O N/A
for O O N/A
something O O N/A
that O O N/A
Wokuni O O N/A
could O O N/A
put O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu, O O N/A
but O O N/A
so O O N/A
far O O N/A
hasn't. O O N/A

as O O N/A

to O O N/A
eating O O N/A
at O O N/A
Don B-EST B-EST N/A
Angie I-EST I-EST N/A
close O O N/A
to O O N/A
5:30 O O N/A
p.m., O O N/A
when O O N/A
I O O N/A
managed O O N/A
to O O N/A
get O O N/A
an O O N/A
unreserved O O N/A
table, O O N/A
I O O N/A
also O O N/A
braced O O N/A
for O O N/A
a O O N/A
dose O O N/A
of O O N/A
abracadabra. O O N/A
It O O N/A
arrived O O N/A
right O O N/A
on O O N/A
schedule O O N/A
with O O N/A
my O O N/A
first O O N/A
drink, O O N/A
which O O N/A
a O O N/A
server O O N/A
strained O O N/A
into O O N/A
a O O N/A
glass O O N/A
through O O N/A
a O O N/A
coffee O O N/A
filter O O N/A
cone O O N/A
lined O O N/A
with O O N/A
espresso B-FOOD B-EST N/A
ice. I-FOOD I-EST N/A
It O O N/A
was O O N/A
called O O N/A
Americano, B-DISH B-DISH N/A
Americano, I-DISH I-DISH N/A
and O O N/A
combined O O N/A
at O O N/A
least O O N/A
three O O N/A
meanings O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
word: O O N/A
a O O N/A
highball, B-DISH B-FOOD N/A
an O O N/A
Italian B-CUISINE B-CUISINE N/A
aperitif B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
wine I-FOOD I-FOOD N/A
and O O N/A
a O O N/A
diluted O O N/A
shot O O N/A
of O O N/A
espresso. B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
The O O N/A
Americano B-DISH B-FOOD N/A
highball, I-DISH I-FOOD N/A
so O O N/A
simple O O N/A
that O O N/A
just O O N/A
about O O N/A
any O O N/A
bartender O O N/A
can O O N/A
make O O N/A
it, O O N/A
doesn't O O N/A
need O O N/A
much O O N/A
improvement. O O N/A
But O O N/A
I O O N/A
have O O N/A
to O O N/A
admit O O N/A
that O O N/A
the O O N/A
coffee B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
did O O N/A
give O O N/A
it O O N/A
some O O N/A
ballast. O O N/A
I'm O O N/A
also O O N/A
happy O O N/A
to O O N/A
report O O N/A
that O O N/A
this O O N/A
was O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
last O O N/A
bits O O N/A
of O O N/A
stagecraft O O N/A
I O O N/A
saw O O N/A
at O O N/A
Don B-EST B-EST N/A
Angie. I-EST I-EST N/A
Ms. O O N/A
Rito O O N/A
and O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Tacinelli O O N/A
have O O N/A
a O O N/A
few O O N/A
tricks O O N/A
up O O N/A
their O O N/A
sleeves, O O N/A
but O O N/A
they O O N/A
save O O N/A
them O O N/A
for O O N/A
the O O N/A
kitchen. O O N/A
The O O N/A
result O O N/A
is O O N/A
food O O N/A
that O O N/A
is O O N/A
creative O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
more O O N/A
interesting O O N/A
and O O N/A
more O O N/A
consistently O O N/A
successful O O N/A
way O O N/A
than O O N/A
it O O N/A
was O O N/A
at O O N/A
Quality B-EST B-EST N/A
Italian. I-EST I-EST N/A
And O O N/A
it O O N/A
arrives O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A
table O O N/A
without O O N/A
the O O N/A
aid O O N/A
of O O N/A
trolleys. O O N/A
When O O N/A
you O O N/A
get O O N/A
a O O N/A
Caesar B-DISH B-DISH N/A
salad, I-DISH I-DISH N/A
the O O N/A
server O O N/A
doesn't O O N/A
whip O O N/A
together O O N/A
the O O N/A
dressing B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
spot. O O N/A
It's O O N/A
been O O N/A
done O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
kitchen, O O N/A
where O O N/A
the O O N/A
chefs O O N/A
replaced O O N/A
romaine B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
with O O N/A
tender O O N/A
chrysanthemum B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
leaves I-FOOD I-FOOD N/A
that O O N/A
taste O O N/A
like O O N/A
some O O N/A
newly O O N/A
discovered O O N/A
herb. O B-FOOD N/A
(The O O N/A
feathery O O N/A
leaves O O N/A
firmly O O N/A
grip O O N/A
the O O N/A
dressing B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
fluffy O O N/A
rasped O B-FOOD N/A

too.) O O N/A
I O O N/A
can't O O N/A
remember O O N/A
seeing O O N/A
chrysanthemum B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
in O O N/A
an O O N/A
Italian B-CUISINE B-CUISINE N/A
restaurant O O N/A
before, O O N/A
and O O N/A
it O O N/A
shows O O N/A
the O O N/A
chefs' O O N/A
skill O O N/A
for O O N/A
cross-pollinating O O N/A
with O O N/A
other O O N/A
cuisines, O O N/A
especially O O N/A
Asian B-CUISINE B-CUISINE N/A
ones. O O N/A
While O O N/A
the O O N/A
Torrisi-Carbone B-EST O N/A
axis O O N/A
is O O N/A
generally O O N/A
faithful O O N/A
to O O N/A
Italian-American B-CUISINE B-CUISINE N/A
standards, O O N/A
using O O N/A
more O O N/A
expensive O O N/A
ingredients O O N/A
and O O N/A
more O O N/A
modern O O N/A
techniques O O N/A
but O O N/A
leaving O O N/A
the O O N/A
basic O O N/A
ideas O O N/A
intact, O O N/A
the O O N/A
Rito-Tacinelli O O N/A
approach O O N/A
is O O N/A
more O O N/A
radical. O O N/A
They O O N/A
trample O O N/A
on O O N/A
tradition O O N/A
when O O N/A
they O O N/A
feel O O N/A
like O O N/A
it. O O N/A
Prosciutto B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A

tossed O O N/A

dressing. I-FOOD I-FOOD N/A
This O O N/A
very O O N/A
good O O N/A
salad, B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
which O O N/A
obviously O O N/A
glances O O N/A
toward O O N/A
Southeast B-LOC B-LOC N/A
Asia, I-LOC I-LOC N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
smart O O N/A
way O O N/A
to O O N/A
handle O O N/A
an O O N/A
antipasto O O N/A
standby O O N/A
that O O N/A
is O O N/A
usually O O N/A
pointless O O N/A
except O O N/A
when O O N/A
melons B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
are O O N/A
in O O N/A
season. O O N/A
Their O O N/A
garlic B-DISH B-DISH N/A
bread I-DISH I-DISH N/A
turns O O N/A
out O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
a O O N/A
very O O N/A
thin O O N/A
disc O O N/A
with O O N/A
garlic B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
chives I-FOOD I-FOOD N/A
and O O N/A
melted O O N/A
cheese O O N/A
inside O O N/A
and O O N/A
sesame O O N/A
seeds O O N/A
on O O N/A
top. O O N/A
Lightweight, O O N/A
salty O O N/A
and O O N/A
irresistible, O O N/A
it's O O N/A
modeled O O N/A
on O O N/A
Ligurian O O N/A
focaccia O O N/A
di O O N/A
recco, O O N/A
but O O N/A
it O O N/A
may O O N/A
also O O N/A
bring O O N/A
to O O N/A
mind O O N/A
Turkish O O N/A
gozleme, O O N/A
Azeri O O N/A
kutab O O N/A
or O O N/A
even O O N/A
a O O N/A
Chinese O O N/A
scallion O O N/A
pancake. O O N/A
There's O O N/A
China O O N/A
again, O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
pepperoni O O N/A
fried O O N/A
rice O O N/A
served O O N/A
under O O N/A
barbecued O O N/A
squid. O O N/A
Ignore O O N/A
the O O N/A
squid O O N/A
unless O O N/A
you O O N/A
like O O N/A
it O O N/A
leathery, O O N/A
and O O N/A
just O O N/A
focus O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
rice, O O N/A
stirring O O N/A
it O O N/A
with O O N/A
labneh O O N/A
when O O N/A
the O O N/A
heat O O N/A
starts O O N/A
to O O N/A
rise. O O N/A
The O O N/A
dish O O N/A
everybody O O N/A
has O O N/A
seen O O N/A
on O O N/A
Instagram O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
pasta O O N/A
called O O N/A
caramelle. O O N/A
In O O N/A
Italian O O N/A
it O O N/A
means O O N/A
caramel, O O N/A
as O O N/A
in O O N/A
candy, O O N/A
but O O N/A
the O O N/A
shape O O N/A
will O O N/A
remind O O N/A
most O O N/A
Americans O O N/A
of O O N/A
an O O N/A
elongated O O N/A
Tootsie O O N/A
Roll, O O N/A
with O O N/A
twists O O N/A
at O O N/A
either O O N/A
end O O N/A
of O O N/A
a O O N/A
drum O O N/A
that's O O N/A
filled O O N/A
with O O N/A
buffalo O O N/A
ricotta. O O N/A
Cameras O O N/A
come O O N/A
out O O N/A
because O O N/A
the O O N/A
dough O O N/A
is O O N/A
striped, O O N/A
with O O N/A
black O O N/A
sesame-flour O O N/A
bands O O N/A
alternating O O N/A
with O O N/A
ordinary O O N/A
egg O O N/A
pasta. O O N/A
The O O N/A
sesame O O N/A
barely O O N/A
registers; O O N/A
the O O N/A
fun O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
dish O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
sauce, O O N/A
a O O N/A
peppered, O O N/A
pickled O O N/A
cantaloupe O O N/A
that O O N/A
tastes O O N/A
like O O N/A
it's O O N/A
still O O N/A
percolating. O O N/A
But O O N/A
the O O N/A
dish O O N/A
that O O N/A
could O O N/A
be O O N/A
Don O O N/A
Angie's O O N/A
lasting O O N/A
contribution O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
pasta O O N/A
sciences O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
garganelli O O N/A
with O O N/A
meatball O O N/A
ragù. O O N/A
The O O N/A
central O O N/A
problem O O N/A
of O O N/A
red-sauce O O N/A
restaurants O O N/A
is O O N/A
this: O O N/A
Pasta O O N/A
and O O N/A
meatballs O O N/A
are O O N/A
always O O N/A
served O O N/A
together, O O N/A
but O O N/A
they O O N/A
remain O O N/A
stubbornly O O N/A
separate. O O N/A
Ms. O O N/A
Rito O O N/A
and O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Tacinelli O O N/A
have O O N/A
found O O N/A
a O O N/A
way O O N/A
out O O N/A
of O O N/A
this O O N/A
conundrum O O N/A
by O O N/A
crushing O O N/A

into O O N/A
a O O N/A
tomato-guanciale O O N/A
ragù. O O N/A
It's O O N/A
not O O N/A
quite O O N/A
as O O N/A
simple O O N/A
as O O N/A
I've O O N/A
made O O N/A
it O O N/A
sound, O O N/A
but O O N/A
you O O N/A
don't O O N/A
know O O N/A
that O O N/A
when O O N/A
you're O O N/A
eating O O N/A
it; O O N/A
you O O N/A
just O O N/A
think O O N/A
you're O O N/A
magically O O N/A
eating O O N/A
meatballs O O N/A
and O O N/A
pasta O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A
same O O N/A
time. O O N/A
They've O O N/A
also O O N/A
tried O O N/A
to O O N/A
salvage O O N/A
chicken O O N/A
scarpariello, O O N/A
a O O N/A
dish O O N/A
that O O N/A
is O O N/A
almost O O N/A
always O O N/A
overcooked. O O N/A
Their O O N/A
solution O O N/A
is O O N/A
to O O N/A
make O O N/A
a O O N/A
kind O O N/A
of O O N/A
pie O O N/A
with O O N/A
chicken O O N/A
meat O O N/A
pressed O O N/A
down O O N/A
into O O N/A
a O O N/A
kind O O N/A
of O O N/A
crust O O N/A
made O O N/A
of O O N/A
sausage. O O N/A
The O O N/A
flavors O O N/A
are O O N/A
accurate, O O N/A
and O O N/A
for O O N/A
once O O N/A
it's O O N/A
not O O N/A
dry, O O N/A
but O O N/A
it's O O N/A
not O O N/A
as O O N/A
engaging O O N/A
as O O N/A
other O O N/A
main O O N/A
courses, O O N/A
like O O N/A
the O O N/A
veal O O N/A
cutlet O O N/A
with O O N/A
speck O O N/A
and O O N/A
pickled O O N/A
mustard O O N/A
seeds, O O N/A
or O O N/A
the O O N/A
grilled O O N/A
fillet O O N/A
of O O N/A
orata O O N/A
next O O N/A
to O O N/A
herbed O O N/A
fregola, O O N/A
with O O N/A
buttermilk O O N/A
as O O N/A
the O O N/A
sauce. O O N/A
Reworking O O N/A
tiramisù O O N/A
almost O O N/A
never O O N/A
improves O O N/A
it, O O N/A
but O O N/A
as O O N/A
a O O N/A
change O O N/A
of O O N/A
pace O O N/A
I O O N/A
did O O N/A
like O O N/A
how O O N/A
the O O N/A
one O O N/A
at O O N/A
Don O O N/A
Angie O O N/A
shifted O O N/A
the O O N/A
emphasis O O N/A
from O O N/A
espresso O O N/A
to O O N/A
bittersweet O O N/A
cocoa. O O N/A
There's O O N/A
a O O N/A
delicious, O O N/A
if O O N/A
more O O N/A
conventional, O O N/A
plate O O N/A
of O O N/A
tender, O O N/A
light O O N/A
zeppole O O N/A
with O O N/A
tangy O O N/A
whipped O O N/A
robiola O O N/A
under O O N/A
an O O N/A
Andy O O N/A
Warhol O O N/A
mop O O N/A
of O O N/A
spun O O N/A
sugar O O N/A
that O O N/A
people O O N/A
go O O N/A
wild O O N/A
for. O O N/A
I O O N/A
was O O N/A
charmed O O N/A
by O O N/A
a O O N/A
smaller, O O N/A
quieter O O N/A
dessert: O O N/A
a O O N/A
mochi O O N/A
cake O O N/A
stuffed O O N/A
with O O N/A

latte O O N/A
ice O O N/A
cream, O O N/A
with O O N/A

salt O O N/A
and O O N/A
a O O N/A
fragrant O O N/A
scribble O O N/A
of O O N/A
olive O O N/A
oil. O O N/A
It's O O N/A
like O O N/A
eating O O N/A
a O O N/A
mozzarella O O N/A

that O O N/A

A O O N/A

were O O N/A

sometimes O O N/A
even O O N/A
celebrated? O O N/A

my O O N/A

he O O N/A
wrote O O N/A
on O O N/A
Medium O O N/A
in O O N/A
December. O O N/A
Having O O N/A
regularly O O N/A

outrage O O N/A
on O O N/A
Harvey O O N/A

of O O N/A

by O O N/A
Asia O O N/A

Mr. O O N/A

he O O N/A
was O O N/A
also O O N/A
confronted O O N/A
with O O N/A
serious O O N/A
and O O N/A
deeply O O N/A
unsettling O O N/A
allegations O O N/A
about O O N/A
Mario O O N/A
Batali O O N/A
, O O N/A

"In O O N/A
these O O N/A
current O O N/A
circumstances, O O N/A
one O O N/A
must O O N/A
pick O O N/A
a O O N/A
side," O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Bourdain O O N/A
wrote. O O N/A
"I O O N/A
stand O O N/A
unhesitatingly O O N/A
and O O N/A
unwaveringly O O N/A
with O O N/A
the O O N/A
women." O O N/A
But O O N/A
if O O N/A
the O O N/A
feminist O O N/A
perspective O O N/A
was O O N/A
relatively O O N/A
new O O N/A
to O O N/A
his O O N/A
repertory, O O N/A
speaking O O N/A
out O O N/A
about O O N/A
sexual O O N/A
abuse O O N/A
was O O N/A
not. O O N/A
Long O O N/A
ago, O O N/A
in O O N/A
"Kitchen O O N/A

he O O N/A
had O O N/A
written O O N/A
about O O N/A
a O O N/A
union O O N/A
shop O O N/A
steward O O N/A
who O O N/A
had O O N/A
inserted O O N/A

Mr. O O N/A

in O O N/A

of O O N/A
the O O N/A
other O O N/A

workers. O O N/A
Experiences O O N/A
like O O N/A
this O O N/A
may O O N/A
be O O N/A
common O O N/A
for O O N/A
male O O N/A
cooks, O O N/A
but O O N/A
they O O N/A
are O O N/A
not O O N/A
commonly O O N/A
discussed O O N/A
in O O N/A
public. O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Bourdain O O N/A
was O O N/A
too O O N/A
unsettled, O O N/A
his O O N/A
moral O O N/A
compass O O N/A
too O O N/A
twitchy, O O N/A
to O O N/A
have O O N/A
written O O N/A
an O O N/A
account O O N/A
of O O N/A
kitchen O O N/A
life O O N/A
that O O N/A
was O O N/A
purely O O N/A
celebratory O O N/A
or O O N/A
purely O O N/A
accusatory. O O N/A
"Life O O N/A
is O O N/A
complicated. O O N/A
It's O O N/A
filled O O N/A
with O O N/A
nuance. O O N/A
It's O O N/A
unsatisfying," O O N/A
he O O N/A
once O O N/A
said. O O N/A
"If O O N/A

I O O N/A
admit O O N/A
that O O N/A
I O O N/A
couldn't O O N/A
see O O N/A
the O O N/A
point O O N/A
of O O N/A
having O O N/A
a O O N/A
chef O O N/A
do O O N/A
the O O N/A
cooking O O N/A
when O O N/A
I O O N/A
was O O N/A
perfectly O O N/A
able O O N/A
to O O N/A
do O O N/A
my O O N/A
own O O N/A

Ms. O O N/A
Okano O O N/A
quickly O O N/A
poured O O N/A
two O O N/A

three O O N/A
mouthfuls O O N/A

warm O O N/A
unfiltered O O N/A
sake B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
into O O N/A
a O O N/A
little O O N/A

This O O N/A
arrived O O N/A
with O O N/A
a O O N/A

-- O O N/A
that O O N/A
artfully O O N/A
underscored O O N/A
the O O N/A
sake's B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
flavor. O O N/A
Then O O N/A
she O O N/A
turned O O N/A
and O O N/A
quietly O O N/A
addressed O O N/A
a O O N/A
sauté O O N/A
pan O O N/A
over O O N/A
the O O N/A

When O O N/A
she O O N/A
turned O O N/A
around O O N/A
again O O N/A
she O O N/A
had O O N/A
cooked O O N/A
an O O N/A
omelet B-DISH B-FOOD N/A

flicked O O N/A
it O O N/A
into O O N/A
a O O N/A
roll O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
Japanese B-CUISINE B-CUISINE N/A

Served O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
bowl O O N/A
of O O N/A
hot, O O N/A
clear O O N/A
dashi, B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
the O O N/A
egg B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
was O O N/A
as O O N/A
tender O O N/A
and O O N/A
delicate O O N/A
as O O N/A
its O O N/A
garnish, O O N/A
a O O N/A
tiny O O N/A
piece O O N/A
of O O N/A
mitsuba O O N/A
stem O O N/A
tied O O N/A
into O O N/A
a O O N/A
knot. O O N/A
Next O O N/A
she O O N/A
poached O O N/A
two O O N/A
pieces O O N/A
of O O N/A
abalone O O N/A
for O O N/A
a O O N/A
few O O N/A
seconds O O N/A
each O O N/A
in O O N/A
abalone O O N/A
broth. O O N/A
One O O N/A
she O O N/A
dabbed O O N/A
with O O N/A
a O O N/A
small, O O N/A
intense O O N/A
blip O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A

Over O O N/A
the O O N/A
other O O N/A
she O O N/A
spooned O O N/A
a O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
made O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A
abalone's O O N/A
liver. O O N/A
I O O N/A
ate O O N/A
them O O N/A
both, O O N/A
and O O N/A
was O O N/A
flooded O O N/A
first O O N/A
with O O N/A
pleasure O O N/A
then O O N/A
with O O N/A
embarrassment O O N/A
that O O N/A
I'd O O N/A
thought O O N/A
simmered O O N/A
food O O N/A
wasn't O O N/A
worth O O N/A
a O O N/A
chef's O O N/A
time. O O N/A
By O O N/A
the O O N/A
time O O N/A
I'd O O N/A
eaten O O N/A
a O O N/A
small O O N/A
tongue O O N/A
of O O N/A
sea O O N/A
urchin O O N/A
combined O O N/A
with O O N/A
silky O O N/A
rags O O N/A
of O O N/A
yuba O O N/A
still O O N/A
dripping O O N/A
with O O N/A

I O O N/A
was O O N/A
on O O N/A
board O O N/A
for O O N/A
anything O O N/A
Ms. O O N/A
Okano O O N/A
wanted O O N/A
to O O N/A
cook. O O N/A
For O O N/A
some O O N/A
time O O N/A
the O O N/A
bubbles O O N/A
in O O N/A
an O O N/A

of O O N/A
dashi O O N/A
set O O N/A
over O O N/A
a O O N/A

had O O N/A
been O O N/A
getting O O N/A
bigger O O N/A

faster. O O N/A
Thin O O N/A
strips O O N/A
of O O N/A
Wagyu O O N/A
beef, O O N/A
streaked O O N/A
with O O N/A
so O O N/A
much O O N/A
fat O O N/A
they O O N/A
looked O O N/A
like O O N/A
stained O O N/A
glass, O O N/A
were O O N/A
stretched O O N/A
out O O N/A
on O O N/A
black O O N/A
slate O O N/A
with O O N/A
pinkish O O N/A
bands O O N/A
of O O N/A
pork O O N/A
belly. O O N/A
Raw O O N/A
vegetables O O N/A

half O O N/A

and O O N/A
a O O N/A
cherry O O N/A
tomato O O N/A
on O O N/A
a O O N/A
wooden O O N/A
spear O O N/A
-- O O N/A
waited O O N/A
on O O N/A
a O O N/A
nearby O O N/A
plate. O O N/A
Before O O N/A
I O O N/A
knew O O N/A
it O O N/A
she O O N/A
had O O N/A
cooked O O N/A
the O O N/A
first O O N/A
piece O O N/A
of O O N/A
beef O O N/A
-- O O N/A
was O O N/A
it O O N/A
the O O N/A
A5 O O N/A
from O O N/A
Miyazaki O O N/A
or O O N/A
the O O N/A
A4 O O N/A
from O O N/A
Kagoshima? O O N/A
The O O N/A
flesh O O N/A
had O O N/A
twisted O O N/A
itself O O N/A
around, O O N/A
and O O N/A
now O O N/A
dusk-gray O O N/A
outer O O N/A
curls O O N/A
hid O O N/A
inner O O N/A
curves O O N/A
of O O N/A
faded O O N/A
pink. O O N/A
The O O N/A
flavors O O N/A
moved O O N/A
in O O N/A
rapid O O N/A
waves: O O N/A
first O O N/A
a O O N/A
few O O N/A
clinging, O O N/A
savory O O N/A
drops O O N/A
of O O N/A
dashi, O O N/A
then O O N/A
some O O N/A
already-melted O O N/A
beef O O N/A
fat, O O N/A
followed O O N/A
by O O N/A
the O O N/A
flavor O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
lean O O N/A
meat O O N/A
itself, O O N/A
sweet O O N/A
and O O N/A
refined. O O N/A
Finally O O N/A
came O O N/A
a O O N/A
second O O N/A
helping O O N/A
of O O N/A
fat, O O N/A
freshly O O N/A
melted O O N/A
now. O O N/A
When O O N/A
Ms. O O N/A
Okano O O N/A
fished O O N/A
out O O N/A
a O O N/A
piece O O N/A
of O O N/A
beef, O O N/A
she O O N/A
would O O N/A
suggest O O N/A
seasoning O O N/A
it O O N/A
with O O N/A
one O O N/A
or O O N/A
more O O N/A
of O O N/A
an O O N/A
almost O O N/A
comically O O N/A
large O O N/A
assortment O O N/A
of O O N/A
condiments O O N/A
and O O N/A
purées O O N/A
that O O N/A
she O O N/A
makes O O N/A
herself. O O N/A
She O O N/A
seemed O O N/A
to O O N/A
favor O O N/A
her O O N/A
ponzu, O O N/A
and O O N/A
so O O N/A
do O O N/A
I; O O N/A
it's O O N/A
more O O N/A
radiant O O N/A
with O O N/A
yuzu O O N/A
than O O N/A
any O O N/A
I've O O N/A
had O O N/A
before. O O N/A
I O O N/A
also O O N/A
liked O O N/A
the O O N/A

with O O N/A
a O O N/A
few O O N/A
drops O O N/A
of O O N/A
what O O N/A
Ms. O O N/A
Okano O O N/A
calls O O N/A
"gravy O O N/A
sauce," O O N/A
a O O N/A
dark O O N/A
liquid O O N/A
that O O N/A
makes O O N/A
meat O O N/A
taste O O N/A
meatier. O O N/A
Many O O N/A
dismal O O N/A
meals O O N/A
would O O N/A
be O O N/A
saved O O N/A
if O O N/A
I O O N/A
carried O O N/A
an O O N/A
eyedropper O O N/A
of O O N/A
gravy O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
around O O N/A
with O O N/A
me. O O N/A
Swabbing O O N/A
the O O N/A
pork O O N/A
belly O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
sticky, O O N/A
thick O O N/A
sesame O O N/A
paste O O N/A
with O O N/A
toasted O O N/A
sesame O O N/A
seeds O O N/A
produces O O N/A
an O O N/A
effect O O N/A
similar O O N/A
to, O O N/A
but O O N/A
more O O N/A
subtle O O N/A
than, O O N/A
the O O N/A
combination O O N/A
of O O N/A
peanut O O N/A
butter O O N/A
and O O N/A
bacon. O O N/A
It's O O N/A
even O O N/A
better O O N/A
with O O N/A
a O O N/A
smear O O N/A
of O O N/A
salted O O N/A
plum, O O N/A
or O O N/A
a O O N/A
few O O N/A
drops O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
yuzu-olive O O N/A
oil O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
that O O N/A
seems O O N/A
to O O N/A
have O O N/A
jetted O O N/A
in O O N/A
from O O N/A
Italy. O O N/A
The O O N/A
vegetables O O N/A
were O O N/A
spotless O O N/A
and O O N/A
fresh. O O N/A
A O O N/A
meal O O N/A
without O O N/A
them O O N/A
would O O N/A
be O O N/A
off O O N/A
kilter, O O N/A
perhaps O O N/A
to O O N/A
a O O N/A
degree O O N/A
that O O N/A
would O O N/A
cause O O N/A
grumbling O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A
digestive O O N/A
system, O O N/A
but O O N/A
on O O N/A
their O O N/A
own O O N/A
they O O N/A
are O O N/A
not O O N/A
a O O N/A
reason O O N/A
to O O N/A
go O O N/A
to O O N/A
Shabushabu O O N/A
Macoron. O O N/A
The O O N/A
chicken O O N/A
meatballs O O N/A
are, O O N/A
though. O O N/A
So O O N/A
are O O N/A
the O O N/A
green O O N/A
tea O O N/A
soba O O N/A
noodles O O N/A
that O O N/A
Ms. O O N/A
Okano O O N/A
somehow O O N/A
manages O O N/A
to O O N/A
cook O O N/A
in O O N/A
between O O N/A
everything O O N/A
else O O N/A
without O O N/A
seeming O O N/A
to O O N/A
leave O O N/A
the O O N/A
few O O N/A
square O O N/A
feet O O N/A
behind O O N/A
the O O N/A
counter. O O N/A
Soba O O N/A
is O O N/A
not O O N/A
standard O O N/A
with O O N/A
shabu O O N/A
shabu, O O N/A
but O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
something O O N/A
she O O N/A
has O O N/A
experience O O N/A
making O O N/A
from O O N/A
her O O N/A
time O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
kitchen O O N/A
at O O N/A
Cocoron O O N/A
, O O N/A
a O O N/A
soba-ya O O N/A
across O O N/A
Delancey O O N/A
Street. O O N/A
When O O N/A
she O O N/A
began O O N/A
talking O O N/A
about O O N/A
her O O N/A
dream O O N/A
of O O N/A
opening O O N/A
what O O N/A
she O O N/A
hoped O O N/A
would O O N/A
be O O N/A
the O O N/A
world's O O N/A
first O O N/A
omakase O O N/A
shabu O O N/A
shabu O O N/A
restaurant, O O N/A
Cocoron's O O N/A
owners O O N/A
listened. O O N/A
When O O N/A
she O O N/A
came O O N/A
back O O N/A
from O O N/A
a O O N/A
dunk-and-swish O O N/A
tour O O N/A
of O O N/A
Japan, O O N/A
they O O N/A
signed O O N/A
on O O N/A
as O O N/A
her O O N/A
partners. O O N/A
At O O N/A
times, O O N/A
it O O N/A
seems O O N/A
as O O N/A
if O O N/A
Ms. O O N/A
Okano O O N/A
can't O O N/A
believe O O N/A
it O O N/A
all O O N/A
worked O O N/A
out. O O N/A
After O O N/A
she'd O O N/A
cooked O O N/A
me O O N/A
three O O N/A
nearly O O N/A
identical O O N/A
meals, O O N/A
I O O N/A
wondered O O N/A
if O O N/A
she'd O O N/A
still O O N/A
be O O N/A
as O O N/A
giddy O O N/A
a O O N/A
year O O N/A
from O O N/A
now. O O N/A
Will O O N/A
she O O N/A
be O O N/A
able O O N/A
to O O N/A
change O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu O O N/A
with O O N/A
the O O N/A
seasons O O N/A
to O O N/A
keep O O N/A
things O O N/A
interesting? O O N/A
Can O O N/A
she O O N/A
stash O O N/A
surprise O O N/A
ingredients O O N/A
below O O N/A
the O O N/A
counter O O N/A
for O O N/A
repeat O O N/A
customers, O O N/A
the O O N/A
way O O N/A
sushi O O N/A
chefs O O N/A
do? O O N/A
None O O N/A
of O O N/A
these O O N/A
questions O O N/A
occurred O O N/A
to O O N/A
me O O N/A
the O O N/A
first O O N/A
two O O N/A
times O O N/A
I O O N/A
ate O O N/A
at O O N/A
her O O N/A
restaurant. O O N/A
I O O N/A
just O O N/A
sat O O N/A
there O O N/A
in O O N/A
something O O N/A
like O O N/A
a O O N/A
state O O N/A
of O O N/A
wonder O O N/A
while O O N/A
she O O N/A
cooked O O N/A
for O O N/A
me. O O N/A
This O O N/A
is, O O N/A
bizarrely, O O N/A
a O O N/A
rare O O N/A
experience O O N/A
at O O N/A
tasting O O N/A
counters, O O N/A
where O O N/A
chefs O O N/A
are O O N/A
often O O N/A
intent O O N/A
on O O N/A
intricacies O O N/A
of O O N/A
plating. O O N/A
The O O N/A
physical O O N/A
setting O O N/A
of O O N/A
Shabushabu O O N/A

strongly O O N/A
suggests O O N/A
a O O N/A
shoestring O O N/A
budget O O N/A
-- O O N/A
the O O N/A
paper O O N/A
towel O O N/A
roll O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A

hangs O O N/A
from O O N/A
what O O N/A
may O O N/A
be O O N/A
an O O N/A
actual O O N/A
shoestring O O N/A
-- O O N/A
but O O N/A
sitting O O N/A
there O O N/A
while O O N/A
Ms. O O N/A
Okano O O N/A
stands O O N/A
a O O N/A
few O O N/A

away O O N/A

I O O N/A
am O O N/A
telling O O N/A

all O O N/A
this O O N/A

seems O O N/A
eager O O N/A
to O O N/A
suggest O O N/A
that O O N/A
it O O N/A
has O O N/A
local O O N/A
roots O O N/A
-- O O N/A
so O O N/A
eager O O N/A
that O O N/A
it O O N/A
has O O N/A
essentially O O N/A
ginned O O N/A
up O O N/A
a O O N/A
history O O N/A
for O O N/A
itself O O N/A
that O O N/A
brings O O N/A
together O O N/A
sloppy O O N/A
research O O N/A
with O O N/A
a O O N/A
superficial O O N/A
tribute O O N/A
to O O N/A
black O O N/A
culture. O O N/A
It's O O N/A
not O O N/A
a O O N/A
combination O O N/A
that O O N/A
will O O N/A
appeal O O N/A
to O O N/A
everybody. O O N/A
Like O O N/A
the O O N/A

the O O N/A

it O O N/A
is O O N/A
in O O N/A
those O O N/A
two O O N/A

is O O N/A
essentially O O N/A
Italian, B-CUISINE O N/A
but O O N/A
less O O N/A
rustic O O N/A
and O O N/A
more O O N/A

This O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
first O O N/A
time O O N/A
the O O N/A

more O O N/A
than O O N/A
$30, O O N/A

as O O N/A
much O O N/A
as O O N/A
$46, O O N/A
for O O N/A

I O O N/A
don't O O N/A
know O O N/A
for O O N/A
sure O O N/A
whether O O N/A
Ryan O O N/A
Hardy, O O N/A
the O O N/A
chef O O N/A
and O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
three O O N/A
partners, O O N/A
has O O N/A
upgraded O O N/A
to O O N/A
better O O N/A
purveyors, O O N/A
but O O N/A
I O O N/A
do O O N/A
know O O N/A
I O O N/A
was O O N/A
taken O O N/A
aback, O O N/A
often, O O N/A
by O O N/A
the O O N/A
quality O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
raw O O N/A
ingredients O O N/A
at O O N/A
Legacy B-EST O N/A
Records. I-EST O N/A
There O O N/A
was O O N/A
the O O N/A
raw B-DISH O N/A
sea I-DISH O N/A
scallop, I-DISH O N/A
so O O N/A
intensely O O N/A
fresh O O N/A
that O O N/A
its O O N/A
slices O O N/A
clung O O N/A
together O O N/A
stickily; O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Hardy O O N/A
had O O N/A
dressed O O N/A
it O O N/A
with O O N/A
dots O O N/A
of O O N/A
yogurt, B-FOOD O N/A
tiny O O N/A
oval O O N/A
basil B-FOOD O N/A
leaves, I-FOOD O N/A
toasted O O N/A
almonds O O N/A
and O O N/A
tart O O N/A
little O O N/A
pink O O N/A
cells O O N/A
of O O N/A
finger O O N/A
lime. O O N/A
There O O N/A
was O O N/A
chilled O O N/A
Dungeness O O N/A
crab, O O N/A
a O O N/A
few O O N/A
pristine O O N/A
white O O N/A
chunks O O N/A
under O O N/A
sea O O N/A
urchin O O N/A
foam, O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
spooned O O N/A
from O O N/A
a O O N/A

glass. O O N/A
And O O N/A
tiles O O N/A
of O O N/A
yellowfin O O N/A
tuna O O N/A
belly, O O N/A
not O O N/A
as O O N/A
fatty O O N/A
as O O N/A
bluefin O O N/A
but O O N/A
very O O N/A
rich O O N/A
all O O N/A
the O O N/A
same, O O N/A
under O O N/A
bits O O N/A
of O O N/A
salted O O N/A
lemon O O N/A

and O O N/A
a O O N/A
splash O O N/A
of O O N/A
colatura, O O N/A
the O O N/A
Italian O O N/A
fish O O N/A
sauce. O O N/A
Again O O N/A
with O O N/A
the O O N/A
main O O N/A
courses, O O N/A
I O O N/A
stopped O O N/A
and O O N/A
wondered: O O N/A
Where O O N/A
did O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Hardy O O N/A
find O O N/A
lamb O O N/A
(with O O N/A
snap O O N/A
peas O O N/A
and O O N/A
smoked O O N/A
cream) O O N/A
that O O N/A
tasted O O N/A
as O O N/A
if O O N/A
it O O N/A
had O O N/A
never O O N/A
eaten O O N/A
anything O O N/A
but O O N/A
fresh O O N/A
herbs? O O N/A
How O O N/A
did O O N/A
he O O N/A
find O O N/A
a O O N/A
rib-eye O O N/A
that's O O N/A
so O O N/A
tender O O N/A
and O O N/A
deeply O O N/A
flavorful O O N/A
without O O N/A
being O O N/A
flabby? O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Hardy O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
quick O O N/A
to O O N/A
make O O N/A
the O O N/A
most O O N/A
of O O N/A
what O O N/A
the O O N/A
market O O N/A
says O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
first O O N/A
month O O N/A
of O O N/A
spring O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A

Mr. O O N/A

built O O N/A
a O O N/A
fine O O N/A
appetizer O O N/A
around O O N/A

with O O N/A

melting O O N/A

spiked O O N/A
with O O N/A
anchovy. O O N/A
Charred O O N/A

made O O N/A
a O O N/A
tangy O O N/A

together O O N/A
with O O N/A
ramps O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
peppery O O N/A
buttermilk O O N/A
dressing. O O N/A
But O O N/A
sweet O O N/A
English O O N/A
peas O O N/A
were O O N/A
swallowed O O N/A
up O O N/A
by O O N/A
a O O N/A
too-sharp O O N/A
risotto; O O N/A
seasoned O O N/A
with O O N/A
prosciutto, O O N/A
the O O N/A

took O O N/A
on O O N/A
more O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
ham's O O N/A
saltiness O O N/A
than O O N/A
its O O N/A
sweetness. O O N/A
Legacy O O N/A

doesn't O O N/A
say O O N/A
anything O O N/A
particularly O O N/A
original, O O N/A
but O O N/A
it O O N/A
has O O N/A
a O O N/A
finesse O O N/A
that's O O N/A
new O O N/A
for O O N/A
this O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
group. O O N/A
There's O O N/A
an O O N/A
exceptional O O N/A
plate O O N/A
of O O N/A
grilled O O N/A
pigeon, O O N/A
neatly O O N/A
carved O O N/A
and O O N/A
served O O N/A
with O O N/A
swooshes O O N/A
of O O N/A
nettle O O N/A
purée. O O N/A
It O O N/A
is O O N/A
at O O N/A
least O O N/A
as O O N/A
impressive O O N/A
as O O N/A
the O O N/A
dish O O N/A
that's O O N/A
becoming O O N/A
a O O N/A
breakout O O N/A
star O O N/A
for O O N/A
the O O N/A
restaurant: O O N/A
a O O N/A
duck O O N/A
breast, O O N/A
its O O N/A
skin O O N/A
rubbed O O N/A
with O O N/A
pepper, O O N/A
chiles, O O N/A
honey O O N/A
and O O N/A
fennel O O N/A
and O O N/A
then O O N/A
roasted O O N/A
until O O N/A
it O O N/A
has O O N/A
a O O N/A
deep, O O N/A
crusty O O N/A
bark O O N/A
that O O N/A
a O O N/A
Texas O O N/A
pitmaster O O N/A
would O O N/A
be O O N/A
proud O O N/A
of. O O N/A
Ordering O O N/A
wine O O N/A
is O O N/A
an O O N/A
event O O N/A
in O O N/A

Robert O O N/A
Bohr O O N/A

Grant O O N/A

who O O N/A
are O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Hardy's O O N/A
partners O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
resident O O N/A
wine O O N/A
soothsayers, O O N/A
have O O N/A
seen O O N/A
to O O N/A
it O O N/A
that O O N/A
cultists O O N/A
can O O N/A
rub O O N/A
elbows O O N/A
with O O N/A
the O O N/A
Agraparts, O O N/A
Raveneaus O O N/A
and O O N/A
Gajas, O O N/A
while O O N/A
the O O N/A
rest O O N/A
of O O N/A
us O O N/A
will O O N/A
still O O N/A
find O O N/A
a O O N/A
few O O N/A
bottles O O N/A
under O O N/A
$100 O O N/A
from O O N/A
some O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
most O O N/A
expensive O O N/A
arable O O N/A
land O O N/A
on O O N/A
earth. O O N/A
Oddly O O N/A
enough, O O N/A
the O O N/A
wine O O N/A
list O O N/A
makes O O N/A
less O O N/A
of O O N/A
an O O N/A
impression O O N/A
than O O N/A
the O O N/A
ones O O N/A
at O O N/A
Charlie O O N/A
Bird O O N/A
and O O N/A
Pasquale O O N/A
Jones, O O N/A
simply O O N/A
because O O N/A
you'd O O N/A
expect O O N/A
an O O N/A
ambitious O O N/A
cellar O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
this O O N/A
expensive. O O N/A
Then O O N/A
again O O N/A
you O O N/A
might O O N/A
also O O N/A
expect O O N/A
a O O N/A
smart, O O N/A
artful O O N/A
dessert O O N/A
menu; O O N/A
if O O N/A
so, O O N/A
you're O O N/A
out O O N/A
of O O N/A
luck. O O N/A
There O O N/A
is O O N/A
ice O O N/A
cream O O N/A
with O O N/A
strawberries, O O N/A
a O O N/A
dark O O N/A
chocolate O O N/A
meringue O O N/A

a O O N/A
selection O O N/A
of O O N/A
gelati, O O N/A
served O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A

all O O N/A
perfectly O O N/A
pleasant, O O N/A
but O O N/A
there's O O N/A
more O O N/A
wit O O N/A
and O O N/A
creativity O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
excellent O O N/A
cocktail O O N/A
roster O O N/A
administered O O N/A
by O O N/A
Jeff O O N/A
Bell. O O N/A
I'm O O N/A
sure O O N/A
there O O N/A
are O O N/A
people O O N/A
who O O N/A
are O O N/A
reluctant O O N/A
to O O N/A
go O O N/A
to O O N/A
Legacy O O N/A

because O O N/A
of O O N/A
how O O N/A
relentlessly O O N/A
noisy O O N/A
this O O N/A
team's O O N/A
downtown O O N/A

are. O O N/A
But O O N/A
they O O N/A
seem O O N/A
to O O N/A
have O O N/A
sent O O N/A
the O O N/A

I N/A O O
don't N/A O O

approvingly N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
review N/A O O
before, N/A O O
but N/A O O
then N/A O O
I N/A O O
don't N/A O O
think N/A O O
a N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
has N/A O O
served N/A O O
me N/A O O
cold N/A O B-DISH
fried N/A O I-DISH
chicken N/A O I-DISH
as N/A O O
good N/A O O
as N/A O O
this N/A O O
before. N/A O O
By N/A O O
flipping N/A O O
through N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
pages N/A O O
you N/A O O
can N/A O O
pinpoint N/A O O
the N/A O O
dates N/A O O
when N/A O O
dishes N/A O O
were N/A O O
first N/A O O
served, N/A O O
and N/A O O
see N/A O O
others N/A O O
that N/A O O
came N/A O O
and N/A O O
went. N/A O O
The N/A O O
idea N/A O O
is N/A O O
for N/A O O
Ko's N/A O B-EST
executive N/A O O
chef, N/A O O
Sean N/A O O
Gray, N/A O O
to N/A O O
use N/A O O
the N/A O O

a N/A O O
"field N/A O O

are N/A O O

refined N/A O O
before N/A O O
they N/A O O
graduate N/A O O
to N/A O O
Ko, N/A O B-EST
which N/A O O
I N/A O O
gave N/A O O
three N/A O O
stars N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
2015 N/A O O
review N/A O O
. N/A O O
Most N/A O O
menus, N/A O O
at N/A O O
least N/A O O
the N/A O O
ones N/A O O
that N/A O O
change N/A O O
over N/A O O
time, N/A O O
are N/A O O
works N/A O O
in N/A O O
progress, N/A O O
but N/A O O
few N/A O O
make N/A O O
that N/A O O
explicit N/A O O
the N/A O O
way N/A O O
the N/A O O
one N/A O O
at N/A O O
Ko's N/A O B-EST
bar N/A O I-EST
does. N/A O O
The N/A O O
cynical N/A O O
way N/A O O
to N/A O O
look N/A O O
at N/A O O
this N/A O O
is N/A O O
that N/A O O
bar N/A O O
customers N/A O O
are N/A O O
paying N/A O O
to N/A O O
serve N/A O O
as N/A O O
lab N/A O O
rats. N/A O O
This N/A O O
will N/A O O
not N/A O O
be N/A O O
everyone's N/A O O
idea N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
fun N/A O O
night N/A O O
out. N/A O O
One N/A O O
recent N/A O O
evening, N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
was N/A O O
as N/A O O
meat-heavy N/A O O
as N/A O O
at N/A O O
Ssam N/A O B-EST
Bar N/A O I-EST
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
era N/A O O
when N/A O O
its N/A O O
menus N/A O O
still N/A O O
proclaimed, N/A O O
"We N/A O O
do N/A O O
not N/A O O
serve N/A O O
vegetarian-friendly N/A O B-DIET
items." N/A O O
Among N/A O O
the N/A O O
more N/A O O
substantial N/A O O
dishes N/A O O
that N/A O O
night N/A O O
was N/A O O
a N/A O O
mixed-meat N/A O B-DISH
sausage N/A O I-DISH
stuffed N/A O O
into N/A O O
a N/A O O
chicken N/A O B-FOOD
neck N/A O I-FOOD
and N/A O I-FOOD
grilled. N/A O O
One N/A O O
end N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
neck N/A O O
was N/A O O
open. N/A O O
The N/A O O
other N/A O O
was N/A O O
still N/A O O
attached N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
chicken's N/A O O
head. N/A O O
It N/A O O
was N/A O O
a N/A O O
sensational N/A O O
sausage, N/A O B-FOOD
but N/A O O
it N/A O O
did N/A O O
nothing N/A O O
to N/A O O
make N/A O O
Ko's N/A O B-EST
bar N/A O I-EST
the N/A O O
kind N/A O O
of N/A O O
place N/A O O
that N/A O O
you'd N/A O O
take N/A O O
your N/A O O
new N/A O O
pescatarian N/A O B-DIET
friend. N/A O I-DIET

the N/A O O
extent N/A O O
that N/A O O
it N/A O O

it's N/A O O
probably N/A O O
most N/A O O
similar N/A O O
to N/A O O
a N/A O O

On N/A O O
the N/A O O
notebook N/A O O
page N/A O O
facing N/A O O
the N/A O O
handwritten N/A O O
menu N/A O O
are N/A O O
two N/A O O
more N/A O O
wines N/A O B-FOOD
that N/A O O
Ambrose N/A O O
Chiang, N/A O O
the N/A O O

pouring N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
glass N/A O O
for N/A O O
one N/A O O
day N/A O O
only. N/A O O
Recently N/A O O
I've N/A O O
lucked N/A O O
into N/A O O
a N/A O O
precisely N/A O O
shaped N/A O O
Côte-Rôtie N/A O B-DISH
from N/A O O
Domaine N/A O O
Jasmin N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
Saumur N/A O B-DISH
from N/A O O
Romain N/A O O
Guiberteau N/A O O
whose N/A O O
self-assurance N/A O O
I N/A O O
envied. N/A O O
These N/A O O
specials N/A O O
can N/A O O
cost N/A O O
twice N/A O O
as N/A O O
much N/A O O
as N/A O O
the N/A O O
regular N/A O O
by-the-glass N/A O O
pours, N/A O O
which N/A O O
tend N/A O O
to N/A O O
fall N/A O O
between N/A O O
$15 N/A O O
and N/A O O
$25. N/A O O
I N/A O O
can't N/A O O
figure N/A O O
out N/A O O
why N/A O O
the N/A O O
wine-geek N/A O O
crowd N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
bring N/A O O
tents N/A O O
and N/A O O
sleeping N/A O O
bags N/A O O
to N/A O O
camp N/A O O
out N/A O O
at N/A O O
Ko's N/A O B-EST
bar. N/A O I-EST
And N/A O O
I N/A O O
don't N/A O O
understand N/A O O
why N/A O O
the N/A O O
place N/A O O
is N/A O O
almost N/A O O
never N/A O O
crowded, N/A O O
despite N/A O O
getting N/A O O
a N/A O O
fair N/A O O
amount N/A O O
of N/A O O
press N/A O O
after N/A O O
it N/A O O
opened. N/A O O
The N/A O O
experimental N/A O O
nature N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
can't N/A O O
be N/A O O
keeping N/A O O
people N/A O O
away; N/A O O
people N/A O O
expect N/A O O
that N/A O O
from N/A O O
Momofuku N/A O B-EST
restaurants N/A O O
. N/A O O
The N/A O O
only N/A O O
dish N/A O O
that N/A O O
I N/A O O
thought N/A O O
wasn't N/A O O
totally N/A O O
successful N/A O O
was N/A O O
the N/A O O
fried N/A O B-DISH
zucchini N/A O I-DISH
made N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
style N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
fried N/A O B-FOOD
chicken, N/A O I-FOOD
and N/A O O
I N/A O O
was N/A O O
still N/A O O
glad N/A O O
I N/A O O
tried N/A O O
it. N/A O O
The N/A O O
prices N/A O O
are N/A O O
all N/A O O
over N/A O O
the N/A O O
place, N/A O O
but N/A O O
a N/A O O
meal N/A O O
here N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
need N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
expensive. N/A O O
While N/A O O
you N/A O O
are N/A O O
welcome N/A O O
to N/A O O
spend N/A O O
$100 N/A O O
on N/A O O
a N/A O O
sourdough N/A O B-DISH

with N/A O I-DISH
50 N/A O I-DISH
grams N/A O I-DISH
of N/A O I-DISH

you N/A O O
can N/A O O
just N/A O O
get N/A O O
the N/A O O
crepe N/A O B-DISH
alone N/A O O
for N/A O O
$8. N/A O O
It N/A O O
is N/A O O
excellent: N/A O O
shiny N/A O O
with N/A O O
tangy N/A O O
cave-age N/A O B-FOOD
butter, N/A O I-FOOD
speckled N/A O O
with N/A O O
oregano N/A O O
cinders N/A O O
and N/A O O
crunchy N/A O O
from N/A O O
a N/A O O
pass N/A O O
over N/A O O
hot N/A O O
Japanese N/A O O
charcoal. N/A O O
The N/A O O
chicken, N/A O B-FOOD
meanwhile, N/A O O
is N/A O O
$7 N/A O O
a N/A O O
piece. N/A O O
The N/A O O
only N/A O O
reason N/A O O
I N/A O O
can N/A O O
think N/A O O
of N/A O O
for N/A O O
the N/A O O
empty N/A O O
seats N/A O O
is N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
place N/A O O
is N/A O O
so N/A O O
hard N/A O O
to N/A O O
sum N/A O O
up. N/A O O
Try N/A O O
this N/A O O

then: N/A O O

notice, N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Robuchon N/A O O
embodied N/A O O
the N/A O O
old N/A O O
order. N/A O O
At N/A O O
the N/A O O
time, N/A O O
this N/A O O
boot-camp N/A O O
style N/A O O
of N/A O O
running N/A O O
a N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
was N/A O O
state N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
art. N/A O O
But N/A O O
it N/A O O
had N/A O O
already N/A O O
come N/A O O
to N/A O O
seem N/A O O
counterproductive, N/A O O
disrespectful N/A O O
and N/A O O
unprofessional N/A O O
long N/A O O
before N/A O O
his N/A O O
death. N/A O O
In N/A O O
retrospect, N/A O O
the N/A O O
internal N/A O O
forces N/A O O
that N/A O O
he N/A O O
gave N/A O O
vent N/A O O
to N/A O O
when N/A O O
he N/A O O
screamed N/A O O
at N/A O O
his N/A O O
cooks N/A O O
must N/A O O
have N/A O O
also N/A O O
tormented N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Robuchon. N/A O O
For N/A O O
most N/A O O
of N/A O O

he N/A O O
was N/A O O
restless, N/A O O
unsatisfied. N/A O O
At N/A O O
51, N/A O O
he N/A O O
tried N/A O O
to N/A O O
retire; N/A O O
of N/A O O
course, N/A O O
it N/A O O
didn't N/A O O
last. N/A O O
In N/A O O
2003 N/A O O
he N/A O O
returned, N/A O O
and N/A O O
this N/A O O
time N/A O O
he N/A O O
seemed N/A O O
determined N/A O O
not N/A O O
to N/A O O
give N/A O O

placed N/A O O
the N/A O O

The N/A O O
French N/A O O

Le N/A O O

summed N/A O O
up N/A O O
the N/A O O
general N/A O O
reaction N/A O O
when N/A O O
it N/A O O
proclaimed, N/A O O
"C'est N/A O O

If N/A O O
you N/A O O
think N/A O O
the N/A O O
Figaro N/A O O
was N/A O O
overreacting, N/A O O
it's N/A O O
because N/A O O
the N/A O O

succeeded. N/A O O
Today, N/A O O
expensive N/A O O

is N/A O O
more N/A O O
likely N/A O O
to N/A O O
mean N/A O O

Mr. N/A O O

out N/A O O

were N/A O O
not N/A O O
just N/A O O
costly N/A O O
to N/A O O
maintain N/A O O
but, N/A O O
by N/A O O
that N/A O O
point, N/A O O
increasingly N/A O O
off-putting, N/A O O
especially N/A O O
to N/A O O
younger N/A O O
diners. N/A O O
Today N/A O O
we N/A O O
don't N/A O O
expect N/A O O

Mr. N/A O O

only N/A O O

the N/A O O

whether N/A O O

a N/A O O

that N/A O O
might N/A O O
have N/A O O
seemed N/A O O
inevitable N/A O O
as N/A O O
the N/A O O
Ukrainian N/A O O
community N/A O O
fell N/A O O
away N/A O O
hasn't N/A O O
been N/A O O
the N/A O O

fate. N/A O O
Not N/A O O
yet. N/A O O
New N/A O O

one N/A O O
of N/A O O
them N/A O O
moved N/A O O
into N/A O O
Surma's N/A O O

called N/A O O

between N/A O O
6 N/A O O

9, N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
small N/A O O
throng N/A O O
will N/A O O
be N/A O O
waiting N/A O O
for N/A O O
seats N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
entrance, N/A O O
below N/A O O
the N/A O O

that N/A O O
are N/A O O
stowed N/A O O
up N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O

During N/A O O
the N/A O O

Le N/A O O

reservations, N/A O O
but N/A O O
that N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
ease N/A O O
the N/A O O
demand N/A O O
by N/A O O
much. N/A O O
On N/A O O
some N/A O O
nights, N/A O O
the N/A O O
crowd N/A O O
is N/A O O
almost N/A O O
exclusively N/A O O
Chinese N/A O O
people N/A O O
of N/A O O
college N/A O O
age N/A O O
or N/A O O
slightly N/A O O
older, N/A O O
many N/A O O
of N/A O O
them N/A O O
lured N/A O O
out N/A O O
of N/A O O
their N/A O O
nearby N/A O O
New N/A O O
York N/A O O
University N/A O O
dorm N/A O O
rooms N/A O O
for N/A O O
steaming N/A O O
pans N/A O O
of N/A O O
shellfish, N/A O O
especially N/A O O
Le N/A O O
Sia's N/A O O
specialty, N/A O O
crayfish. N/A O O
Although N/A O O
a N/A O O
server N/A O O
there N/A O O
described N/A O O
the N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
to N/A O O
me N/A O O
as N/A O O
"Cajun N/A O O
seafood," N/A O O
Le N/A O O
Sia N/A O O
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
serving N/A O O
Acadiana-style N/A O O
crayfish. N/A O O
Nor N/A O O
is N/A O O
it N/A O O
seasoning N/A O O
crayfish N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
magical, N/A O O
butter-drenched N/A O O
combinations N/A O O
of N/A O O
Southeast N/A O O
Asian N/A O O
and N/A O O
Louisiana N/A O O
flavors N/A O O
like N/A O O
Thai N/A O O
basil-tamarind N/A O O
and N/A O O
lemongrass-ginger N/A O O
that N/A O O
were N/A O O
spawned N/A O O
in N/A O O
Vietnamese N/A O O
kitchens N/A O O
along N/A O O
Bellaire N/A O O

own N/A O O
the N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
along N/A O O
with N/A O O
its N/A O O
chef, N/A O O
Zac N/A O O
Zhang, N/A O O
are N/A O O
following N/A O O
a N/A O O
separate, N/A O O
unbuttered N/A O O
Chinese N/A O O
tradition N/A O O
that N/A O O
they N/A O O
enjoyed N/A O O
before N/A O O
moving N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
United N/A O O
States. N/A O O
It's N/A O O
a N/A O O
fairly N/A O O
young N/A O O
one, N/A O O
as N/A O O
Chinese N/A O O
food N/A O O
traditions N/A O O
go. N/A O O
Crayfish, N/A O O
or N/A O O
xiaolongxia, N/A O O
arrived N/A O O
in N/A O O
China N/A O O
sometime N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
middle N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
20th N/A O O
century. N/A O O
After N/A O O
regarding N/A O O
the N/A O O
novel N/A O O
ingredient N/A O O
warily N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O
few N/A O O
decades, N/A O O
cooks N/A O O
built N/A O O
a N/A O O
cuisine N/A O O
around N/A O O
it. N/A O O
Eaters N/A O O
took N/A O O
to N/A O O
it N/A O O
so N/A O O
enthusiastically N/A O O
that N/A O O
by N/A O O
2016 N/A O O
the N/A O O
Chinese N/A O O
crayfish N/A O O
industry N/A O O
employed N/A O O
five N/A O O
million N/A O O
people N/A O O
and N/A O O
was N/A O O
worth N/A O O
$27 N/A O O
billion. N/A O O
One N/A O O
major N/A O O
farming N/A O O
center N/A O O
is N/A O O
Hubei N/A O O
province, N/A O O
which N/A O O
recently N/A O O
unveiled N/A O O
a N/A O O
59-foot-long N/A O O
crayfish N/A O O
sculpture N/A O O
that N/A O O
is N/A O O
said N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
the N/A O O
world's N/A O O
largest. N/A O O
Its N/A O O
bright-red N/A O O
pincers N/A O O
are N/A O O
raised N/A O O
victoriously N/A O O
. N/A O O
Le N/A O O
Sia N/A O O
cooks N/A O O
crayfish N/A O O
and N/A O O
other N/A O O
shellfish N/A O O
-- N/A O O
lobster, N/A O O
shrimp, N/A O O
and N/A O O
Dungeness N/A O O
and N/A O O
snow N/A O O
crabs N/A O O
-- N/A O O
by N/A O O
boiling N/A O O
them N/A O O
first N/A O O
and N/A O O
then N/A O O
clacking N/A O O
them N/A O O
around N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
hot N/A O O
wok N/A O O
with N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
seven N/A O O
sauces. N/A O O
Each N/A O O
sauce N/A O O
can N/A O O
be N/A O O
further N/A O O
customized N/A O O
to N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
four N/A O O
chile-heat N/A O O
levels, N/A O O
from N/A O O
mild N/A O O
to N/A O O
"fire." N/A O O
Whatever N/A O O
combination N/A O O
of N/A O O
sea N/A O O
animal N/A O O
and N/A O O
seasoning N/A O O
you N/A O O
ask N/A O O
for, N/A O O
it N/A O O
will N/A O O
arrive N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
table N/A O O
almost N/A O O
before N/A O O
the N/A O O
words N/A O O
have N/A O O
left N/A O O
your N/A O O
mouth. N/A O O
For N/A O O
many N/A O O
customers N/A O O
the N/A O O
go-to N/A O O
order N/A O O
seems N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
"crayfish N/A O O
hot N/A O O
and N/A O O
spicy, N/A O O
spicy." N/A O O
Hot N/A O O
and N/A O O
spicy N/A O O
sauce, N/A O O
as N/A O O
far N/A O O
as N/A O O
I N/A O O
can N/A O O
make N/A O O
out, N/A O O
is N/A O O
based N/A O O
on N/A O O
soy, N/A O O
miso N/A O O
and N/A O O
garlic; N/A O O
the N/A O O
firepower N/A O O
comes N/A O O
from N/A O O
sliced N/A O O
pickled N/A O O
chiles, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
soy N/A O O
and N/A O O
miso N/A O O
give N/A O O
it N/A O O
a N/A O O
muscular N/A O O
heft. N/A O O
It N/A O O
may N/A O O
be N/A O O
my N/A O O
favorite N/A O O
Le N/A O O
Sia N/A O O
sauce, N/A O O
although N/A O O
it's N/A O O
a N/A O O
close N/A O O
call N/A O O
between N/A O O
that N/A O O
and N/A O O
its N/A O O
near N/A O O
relative, N/A O O
"numbing N/A O O
and N/A O O
spicy," N/A O O
which N/A O O
is N/A O O
propelled N/A O O
into N/A O O
tingling N/A O O
ma N/A O O
la N/A O O
territory N/A O O
by N/A O O
Sichuan N/A O O
peppercorns. N/A O O
I'm N/A O O
fascinated N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
kimchi-lime N/A O O
sauce, N/A O O
which N/A O O
conforms N/A O O
to N/A O O
no N/A O O
seafood-boil N/A O O
tradition N/A O O
I N/A O O
know N/A O O
of; N/A O O
its N/A O O
flavor N/A O O
is N/A O O
angular, N/A O O
hybridized, N/A O O
invigorating N/A O O
and N/A O O
not N/A O O
as N/A O O
fiery N/A O O
as N/A O O
you N/A O O
might N/A O O
expect. N/A O O
The N/A O O
garlic N/A O O
sauce N/A O O
hits N/A O O
just N/A O O
one N/A O O
note, N/A O O
and N/A O O
there N/A O O
will N/A O O
be N/A O O
no N/A O O
prizes N/A O O
for N/A O O
guessing N/A O O
which N/A O O
one. N/A O O
There N/A O O
is N/A O O
also N/A O O
a N/A O O
sauce N/A O O
called N/A O O
"thirteen N/A O O
special-flavor N/A O O
herbal N/A O O
spices." N/A O O
I N/A O O
tried N/A O O
it N/A O O
twice, N/A O O
with N/A O O
wildly N/A O O
divergent N/A O O
outcomes. N/A O O
The N/A O O
first N/A O O
time N/A O O
it N/A O O
was N/A O O
a N/A O O
wonderful, N/A O O
nuanced N/A O O
aromatic N/A O O
blend N/A O O
of N/A O O
expected N/A O O
and N/A O O
unexpected N/A O O
Chinese N/A O O
spices. N/A O O
On N/A O O
a N/A O O
second N/A O O
try, N/A O O
it N/A O O
tasted N/A O O
like N/A O O
spiced N/A O O
seawater. N/A O O
The N/A O O
star N/A O O
ingredient N/A O O
can N/A O O
vary, N/A O O
too. N/A O O
Honesty N/A O O
compels N/A O O
me N/A O O
to N/A O O
note N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
California N/A O O
crayfish N/A O O
Le N/A O O
Sia N/A O O
has N/A O O
been N/A O O
serving N/A O O
lately N/A O O
have N/A O O
a N/A O O
sweeter, N/A O O
finer N/A O O
flavor N/A O O
than N/A O O
the N/A O O
ones N/A O O
it N/A O O
was N/A O O
getting N/A O O
from N/A O O
Louisiana N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
late N/A O O
spring. N/A O O
This N/A O O
will N/A O O
no N/A O O
doubt N/A O O
cost N/A O O
me N/A O O
some N/A O O
friends N/A O O
in N/A O O
New N/A O O
Orleans. N/A O O
On N/A O O
the N/A O O
other N/A O O
hand, N/A O O
those N/A O O
friendships N/A O O
are N/A O O
already N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
rocks N/A O O
over N/A O O
my N/A O O
newspaper's N/A O O
insistence N/A O O
on N/A O O
calling N/A O O
the N/A O O
crustacean N/A O O
in N/A O O
question N/A O O
crayfish, N/A O O
rather N/A O O
than N/A O O
crawfish. N/A O O
Le N/A O O
Sia's N/A O O
shrimp, N/A O O
in N/A O O
my N/A O O
encounters N/A O O
with N/A O O
it, N/A O O
was N/A O O
bland N/A O O
and N/A O O
powdery. N/A O O
Dungeness N/A O O
crab N/A O O
arrived N/A O O
overcooked, N/A O O
the N/A O O
meat N/A O O
desperately N/A O O
stuck N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
shell. N/A O O
Snow N/A O O
crab N/A O O
was N/A O O
much N/A O O
better: N/A O O
sweet N/A O O
and N/A O O
flaky N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
legs, N/A O O
although N/A O O
the N/A O O
white N/A O O
bits N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
joints N/A O O
were N/A O O
slightly N/A O O
broken N/A O O
down. N/A O O
But N/A O O
every N/A O O
time N/A O O
I N/A O O
ordered N/A O O
lobster N/A O O
it N/A O O
was N/A O O
juicy N/A O O
and N/A O O
sweet. N/A O O
It N/A O O
may N/A O O
be N/A O O
the N/A O O
safest N/A O O
choice, N/A O O
although N/A O O
I N/A O O
haven't N/A O O
completely N/A O O
given N/A O O
up N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
crayfish N/A O O
entirely. N/A O O
At N/A O O
$15 N/A O O
for N/A O O
what N/A O O
looks N/A O O
like N/A O O
a N/A O O
very N/A O O
generous N/A O O
pound, N/A O O
it's N/A O O
worth N/A O O
taking N/A O O
a N/A O O
chance. N/A O O
As N/A O O
for N/A O O
the N/A O O
risks N/A O O
of N/A O O
eating N/A O O
without N/A O O
a N/A O O
pair N/A O O
of N/A O O
plastic N/A O O
gloves, N/A O O
kept N/A O O
in N/A O O
plentiful N/A O O
supply N/A O O
in N/A O O
sealed N/A O O
pouches N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
table, N/A O O
or N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O

bibs N/A O O
with N/A O O
their N/A O O
swirling N/A O O
red N/A O O
claw-and-antenna N/A O O

that N/A O O
is N/A O O
up N/A O O

you. N/A O O

animal N/A O O
parts N/A O O

These N/A O O

even N/A O O
faster N/A O O

the N/A O O

They N/A O O
are N/A O O
not N/A O O
bad N/A O O

quick, N/A O O

But N/A O O
other N/A O O

an N/A O O

the N/A O O

the N/A O O

Wok-fried N/A O O
clams N/A O O
in N/A O O
garlic N/A O O

were N/A O O
delicious, N/A O O
though, N/A O O
as N/A O O
were N/A O O
many N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O

eventually O N/A O
the O N/A O

"Our O N/A O

it's O N/A O

I O N/A O
must O N/A O
have O N/A O
looked O N/A O
confused O N/A O
because O N/A O
he O N/A O
added, O N/A O
"Some O N/A O

what O N/A O

After O N/A O
three O N/A O
recent O N/A O
visits O N/A O
to O N/A O

I O N/A O
decided O N/A O
that, O N/A O
apart O N/A O
from O N/A O
minor O N/A O

variations, O N/A O
any O N/A O

is O N/A O
too O N/A O
subtle O N/A O
for O N/A O
me O N/A O
to O N/A O
make O N/A O
out. O N/A O
The O N/A O

uptown O N/A O

Taku O N/A O
Sato O N/A O

Matt O N/A O

Downtown O N/A O
was O N/A O
led O N/A O
by O N/A O
Ricky O N/A O
Estrellado O N/A O
and O N/A O
Ryo O N/A O
Hasegawa O N/A O
until O N/A O
June, O N/A O
when O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
Estrellado O N/A O
died O N/A O
suddenly. O N/A O
His O N/A O
successor O N/A O
has O N/A O
not O N/A O
been O N/A O

Both O N/A O

models O N/A O
of O N/A O
superior O N/A O
ingredient O N/A O

and O N/A O
consistent O N/A O
performance. O N/A O
When O N/A O
those O N/A O
classic O N/A O
Nobu B-EST N/A B-EST

appear, O N/A O
they O N/A O
will O N/A O
be O N/A O
exactly O N/A O
like O N/A O
the O N/A O
last O N/A O
time O N/A O
you O N/A O
had O N/A O
them. O N/A O
In O N/A O

her O N/A O
early O N/A O

she O N/A O
cooked O N/A O
Iranian O N/A O
dishes O N/A O
from O N/A O
memory, O N/A O
and O N/A O
it O N/A O
would O N/A O
be O N/A O
decades O N/A O
before O N/A O
she O N/A O
traveled O N/A O
back O N/A O

noodle O N/A O
stew, O N/A O
stands O N/A O
out O N/A O
on O N/A O
the O N/A O
menu O N/A O
because O N/A O
it O N/A O
stays O N/A O
so O N/A O
close O N/A O
to O N/A O
tradition. O N/A O
Other O N/A O

show O N/A O
the O N/A O
acclimatizing O N/A O
effect O N/A O
of O N/A O
New O N/A O

It's O N/A O
an O N/A O
article O N/A O
of O N/A O
faith O N/A O
for O N/A O
chefs O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
city O N/A O
that O N/A O
any O N/A O
dish O N/A O
can O N/A O
be O N/A O
improved O N/A O
by O N/A O
putting O N/A O
a O N/A O
poached O N/A O
egg O N/A O
on O N/A O
it. O N/A O
I'm O N/A O
not O N/A O
so O N/A O
sure O N/A O
that O N/A O
Sofreh's O N/A O
smoked O N/A O
eggplant O N/A O
halves O N/A O
with O N/A O
their O N/A O
sweet, O N/A O
garlic-drenched O N/A O
tomato O N/A O
sauce O N/A O
need O N/A O
one, O N/A O
though. O N/A O
Is O N/A O
the O N/A O
watermelon O N/A O
feta O N/A O
salad O N/A O
familiar O N/A O
from O N/A O
restaurants O N/A O
that O N/A O
have O N/A O
nothing O N/A O
to O N/A O
do O N/A O
with O N/A O
Iran? O N/A O
Maybe O N/A O
just O N/A O
a O N/A O
bit, O N/A O
but O N/A O
Sofreh's O N/A O
version O N/A O
stands O N/A O
out O N/A O
for O N/A O
its O N/A O
intriguing O N/A O
sauce O N/A O
of O N/A O
nigella O N/A O
seeds O N/A O
crushed O N/A O
into O N/A O
mint O N/A O
oil. O N/A O
And O N/A O
while O N/A O
the O N/A O
Shiraz O N/A O
salad O N/A O
isn't O N/A O
chopped O N/A O
to O N/A O
fine O N/A O
bits O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
traditional O N/A O
way O N/A O
that O N/A O
makes O N/A O
it O N/A O
something O N/A O
like O N/A O
Iran's O N/A O
answer O N/A O
to O N/A O
pico O N/A O
de O N/A O
gallo, O N/A O
its O N/A O
sour O N/A O
purple O N/A O
flecks O N/A O
of O N/A O
sumac O N/A O
distinguish O N/A O
it O N/A O
from O N/A O
the O N/A O
herd O N/A O
of O N/A O
tomato-cucumber O N/A O
assemblages. O N/A O
The O N/A O
menu O N/A O
is O N/A O
fairly O N/A O
concise, O N/A O
and O N/A O
occasionally O N/A O
I O N/A O
wished O N/A O
that O N/A O
it O N/A O
plunged O N/A O
into O N/A O
tradition O N/A O
with O N/A O
less O N/A O
restraint. O N/A O
For O N/A O
a O N/A O
dish O N/A O
called O N/A O
"catch O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
day," O N/A O
Ms. O N/A O

has O N/A O
adapted O N/A O

a O N/A O
tamarind-soured O N/A O

of O N/A O
fish O N/A O
and O N/A O
fresh O N/A O
herbs O N/A O
from O N/A O
southern O N/A O

In O N/A O
her O N/A O
version, O N/A O
a O N/A O
pan-seared O N/A O
hunk O N/A O
of O N/A O
whitefish O N/A O
-- O N/A O

-- O N/A O
is O N/A O
set O N/A O

Dark O N/A O

cilantro O N/A O
and O N/A O
fresh O N/A O
fenugreek O N/A O
leaves, O N/A O
the O N/A O
sauce O N/A O
is O N/A O
hypnotically O N/A O
complex. O N/A O
Still, O N/A O
a O N/A O
sauce O N/A O
sitting O N/A O
under O N/A O
fish O N/A O
is O N/A O
not O N/A O
the O N/A O

one O N/A O
that O N/A O
has O N/A O
been O N/A O
cooked O N/A O
with O N/A O

so O N/A O
the O N/A O

acquainted. O N/A O
A O N/A O
simple O N/A O
flattened O N/A O
and O N/A O
griddled O N/A O
half O N/A O
chicken, O N/A O
though, O N/A O
is O N/A O
a O N/A O
wonderful O N/A O
foil O N/A O
for O N/A O
a O N/A O
topping O N/A O
of O N/A O
tart O N/A O

a O N/A O
captivating O N/A O
sauce O N/A O
of O N/A O
dried O N/A O
Persian O N/A O
plums O N/A O
and O N/A O
saffron. O N/A O
And O N/A O
there's O N/A O
lovely O N/A O
simplicity O N/A O
to O N/A O
the O N/A O
braised O N/A O
lamb O N/A O

This O N/A O
overture O N/A O
out O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
way, O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O

lifted O N/A O
what O N/A O
appeared O N/A O
to O N/A O
be O N/A O
a O N/A O
machete. O N/A O
This O N/A O
was O N/A O
a O N/A O
hamo O N/A O
knife, O N/A O
a O N/A O
heavy O N/A O
swath O N/A O
of O N/A O

before O N/A O
the O N/A O
first O N/A O
one O N/A O
was O N/A O
forged O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
19th O N/A O
century, O N/A O
he O N/A O
explained, O N/A O
the O N/A O
eel O N/A O
had O N/A O
to O N/A O
be O N/A O
fully O N/A O
cooked O N/A O
and O N/A O
separated O N/A O
from O N/A O
its O N/A O
skeleton. O N/A O
This O N/A O
hamo O N/A O
would O N/A O
be O N/A O
quickly O N/A O
scorched O N/A O
on O N/A O
one O N/A O
side O N/A O
and O N/A O
served O N/A O
with O N/A O
a O N/A O
lick O N/A O
of O N/A O
wasabi O N/A O
and O N/A O
puréed O N/A O
salt-cured O N/A O

thinned O N/A O
with O N/A O
dashi. O N/A O
Sashimi O N/A O
came O N/A O
next O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
form O N/A O
of O N/A O
shioko, O N/A O
or O N/A O
kanpachi O N/A O
caught O N/A O
when O N/A O
it O N/A O
is O N/A O
young O N/A O
and O N/A O
its O N/A O
flavor O N/A O
is O N/A O
leaner O N/A O
and O N/A O
softer O N/A O
than O N/A O
it O N/A O
will O N/A O
get O N/A O
later O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
year. O N/A O
This O N/A O
was O N/A O
followed O N/A O
by O N/A O
a O N/A O
local O N/A O
fish O N/A O
that O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
spring O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
Wilcox O N/A O
had O N/A O
told O N/A O
me O N/A O
he O N/A O
didn't O N/A O
like, O N/A O
striped O N/A O
bass. O N/A O
He O N/A O
had O N/A O
been O N/A O
working O N/A O
with O N/A O
it, O N/A O
though, O N/A O
salting O N/A O
it O N/A O
overnight O N/A O
and O N/A O
then O N/A O
grilling O N/A O
it O N/A O
until O N/A O
the O N/A O
skin O N/A O
crackled. O N/A O
Now O N/A O
I O N/A O
don't O N/A O
want O N/A O
striped O N/A O
bass O N/A O
cooked O N/A O
any O N/A O
other O N/A O
way. O N/A O
After O N/A O
this O N/A O
was O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
Wilcox's O N/A O
nod O N/A O
to O N/A O
the O N/A O
kaiseki O N/A O
tradition O N/A O
known O N/A O
as O N/A O
takiawase, O N/A O
a O N/A O
plate O N/A O
of O N/A O
simmered O N/A O
vegetables O N/A O
and, O N/A O
in O N/A O
this O N/A O
case, O N/A O
seafood: O N/A O
a O N/A O
small O N/A O
potato, O N/A O
some O N/A O
Japanese O N/A O
eggplant, O N/A O
a O N/A O
crisp O N/A O
pink O N/A O
ginger O N/A O
shoot O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
most O N/A O
flavorful O N/A O
piece O N/A O
of O N/A O
octopus O N/A O
I O N/A O
have O N/A O
ever O N/A O
put O N/A O
in O N/A O
my O N/A O
mouth. O N/A O
After O N/A O
my O N/A O
first O N/A O
meal O N/A O
at O N/A O
Shoji O N/A O
I O N/A O
learned O N/A O
to O N/A O
hope O N/A O
that O N/A O
chawan O N/A O
mushi, O N/A O
a O N/A O
bowl O N/A O
of O N/A O
steaming-hot O N/A O
tofu O N/A O
custard, O N/A O
was O N/A O
on O N/A O
the O N/A O
menu. O N/A O
In O N/A O
spring O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
Wilcox O N/A O
made O N/A O
it O N/A O
with O N/A O
spot O N/A O
prawns, O N/A O
but O N/A O
tonight, O N/A O
in O N/A O
homage O N/A O
to O N/A O
clambake O N/A O
season, O N/A O
he O N/A O
was O N/A O
serving O N/A O
lobster O N/A O
chawan O N/A O
mushi. O N/A O
To O N/A O
this O N/A O
point, O N/A O
the O N/A O
menu O N/A O
had O N/A O
faithfully O N/A O
followed O N/A O
kaiseki's O N/A O
ritualized O N/A O
sequence O N/A O
of O N/A O
courses O N/A O
and O N/A O
its O N/A O
stopwatch-precise O N/A O
attention O N/A O
to O N/A O
seasonality. O N/A O
It O N/A O
was O N/A O
about O N/A O
to O N/A O
veer O N/A O
in O N/A O
a O N/A O
different O N/A O
direction, O N/A O
but O N/A O
it O N/A O
was O N/A O
enough O N/A O
to O N/A O
suggest O N/A O
that O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
Wilcox O N/A O
could O N/A O
open O N/A O
a O N/A O
kaiseki O N/A O
restaurant O N/A O
that O N/A O
would O N/A O
set O N/A O
a O N/A O
new O N/A O
standard O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
city. O N/A O
I'm O N/A O
not O N/A O
sure O N/A O
the O N/A O
city O N/A O
would O N/A O
support O N/A O
it, O N/A O
but O N/A O
it O N/A O
would O N/A O
be O N/A O
spectacular O N/A O
while O N/A O
it O N/A O
lasted. O N/A O
The O N/A O
different O N/A O
direction, O N/A O
of O N/A O
course, O N/A O
was O N/A O
sushi. O N/A O
Accounting O N/A O
for O N/A O
just O N/A O
about O N/A O
half O N/A O
the O N/A O
Shoji O N/A O
menu, O N/A O
the O N/A O
sushi O N/A O
portion O N/A O
is O N/A O
briefer O N/A O
and O N/A O
offers O N/A O
less O N/A O
variety O N/A O
than O N/A O
the O N/A O
full O N/A O
monty O N/A O
at, O N/A O
say, O N/A O
Sushi O N/A O
Amane O N/A O
or O N/A O
Ginza O N/A O
Sushi O N/A O
Onodera O N/A O
. O N/A O
But O N/A O
I'm O N/A O
not O N/A O
sure O N/A O
any O N/A O
competitor O N/A O
outflanks O N/A O
Shoji O N/A O
on O N/A O
the O N/A O
quality O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
seafood O N/A O
it O N/A O
does O N/A O
serve, O N/A O
or O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
timeliness O N/A O
with O N/A O
which O N/A O
it O N/A O
serves O N/A O
up O N/A O
exactly O N/A O
the O N/A O
specimens O N/A O
most O N/A O
worth O N/A O
tracking O N/A O
down O N/A O
at O N/A O
any O N/A O
given O N/A O
moment. O N/A O
In O N/A O
spring, O N/A O
when O N/A O
bioluminescent O N/A O
firefly O N/A O
squid O N/A O
are O N/A O
spawning O N/A O
in O N/A O
Japanese O N/A O
bays, O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
Wilcox O N/A O
gets O N/A O
them. O N/A O
In O N/A O
August, O N/A O
when O N/A O
cuttlefish O N/A O
are O N/A O
thumbnail O N/A O
size, O N/A O
unbelievably O N/A O
smooth O N/A O
and O N/A O
as O N/A O
meltingly O N/A O
soft O N/A O
as O N/A O
the O N/A O
thinnest O N/A O
sheet O N/A O
of O N/A O
nova O N/A O
at O N/A O
Russ O N/A O
& O N/A O
Daughters O N/A O
, O N/A O
he O N/A O
will O N/A O
lay O N/A O
three O N/A O
of O N/A O
those O N/A O
over O N/A O
a O N/A O
single O N/A O
finger O N/A O
of O N/A O
rice. O N/A O
He O N/A O
tracks O N/A O
bluefin O N/A O
that O N/A O
has O N/A O
been O N/A O
caught O N/A O
from O N/A O
healthy O N/A O
stocks, O N/A O
like O N/A O
the O N/A O
o-toro O N/A O
from O N/A O
Ireland O N/A O
that O N/A O
he O N/A O
served O N/A O
last O N/A O
spring O N/A O
and O N/A O
that O N/A O
was O N/A O
so O N/A O
seductive O N/A O
it O N/A O
could O N/A O
have O N/A O
been O N/A O
captioned O N/A O
"the O N/A O
guy O N/A O
she O N/A O
told O N/A O
you O N/A O
not O N/A O
to O N/A O
worry O N/A O
about." O N/A O
While O N/A O
in O N/A O
Japan, O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
Wilcox O N/A O
learned O N/A O
to O N/A O
make O N/A O
fresh O N/A O
ikura O N/A O
from O N/A O
sacs O N/A O
of O N/A O
salmon O N/A O
roe, O N/A O
a O N/A O
slow O N/A O
process O N/A O
that O N/A O
requires O N/A O
massaging O N/A O
the O N/A O
eggs O N/A O
apart O N/A O
by O N/A O
hand O N/A O
in O N/A O
many O N/A O
changes O N/A O
of O N/A O
water. O N/A O
Normally O N/A O
the O N/A O
roe O N/A O
is O N/A O
then O N/A O
heavily O N/A O
cured O N/A O
with O N/A O
sugar O N/A O
and O N/A O
salt, O N/A O
but O N/A O
the O N/A O
roe O N/A O
he O N/A O
was O N/A O
serving O N/A O
last O N/A O
month O N/A O
was O N/A O
very O N/A O
lightly O N/A O
seasoned O N/A O
before O N/A O
being O N/A O
spooned O N/A O
into O N/A O
a O N/A O
shot O N/A O
glass O N/A O
and O N/A O
served O N/A O
as O N/A O
is O N/A O
-- O N/A O
sticky, O N/A O
fatty, O N/A O
sweet O N/A O
and O N/A O
fresh. O N/A O
After O N/A O
the O N/A O
last O N/A O
piece O N/A O
of O N/A O
fish, O N/A O
the O N/A O
kaiseki O N/A O
format O N/A O
kicks O N/A O
in O N/A O
again O N/A O
with O N/A O
a O N/A O
soup, O N/A O
which O N/A O
may O N/A O
be O N/A O
as O N/A O
simple O N/A O
as O N/A O
a O N/A O
classic O N/A O
bowl O N/A O
of O N/A O
miso O N/A O
or O N/A O
may O N/A O
break O N/A O
with O N/A O
tradition, O N/A O
like O N/A O
the O N/A O
extraordinary O N/A O
corn O N/A O
soup O N/A O
I O N/A O
ate O N/A O
in O N/A O
August. O N/A O
There O N/A O
will O N/A O
be O N/A O
something O N/A O
cold O N/A O
and O N/A O
refreshing, O N/A O
maybe O N/A O
a O N/A O
granita O N/A O
made O N/A O
from O N/A O
ginger O N/A O
or O N/A O
matcha, O N/A O
and O N/A O
finally O N/A O
a O N/A O
more O N/A O
substantial O N/A O
dessert. O N/A O
Sometimes O N/A O
this O N/A O
is O N/A O
a O N/A O
sort O N/A O
of O N/A O
tart O N/A O
with O N/A O
seasonal O N/A O
fruit O N/A O
-- O N/A O
candied O N/A O
kumquats, O N/A O
maybe, O N/A O
or O N/A O
white O N/A O
peaches O N/A O
and O N/A O
blueberries O N/A O
-- O N/A O
arranged O N/A O
in O N/A O
a O N/A O
mochi O N/A O
wafer O N/A O
called O N/A O
monaka. O N/A O
For O N/A O
all O N/A O
this O N/A O
the O N/A O

is O N/A O
$252, O N/A O
service O N/A O

That O N/A O
service O N/A O
is O N/A O
somewhat O N/A O
minimal; O N/A O
lately O N/A O
it O N/A O
has O N/A O

the O N/A O
spotlight O N/A O
in O N/A O
New O N/A O
York O N/A O
restaurants, O N/A O
where O N/A O
there's O N/A O
always O N/A O
pressure O N/A O
to O N/A O
order O N/A O
something O N/A O
big. O N/A O
This O N/A O
is, O N/A O
after O N/A O
all, O N/A O
a O N/A O
city O N/A O
that O N/A O
turned O N/A O
the O N/A O
casual O N/A O
tapas O N/A B-TYPE
bar O N/A I-TYPE
into O N/A O
the O N/A O
peculiar O N/A O
genre O N/A O
known O N/A O
as O N/A O
the O N/A O
tapas O N/A B-TYPE
restaurant. O N/A I-TYPE
There O N/A O
is O N/A O
no O N/A O
such O N/A O
pressure O N/A O
inside O N/A O
Kopitiam, O N/A B-EST
at O N/A O
least O N/A O
on O N/A O
weekdays. O N/A O
Weekend O N/A O
brunch O N/A O
is O N/A O
another O N/A O
story, O N/A O
as O N/A O
it O N/A O
often O N/A O
is. O N/A O
The O N/A O
menu O N/A O
is O N/A O
the O N/A O
same, O N/A O
but O N/A O
the O N/A O
crowds O N/A O
thicken. O N/A O
A O N/A O
sign-in O N/A O
sheet O N/A O
is O N/A O
kept O N/A O
outside O N/A O
the O N/A O
door, O N/A O
next O N/A O
to O N/A O
the O N/A O
pink O N/A O
pay O N/A O
phone O N/A O
(25 O N/A O
cents; O N/A O
it O N/A O
works), O N/A O
and O N/A O
hopeful O N/A O
customers O N/A O
sit O N/A O
on O N/A O
ceramic O N/A O
garden O N/A O
stools O N/A O
at O N/A O
the O N/A O
top O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
stoop O N/A O
listening O N/A O
for O N/A O
their O N/A O
names. O N/A O
When O N/A O
you're O N/A O
finally O N/A O
called, O N/A O
you O N/A O
may O N/A O
feel O N/A O
silly O N/A O
getting O N/A O
nothing O N/A O
more O N/A O
than O N/A O
tannic O N/A O
milky O N/A B-FOOD
tea O N/A I-FOOD
and O N/A O
a O N/A O
bundle O N/A O
of O N/A O
blue O N/A B-FOOD
sticky O N/A I-FOOD
rice. O N/A I-FOOD
And O N/A O
when O N/A O
demand O N/A O
peaks, O N/A O
chaos O N/A O
can O N/A O
creep O N/A O
in, O N/A O
suggesting O N/A O
that O N/A O
Kopitiam O N/A B-EST
is O N/A O
still O N/A O
figuring O N/A O
out O N/A O
the O N/A O
mechanics O N/A O
of O N/A O
its O N/A O
larger O N/A O
space. O N/A O
Servers O N/A O
may O N/A O
pop O N/A O
by O N/A O
anxiously O N/A O
to O N/A O
ask, O N/A O
"Did O N/A O
you O N/A O
get O N/A O
all O N/A O
your O N/A O
food?" O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
answer O N/A O
may O N/A O
be O N/A O
no. O N/A O
Drink O N/A O
orders O N/A O
may O N/A O
stack O N/A O
up. O N/A O
Once O N/A O
the O N/A O
white O N/A B-FOOD
coffee O N/A I-FOOD
was O N/A O
off O N/A O
the O N/A O
menu; O N/A O
another O N/A O
time, O N/A O
no O N/A O
coffee O N/A B-FOOD
at O N/A O
all O N/A O
was O N/A O
being O N/A O
poured; O N/A O
and O N/A O
for O N/A O
a O N/A O
short O N/A O
time O N/A O
one O N/A O
day, O N/A O
both O N/A O
coffee O N/A O
and O N/A O
tea O N/A O
were O N/A O
unavailable, O N/A O
an O N/A O
awkward O N/A O
state O N/A O
of O N/A O
affairs O N/A O
for O N/A O
a O N/A O
coffee O N/A B-TYPE
and O N/A I-TYPE
tea O N/A I-TYPE
parlor. O N/A I-TYPE
Even O N/A O
with O N/A O
a O N/A O
backlog O N/A O
of O N/A O
tickets, O N/A O
though, O N/A O
the O N/A O
food O N/A O
trickling O N/A O
out O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
kitchen O N/A O
is O N/A O
almost O N/A O
unfailingly O N/A O
terrific. O N/A O
Maybe O N/A O
the O N/A O
stir-fried O N/A B-DISH
duck O N/A I-DISH

I O N/A O
ate O N/A O

slid O N/A O
from O N/A O
their O N/A O

more O N/A O
easily. O N/A O
Then O N/A O
again, O N/A O
maybe O N/A O
I O N/A O
wasn't O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O

without O N/A O

it. O N/A O
At O N/A O
best O N/A O
I O N/A O
might O N/A O
have O N/A O

the O N/A O
tiny O N/A O

over O N/A O
its O N/A O
10 O N/A O

giving O N/A O
it O N/A O
the O N/A O
appearance O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
world's O N/A O
smallest O N/A O
used-car O N/A O
dealership. O N/A O
In O N/A O
the O N/A O
back O N/A O
is O N/A O
a O N/A O
wide, O N/A O
single-story O N/A O
structure O N/A O
that O N/A O
looks O N/A O
like O N/A O
the O N/A O
trailer O N/A O
office O N/A O
where O N/A O
you O N/A O
would O N/A O
sit O N/A O
down O N/A O
to O N/A O
discuss O N/A O
loan O N/A O
options O N/A O
with O N/A O
Marty O N/A O
from O N/A O
financing. O N/A O
But O N/A O
that O N/A O
building O N/A O
is O N/A O
an O N/A O
Azerbaijani B-CUISINE N/A B-CUISINE
restaurant O N/A O
that O N/A O
stands O N/A O
out O N/A O

the O N/A O

outposts O N/A O
of O N/A O
former O N/A O

and O N/A O
each O N/A O

I've O N/A O

I O N/A O
was O N/A O

not O N/A O
a O N/A O

a O N/A O

of O N/A O
my O N/A O

This O N/A O
is O N/A O
not O N/A O
just O N/A O
because O N/A O
almost O N/A O
every O N/A O

the O N/A O

seems O N/A O
intended O N/A O
to O N/A O
feed O N/A O
an O N/A O
actual O N/A O
village. O N/A O
I O N/A O
run O N/A O
into O N/A O
trouble O N/A O
because O N/A O
there O N/A O
are O N/A O
so O N/A O
many O N/A O
things O N/A O
I O N/A O
want O N/A O
to O N/A O
order O N/A O
and O N/A O
so O N/A O
few O N/A O
things O N/A O
I O N/A O
am O N/A O
willing O N/A O
to O N/A O
leave O N/A O
on O N/A O
the O N/A O
table O N/A O
as O N/A O
the O N/A O
meal O N/A O
winds O N/A O
down. O N/A O
There O N/A O
will O N/A O
never O N/A O
be O N/A O
a O N/A O
time O N/A O
when O N/A O
I O N/A O
go O N/A O
to O N/A O
Village B-EST N/A B-EST
Cafe I-EST N/A I-EST
and O N/A O
decide O N/A O
not O N/A O
to O N/A O

one O N/A O
qutab, B-DISH N/A B-FOOD
if O N/A O
not O N/A O
all O N/A O
three. O N/A O
The O N/A O

of O N/A O
this O N/A O
delicate O N/A O
Azerbaijani B-CUISINE N/A B-CUISINE

way, O N/A O
it O N/A O

quietly I-FOOD N/A O
spiced I-FOOD N/A O
chicken I-FOOD N/A B-FOOD
or O N/A O

It O N/A O
is O N/A O
exceptional O N/A O
when O N/A O
filled O N/A O
with O N/A O
greens: B-FOOD N/A O
spinach, B-FOOD N/A B-FOOD
scallions, B-FOOD N/A B-FOOD

cilantro, O N/A O
two O N/A O

turn O N/A O
up O N/A O
again O N/A O
and O N/A O
again O N/A O
in O N/A O
Azerbaijani O N/A O
cooking. O N/A O
I O N/A O
will O N/A O
always O N/A O
want O N/A O
the O N/A O
crimped O N/A O
dumplings, O N/A O
the O N/A O
size O N/A O
and O N/A O
shape O N/A O
of O N/A O
chicken O N/A O
drumettes, O N/A O
that O N/A O
the O N/A O
English O N/A O
menu O N/A O
calls O N/A O
ravioli O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
servers O N/A O
call O N/A O
pelmeni. O N/A O
Filled O N/A O
with O N/A O
chicken O N/A O
or O N/A O
lamb, O N/A O
these O N/A O
dumplings O N/A O
can O N/A O
be O N/A O
boiled, O N/A O
but O N/A O
the O N/A O
urge O N/A O
to O N/A O
ask O N/A O
for O N/A O
them O N/A O
fried O N/A O
is O N/A O
overwhelming, O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
fried O N/A O
ones O N/A O
are O N/A O
better O N/A O
dunked O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
tomato-pepper O N/A O
sauce O N/A O
that O N/A O
I O N/A O
would O N/A O
call O N/A O
salsa O N/A O
if O N/A O
I O N/A O
were O N/A O
not O N/A O
in O N/A O
an O N/A O
Azerbaijani O N/A O
restaurant. O N/A O
There O N/A O
will O N/A O
be O N/A O
liver O N/A O
on O N/A O
my O N/A O
table, O N/A O
too. O N/A O
Maybe O N/A O
it O N/A O
will O N/A O
be O N/A O
Turkish O N/A O
style, O N/A O
little O N/A O
fried O N/A O
cubes O N/A O
under O N/A O
a O N/A O
tart O N/A O
purple O N/A O
dusting O N/A O
of O N/A O
ground O N/A O
sumac. O N/A O
Or O N/A O
the O N/A O
liver O N/A O
may O N/A O
be O N/A O
added O N/A O
to O N/A O
bits O N/A O
of O N/A O
lamb O N/A O
hearts, O N/A O
kidney O N/A O
and O N/A O
testicles, O N/A O
and O N/A O
cooked O N/A O
with O N/A O
onions O N/A O
and O N/A O
potato O N/A O
cubes O N/A O
in O N/A O
a O N/A O
fantastically O N/A O
oily O N/A O
hash O N/A O
called O N/A O
djiz O N/A O
biz. O N/A O
Whether O N/A O
I O N/A O
will O N/A O
eat O N/A O
guru O N/A O
hingal O N/A O
will O N/A O
depend O N/A O
on O N/A O
how O N/A O
far O N/A O
in O N/A O
advance O N/A O
I've O N/A O
planned O N/A O
my O N/A O
meal, O N/A O
because O N/A O
it O N/A O
generally O N/A O
has O N/A O
to O N/A O
be O N/A O
ordered O N/A O
a O N/A O
day O N/A O
ahead. O N/A O
It O N/A O
is O N/A O
a O N/A O
noodle O N/A O
dish: O N/A O
very O N/A O
thin, O N/A O
wide O N/A O
sheets O N/A O
of O N/A O
pasta O N/A O
under O N/A O
a O N/A O
sauce O N/A O
of O N/A O
onions O N/A O
and O N/A O
ground O N/A O
lamb O N/A O
fried O N/A O
in O N/A O
its O N/A O
own O N/A O
fat O N/A O
until O N/A O
it O N/A O
is O N/A O
magnificently O N/A O
crunchy. O N/A O
If O N/A O
you O N/A O
poured O N/A O
chile O N/A O
oil O N/A O
over O N/A O
guru O N/A O
hingal, O N/A O
it O N/A O
would O N/A O
taste O N/A O
Sichuanese; O N/A O
stew O N/A O
the O N/A O
lamb O N/A O
with O N/A O
tomatoes O N/A O
and O N/A O
you O N/A O
could O N/A O
mistake O N/A O
the O N/A O
sauce O N/A O
for O N/A O
Bolognese. O N/A O
But O N/A O
it's O N/A O
from O N/A O
Azerbaijan, O N/A O
and O N/A O
it's O N/A O
good O N/A O
with O N/A O
yogurt. O N/A O
And O N/A O
I O N/A O
will O N/A O
have O N/A O
soup, O N/A O
even O N/A O
if O N/A O
nobody O N/A O
else O N/A O
does, O N/A O
because O N/A O
Village O N/A O
Cafe's O N/A O
kitchen O N/A O
understands O N/A O
how O N/A O
to O N/A O
make O N/A O
it. O N/A O
The O N/A O
kufta-bozbash O N/A O
is O N/A O
a O N/A O
strong, O N/A O
well-skimmed O N/A O
lamb O N/A O
broth O N/A O
with O N/A O
chickpeas O N/A O
and O N/A O
a O N/A O
single, O N/A O
tender O N/A O
lamb-rice O N/A O
meatball, O N/A O
as O N/A O
big O N/A O
as O N/A O
an O N/A O
apple. O N/A O
The O N/A O
broth O N/A O
for O N/A O
dushbara O N/A O
soup O N/A O
is O N/A O
similar, O N/A O
but O N/A O
the O N/A O
ballast O N/A O
is O N/A O
provided O N/A O
by O N/A O
miniature O N/A O
lamb O N/A O
dumplings O N/A O
about O N/A O
the O N/A O
size O N/A O
of O N/A O
M&Ms. O N/A O
Cilantro O N/A O
and O N/A O
dried O N/A O
mint O N/A O
are O N/A O
added O N/A O
to O N/A O
both O N/A O
soups O N/A O
at O N/A O
the O N/A O
last O N/A O
minute, O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
mint O N/A O
is O N/A O
especially O N/A O
helpful. O N/A O
Village O N/A O
Cafe's O N/A O
hot O N/A O
borscht, O N/A O
strong O N/A O
and O N/A O
decidedly O N/A O
unvegetarian, O N/A O
outperforms O N/A O
some O N/A O
I've O N/A O
had O N/A O
in O N/A O
Brighton O N/A O
Beach. O N/A O
Instead O N/A O
of O N/A O
sour O N/A O
cream, O N/A O
it O N/A O
comes O N/A O
with O N/A O
a O N/A O
spoonful O N/A O
of O N/A O
yogurt. O N/A O
The O N/A O
cuisine O N/A O
of O N/A O
Azerbaijan O N/A O
often O N/A O
echoes O N/A O
those O N/A O
of O N/A O
its O N/A O
neighbors O N/A O
Georgia, O N/A O
Armenia O N/A O
and O N/A O
Iran, O N/A O
but O N/A O
other O N/A O
dishes, O N/A O
like O N/A O
borscht, O N/A O
were O N/A O
hauled O N/A O
down O N/A O
from O N/A O
Eastern O N/A O
Europe O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
strong O N/A O
arms O N/A O
of O N/A O
Mother O N/A O
Russia. O N/A O
We O N/A O
can O N/A O
also O N/A O
thank O N/A O
Russia O N/A O
for O N/A O
the O N/A O
insane O N/A O
music O N/A O
videos O N/A O
that O N/A O
play O N/A O
on O N/A O
Village O N/A O
Cafe's O N/A O
two O N/A O
televisions, O N/A O
typically O N/A O
with O N/A O
the O N/A O
volume O N/A O
off O N/A O
while O N/A O
American O N/A O
pop O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
'80s O N/A O
plays O N/A O
on O N/A O
the O N/A O

You O N/A O

The O N/A O

Almost O N/A O

The O N/A O

by O N/A O
someone O N/A O
with O N/A O
a O N/A O
weakness O N/A O
for O N/A O
poetry, O N/A O
so O N/A O
the O N/A O
salads O N/A O
are O N/A O
called O N/A O
things O N/A O
like O N/A O
"Journey O N/A O
to O N/A O
Baku," O N/A O
"Winter O N/A O
Fun" O N/A O
and O N/A O
"Unexpected O N/A O

The O N/A O
Journey O N/A O
to O N/A O
Baku O N/A O
is O N/A O
worth O N/A O
taking; O N/A O
it's O N/A O

with O N/A O
one O N/A O
chicken O N/A O

But O N/A O
the O N/A O
lamb O N/A O

the O N/A O

the O N/A O

it's O N/A O

the O N/A O

you O N/A O
generally O N/A O
flow O N/A O

the O N/A O

the O N/A O

every O N/A O

Generally, O N/A O
but O N/A O
not O N/A O
always. O N/A O
I O N/A O
believe O N/A O

still O N/A O
find O N/A O

that O N/A O

You O N/A O
could O N/A O
say O N/A O
the O N/A O
same O N/A O
about O N/A O
the O N/A O
intensely O N/A O
herb-scented O N/A O
seafood O N/A O

in O N/A O
a O N/A O

Mr. O N/A O

calls O N/A O
the O N/A O
Afropot; O N/A O
the O N/A O
clams O N/A O
and O N/A O
king O N/A O
crab O N/A O
legs O N/A O
were O N/A O
very O N/A O
good, O N/A O
but O N/A O
the O N/A O
prawns O N/A O
were O N/A O
unappealingly O N/A O
soft O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
mussels O N/A O
not O N/A O
quite O N/A O
fleshy O N/A O
enough. O N/A O
The O N/A O
cooking, O N/A O
though, O N/A O
has O N/A O
been O N/A O
getting O N/A O
tighter O N/A O
over O N/A O
the O N/A O
past O N/A O
month, O N/A O
picking O N/A O
up O N/A O
from O N/A O

somewhat O N/A O
droopy O N/A O
meal O N/A O
on O N/A O

night O N/A O
when O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O

not O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O

A O N/A O
parcel O N/A O
of O N/A O
rice O N/A O
supposedly O N/A O
inspired O N/A O
by O N/A O
Dominican O N/A O
concón O N/A O
had O N/A O
as O N/A O
much O N/A O
crunch O N/A O
as O N/A O
if O N/A O
it O N/A O
had O N/A O
been O N/A O
left O N/A O
out O N/A O
on O N/A O
the O N/A O

overnight, O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
eggplant O N/A O
curry O N/A O
ladled O N/A O
over O N/A O
it O N/A O
tasted O N/A O
more O N/A O
like O N/A O
a O N/A O
halfheartedly O N/A O
seasoned O N/A O
tomato O N/A O
sauce. O N/A O
The O N/A O
second O N/A O
time O N/A O
I O N/A O
tried O N/A O
it, O N/A O
the O N/A O
rice O N/A O
had O N/A O
a O N/A O
golden O N/A O
crackle O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
curry O N/A O
was O N/A O
worth O N/A O
paying O N/A O
attention O N/A O
to. O N/A O
Apart O N/A O
from O N/A O
the O N/A O
seared O N/A O
scallops O N/A O
in O N/A O
a O N/A O
remarkably O N/A O
good O N/A O
hominy O N/A O
broth O N/A O
with O N/A O
cilantro O N/A O
pistou, O N/A O
those O N/A O
bone-in O N/A O
ribs O N/A O
are O N/A O
the O N/A O
most O N/A O
rewarding O N/A O
main O N/A O
course. O N/A O
The O N/A O
rewards O N/A O
are O N/A O
not O N/A O
so O N/A O
much O N/A O
the O N/A O
short O N/A O
ribs O N/A O
themselves, O N/A O
though O N/A O
they O N/A O
are O N/A O
flavorful O N/A O
and O N/A O
tender; O N/A O
the O N/A O
thrill O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
dish O N/A O
is O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
battery O N/A O
of O N/A O
little O N/A O
sides O N/A O
like O N/A O
stir-fried O N/A O
millet, O N/A O
spiced O N/A O
black O N/A O
beans O N/A O
and O N/A O
a O N/A O
hoisin O N/A O

I O N/A O
wanted O N/A O
to O N/A O
take O N/A O
home O N/A O
to O N/A O
keep O N/A O
on O N/A O
hand O N/A O
for O N/A O
Chinese-food O N/A O
emergencies. O N/A O
I O N/A O
also O N/A O
thought O N/A O
about O N/A O
pocketing O N/A O
a O N/A O
Foie O N/A O
Crispy O N/A O
Treat, O N/A O
and O N/A O
I O N/A O
would O N/A O
have O N/A O
gotten O N/A O
away O N/A O
with O N/A O
it O N/A O
because O N/A O
everybody O N/A O
else O N/A O
at O N/A O
the O N/A O
table O N/A O
thought O N/A O
they O N/A O
were O N/A O
too O N/A O
weird. O N/A O
Weird O N/A O
they O N/A O
are, O N/A O
but O N/A O
interesting, O N/A O
too. O N/A O
Maybe O N/A O
you'd O N/A O
be O N/A O
happier O N/A O
with O N/A O
the O N/A O
sweet O N/A O
potato O N/A O
pie O N/A O
in O N/A O
a O N/A O
crisp O N/A O
butter O N/A O
crust, O N/A O

apart O N/A O
from O N/A O
the O N/A O

your O N/A O

a O N/A O

from O N/A O
the O N/A O

what O N/A O

the O N/A O
"house O N/A O

is O N/A O
brown, O N/A O
more O N/A O

than O N/A O
smooth O N/A O
and O N/A O
baked O N/A O
to O N/A O
a O N/A O
ferocious O N/A O
crackle. O N/A O
You O N/A O
could O N/A O
tear O N/A O
it O N/A O
off O N/A O
and O N/A O
enjoy O N/A O
it O N/A O
on O N/A O
its O N/A O
own, O N/A O
or O N/A O
maybe O N/A O
with O N/A O
butter O N/A O
or O N/A O
olive O N/A O
oil, O N/A O
just O N/A O
as O N/A O
you O N/A O
can O N/A O
with O N/A O
the O N/A O
best O N/A O
Neapolitans. O N/A O
Yet O N/A O
the O N/A O
flat O N/A O
layer O N/A O
of O N/A O
crust O N/A O

the O N/A O
soupy O N/A O

of O N/A O
the O N/A O
Neapolitan O N/A O
style. O N/A O
True O N/A O
to O N/A O
New O N/A O

form, O N/A O
you O N/A O
can O N/A O
hold O N/A O
it O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
air O N/A O
by O N/A O
the O N/A O
curved O N/A O
rim O N/A O
and O N/A O
it O N/A O
will O N/A O
stay O N/A O
flat O N/A O
and O N/A O
parallel O N/A O
to O N/A O
the O N/A O
floor. O N/A O
As O N/A O
they O N/A O
do O N/A O
at O N/A O
Totonno's O N/A O
and O N/A O
some O N/A O
other O N/A O
brick-oven O N/A O
pizzerias, O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
Tuttolomondo O N/A O
lays O N/A O
the O N/A O
cheese O N/A O
down O N/A O
before O N/A O
the O N/A O
sauce. O N/A O
Rather O N/A O
than O N/A O
drippy, O N/A O
milky O N/A O
discs O N/A O
of O N/A O
fresh O N/A O
mozzarella, O N/A O
though, O N/A O
he O N/A O
covers O N/A O
the O N/A O
raw O N/A O
dough O N/A O
(after O N/A O
priming O N/A O
it O N/A O
with O N/A O
olive O N/A O
oil) O N/A O
in O N/A O
shreds O N/A O
of O N/A O
a O N/A O
slice-friendly O N/A O
variety O N/A O
that O N/A O
is O N/A O
known O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
trade O N/A O
as O N/A O
low-moisture O N/A O
mozzarella O N/A O
and O N/A O
that O N/A O
the O N/A O
rest O N/A O
of O N/A O
us O N/A O
call O N/A O
pizza O N/A O
cheese. O N/A O
Over O N/A O
this, O N/A O
he O N/A O
ladles O N/A O
a O N/A O
few O N/A O
blots O N/A O
of O N/A O
tomato O N/A O
pulp. O N/A O
This O N/A O
helps O N/A O
the O N/A O
crust O N/A O
to O N/A O
bake O N/A O
through O N/A O
without O N/A O
getting O N/A O
soggy, O N/A O
keeps O N/A O
the O N/A O
cheese O N/A O
from O N/A O
sliding O N/A O
off O N/A O
the O N/A O
crust, O N/A O
and O N/A O
most O N/A O
of O N/A O
all O N/A O
lets O N/A O
you O N/A O
taste O N/A O
the O N/A O
tomatoes, O N/A O
which O N/A O
are O N/A O
very O N/A O
good. O N/A O
You O N/A O
could, O N/A O
I O N/A O
suppose, O N/A O
think O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
house O N/A O
slice O N/A O
as O N/A O
a O N/A O
white O N/A O
pizza O N/A O
with O N/A O
tomato-sauce O N/A O
topping. O N/A O
After O N/A O
the O N/A O
pie O N/A O
comes O N/A O
out O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
oven, O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
Tuttolomondo O N/A O
sprinkles O N/A O
it O N/A O
with O N/A O
grated O N/A O
two-year-old O N/A O
Parmigiano-Reggiano. O N/A O
Basil O N/A O
leaves O N/A O
are O N/A O
the O N/A O
last O N/A O
to O N/A O
go O N/A O
on. O N/A O
At O N/A O
this O N/A O
point, O N/A O
you O N/A O
can O N/A O
pay, O N/A O
walk O N/A O
out O N/A O
the O N/A O
door O N/A O
and O N/A O
amble O N/A O
toward O N/A O
Broadway O N/A O
and O N/A O
106th O N/A O
Street O N/A O
cradling O N/A O
your O N/A O
slice O N/A O
in O N/A O
a O N/A O
paper O N/A O
plate O N/A O
and O N/A O
taking O N/A O
bites O N/A O
as O N/A O
you O N/A O
go. O N/A O
In O N/A O
other O N/A O
words, O N/A O
you O N/A O
can O N/A O
have O N/A O
the O N/A O
traditional O N/A O
sidewalk O N/A O
pizza O N/A O
experience, O N/A O
but O N/A O
you O N/A O
will O N/A O
be O N/A O
tasting O N/A O
flavors O N/A O
you O N/A O
normally O N/A O
find O N/A O
only O N/A O
in O N/A O
high-minded O N/A O
sit-down O N/A O
pizzerias O N/A O

Those O N/A O

who O N/A O
follow O N/A O
the O N/A O
city's O N/A O
melted-mozzarella O N/A O

will O N/A O
recognize O N/A O
that O N/A O
Mama's O N/A O
Too O N/A O
is O N/A O
part O N/A O
of O N/A O
a O N/A O
great O N/A O
reawakening O N/A O
of O N/A O
slice O N/A O
culture. O N/A O
Unlike O N/A O
brick-oven O N/A O
pizza, O N/A O
which O N/A O
came O N/A O
from O N/A O
Europe O N/A O
and O N/A O
relied O N/A O
on O N/A O
preindustrial O N/A O
technology, O N/A O
the O N/A O
New O N/A O
York O N/A O
slice O N/A O
is O N/A O
a O N/A O
lowly O N/A O
American O N/A O
hybrid. O N/A O
It O N/A O
is O N/A O
baked O N/A O
in O N/A O
gas O N/A O
ovens, O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
sheer O N/A O
number O N/A O
of O N/A O
places O N/A O
selling O N/A O
it O N/A O
suggests O N/A O
that O N/A O
it O N/A O
requires O N/A O
no O N/A O
special O N/A O
skill. O N/A O
When O N/A O
it O N/A O
is O N/A O
praised, O N/A O
we O N/A O
don't O N/A O

about O N/A O

we O N/A O
call O N/A O
it O N/A O
the O N/A O
humble O N/A O
slice, O N/A O
the O N/A O
street-corner O N/A O
slice, O N/A O
the O N/A O
slice O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
common O N/A O

and O N/A O

The O N/A O

and O N/A O
its O N/A O
heftier O N/A O

the O N/A O

Today, O N/A O
serious O N/A O

hobbyists O N/A O
talk O N/A O
about O N/A O
their O N/A O
favorite O N/A O

off O N/A O
the O N/A O

North O N/A O

still O N/A O
the O N/A O
center O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O

with O N/A O
L'Industrie O N/A O

Paulie O N/A O

Slice O N/A O
Shop O N/A O
in O N/A O
Greenpoint, O N/A O
Brooklyn, O N/A O
but O N/A O
the O N/A O
forward-thinking O N/A O
slice O N/A O
is O N/A O
found O N/A O
in O N/A O
Manhattan, O N/A O
too, O N/A O
at O N/A O
Scarr's O N/A O

The O N/A O
goal O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
neoclassicists O N/A O
is, O N/A O
essentially, O N/A O
to O N/A O
return O N/A O
to O N/A O
the O N/A O
golden O N/A O
age O N/A O
of O N/A O
New O N/A O

takeout O N/A O
pizza, O N/A O
which O N/A O
survives O N/A O
at O N/A O

like O N/A O

of O N/A O

Paulie O N/A O
Gee's O N/A O
Slice O N/A O
Shop, O N/A O
Scarr's O N/A O
and O N/A O
other O N/A O
neoclassicist O N/A O
joints O N/A O
cultivate O N/A O
a O N/A O
self-consciously O N/A O
vintage O N/A O
atmosphere, O N/A O
styling O N/A O
their O N/A O
logos O N/A O
and O N/A O
signs O N/A O
and O N/A O
interiors O N/A O
so O N/A O
they O N/A O
look O N/A O
like O N/A O
a O N/A O
place O N/A O
where O N/A O
Johnny O N/A O
Boy O N/A O
and O N/A O
Charlie O N/A O
in O N/A O
"Mean O N/A O

might O N/A O
have O N/A O
gone O N/A O
for O N/A O
a O N/A O
pepperoni O N/A O
slice O N/A O
and O N/A O
a O N/A O
Coke. O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
Tuttolomondo O N/A O
does O N/A O
not O N/A O
fetishize O N/A O
the O N/A O
past. O N/A O
Perhaps O N/A O
this O N/A O
is O N/A O
because O N/A O
he O N/A O
lived O N/A O
it. O N/A O
For O N/A O
almost O N/A O
60 O N/A O
years O N/A O
his O N/A O
family O N/A O
has O N/A O
owned O N/A O
a O N/A O
series O N/A O
of O N/A O
old-school O N/A O
slice O N/A O
joints O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
neighborhood. O N/A O
The O N/A O
current O N/A O
incarnation O N/A O
is O N/A O
literally O N/A O
on O N/A O
a O N/A O
street O N/A O
corner, O N/A O
at O N/A O
the O N/A O
intersection O N/A O
of O N/A O
106th O N/A O
Street O N/A O
and O N/A O
Amsterdam O N/A O
Avenue. O N/A O
It O N/A O
is O N/A O
called O N/A O
Mama's O N/A O
Pizza O N/A O
. O N/A O
He O N/A O
didn't O N/A O
open O N/A O
Mama's O N/A O
Too O N/A O
a O N/A O
block O N/A O
away O N/A O
to O N/A O
outdo O N/A O
his O N/A O
parents; O N/A O
he's O N/A O
bringing O N/A O
their O N/A O
product O N/A O
into O N/A O
a O N/A O
new O N/A O
era. O N/A O
If O N/A O
the O N/A O
neoclassicists O N/A O
are O N/A O
like O N/A O
the O N/A O
folk O N/A O
revivalists O N/A O
who O N/A O
collected O N/A O
old O N/A O
acoustic O N/A O
78s, O N/A O
he O N/A O
is O N/A O
Dylan O N/A O
at O N/A O
the O N/A O
Newport O N/A O
Folk O N/A O
Festival O N/A O
in O N/A O
1965. O N/A O
When O N/A O
Mama's O N/A O
Too O N/A O
opened O N/A O
in O N/A O
December, O N/A O
it O N/A O
also O N/A O
served O N/A O
housemade O N/A O
pasta. O N/A O
It's O N/A O
still O N/A O
on O N/A O
the O N/A O
menu O N/A O
board O N/A O
that O N/A O
hangs O N/A O
on O N/A O
one O N/A O
wall, O N/A O
but O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
Tuttolomondo O N/A O
has O N/A O
stopped O N/A O
serving O N/A O
it O N/A O
to O N/A O
concentrate O N/A O
on O N/A O
pizza. O N/A O
Besides O N/A O
the O N/A O
house O N/A O
slice, O N/A O
he O N/A O
also O N/A O
makes O N/A O
squares O N/A O
that O N/A O
he O N/A O
sees O N/A O
as O N/A O
a O N/A O
marriage O N/A O
of O N/A O
rectangular O N/A O
Sicilian O N/A O
pizza O N/A O
with O N/A O
Roman O N/A O
pizza O N/A O
al O N/A O
taglio. O N/A O
The O N/A O
crust O N/A O
is O N/A O
much O N/A O
taller O N/A O
than O N/A O
the O N/A O
Roman O N/A O
style, O N/A O
and O N/A O
taller O N/A O
than O N/A O
some O N/A O
Sicilians, O N/A O
too, O N/A O
but O N/A O
it O N/A O
is O N/A O
airy O N/A O
and O N/A O
chewy. O N/A O
On O N/A O
the O N/A O
bottom O N/A O
it O N/A O
has O N/A O
the O N/A O
bronze O N/A O
color, O N/A O
the O N/A O
cratered O N/A O
surface O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
pan-fried O N/A O
crunch O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
bread O N/A O
on O N/A O
a O N/A O
grilled O N/A O
cheese O N/A O
sandwich. O N/A O
The O N/A O
edges, O N/A O
where O N/A O
the O N/A O
dough O N/A O
meets O N/A O
the O N/A O
pan, O N/A O
have O N/A O
a O N/A O
gold O N/A O
fringe O N/A O
of O N/A O
browned O N/A O
cheese, O N/A O
known O N/A O
among O N/A O
students O N/A O
of O N/A O
pizza O N/A O
styles O N/A O
as O N/A O
a O N/A O
"frico O N/A O
crust." O N/A O
This O N/A O
fringe O N/A O
is, O N/A O
of O N/A O
course, O N/A O
crunchy O N/A O
and O N/A O
delicious. O N/A O
The O N/A O
most O N/A O
impressive O N/A O
square O N/A O
is, O N/A O
I O N/A O
think, O N/A O
the O N/A O
pepperoni. O N/A O
Unlike O N/A O
most O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
others, O N/A O
it O N/A O
incorporates O N/A O
tomato O N/A O
sauce. O N/A O
The O N/A O
mozzarella O N/A O
is O N/A O
baked O N/A O
until O N/A O
it O N/A O
begins O N/A O
to O N/A O
brown. O N/A O
The O N/A O
pepperoni O N/A O
slices O N/A O
are O N/A O
small O N/A O
and O N/A O
concave, O N/A O
like O N/A O
contact O N/A O
lenses O N/A O
made O N/A O
of O N/A O
meat. O N/A O
Crunchy O N/A O
around O N/A O
the O N/A O
rims, O N/A O
these O N/A O
little O N/A O
cups O N/A O
are O N/A O
half-filled O N/A O
with O N/A O
spicy O N/A O
red O N/A O
oil. O N/A O
It O N/A O
may O N/A O
sound O N/A O
as O N/A O
if O N/A O
I O N/A O
approached O N/A O
this O N/A O
slice O N/A O
with O N/A O
cool, O N/A O
analytical O N/A O
detachment. O N/A O
The O N/A O
truth O N/A O
is O N/A O
I O N/A O
ripped O N/A O
into O N/A O
it O N/A O
like O N/A O
a O N/A O
pack O N/A O
of O N/A O
hyenas. O N/A O
The O N/A O
other O N/A O
squares O N/A O
tend O N/A O
to O N/A O
be O N/A O
white O N/A O
pies O N/A O
with O N/A O
toppings. O N/A O
Again, O N/A O
tomato O N/A O
sauce O N/A O
is O N/A O
one O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
toppings. O N/A O
In O N/A O
one O N/A O
case O N/A O
it's O N/A O
a O N/A O
thick O N/A O
and O N/A O
creamy O N/A O
layer O N/A O
of O N/A O
vodka O N/A O
sauce, O N/A O
one O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
ideas O N/A O
that O N/A O
separates O N/A O
Mama's O N/A O
Too O N/A O
from O N/A O
the O N/A O
neoclassicists. O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
Tuttolomondo O N/A O
also O N/A O
makes O N/A O
a O N/A O
cacio O N/A O
e O N/A O
pepe O N/A O
Sicilian O N/A O
pie, O N/A O
essentially O N/A O
a O N/A O
four-cheese O N/A O
pizza O N/A O
in O N/A O
which O N/A O
one O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
cheeses O N/A O
is O N/A O
pecorino; O N/A O
the O N/A O
whole O N/A O
slice O N/A O
hums O N/A O
with O N/A O
black O N/A O
pepper. O N/A O
The O N/A O
square O N/A O
topped O N/A O
with O N/A O
Gorgonzola O N/A O
dolce O N/A O
and O N/A O
pears O N/A O
works O N/A O
in O N/A O
a O N/A O
way O N/A O
that O N/A O
combination O N/A O
often O N/A O
doesn't, O N/A O
although O N/A O
half O N/A O
a O N/A O
slice O N/A O
was O N/A O
enough O N/A O
for O N/A O
me. O N/A O
The O N/A O
shop O N/A O
is O N/A O
small, O N/A O
and O N/A O
if O N/A O
you O N/A O
sit O N/A O

When O O N/A

up O O N/A
at O O N/A

odds O O N/A

many O O N/A
that O O N/A
the O O N/A

from O O N/A

in O O N/A
the O O N/A

that O O N/A
on O O N/A
days O O N/A

the O O N/A

quick O O N/A
trip O O N/A
of O O N/A
hand O O N/A

mouth, O O N/A
a O O N/A
sharp O O N/A

and O O N/A
an O O N/A
appraising O O N/A

decide O O N/A
if O O N/A
that O O N/A

is O O N/A
ready O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
pulled O O N/A
from O O N/A

Some O O N/A

their O O N/A

over O O N/A
pasta O O N/A
by O O N/A

Ms. O O N/A

likes O O N/A

to O O N/A
have O O N/A
body O O N/A
and O O N/A
heft, O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
chew O O N/A

is O O N/A
the O O N/A
most O O N/A
reliable O O N/A
way O O N/A
to O O N/A
tell O O N/A
when O O N/A
thick O O N/A
pasta O O N/A
like O O N/A
that O O N/A
is O O N/A
ready. O O N/A
You O O N/A
are O O N/A
very O O N/A
unlikely O O N/A
to O O N/A
get O O N/A
a O O N/A
piece O O N/A
that O O N/A
is O O N/A
undercooked O O N/A
at O O N/A
its O O N/A
core, O O N/A
or O O N/A
one O O N/A
that O O N/A
doesn't O O N/A
fight O O N/A
back O O N/A
enough O O N/A
to O O N/A
let O O N/A
you O O N/A
know O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
still O O N/A
alive. O O N/A
You O O N/A
get O O N/A
this O O N/A
just-in-between O O N/A

in O O N/A
the O O N/A
stubs O O N/A
of O O N/A

with O O N/A
a O O N/A

that's O O N/A
been O O N/A
stewed O O N/A
with O O N/A
whole O O N/A

-- O O N/A
30 O O N/A

a O O N/A
batch, O O N/A
according O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu. O O N/A
You O O N/A
get O O N/A
it O O N/A
again O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
corzetti, O O N/A

about O O N/A

In O O N/A
October, O O N/A
Misi O O N/A
served O O N/A
these O O N/A
ridged O O N/A
coins O O N/A
with O O N/A
another O O N/A
tomato O O N/A
sauce, O O N/A
this O O N/A
one O O N/A
barely O O N/A
cooked, O O N/A
just O O N/A
some O O N/A
Sungold O O N/A
tomatoes O O N/A
warmed O O N/A
until O O N/A
they O O N/A
broke O O N/A
open O O N/A
and O O N/A
their O O N/A
yellow O O N/A
pulp O O N/A
spilled O O N/A
out. O O N/A
Fresh O O N/A
basil, O O N/A
thyme O O N/A
and O O N/A
chervil O O N/A
were O O N/A
scattered O O N/A
over O O N/A
the O O N/A
top, O O N/A
as O O N/A
good O O N/A
an O O N/A
illustration O O N/A
as O O N/A
any O O N/A
of O O N/A
how O O N/A
Ms. O O N/A
Robbins O O N/A
makes O O N/A
her O O N/A
food O O N/A
stand O O N/A
out O O N/A
without O O N/A
deviating O O N/A
from O O N/A
an O O N/A
Italian O O N/A
reliance O O N/A
on O O N/A
simple, O O N/A
unmanipulated O O N/A
ingredients. O O N/A
But O O N/A
to O O N/A
call O O N/A
Misi O O N/A
a O O N/A
pasta O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
would O O N/A
be O O N/A
to O O N/A
overlook O O N/A
its O O N/A
highly O O N/A
impressive O O N/A
work O O N/A
with O O N/A
vegetables. O O N/A
They O O N/A
are O O N/A
the O O N/A
subject O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu's O O N/A
other O O N/A
half, O O N/A
sneakily O O N/A
headlined O O N/A
"antipasti." O O N/A
This O O N/A
is O O N/A
where O O N/A
you O O N/A
will O O N/A
find O O N/A
a O O N/A
globe O O N/A
eggplant O O N/A
roasted O O N/A
until O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
as O O N/A
soft O O N/A
and O O N/A
easy O O N/A
to O O N/A
spread O O N/A
as O O N/A
cream O O N/A
cheese; O O N/A
the O O N/A
cut O O N/A
surfaces O O N/A
are O O N/A
dressed O O N/A
with O O N/A
Calabrian O O N/A
chiles, O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
taste O O N/A
of O O N/A
lemon O O N/A
juice O O N/A
seems O O N/A
to O O N/A
have O O N/A
found O O N/A
its O O N/A
way O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
center O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
eggplant. O O N/A
There O O N/A
are O O N/A
fleshy O O N/A
and O O N/A
firm O O N/A
chanterelles, O O N/A
too, O O N/A
lightly O O N/A
pickled O O N/A
and O O N/A
preserved O O N/A
in O O N/A
olive O O N/A
oil O O N/A
until O O N/A
they're O O N/A
brought O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
table O O N/A
crisscrossed O O N/A
with O O N/A
rosemary O O N/A
needles. O O N/A
Grilled O O N/A
runner O O N/A
beans O O N/A
with O O N/A
garlic O O N/A
and O O N/A
chiles O O N/A
have O O N/A
been O O N/A
around O O N/A
lately, O O N/A
too, O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
big O O N/A
heap O O N/A
that O O N/A
I O O N/A
would O O N/A
have O O N/A
enjoyed O O N/A
more O O N/A
if O O N/A
a O O N/A
few O O N/A
stringy, O O N/A
leathery O O N/A
beans O O N/A
had O O N/A
not O O N/A
gotten O O N/A
past O O N/A
the O O N/A
inspectors O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
kitchen. O O N/A
Like O O N/A
the O O N/A
pastas, O O N/A
Misi's O O N/A
vegetables O O N/A
tend O O N/A
to O O N/A
bring O O N/A
together O O N/A
only O O N/A
a O O N/A
few O O N/A
ingredients, O O N/A
often O O N/A
applied O O N/A
in O O N/A
ways O O N/A
you O O N/A
don't O O N/A
quite O O N/A
expect. O O N/A
I O O N/A
don't O O N/A
know O O N/A
where O O N/A
else O O N/A
you O O N/A
will O O N/A
taste O O N/A
pistachios O O N/A
and O O N/A
anchovies O O N/A
combined O O N/A
with O O N/A
skinny, O O N/A
leaf-bud-green O O N/A
leeks O O N/A
marinated O O N/A
in O O N/A
vinegar, O O N/A
or O O N/A
a O O N/A
kind O O N/A
of O O N/A
panzanella O O N/A
made O O N/A
with O O N/A
grilled O O N/A
bread, O O N/A
capers, O O N/A
fresh O O N/A
oregano O O N/A
and O O N/A
chunks O O N/A
of O O N/A
zucchini O O N/A
that O O N/A
are O O N/A
still O O N/A
tender O O N/A
after O O N/A
a O O N/A
quick O O N/A
poaching O O N/A
in O O N/A
olive O O N/A
oil. O O N/A
And O O N/A
though O O N/A
the O O N/A
gently O O N/A
roasted O O N/A
tomatoes O O N/A
won't O O N/A
come O O N/A
back O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu O O N/A
until O O N/A
next O O N/A
summer, O O N/A
you O O N/A
can O O N/A
try O O N/A
imagining O O N/A
how O O N/A
their O O N/A
dusting O O N/A
of O O N/A
fennel O O N/A
seeds O O N/A
and O O N/A
cracked O O N/A
coriander O O N/A
seeds O O N/A
responds O O N/A
to O O N/A
a O O N/A
last-minute O O N/A
squirt O O N/A
of O O N/A
spicy O O N/A
honey. O O N/A
There O O N/A
are O O N/A
enough O O N/A
of O O N/A
these O O N/A
vegetables, O O N/A
and O O N/A
enough O O N/A
meatless O O N/A
pastas, O O N/A
that O O N/A
a O O N/A
vegetarian O O N/A
could O O N/A
eat O O N/A
extremely O O N/A
well O O N/A
at O O N/A
Misi O O N/A
just O O N/A
by O O N/A
watching O O N/A
out O O N/A
for O O N/A
things O O N/A
like O O N/A
bottarga O O N/A
and O O N/A
staying O O N/A
away O O N/A
entirely O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A
creamy O O N/A
pork O O N/A
sugo O O N/A
tossed O O N/A
with O O N/A
strangozzi. O O N/A
(Meat O O N/A
eaters, O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
other O O N/A
hand, O O N/A
may O O N/A
find O O N/A
the O O N/A
sugo O O N/A
helps O O N/A
restore O O N/A
chafed O O N/A
nerves.) O O N/A
Although O O N/A
Misi O O N/A
doesn't O O N/A
let O O N/A
its O O N/A
kitchen O O N/A
range O O N/A
as O O N/A
widely O O N/A
as O O N/A
Lilia's, O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
more O O N/A
successful O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
in O O N/A
several O O N/A
ways. O O N/A
The O O N/A
menu O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
distilled O O N/A
down O O N/A
to O O N/A
essentials, O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
whole O O N/A
enterprise O O N/A
seems O O N/A
more O O N/A
carefully O O N/A
thought O O N/A
through. O O N/A
The O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
is O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
ground O O N/A
floor O O N/A
of O O N/A
a O O N/A
new O O N/A
apartment O O N/A
building O O N/A
by O O N/A
SHoP O O N/A
Architects O O N/A
, O O N/A
who O O N/A
chose O O N/A
to O O N/A
leave O O N/A
a O O N/A
hole O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
middle O O N/A
that O O N/A
you O O N/A
could O O N/A
fly O O N/A
a O O N/A
helicopter O O N/A
through. O O N/A
The O O N/A
developer, O O N/A
Two O O N/A
Trees O O N/A
, O O N/A
recruited O O N/A
Ms. O O N/A
Robbins O O N/A
and O O N/A
her O O N/A
business O O N/A
partner, O O N/A
Sean O O N/A
Feeney, O O N/A
and O O N/A
gave O O N/A
them O O N/A
a O O N/A
chance O O N/A
to O O N/A
build O O N/A
the O O N/A
virgin O O N/A
space O O N/A
to O O N/A
their O O N/A
needs. O O N/A
The O O N/A
acoustics O O N/A
are O O N/A
better O O N/A
than O O N/A
at O O N/A
Lilia, O O N/A
and O O N/A
traffic O O N/A
between O O N/A
tables O O N/A
flows O O N/A
more O O N/A
smoothly. O O N/A
The O O N/A
interior O O N/A
is O O N/A
unusually O O N/A
good, O O N/A
with O O N/A
narrow O O N/A
horizontal O O N/A
wall O O N/A
tiles O O N/A
in O O N/A
white O O N/A
and O O N/A
nooks O O N/A
for O O N/A
stacked O O N/A
plates O O N/A
that O O N/A
make O O N/A
them O O N/A
part O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
décor. O O N/A
As O O N/A
at O O N/A
Lilia, O O N/A
the O O N/A
wine O O N/A
list O O N/A
practically O O N/A
begs O O N/A
you O O N/A
to O O N/A
take O O N/A
something O O N/A
new O O N/A
for O O N/A
a O O N/A
whirl: O O N/A
a O O N/A
catarratto O O N/A
from O O N/A
Sicily, O O N/A
a O O N/A
Corsican O O N/A
niellucciu, O O N/A
or O O N/A
a O O N/A
croatina-ughetta O O N/A
blend O O N/A
from O O N/A
Lombardy O O N/A
softened O O N/A
with O O N/A
some O O N/A
uva O O N/A
rara. O O N/A
Of O O N/A
course, O O N/A
you O O N/A
could O O N/A
stick O O N/A
to O O N/A
a O O N/A
$45 O O N/A
Lambrusco, O O N/A
or O O N/A
get O O N/A
a O O N/A
$250 O O N/A
Champagne O O N/A
from O O N/A
David O O N/A
Léclapart, O O N/A
after O O N/A
which O O N/A
you O O N/A
can O O N/A
try O O N/A
flying O O N/A
through O O N/A
the O O N/A
hole O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
building O O N/A
yourself. O O N/A
If O O N/A
we O O N/A
are O O N/A
striving O O N/A
for O O N/A
total O O N/A
accuracy, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
we O O N/A
need O O N/A
to O O N/A
call O O N/A
Misi O O N/A
a O O N/A
pasta-vegetables-and-gelato O O N/A
restaurant. O O N/A
Its O O N/A
gelato O O N/A
is O O N/A
made O O N/A
in O O N/A
house; O O N/A
there O O N/A
are O O N/A
about O O N/A
six O O N/A
kinds O O N/A
at O O N/A
any O O N/A
given O O N/A
moment. O O N/A
The O O N/A
flavors O O N/A
open O O N/A
up O O N/A
right O O N/A
away, O O N/A
in O O N/A
part O O N/A
because O O N/A
Misi O O N/A
serves O O N/A
them O O N/A
just O O N/A
below O O N/A
the O O N/A
melting O O N/A
point O O N/A
and O O N/A
in O O N/A
part O O N/A
because O O N/A
the O O N/A
ingredients O O N/A
are O O N/A
used O O N/A
prodigally. O O N/A
There O O N/A
are O O N/A
a O O N/A
lot O O N/A
of O O N/A
almonds O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
almond, O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
espresso O O N/A
could O O N/A
keep O O N/A
you O O N/A
up O O N/A
an O O N/A
extra O O N/A
hour. O O N/A
But O O N/A
even O O N/A
the O O N/A
unflavored O O N/A
fior O O N/A
di O O N/A
latte, O O N/A
made O O N/A
with O O N/A
milk, O O N/A
cream O O N/A
and O O N/A
sugar, O O N/A
comes O O N/A
at O O N/A
you O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
rush. O O N/A
There O O N/A
are O O N/A
no O O N/A
desserts O O N/A
other O O N/A
than O O N/A
gelato. O O N/A
The O O N/A
only O O N/A

to O O N/A

at O O N/A

the O O N/A
kind O O N/A
of O O N/A
Indian O O N/A
food O O N/A
the O O N/A

has O O N/A
been O O N/A
hungry O O N/A

or O O N/A
at O O N/A
least O O N/A
the O O N/A
kind O O N/A
that O O N/A
I'd O O N/A
been O O N/A
hungry O O N/A
for: O O N/A
made O O N/A
with O O N/A
care O O N/A
but O O N/A
no O O N/A
pretense; O O N/A
seasoned O O N/A
for O O N/A
people O O N/A
who O O N/A
love O O N/A
the O O N/A
interplay O O N/A
of O O N/A
spices; O O N/A
presented O O N/A
without O O N/A
apology O O N/A
in O O N/A
all O O N/A
its O O N/A
brown, O O N/A
lumpy O O N/A
glory; O O N/A
and O O N/A
complex O O N/A
in O O N/A
ways O O N/A
that O O N/A
demand O O N/A
full O O N/A
attention. O O N/A
Adda O O N/A

Indian O O N/A

Mazumdar, O O N/A
who O O N/A

it, O O N/A
and O O N/A
Chintan O O N/A
Pandya, O O N/A
who O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
chef. O O N/A
The O O N/A
two O O N/A
men O O N/A
already O O N/A
run O O N/A
Rahi O O N/A
, O O N/A
in O O N/A
Greenwich O O N/A
Village, O O N/A
perhaps O O N/A
the O O N/A
best O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
casual, O O N/A
modernizing O O N/A
Indian O O N/A
restaurants, O O N/A
where O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Pandya O O N/A
serves O O N/A
original O O N/A
notions O O N/A
like O O N/A
tandoori O O N/A
skate O O N/A
and O O N/A
sends O O N/A
almost O O N/A
everything O O N/A
out O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
kitchen O O N/A
decorated O O N/A
with O O N/A
edible O O N/A
flowers. O O N/A
They've O O N/A
taken O O N/A
another O O N/A
angle O O N/A
at O O N/A
Adda, O O N/A
mining O O N/A
family O O N/A
recipes O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
lessons O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Pandya O O N/A
absorbed O O N/A
from O O N/A
civilian O O N/A
cooks O O N/A
around O O N/A
India. O O N/A
The O O N/A
menu O O N/A
travels O O N/A
beyond O O N/A
the O O N/A
standard O O N/A
north O O N/A
Indian O O N/A
dishes O O N/A
most O O N/A
New O O N/A
Yorkers O O N/A
already O O N/A
know, O O N/A
but O O N/A
even O O N/A
those O O N/A
dishes, O O N/A
when O O N/A
they O O N/A
appear, O O N/A
are O O N/A
prepared O O N/A
so O O N/A
emphatically O O N/A
that O O N/A
they O O N/A
don't O O N/A
resemble O O N/A
anything O O N/A
else O O N/A
in O O N/A
town. O O N/A
Adda O O N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
lusty, O O N/A
full-throated O O N/A
defense O O N/A
of O O N/A
traditional O O N/A
cooking. O O N/A
Saag O O N/A
paneer, O O N/A
the O O N/A
grayest O O N/A
of O O N/A
old O O N/A
gray O O N/A
mares O O N/A
in O O N/A
many O O N/A
Indian O O N/A
restaurants, O O N/A
is O O N/A
coltishly O O N/A
energetic O O N/A
at O O N/A
Adda. O O N/A
The O O N/A
cheese O O N/A
is O O N/A
made O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
kitchen, O O N/A
and O O N/A
it's O O N/A
gorgeously O O N/A
soft, O O N/A
while O O N/A
the O O N/A
saag O O N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
tart O O N/A
and O O N/A
peppery O O N/A
mix O O N/A
of O O N/A
wilted O O N/A
arugula, O O N/A
sorrel, O O N/A
spinach O O N/A
and O O N/A
mustard O O N/A
greens. O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Pandya O O N/A
does O O N/A
very O O N/A
well O O N/A
by O O N/A
the O O N/A
class O O N/A
of O O N/A
sidewalk O O N/A
treats O O N/A
called O O N/A
chaat. O O N/A
Each O O N/A
delivers O O N/A
the O O N/A
messy O O N/A
riot O O N/A
you'd O O N/A
hope O O N/A
for, O O N/A
busy O O N/A
with O O N/A
crunchy O O N/A
hieroglyphs O O N/A
of O O N/A
fried O O N/A
noodles O O N/A
and O O N/A
splattered O O N/A
with O O N/A
yogurt O O N/A
and O O N/A
tamarind O O N/A
sauce. O O N/A
One O O N/A
chaat O O N/A
is O O N/A
anchored O O N/A
by O O N/A
a O O N/A
big O O N/A
kale O O N/A
fritter, O O N/A
another O O N/A
by O O N/A
several O O N/A
smaller O O N/A
chips O O N/A
of O O N/A
battered, O O N/A
spiced O O N/A
lentil O O N/A
cakes, O O N/A
and O O N/A
a O O N/A
third O O N/A
by O O N/A
fried O O N/A
smashed O O N/A
potatoes O O N/A
and O O N/A
chickpeas. O O N/A
But O O N/A
discerning O O N/A
chaat O O N/A
lovers O O N/A
should O O N/A
probably O O N/A
go O O N/A
directly O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
dahi O O N/A
batata O O N/A
puri, O O N/A
soft O O N/A
potato O O N/A
packed O O N/A
into O O N/A
hollow O O N/A
globes O O N/A
of O O N/A
fried O O N/A
dough O O N/A
that O O N/A
you O O N/A
can O O N/A
pick O O N/A
up O O N/A
and O O N/A
eat O O N/A
with O O N/A
your O O N/A
fingers, O O N/A
like O O N/A
chocolates. O O N/A
Anything O O N/A
that O O N/A
passes O O N/A
through O O N/A
Adda's O O N/A
tandoor O O N/A
is O O N/A
worth O O N/A
investigating. O O N/A
Seekh O O N/A
kebabs, O O N/A
made O O N/A
with O O N/A
lamb O O N/A
that's O O N/A
coarsely O O N/A
ground O O N/A
by O O N/A
hand, O O N/A
come O O N/A
out O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
tandoor O O N/A
juicier O O N/A
and O O N/A
pinker O O N/A
than O O N/A
the O O N/A
usual; O O N/A
Mumbai-style O O N/A
tandoori O O N/A
macchi, O O N/A
a O O N/A
skewered O O N/A
pompano O O N/A
rubbed O O N/A
with O O N/A
ground O O N/A
mustard O O N/A
seeds O O N/A
and O O N/A
cilantro, O O N/A
is O O N/A
lightly O O N/A
charred O O N/A
and O O N/A
smoky O O N/A
after O O N/A
roasting, O O N/A
but O O N/A
still O O N/A
moist; O O N/A
bhatti O O N/A
da O O N/A
murgh, O O N/A
a O O N/A
double-marinated O O N/A
chicken O O N/A
thigh O O N/A
and O O N/A
drumstick, O O N/A
is O O N/A
so O O N/A
thickly O O N/A
crusted O O N/A
with O O N/A
coriander O O N/A
and O O N/A
cumin O O N/A
that O O N/A
it O O N/A
crunches O O N/A
when O O N/A
you O O N/A
bite O O N/A
it. O O N/A
My O O N/A
server O O N/A
expressed O O N/A
an O O N/A
enthusiasm O O N/A
about O O N/A
the O O N/A
poussin O O N/A
-- O O N/A
plunged O O N/A
into O O N/A
the O O N/A
tandoor O O N/A
in O O N/A
one O O N/A
piece O O N/A
after O O N/A
marinating O O N/A
in O O N/A
vinegar, O O N/A
yogurt, O O N/A
fresh O O N/A
red O O N/A
chiles O O N/A
and O O N/A
kala O O N/A
namak, O O N/A
the O O N/A
sulfurous O O N/A
black O O N/A
salt O O N/A
of O O N/A
India O O N/A
-- O O N/A
that O O N/A
you O O N/A
typically O O N/A
find O O N/A
in O O N/A
new O O N/A
converts O O N/A
to O O N/A
a O O N/A
cult. O O N/A
After O O N/A
tasting O O N/A
it, O O N/A
I O O N/A
was O O N/A
ready O O N/A
to O O N/A
join. O O N/A
He O O N/A
was O O N/A
enthusiastic O O N/A
about O O N/A
almost O O N/A
everything, O O N/A
as O O N/A
it O O N/A
turned O O N/A
out; O O N/A
the O O N/A
service O O N/A
at O O N/A
Adda O O N/A
is O O N/A
nothing O O N/A
if O O N/A
not O O N/A
eager O O N/A
to O O N/A
talk O O N/A
up O O N/A
the O O N/A
food. O O N/A
(Getting O O N/A
your O O N/A
water O O N/A
glass O O N/A
refilled O O N/A
is O O N/A
another O O N/A
story.) O O N/A
Placing O O N/A
a O O N/A
dish O O N/A
of O O N/A
yogurt O O N/A
and O O N/A
pomegranate O O N/A
seeds O O N/A
next O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
goat O O N/A
biryani O O N/A
that O O N/A
is O O N/A
steamed O O N/A
under O O N/A
a O O N/A
lid O O N/A
of O O N/A
dough, O O N/A
he O O N/A
said, O O N/A
"This O O N/A
is O O N/A
going O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
your O O N/A
best O O N/A
friend O O N/A
when O O N/A
the O O N/A
spice O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
biryani O O N/A
starts O O N/A
to O O N/A
hit O O N/A
you." O O N/A
It O O N/A
was, O O N/A
in O O N/A
fact, O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
fiercest O O N/A
biryanis O O N/A
I've O O N/A
ever O O N/A
met, O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
yogurt O O N/A
tamed O O N/A
it O O N/A
so O O N/A
that O O N/A
I O O N/A
could O O N/A
taste O O N/A
the O O N/A
tender O O N/A
goat O O N/A
meat O O N/A
and O O N/A
crisp, O O N/A
bittersweet O O N/A
fried O O N/A
onions. O O N/A
Few O O N/A
things O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu O O N/A
are O O N/A
quite O O N/A
as O O N/A
chile-drenched O O N/A
as O O N/A
the O O N/A
biryani, O O N/A
but O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Pandya O O N/A
definitely O O N/A
favors O O N/A
India's O O N/A
more O O N/A
intense O O N/A
flavors. O O N/A
Adda O O N/A
is O O N/A
not O O N/A
big O O N/A
on O O N/A
soft-spoken O O N/A
cream O O N/A
sauces; O O N/A
the O O N/A
coconut O O N/A
milk O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
Malvani O O N/A
prawn O O N/A
curry O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A
South O O N/A
Konkan O O N/A
coast, O O N/A
for O O N/A
instance, O O N/A
has O O N/A
a O O N/A
pronounced O O N/A
kick. O O N/A
(It's O O N/A
very O O N/A
good O O N/A
if O O N/A
you O O N/A
get O O N/A
it O O N/A
on O O N/A
a O O N/A
night O O N/A
when O O N/A
the O O N/A
prawns O O N/A
are O O N/A
firm O O N/A
and O O N/A
not O O N/A
spongy.) O O N/A
And O O N/A
while O O N/A
Adda O O N/A
does O O N/A
serve O O N/A
some O O N/A
vegetables, O O N/A
it O O N/A
would O O N/A
not O O N/A
make O O N/A
my O O N/A
list O O N/A

"Like O O N/A

our O O N/A
server O O N/A
said, O O N/A
accurately. O O N/A
I O O N/A
might O O N/A
point O O N/A
out O O N/A
that O O N/A
a O O N/A
typical O O N/A
Indian O O N/A

is O O N/A
drier, O O N/A
with O O N/A
a O O N/A
higher O O N/A
ratio O O N/A
of O O N/A

to O O N/A
sauce. O O N/A
But O O N/A
I O O N/A
would O O N/A
not O O N/A
necessarily O O N/A
mean O O N/A
that O O N/A
as O O N/A

treats O O N/A

to O O N/A

on O O N/A

it O O N/A
safe O O N/A
more O O N/A
often O O N/A
than O O N/A
it O O N/A
should. O O N/A
Like O O N/A
all O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A

restaurants, O O N/A
Saint O O N/A
Julivert O O N/A
toggles O O N/A
between O O N/A
innovation O O N/A
and O O N/A
tradition. O O N/A
But O O N/A
the O O N/A
other O O N/A
places O O N/A
explore O O N/A
Spanish O O N/A
cuisine, O O N/A
so O O N/A
when O O N/A
they O O N/A
toss O O N/A
off O O N/A
a O O N/A
straight-ahead O O N/A
classic O O N/A
like O O N/A
patatas O O N/A

there's O O N/A
a O O N/A
reason. O O N/A
When O O N/A

with O O N/A
yuzu O O N/A

and O O N/A
trout O O N/A
roe, O O N/A
it O O N/A
can O O N/A
seem O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
grasping O O N/A
at O O N/A
ideas O O N/A
that O O N/A
other O O N/A
restaurants O O N/A
are O O N/A
already O O N/A
doing O O N/A
-- O O N/A
even O O N/A
when O O N/A
Saint O O N/A
Julivert O O N/A
does O O N/A
them O O N/A
better. O O N/A
The O O N/A
sautéed O O N/A

not O O N/A

although O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A
time O O N/A
I O O N/A
was O O N/A
very O O N/A
happy O O N/A
to O O N/A
have O O N/A
it, O O N/A
not O O N/A
least O O N/A
because O O N/A
it O O N/A
was O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
few O O N/A
things O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu O O N/A
the O O N/A
size O O N/A
of O O N/A
a O O N/A
standard O O N/A
main O O N/A
course. O O N/A
Even O O N/A
if O O N/A
you're O O N/A
an O O N/A
old O O N/A
hand O O N/A
at O O N/A
navigating O O N/A
the O O N/A
shallow O O N/A
waters O O N/A
of O O N/A
small O O N/A
plates, O O N/A
it O O N/A
can O O N/A
be O O N/A
unnervingly O O N/A
easy O O N/A
to O O N/A
spend O O N/A
more O O N/A
than O O N/A
$100 O O N/A
on O O N/A
food O O N/A
and O O N/A
drinks O O N/A
at O O N/A
Saint O O N/A
Julivert O O N/A
and O O N/A
still O O N/A
wonder O O N/A
whether O O N/A
you've O O N/A
actually O O N/A
had O O N/A
dinner. O O N/A
Seafood O O N/A
this O O N/A
good O O N/A
is O O N/A
expensive, O O N/A
but O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu O O N/A
doesn't O O N/A
stray O O N/A
very O O N/A
far O O N/A
above O O N/A
$20; O O N/A
the O O N/A
result O O N/A
is O O N/A
that O O N/A
portions O O N/A
can O O N/A
seem O O N/A
somewhat O O N/A
airy. O O N/A
When O O N/A
there's O O N/A
an O O N/A
inexpensive O O N/A
opportunity O O N/A
to O O N/A
pad O O N/A
out O O N/A
a O O N/A
dish, O O N/A
Saint O O N/A
Julivert O O N/A
doesn't O O N/A
always O O N/A
take O O N/A
it. O O N/A
I O O N/A
understand O O N/A
why O O N/A
I O O N/A
can't O O N/A
have O O N/A
more O O N/A
than O O N/A
three O O N/A
excellent O O N/A
wild O O N/A
shrimp O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
$21 O O N/A
bowl O O N/A
of O O N/A
red O O N/A
pozole, O O N/A
but O O N/A
couldn't O O N/A
there O O N/A
be O O N/A
more O O N/A
than O O N/A
a O O N/A
spoonful O O N/A
of O O N/A
hominy O O N/A
kernels? O O N/A
Saltines O O N/A
fried O O N/A
in O O N/A
canola O O N/A

are O O N/A
served O O N/A
with O O N/A
the O O N/A
ceviche O O N/A
and O O N/A
with O O N/A
a O O N/A
cold O O N/A
and O O N/A
highly O O N/A
appealing O O N/A
bowl O O N/A
of O O N/A
pickled O O N/A
shrimp O O N/A
under O O N/A
pink O O N/A
pickled O O N/A
onions; O O N/A
grilled O O N/A
bread O O N/A
slices O O N/A
accompany O O N/A
the O O N/A
mackerel O O N/A
whipped O O N/A
into O O N/A
a O O N/A
hummus-like O O N/A
orange O O N/A
spread O O N/A
with O O N/A
piri-piri O O N/A
oil. O O N/A
Still, O O N/A
each O O N/A
time O O N/A
I O O N/A
went, O O N/A
somebody O O N/A
at O O N/A
my O O N/A
table O O N/A
asked O O N/A
for O O N/A
more O O N/A
bread. O O N/A
None O O N/A
of O O N/A
Saint O O N/A
Julivert's O O N/A
issues O O N/A
are O O N/A
insoluble. O O N/A
The O O N/A
lighting O O N/A
could O O N/A
be O O N/A
warmed O O N/A
up O O N/A
so O O N/A
the O O N/A
room O O N/A
looks O O N/A
less O O N/A
like O O N/A
an O O N/A
aquarium. O O N/A
A O O N/A
few O O N/A
more O O N/A
dishes O O N/A
you O O N/A
won't O O N/A
see O O N/A
anywhere O O N/A
else, O O N/A
like O O N/A
the O O N/A
tuna O O N/A
bake, O O N/A
would O O N/A
make O O N/A
it O O N/A
harder O O N/A
to O O N/A
resist. O O N/A
Another O O N/A
two O O N/A
or O O N/A
three O O N/A
large O O N/A
plates O O N/A
would O O N/A
make O O N/A
it O O N/A
a O O N/A
place O O N/A
you O O N/A
think O O N/A
of O O N/A
when O O N/A
you're O O N/A
hungry. O O N/A
The O O N/A
excellent O O N/A
$19 O O N/A
prego O O N/A
sandwich O O N/A
is O O N/A
more O O N/A
snack O O N/A
than O O N/A
dinner, O O N/A
until O O N/A
you O O N/A
pay O O N/A
another O O N/A
$7 O O N/A
to O O N/A
have O O N/A
fried O O N/A
oysters O O N/A
tucked O O N/A
into O O N/A
the O O N/A
roll O O N/A
beside O O N/A
the O O N/A
beef, O O N/A
making O O N/A
it O O N/A
into O O N/A
a O O N/A
kind O O N/A
of O O N/A
crunchy O O N/A
carpetbagger. O O N/A
On O O N/A
the O O N/A
other O O N/A
hand, O O N/A
that's O O N/A
worth O O N/A
doing O O N/A
even O O N/A
if O O N/A

not O O N/A
hungry. O O N/A

Over O O N/A
that O O N/A

for O O N/A
his O O N/A

Less O O N/A
frequently, O O N/A

In O O N/A

one O O N/A
of O O N/A

sued O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A

the O O N/A
Four O B-EST N/A
Seasons O I-EST N/A
, O O N/A
citing O O N/A
sexual O O N/A

She O O N/A
claimed O O N/A
that O O N/A
for O O N/A
more O O N/A
than O O N/A
three O O N/A
years O O N/A
he O O N/A
had O O N/A
repeatedly O O N/A
rubbed O O N/A
up O O N/A

her, O O N/A
told O O N/A
her O O N/A
in O O N/A
vulgar O O N/A

about O O N/A
his O O N/A
sexual O O N/A

and O O N/A
called O O N/A
her O O N/A
"slut," O O N/A
"lesbian" O O N/A
and O O N/A
other O O N/A
things. O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Niccolini O O N/A
denied O O N/A
the O O N/A
charges. O O N/A
In O O N/A
2014, O O N/A
a O O N/A
former O O N/A
assistant O O N/A
manager O O N/A
filed O O N/A
suit O O N/A
against O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A

Mr. O O N/A

the O O N/A
Four O B-EST N/A
Seasons, O I-EST N/A
alleging O O N/A
discrimination. O O N/A
The O O N/A
ex-manager O O N/A
said O O N/A
that O O N/A
after O O N/A
she O O N/A
returned O O N/A
from O O N/A
a O O N/A
maternity O O N/A
leave, O O N/A
the O O N/A

about O O N/A

later, O O N/A
fired O O N/A
her O O N/A

replaced O O N/A
her O O N/A

In O O N/A
a O O N/A
response O O N/A

with O O N/A
the O O N/A
court, O O N/A
the O O N/A
defendants O O N/A
denied O O N/A
the O O N/A
allegations. O O N/A
Both O O N/A
suits O O N/A
were O O N/A
settled O O N/A
under O O N/A
terms O O N/A
that O O N/A
have O O N/A
not O O N/A
been O O N/A
divulged. O O N/A
In O O N/A
2015, O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Niccolini O O N/A
was O O N/A
arrested O O N/A
on O O N/A
a O O N/A
felony O O N/A
charge O O N/A
of O O N/A
sexual O O N/A
abuse. O O N/A
According O O N/A
to O O N/A
a O O N/A
prosecutor, O O N/A
he O O N/A
had O O N/A
attacked O O N/A
a O O N/A
woman O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A
Four B-EST B-EST N/A
Seasons I-EST I-EST N/A

"with O O N/A
such O O N/A
force O O N/A
that O O N/A
he O O N/A
ripped O O N/A

the O O N/A

a O O N/A

give O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A

their O O N/A
money. O O N/A
I O O N/A
understand O O N/A
this. O O N/A
I O O N/A
also O O N/A
know O O N/A
people O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A

who O O N/A
think O O N/A
the O O N/A

should O O N/A

get O O N/A
any O O N/A

as O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A

owns O O N/A
a O O N/A

of O O N/A
it. O O N/A
I O O N/A
understand O O N/A
this, O O N/A
too, O O N/A
but O O N/A
it's O O N/A
not O O N/A
my O O N/A
view. O O N/A
[Julian O O N/A

since O O N/A
been O O N/A
forced O O N/A
to O O N/A
resign O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A

Their O O N/A
stance O O N/A
rests, O O N/A
I O O N/A
think, O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
idea O O N/A
that O O N/A
writing O O N/A
about O O N/A
powerful O O N/A
men O O N/A
who O O N/A
have O O N/A
been O O N/A
accused O O N/A
of O O N/A
abusing O O N/A
women O O N/A
amounts O O N/A
to O O N/A
condoning O O N/A
the O O N/A
abuse O O N/A
and O O N/A
helping O O N/A
the O O N/A
abusers O O N/A
stay O O N/A
in O O N/A
power. O O N/A
While O O N/A
it's O O N/A
true O O N/A
that O O N/A

is O O N/A
often O O N/A
like O O N/A

Even O O N/A
when O O N/A

writing O O N/A
a O O N/A

a O O N/A

often O O N/A
requires O O N/A
weaving O O N/A

with O O N/A

The O O N/A

limited O O N/A

being O O N/A
the O O N/A
Four B-EST B-EST N/A
Seasons, I-EST I-EST N/A
the O O N/A

would O O N/A
have O O N/A
to O O N/A
mention O O N/A
the O O N/A
new O O N/A
restaurant's O O N/A
interior. O O N/A
It O O N/A
reminded O O N/A
me O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
old O O N/A

of O O N/A
there, O O N/A
a O O N/A
trick O O N/A
I O O N/A

was O O N/A
impossible. O O N/A
The O O N/A

transformed O O N/A

the O O N/A

homage O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
vintage O O N/A

used O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A

All O O N/A
of O O N/A
this O O N/A

(the O O N/A

a O O N/A
few O O N/A
hours O O N/A
of O O N/A
celebratory O O N/A
sightseeing O O N/A
of O O N/A

kind O O N/A
that O O N/A

The O O N/A

offers O O N/A
an O O N/A
escape O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A
outside O O N/A
world. O O N/A
Escaping O O N/A
from O O N/A
what's O O N/A
inside, O O N/A
however, O O N/A
takes O O N/A
a O O N/A
mental O O N/A
effort O O N/A
that O O N/A
is O O N/A
beyond O O N/A
me O O N/A
and O O N/A
will O O N/A
probably O O N/A
be O O N/A
beyond O O N/A
many O O N/A
others O O N/A
as O O N/A
well, O O N/A
whether O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A

an O O N/A

requires O O N/A
trust O O N/A
and O O N/A
a O O N/A

of O O N/A

the O O N/A

Mr. O O N/A

that O O N/A

up O O N/A
at O O N/A

before O O N/A
you O O N/A

The O O N/A

seemed O O N/A
eager O O N/A
to O O N/A

but O O N/A
gave O O N/A
the O O N/A
impression O O N/A
of O O N/A
struggling O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
face O O N/A
of O O N/A
unseen O O N/A
enemies. O O N/A
One O O N/A
night, O O N/A
asked O O N/A
"Still O B-FOOD N/A
or O O N/A
sparkling?," O B-FOOD N/A
I O O N/A
chose O O N/A
the O O N/A
sparkling B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
water. I-FOOD I-FOOD N/A
My O O N/A
server O O N/A
began O O N/A
to O O N/A
walk O O N/A
away, O O N/A
then O O N/A
turned O O N/A
on O O N/A
his O O N/A
heel O O N/A
and O O N/A
said, O O N/A
"I'm O O N/A
sorry, O O N/A
we're O O N/A
all O O N/A
out O O N/A
of O O N/A
sparkling." O B-FOOD N/A
"That's O O N/A
fine," O O N/A
I O O N/A
said. O O N/A
"I'll O O N/A
just O O N/A
have O O N/A
the O O N/A
BrewDog B-DISH B-DISH N/A
I.P.A. I-DISH I-DISH N/A
instead." O O N/A
"I O O N/A
apologize," O O N/A
he O O N/A
said. O O N/A
"We O O N/A
don't O O N/A
have O O N/A
any O O N/A
draft O B-FOOD N/A
beer." B-FOOD I-FOOD N/A
After O O N/A
the O O N/A
main O O N/A
course O O N/A
was O O N/A
cleared, O O N/A
I O O N/A
asked O O N/A
him O O N/A
for O O N/A
the O O N/A
Chocolate B-DISH B-DISH N/A
Bluebird. I-DISH I-DISH N/A
"That O O N/A
is O O N/A
our O O N/A
signature O O N/A
dessert," O O N/A
he O O N/A
said. O O N/A
I O O N/A
nodded. O O N/A
I O O N/A
had O O N/A
read O O N/A
that O O N/A
this O O N/A
was O O N/A
a O O N/A
chocolate B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
mousse I-FOOD I-FOOD N/A
inside O O N/A
a O O N/A

once O O N/A
made O O N/A

"Unfortunately, O O N/A
we O O N/A
do O O N/A
not O O N/A
have O O N/A
it O O N/A
tonight," O O N/A
he O O N/A
said. O O N/A
His O O N/A
courtesy O O N/A
went O O N/A
a O O N/A
long O O N/A
way. O O N/A
Ultimately, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
I O O N/A
preferred O O N/A
the O O N/A
blunt O O N/A
approach O O N/A
that O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
bartenders O O N/A
took O O N/A
with O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
my O O N/A
guests. O O N/A
Looking O O N/A
over O O N/A

list O O N/A
of O O N/A
old O O N/A

new O O N/A
cocktails, B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
she O O N/A
asked O O N/A
the O O N/A
bartender O O N/A
which O O N/A
he O O N/A
would O O N/A
recommend. O O N/A
"If O O N/A
you O O N/A
want O O N/A
to O O N/A
drink O O N/A
something O O N/A
that O O N/A
tastes O O N/A
good," O O N/A
he O O N/A
said, O O N/A
"I O O N/A
wouldn't O O N/A
order O O N/A
anything O O N/A
off O O N/A

Each O O N/A
vegetable O O N/A
in O O N/A
this O O N/A
miniature O O N/A
garden O O N/A
is O O N/A
planted O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
purée O O N/A
or O O N/A
a O O N/A
reduced O O N/A
essence O O N/A
of O O N/A
itself. O O N/A
Each O O N/A
is O O N/A
very O O N/A
good, O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
carrots O O N/A
are O O N/A
fantastic. O O N/A
Alongside O O N/A
them O O N/A
sits O O N/A
lamb O O N/A

a O O N/A

little O O N/A

One O O N/A
corner O O N/A
of O O N/A
this O O N/A
brick O O N/A
sits O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
dark-green O O N/A
spread O O N/A
that O O N/A
tastes O O N/A
like O O N/A
gremolata. O O N/A
Not O O N/A
one O O N/A
combination O O N/A
of O O N/A
flavors O O N/A
on O O N/A
this O O N/A

is O O N/A
original, O O N/A
and O O N/A
it O O N/A
doesn't O O N/A

at O O N/A

The O O N/A
Italian O O N/A
food O O N/A
that O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Benno O O N/A
made O O N/A
at O O N/A
his O O N/A
last O O N/A
restaurant, O O N/A
Lincoln O O N/A
Ristorante O O N/A
, O O N/A
could O O N/A
be O O N/A
impressive, O O N/A
but O O N/A
I O O N/A
sometimes O O N/A
had O O N/A
the O O N/A
sense O O N/A
that O O N/A
he O O N/A
was O O N/A
cooking O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A
outside O O N/A
in, O O N/A
trying O O N/A
to O O N/A
unlock O O N/A
the O O N/A
flavors O O N/A
of O O N/A
Italy O O N/A
through O O N/A
process O O N/A
and O O N/A
method. O O N/A
The O O N/A
results O O N/A
didn't O O N/A
always O O N/A
match O O N/A
the O O N/A
evident O O N/A
effort. O O N/A
I O O N/A
still O O N/A
got O O N/A
a O O N/A
bit O O N/A
of O O N/A
that O O N/A
feeling O O N/A
from O O N/A
his O O N/A
food O O N/A
at O O N/A
Leonelli O O N/A
Taberna O O N/A
, O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
back O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
Evelyn O O N/A
lobby. O O N/A
It's O O N/A
supposed O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
the O O N/A
hotel's O O N/A
casual O O N/A
Italian O O N/A
restaurant, O O N/A
and O O N/A
it O O N/A
would O O N/A
be O O N/A
if O O N/A
you O O N/A
didn't O O N/A
sometimes O O N/A
catch O O N/A
the O O N/A
food O O N/A

to O O N/A
relax. O O N/A

doesn't O O N/A
appear O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
plagued O O N/A
by O O N/A
a O O N/A
similar O O N/A
anxiety. O O N/A

have O O N/A
an O O N/A
easy O O N/A
inevitability. O O N/A
Pasta O O N/A
is O O N/A
unlikely O O N/A
to O O N/A
become O O N/A
the O O N/A
thing O O N/A
Benno O O N/A
is O O N/A
known O O N/A
for. O O N/A
Still, O O N/A
when O O N/A
the O O N/A
kitchen O O N/A
stretches O O N/A
to O O N/A
Italy, O O N/A
nice O O N/A
things O O N/A
happen. O O N/A

diavolo, O O N/A
with O O N/A
the O O N/A
bent O O N/A

is O O N/A
a O O N/A
tribute O O N/A
to O O N/A
an O O N/A
American O O N/A
pop O O N/A
hit O O N/A
made O O N/A
over, O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
Thomas O O N/A
Keller O O N/A
tradition, O O N/A
with O O N/A
maximum O O N/A
clarity O O N/A
and O O N/A
precision. O O N/A
Spaghetti O O N/A
made O O N/A
with O O N/A
grano O O N/A
arso, O O N/A
or O O N/A
burned-wheat O O N/A
flour, O O N/A
tasted O O N/A
pleasantly O O N/A
toasted O O N/A
rather O O N/A
than O O N/A
incinerated O O N/A
as O O N/A
it O O N/A
soaked O O N/A
up O O N/A
the O O N/A
liquor O O N/A
of O O N/A
tiny O O N/A
hard-shell O O N/A

fresh O O N/A

Technique O O N/A
never O O N/A
overplayed O O N/A
its O O N/A
hand O O N/A
in O O N/A
these O O N/A
dishes. O O N/A
The O O N/A
only O O N/A
time O O N/A
it O O N/A
came O O N/A
up O O N/A
short O O N/A
was O O N/A
when O O N/A
a O O N/A
drum O O N/A
of O O N/A
steelhead O O N/A
salmon O O N/A
poached O O N/A
in O O N/A
olive O O N/A
oil O O N/A
arrived O O N/A
slightly O O N/A
mushy O O N/A
and O O N/A
underdone. O O N/A
A O O N/A
week O O N/A
later, O O N/A
the O O N/A
fish O O N/A
was O O N/A
cooked O O N/A
more O O N/A
successfully. O O N/A
The O O N/A
scope O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
Evelyn's O O N/A

All O O N/A
this O O N/A
should O O N/A
persuade O O N/A
some O O N/A
skeptics O O N/A
to O O N/A
give O O N/A
Benno O O N/A
a O O N/A
try. O O N/A
The O O N/A
restaurant's O O N/A
greatest O O N/A
challenge O O N/A
is O O N/A
that O O N/A
the O O N/A
food O O N/A
seems O O N/A
to O O N/A
come O O N/A
from O O N/A
an O O N/A
era O O N/A
that's O O N/A
too O O N/A
old O O N/A
to O O N/A
seem O O N/A
fresh O O N/A
but O O N/A
too O O N/A
recent O O N/A
to O O N/A
feel O O N/A
nostalgic O O N/A
about. O O N/A
When O O N/A
pop O O N/A
music O O N/A
is O O N/A
that O O N/A
age, O O N/A
we O O N/A
cringe. O O N/A
When O O N/A
buildings O O N/A
are O O N/A
that O O N/A
age, O O N/A
we O O N/A
knock O O N/A
them O O N/A
down O O N/A
before O O N/A
they O O N/A
can O O N/A
be O O N/A
landmarked. O O N/A
But O O N/A
sometimes O O N/A
one O O N/A
chef O O N/A
cooking O O N/A
what O O N/A
he O O N/A
believes O O N/A
is O O N/A
better O O N/A

the O O N/A

at O O N/A

. O O N/A
The O O N/A
chef, O O N/A
Cosme O O N/A
Aguilar, O O N/A
calls O O N/A
it O O N/A
mole O O N/A
de O O N/A
Piaxtla, O O N/A
after O O N/A
the O O N/A
Pueblan O O N/A
town O O N/A
where O O N/A
his O O N/A
father O O N/A
grew O O N/A
up, O O N/A
and O O N/A
as O O N/A
a O O N/A
reminder O O N/A
that O O N/A
there O O N/A
is O O N/A
not O O N/A
just O O N/A
one O O N/A
mole O O N/A
poblano O O N/A
but O O N/A
many. O O N/A
Some O O N/A
have O O N/A
apple O O N/A
in O O N/A
addition O O N/A
to O O N/A
raisins. O O N/A
Some O O N/A
are O O N/A
thickened O O N/A
with O O N/A
animal O O N/A
crackers. O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Aguilar O O N/A
remembers O O N/A
that O O N/A
in O O N/A
his O O N/A
childhood O O N/A
home, O O N/A
plantains O O N/A
were O O N/A
allowed O O N/A
to O O N/A
hang O O N/A
until O O N/A
they O O N/A
were O O N/A
black O O N/A
before O O N/A
they O O N/A
could O O N/A
be O O N/A
pounded O O N/A
into O O N/A
mole. O O N/A
Maybe O O N/A
this O O N/A
explains O O N/A
the O O N/A
particular O O N/A
sweetness O O N/A
of O O N/A
Casa O O N/A
Enrique's O O N/A
version, O O N/A
which O O N/A
is O O N/A
not O O N/A
the O O N/A
candy-bar O O N/A
sweetness O O N/A
of O O N/A
some. O O N/A
It's O O N/A
deep O O N/A
and O O N/A
complicated. O O N/A
The O O N/A
character O O N/A
of O O N/A
this O O N/A
mole O O N/A
de O O N/A
Piaxtla O O N/A
unfurls O O N/A
as O O N/A
you O O N/A
eat, O O N/A
whether O O N/A
the O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
soaked O O N/A
into O O N/A
enchiladas O O N/A
filled O O N/A
with O O N/A
chicken O O N/A
or O O N/A
simply O O N/A
pooled O O N/A
on O O N/A
a O O N/A
plate O O N/A
over O O N/A
and O O N/A
under O O N/A
a O O N/A
quartered O O N/A
chicken O O N/A
and O O N/A
yellow O O N/A
rice O O N/A
cooked O O N/A
with O O N/A
peas. O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Aguilar O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
frying, O O N/A
blending O O N/A
and O O N/A
stirring O O N/A
mole O O N/A

off O O N/A

in O O N/A
Long O O N/A
Island O O N/A
City, O O N/A
Queens. O O N/A
In O O N/A
fact, O O N/A
he O O N/A
has O O N/A
barely O O N/A
changed O O N/A
his O O N/A
menu O O N/A
since O O N/A
our O O N/A
Hungry O O N/A
City O O N/A
critic, O O N/A
Ligaya O O N/A
Mishan, O O N/A
reviewed O O N/A
it O O N/A
the O O N/A
next O O N/A
year. O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Aguilar O O N/A
says O O N/A
he O O N/A
is O O N/A
emulating O O N/A
the O O N/A
restaurants O O N/A
he O O N/A
likes O O N/A
best O O N/A
in O O N/A
Mexico, O O N/A
ones O O N/A
whose O O N/A
kitchens O O N/A
make O O N/A
the O O N/A
same O O N/A
dishes O O N/A
year O O N/A
in O O N/A
and O O N/A
year O O N/A
out. O O N/A
Whether O O N/A
despite O O N/A
this O O N/A
or O O N/A
because O O N/A
of O O N/A
it, O O N/A
the O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
seems O O N/A
to O O N/A
have O O N/A
improved O O N/A
in O O N/A
subtle O O N/A
ways. O O N/A
Acoustic O O N/A
panels O O N/A
tacked O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
ceiling O O N/A
make O O N/A
conversation O O N/A
easier. O O N/A
Servers, O O N/A
always O O N/A
welcoming, O O N/A
have O O N/A
become O O N/A
experts O O N/A
at O O N/A
anticipating O O N/A
the O O N/A
meal's O O N/A
ebb O O N/A
and O O N/A
flow. O O N/A
They'll O O N/A
step O O N/A
in O O N/A
just O O N/A
when O O N/A
you're O O N/A
ready O O N/A
for O O N/A
a O O N/A
fresh O O N/A
drink, O O N/A
maybe O O N/A
a O O N/A
margarita O O N/A
with O O N/A
some O O N/A
tamarind O O N/A
this O O N/A
time O O N/A
to O O N/A
offset O O N/A
the O O N/A
raw-sugar O O N/A
syrup. O O N/A
They'll O O N/A
gauge O O N/A
the O O N/A
precise O O N/A
moment O O N/A
when O O N/A
you're O O N/A
ready O O N/A
to O O N/A
have O O N/A
dinner O O N/A
plates O O N/A
cleared O O N/A
to O O N/A
make O O N/A
room O O N/A
for O O N/A
dessert. O O N/A
Or O O N/A
they'll O O N/A
break O O N/A
away O O N/A
from O O N/A
your O O N/A
table O O N/A
just O O N/A
long O O N/A
enough O O N/A
to O O N/A
join O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
full-throated O O N/A
singing O O N/A
of O O N/A
"Happy O O N/A
Birthday" O O N/A
around O O N/A
a O O N/A
slice O O N/A
of O O N/A
tres O O N/A
leches O O N/A
cake O O N/A
with O O N/A
a O O N/A
candle O O N/A
stuck O O N/A
in O O N/A
it O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
other O O N/A
side O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
room. O O N/A
This O O N/A
may O O N/A
happen O O N/A
three O O N/A
or O O N/A
four O O N/A
times O O N/A
a O O N/A
night, O O N/A
probably O O N/A
not O O N/A
because O O N/A
Casa O O N/A
Enrique O O N/A
looks O O N/A
particularly O O N/A
festive O O N/A
-- O O N/A
from O O N/A
floor O O N/A
to O O N/A
ceiling, O O N/A
it's O O N/A
done O O N/A
almost O O N/A
entirely O O N/A
in O O N/A
white O O N/A
-- O O N/A
but, O O N/A
I'd O O N/A
guess, O O N/A
because O O N/A
regulars O O N/A
know O O N/A
it O O N/A
regularly O O N/A
outperforms O O N/A
any O O N/A
number O O N/A
of O O N/A
other O O N/A
restaurants O O N/A
that O O N/A
might O O N/A
seem O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
more O O N/A
special O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
surface O O N/A
but O O N/A
aren't, O O N/A
really. O O N/A
Also, O O N/A
the O O N/A
tres O O N/A
leches O O N/A
cake, O O N/A
if O O N/A
not O O N/A
as O O N/A
soggy O O N/A
with O O N/A
condensed O O N/A
milk O O N/A
as O O N/A
it O O N/A
could O O N/A
be, O O N/A
is O O N/A
still O O N/A
pretty O O N/A
good, O O N/A
though O O N/A
I O O N/A
think O O N/A
the O O N/A
flan O O N/A
is O O N/A
almost O O N/A
mandatory, O O N/A
and O O N/A
it, O O N/A
too, O O N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
perfectly O O N/A
credible O O N/A
birthday-candle O O N/A
holder. O O N/A
Although O O N/A
the O O N/A
guacamole O O N/A
is O O N/A
freshly O O N/A
mashed O O N/A
and O O N/A
pleasingly O O N/A
minimalist, O O N/A
I O O N/A
tend O O N/A
to O O N/A
skip O O N/A
it O O N/A
as O O N/A
long O O N/A
as O O N/A
the O O N/A
people O O N/A
I'm O O N/A
with O O N/A
don't O O N/A
mind. O O N/A
Instead O O N/A
I'll O O N/A
head O O N/A
straight O O N/A
for O O N/A
the O O N/A
two-bite O O N/A
sopecitos O O N/A
topped O O N/A
with O O N/A
refried O O N/A
beans O O N/A
and O O N/A
loose O O N/A
chorizo, O O N/A
or O O N/A
the O O N/A
albondigas O O N/A
in O O N/A
cumin-laced O O N/A
chipotle O O N/A
sauce, O O N/A
each O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
three O O N/A
meatballs O O N/A
stuffed O O N/A
with O O N/A
hard-cooked O O N/A
eggs. O O N/A
The O O N/A
best O O N/A
Mexican O O N/A
seafood O O N/A
dishes O O N/A
often O O N/A
come O O N/A
from O O N/A
restaurants O O N/A
that O O N/A
specialize O O N/A
in O O N/A
them. O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Aguilar, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
seems O O N/A
equally O O N/A
at O O N/A
home O O N/A
with O O N/A
fish O O N/A
and O O N/A
meat. O O N/A
The O O N/A
market O O N/A
fish O O N/A
offered O O N/A
as O O N/A
a O O N/A
main O O N/A
course O O N/A
-- O O N/A
lately O O N/A
a O O N/A
black O O N/A
sea O O N/A
bass O O N/A
-- O O N/A
has O O N/A
always O O N/A
been O O N/A
seared O O N/A
to O O N/A
a O O N/A
crisp O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
skin O O N/A
side. O O N/A
Still, O O N/A
in O O N/A
all O O N/A
these O O N/A
years O O N/A
I've O O N/A
never O O N/A
been O O N/A
convinced O O N/A
that O O N/A
the O O N/A
corn O O N/A
under O O N/A
it O O N/A
compares O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
best O O N/A
street-corner O O N/A
esquites, O O N/A
or O O N/A
that O O N/A
it O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
fish O O N/A
really O O N/A
add O O N/A
up O O N/A
to O O N/A
a O O N/A
whole O O N/A
dish. O O N/A
The O O N/A
seafood O O N/A
appetizers, O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
other O O N/A
hand, O O N/A
are O O N/A
some O O N/A
of O O N/A
my O O N/A
favorite O O N/A
things O O N/A
at O O N/A
Casa O O N/A
Enrique: O O N/A
the O O N/A
delicately O O N/A
fried O O N/A
oysters O O N/A
sitting O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
mayonnaise O O N/A
that O O N/A
gets O O N/A
its O O N/A
tangerine O O N/A
color O O N/A
from O O N/A
ground O O N/A
chiles; O O N/A
the O O N/A
ceviche, O O N/A
freshly O O N/A
tossed O O N/A
with O O N/A
lime O O N/A
and O O N/A
herbs; O O N/A
the O O N/A
crab O O N/A
tostadas, O O N/A
loaded O O N/A
with O O N/A
a O O N/A
thin O O N/A
slice O O N/A
or O O N/A
two O O N/A
of O O N/A
Serrano O O N/A
chile, O O N/A
chopped O O N/A
tomato, O O N/A
leaves O O N/A
of O O N/A
cilantro, O O N/A
smooth O O N/A
avocado O O N/A
salsa O O N/A
and O O N/A
a O O N/A
spoonful O O N/A
of O O N/A
crab O O N/A
meat, O O N/A
pure O O N/A
and O O N/A
clean; O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
shrimp O O N/A
cocktail, O O N/A
which O O N/A
gets O O N/A
its O O N/A
roundness O O N/A
and O O N/A
slight O O N/A
richness, O O N/A
I O O N/A
think, O O N/A
from O O N/A
orange O O N/A
soda, O O N/A
just O O N/A
the O O N/A
way O O N/A
you'd O O N/A
hope. O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Aguilar O O N/A
is O O N/A
not O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
those O O N/A
chefs O O N/A
who O O N/A
set O O N/A
up O O N/A
masa O O N/A
factories O O N/A
in O O N/A
their O O N/A
basements. O O N/A
Casa O O N/A
Enrique's O O N/A
corn O O N/A
tortillas O O N/A
do O O N/A
not O O N/A
have O O N/A
the O O N/A
pretty O O N/A
floral O O N/A
aromas O O N/A
of O O N/A
Cosme's, O O N/A
or O O N/A
the O O N/A
sweet, O O N/A
focused O O N/A
corn O O N/A
flavor O O N/A
you O O N/A
taste O O N/A
in O O N/A
Claro's. O O N/A
But O O N/A
they O O N/A
are O O N/A
better O O N/A
than O O N/A
you'd O O N/A
find O O N/A
almost O O N/A
anywhere O O N/A
else O O N/A
in O O N/A
New O O N/A
York. O O N/A
They O O N/A
give O O N/A
a O O N/A
boost O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
tacos, O O N/A
made O O N/A
with O O N/A
braised O O N/A
tongue O O N/A
or O O N/A
brisket; O O N/A
crumbled O O N/A
chorizo; O O N/A
or O O N/A
fried, O O N/A
battered O O N/A
fish, O O N/A
and O O N/A
they O O N/A
are O O N/A
especially O O N/A
delicious O O N/A
soaked O O N/A
in O O N/A
salsa O O N/A
verde O O N/A
and O O N/A
wrapped O O N/A
around O O N/A

bloops O O N/A
and O O N/A
wobbles O O N/A
eating O O N/A
there O O N/A
than O O N/A
I O O N/A
have O O N/A
exploring O O N/A
the O O N/A
far O O N/A
more O O N/A
traditional O O N/A
menu O O N/A
at O O N/A
Casa O O N/A
Enrique. O O N/A
It O O N/A
isn't O O N/A
necessarily O O N/A
the O O N/A
more O O N/A
interesting O O N/A
restaurant, O O N/A
but O O N/A
it's O O N/A
the O O N/A
one O O N/A
where O O N/A
I'm O O N/A
more O O N/A
confident O O N/A
that O O N/A
if O O N/A
I O O N/A
went O O N/A
there O O N/A
tonight, O O N/A
everything O O N/A
would O O N/A
taste O O N/A
exactly O O N/A
the O O N/A
way O O N/A
it O O N/A
was O O N/A
supposed O O N/A
to. O O N/A
The O O N/A
pozole O O N/A
will O O N/A
be O O N/A
dark O O N/A
and O O N/A
intense, O O N/A
though O O N/A
not O O N/A
especially O O N/A
spicy, O O N/A
with O O N/A
tender O O N/A
strands O O N/A
of O O N/A
pork O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
broth O O N/A
and O O N/A
all O O N/A
the O O N/A
usual O O N/A
mix-ins O O N/A
waiting O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
side. O O N/A
The O O N/A
pork O O N/A
ribs O O N/A
will O O N/A
be O O N/A
slowly O O N/A
braised, O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
style O O N/A
of O O N/A
Chiapas, O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
thick O O N/A
cooked O O N/A
salsa O O N/A
built O O N/A
on O O N/A
a O O N/A
foundation O O N/A
of O O N/A
guajillo O O N/A
chiles. O O N/A
These O O N/A
ribs O O N/A
are O O N/A
not O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
confused O O N/A
with O O N/A
the O O N/A
baby O O N/A
back O O N/A
ribs, O O N/A
cooked O O N/A
in O O N/A
an O O N/A
even O O N/A
thicker, O O N/A
creamier O O N/A
pipian O O N/A

that O O N/A
sometimes O O N/A
turn O O N/A
up O O N/A
as O O N/A
a O O N/A
daily O O N/A
special. O O N/A
Best O O N/A
of O O N/A
all, O O N/A
perhaps, O O N/A
will O O N/A
be O O N/A
the O O N/A
chamorro O O N/A
de O O N/A
borrego, O O N/A
or O O N/A
lamb O O N/A
shank O O N/A
stewed O O N/A
with O O N/A
chickpeas; O O N/A
it O O N/A
will O O N/A
be O O N/A
very O O N/A
tender O O N/A
and O O N/A
very O O N/A
flavorful O O N/A
in O O N/A
its O O N/A
rough O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
of O O N/A
pulla O O N/A
chiles O O N/A
with O O N/A
crushed O O N/A
guaje O O N/A
seeds. O O N/A
The O O N/A
name O O N/A
of O O N/A
that O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
is O O N/A
huaxmole, O O N/A
or O O N/A
sometimes O O N/A
guaxmole, O O N/A
or O O N/A
even O O N/A
mole O O N/A
de O O N/A
guaje. O O N/A
Yes, O O N/A
it's O O N/A
a O O N/A
mole, O O N/A
and O O N/A
one O O N/A

They're N/A O O
easy N/A O O
to N/A O O
find N/A O O
these N/A O O
days, N/A O O
as N/A O O
consumers N/A O O

the N/A O O

countless N/A O O

endlessly N/A O O

just N/A O O
from N/A O O
traditional N/A O O

Yelp N/A O O
(171 N/A O O

but N/A O O
also N/A O O
from N/A O O
Facebook N/A O O

those N/A O O
all-purpose N/A O O
giants. N/A O O
Everybody's N/A O O
a N/A O O
critic, N/A O O
right? N/A O O
I N/A O O
happen N/A O O
to N/A O O
get N/A O O
paid N/A O O
for N/A O O
criticism, N/A O O
and N/A O O
I N/A O O
would N/A O O
like N/A O O
to N/A O O
criticize N/A O O
that N/A O O
old N/A O O
platitude N/A O O
right N/A O O
out N/A O O
the N/A O O
window: N/A O O
No, N/A O O
everybody N/A O O
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
a N/A O O
critic. N/A O O
What N/A O O
most N/A O O
of N/A O O
you N/A O O
are N/A O O
doing N/A O O
out N/A O O
there, N/A O O
online N/A O O
and N/A O O
in N/A O O
three N/A O O
dimensions, N/A O O
is N/A O O
complaining. N/A O O
When N/A O O
we N/A O O
complain, N/A O O
we N/A O O
experience N/A O O
something N/A O O
that N/A O O
we N/A O O
don't N/A O O
like N/A O O
and N/A O O
we N/A O O
say N/A O O
something N/A O O
about N/A O O
it. N/A O O
A N/A O O
critic N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
write N/A O O
about N/A O O
his N/A O O
own N/A O O
dissatisfaction, N/A O O
or N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
just N/A O O
do N/A O O
that. N/A O O
A N/A O O
critic N/A O O
has N/A O O
to N/A O O
poke N/A O O
his N/A O O
head N/A O O
out N/A O O
of N/A O O
his N/A O O
turtle N/A O O
shell, N/A O O
look N/A O O
around N/A O O
and N/A O O
gesture, N/A O O
with N/A O O
stubby N/A O O
legs, N/A O O
toward N/A O O
the N/A O O
sources N/A O O
of N/A O O
dissatisfaction. N/A O O
Done N/A O O
perceptively, N/A O O
with N/A O O
analytic N/A O O
thinking N/A O O
and N/A O O
an N/A O O
effort N/A O O
to N/A O O
connect N/A O O
the N/A O O
dots N/A O O
between N/A O O
this N/A O O
experience N/A O O
and N/A O O
others, N/A O O
this N/A O O
can N/A O O
be N/A O O
the N/A O O
beginning N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
value N/A O O
system N/A O O
that N/A O O
readers N/A O O
might N/A O O
share, N/A O O
or N/A O O
reject, N/A O O
or N/A O O
at N/A O O
least N/A O O
attempt N/A O O
to N/A O O
understand. N/A O O
Complaining N/A O O
is N/A O O
as N/A O O
easy N/A O O
as N/A O O
breathing. N/A O O
Writing N/A O O
criticism N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
real N/A O O
pain. N/A O O
That N/A O O
was N/A O O
a N/A O O
complaint, N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
way. N/A O O
But N/A O O
criticism N/A O O
and N/A O O
complaint N/A O O
are N/A O O
closely N/A O O
related N/A O O
enough N/A O O
for N/A O O
me N/A O O
to N/A O O
know N/A O O
that N/A O O
there's N/A O O
a N/A O O
lot N/A O O
of N/A O O
complaining N/A O O
going N/A O O
on, N/A O O
and N/A O O
that N/A O O
most N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
complaints N/A O O
aren't N/A O O
having N/A O O
any N/A O O
effect N/A O O
at N/A O O
all. N/A O O
This N/A O O
may N/A O O
not N/A O O
be N/A O O
the N/A O O
point. N/A O O
People N/A O O
who N/A O O
study N/A O O
complaints N/A O O
divide N/A O O
them N/A O O
into N/A O O
two N/A O O
categories, N/A O O
instrumental N/A O O
and N/A O O
expressive. N/A O O
An N/A O O
instrumental N/A O O
complaint N/A O O
is N/A O O
"directed N/A O O
toward N/A O O
a N/A O O
specific N/A O O
target N/A O O
and N/A O O
intended N/A O O
to N/A O O
bring N/A O O
about N/A O O
a N/A O O
specific N/A O O
outcome," N/A O O
according N/A O O
to N/A O O
Robin N/A O O
Kowalski, N/A O O
a N/A O O
professor N/A O O
of N/A O O
psychology N/A O O
at N/A O O
Clemson N/A O O
University N/A O O
who N/A O O
has N/A O O
studied N/A O O
the N/A O O
social N/A O O
functions N/A O O
of N/A O O
complaining. N/A O O
Calling N/A O O
a N/A O O
restaurant's N/A O O
owner N/A O O
the N/A O O
next N/A O O
day N/A O O
to N/A O O
say N/A O O
that N/A O O
you N/A O O
waited N/A O O
an N/A O O
hour N/A O O
for N/A O O
dessert N/A O O
and N/A O O
don't N/A O O
intend N/A O O
to N/A O O
come N/A O O
back N/A O O
is N/A O O
an N/A O O
instrumental N/A O O
complaint. N/A O O
Texting N/A O O
a N/A O O
friend N/A O O
to N/A O O
say N/A O O
the N/A O O
polar N/A O O
vortex N/A O O
is N/A O O
making N/A O O
your N/A O O
skin N/A O O
peel N/A O O
off N/A O O
is N/A O O
an N/A O O
expressive N/A O O
complaint. N/A O O
We N/A O O
call N/A O O
expressive N/A O O
complaints N/A O O
venting, N/A O O
kvetching, N/A O O
griping N/A O O
or N/A O O
a N/A O O
number N/A O O
of N/A O O
other N/A O O
names. N/A O O
It's N/A O O
important N/A O O
to N/A O O
know N/A O O
which N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
two N/A O O
types N/A O O
of N/A O O
complaint N/A O O
is N/A O O
right N/A O O
for N/A O O
you N/A O O
before N/A O O
opening N/A O O
the N/A O O
first N/A O O
can N/A O O
of N/A O O
invective. N/A O O
Venting N/A O O
has N/A O O
its N/A O O
uses. N/A O O
In N/A O O
one N/A O O
study, N/A O O
Dr. N/A O O
Kowalski N/A O O
and N/A O O
some N/A O O
colleagues N/A O O
showed N/A O O
that N/A O O
when N/A O O
we N/A O O
are N/A O O
asked N/A O O
to N/A O O
put N/A O O
our N/A O O
feelings N/A O O
of N/A O O
dissatisfaction N/A O O
with N/A O O
somebody N/A O O
into N/A O O
writing, N/A O O
our N/A O O
"positive N/A O O
affect" N/A O O
-- N/A O O
good N/A O O
feelings, N/A O O
basically N/A O O
-- N/A O O
will N/A O O
rise N/A O O
about N/A O O
15 N/A O O
minutes N/A O O
later, N/A O O
after N/A O O
an N/A O O
initial N/A O O
downswing. N/A O O
In N/A O O
the N/A O O
same N/A O O
way, N/A O O
if N/A O O
a N/A O O
meal N/A O O
lets N/A O O
you N/A O O
down, N/A O O
taking N/A O O
a N/A O O
pair N/A O O
of N/A O O
pliers N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
blowtorch N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
on N/A O O
Yelp N/A O O
might N/A O O
give N/A O O
you N/A O O
a N/A O O
brief N/A O O
lift. N/A O O
But N/A O O
once N/A O O
the N/A O O
rush N/A O O
of N/A O O
having N/A O O
gotten N/A O O
it N/A O O
off N/A O O
your N/A O O
chest N/A O O
is N/A O O
gone, N/A O O
you'd N/A O O
realize N/A O O
nothing N/A O O
has N/A O O
changed. N/A O O
You're N/A O O
still N/A O O
out N/A O O
the N/A O O
price N/A O O
of N/A O O
dinner, N/A O O
and N/A O O
you N/A O O
won't N/A O O
find N/A O O
out N/A O O
whether N/A O O
your N/A O O
grievance N/A O O
has N/A O O
reached N/A O O
the N/A O O
right N/A O O
ears N/A O O
unless N/A O O
somebody N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
responds. N/A O O
Some N/A O O
owners N/A O O
make N/A O O
a N/A O O
point N/A O O
of N/A O O
scouring N/A O O
review N/A O O
sites N/A O O
so N/A O O
they N/A O O
can N/A O O
do N/A O O
just N/A O O
that. N/A O O
Others N/A O O
use N/A O O
the N/A O O
review's N/A O O
date N/A O O
and N/A O O
details N/A O O
to N/A O O
identify N/A O O
and N/A O O
get N/A O O
in N/A O O
touch N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
kvetcher. N/A O O
But N/A O O
there N/A O O
are N/A O O
more N/A O O
direct N/A O O
ways N/A O O
to N/A O O
get N/A O O
your N/A O O
gripe N/A O O
acknowledged N/A O O
than N/A O O
scrawling N/A O O
it N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
walls N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
internet. N/A O O
"If N/A O O
there's N/A O O
something N/A O O
that's N/A O O
really N/A O O
bothering N/A O O
you, N/A O O
the N/A O O
ultimate N/A O O
benefits N/A O O
are N/A O O
going N/A O O
to N/A O O
come N/A O O
from N/A O O
targeted N/A O O
complaining N/A O O
," N/A O O
Dr. N/A O O
Kowalski N/A O O
said. N/A O O
"Telling N/A O O
the N/A O O
person N/A O O
or N/A O O
restaurant." N/A O O
I N/A O O
know, N/A O O
I N/A O O
know. N/A O O
This N/A O O
is N/A O O
the N/A O O
part N/A O O
I N/A O O
avoid, N/A O O
too, N/A O O
by N/A O O
saving N/A O O
all N/A O O
my N/A O O
criticisms N/A O O
for N/A O O
my N/A O O
reviews. N/A O O
I N/A O O
hate N/A O O
confrontations, N/A O O
I N/A O O
run N/A O O
from N/A O O
them, N/A O O
I'd N/A O O
rather N/A O O
pay N/A O O
the N/A O O
check, N/A O O
even N/A O O
with N/A O O
my N/A O O
own N/A O O
money, N/A O O
and N/A O O
walk N/A O O
out N/A O O
never N/A O O
to N/A O O
return. N/A O O
But N/A O O
let's N/A O O
say N/A O O
you N/A O O
want N/A O O
something N/A O O
out N/A O O
of N/A O O
your N/A O O
complaint. N/A O O
Maybe N/A O O
you N/A O O
just N/A O O
want N/A O O
a N/A O O
rib-eye N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
that's N/A O O
still N/A O O
rare N/A O O
instead N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
overdone N/A O O
paving N/A O O
stone N/A O O
you N/A O O
were N/A O O
served. N/A O O
Or N/A O O
you N/A O O
have N/A O O
a N/A O O
reason N/A O O
for N/A O O
wanting N/A O O
an N/A O O
item N/A O O
taken N/A O O
off N/A O O
your N/A O O
bill. N/A O O
Or N/A O O
(and N/A O O
I N/A O O
think N/A O O
this N/A O O
is N/A O O
what N/A O O
most N/A O O
people N/A O O
are N/A O O
looking N/A O O
for N/A O O
when N/A O O
they N/A O O
complain) N/A O O
you N/A O O
just N/A O O
want N/A O O
somebody N/A O O
to N/A O O
look N/A O O
you N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
eye N/A O O
and N/A O O
say: N/A O O
"So N/A O O
sorry N/A O O
about N/A O O
that. N/A O O
Is N/A O O
there N/A O O
anything N/A O O
we N/A O O
can N/A O O
do N/A O O
to N/A O O
make N/A O O
it N/A O O
right?" N/A O O
Whatever N/A O O
you N/A O O
want, N/A O O
you're N/A O O
more N/A O O
likely N/A O O
to N/A O O
get N/A O O
it N/A O O
if N/A O O
you N/A O O
have N/A O O
a N/A O O
word N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
manager N/A O O
either N/A O O
before N/A O O
you N/A O O
leave N/A O O
or N/A O O
later N/A O O
on. N/A O O
As N/A O O
a N/A O O
side N/A O O
benefit, N/A O O
you'll N/A O O
be N/A O O
helping N/A O O
the N/A O O
restaurant, N/A O O

somebody N/A O O

un N/A O O
happy N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
end N/A O O

a N/A O O

almost N/A O O
any N/A O O

"We N/A O O
actually N/A O O
really N/A O O
welcome N/A O O
complaints," N/A O O
said N/A O O
Melinda N/A O O
Shopsin, N/A O O
a N/A O O
film N/A O O
producer N/A O O
who N/A O O
cooks N/A O O
and N/A O O
waits N/A O O
tables N/A O O

This N/A O O
may N/A O O
come N/A O O
as N/A O O
a N/A O O
surprise N/A O O
to N/A O O
anyone N/A O O
who N/A O O
has N/A O O
heard N/A O O
the N/A O O
numerous N/A O O
accounts N/A O O
of N/A O O
customers' N/A O O
being N/A O O
tossed N/A O O
out N/A O O
of N/A O O
Shopsin's N/A B-EST B-EST
for N/A O O
any N/A O O
number N/A O O
of N/A O O
arcane N/A O O
infractions. N/A O O
And N/A O O
yet, N/A O O
Ms. N/A O O
Shopsin N/A O O
says N/A O O
that N/A O O
when N/A O O
her N/A O O
mother N/A O O
was N/A O O
still N/A O O
alive, N/A O O
she N/A O O
would N/A O O
ask N/A O O
what N/A O O
was N/A O O
wrong N/A O O
when N/A O O
she N/A O O
saw N/A O O
an N/A O O
unfinished N/A O O
plate, N/A O O
and N/A O O
then N/A O O
take N/A O O
a N/A O O
bite N/A O O
to N/A O O
see N/A O O
for N/A O O
herself. N/A O O
At N/A O O
other N/A O O
restaurants, N/A O O
this N/A O O
exploratory N/A O O
bite N/A O O
may N/A O O
happen N/A O O
backstage, N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
kitchen. N/A O O
If N/A O O
you're N/A O O
going N/A O O
to N/A O O
make N/A O O
an N/A O O
instrumental N/A O O
complaint, N/A O O
though, N/A O O
you N/A O O
still N/A O O
need N/A O O
to N/A O O
figure N/A O O
out N/A O O
whether N/A O O
the N/A O O
reasons N/A O O
you're N/A O O
unhappy N/A O O
are N/A O O
subjective N/A O O
or N/A O O
objective. N/A O O
Did N/A O O
Medieval N/A B-EST B-EST
Times N/A I-EST I-EST
undercook N/A O O
the N/A O O
chicken, N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
or N/A O O
do N/A O O
you N/A O O
just N/A O O
not N/A O O
like N/A O O
eating N/A O O
with N/A O O
your N/A O O
hands? N/A O O
Even N/A O O
if N/A O O
you're N/A O O
pretty N/A O O
sure N/A O O
the N/A O O
problem N/A O O
is N/A O O
objective, N/A O O
it N/A O O
can N/A O O
be N/A O O
useful N/A O O
to N/A O O
pretend N/A O O
it's N/A O O
subjective, N/A O O
for N/A O O
the N/A O O
sake N/A O O
of N/A O O
diplomacy. N/A O O
The N/A O O
chef N/A O O
John N/A O O
Tesar N/A O O
recalls N/A O O
a N/A O O
night, N/A O O
soon N/A O O
after N/A O O
he'd N/A O O
opened N/A O O
his N/A O O
Knife N/A B-EST B-EST
steakhouse N/A B-TYPE B-TYPE
in N/A O O
Dallas, N/A B-LOC B-LOC
when N/A O O
he N/A O O
got N/A O O
into N/A O O
an N/A O O
argument N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
customer N/A O O
about N/A O O
the N/A O O
weight N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
steak N/A O B-FOOD
-- N/A O O
an N/A O O
objective N/A O O
complaint N/A O O
if N/A O O
ever N/A O O
there N/A O O
was N/A O O
one. N/A O O
"We N/A O O
had N/A O O
a N/A O O
33-ounce N/A O O
rib-eye N/A B-DISH B-FOOD
for N/A I-DISH O
two," N/A I-DISH O
Mr. N/A O O
Tesar N/A O O
said. N/A O O
One N/A O O
customer N/A O O
who N/A O O
ordered N/A O O
it N/A O O
wasn't N/A O O
convinced N/A O O
and N/A O O
began N/A O O
"screaming," N/A O O
according N/A O O
to N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Tesar: N/A O O
"‘This N/A O O
steak N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
is N/A O O
too N/A O O
small! N/A O O
This N/A O O
isn't N/A O O
enough N/A O O
to N/A O O
feed N/A O O
all N/A O O
of N/A O O
us!'" N/A O O
He N/A O O
went N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
table, N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
hostilities N/A O O
quickly N/A O O
escalated, N/A O O
he N/A O O
said, N/A O O
until N/A O O
"I N/A O O
went N/A O O
into N/A O O
the N/A O O
kitchen, N/A O O
got N/A O O
a N/A O O
scale, N/A O O
grabbed N/A O O
the N/A O O
steak, N/A O O
weighed N/A O O
it N/A O O
in N/A O O
front N/A O O
of N/A O O
her, N/A O O
and N/A O O
said, N/A O O
‘It's N/A O O
36 N/A O O
ounces!'" N/A O O
The N/A O O
story N/A O O
ends N/A O O
happily, N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
two N/A O O
combatants N/A O O
meeting N/A O O
again N/A O O
at N/A O O
a N/A O O
dinner N/A O O
party N/A O O
some N/A O O
time N/A O O
later N/A O O
and N/A O O
getting N/A O O
along N/A O O
swimmingly. N/A O O
"We N/A O O
both N/A O O
realized N/A O O
how N/A O O
absurd N/A O O
and N/A O O
insecure N/A O O
we N/A O O
were N/A O O
being," N/A O O
he N/A O O
said. N/A O O
All N/A O O
this N/A O O
might N/A O O
have N/A O O
been N/A O O
avoided N/A O O
if N/A O O
the N/A O O
complaint N/A O O
had N/A O O
been N/A O O
cast N/A O O
subjectively: N/A O O
"That N/A O O
steak N/A O O
looks N/A O O
smaller N/A O O
than N/A O O
we N/A O O
expected. N/A O O
Are N/A O O
you N/A O O
sure N/A O O
it's N/A O O
the N/A O O
one N/A O O
we N/A O O
ordered?" N/A O O
Subjective N/A O O
complaints N/A O O
are N/A O O
still N/A O O
important N/A O O
data N/A O O
for N/A O O
restaurants. N/A O O
If N/A O O
one N/A O O
person N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
like N/A O O
the N/A O O
new N/A O O
hot-dog N/A O O
lasagna, N/A O O
it's N/A O O
an N/A O O
aberration. N/A O O
If N/A O O
15 N/A O O
people N/A O O
don't N/A O O
like N/A O O
it, N/A O O
the N/A O O
recipe N/A O O
probably N/A O O
needs N/A O O
to N/A O O
go N/A O O
back N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
workshop. N/A O O
The N/A O O
chef N/A O O
or N/A O O
owner N/A O O
needs N/A O O
to N/A O O
know N/A O O
this, N/A O O
but N/A O O
also N/A O O
needs N/A O O
to N/A O O
hear N/A O O
it N/A O O
in N/A O O
terms N/A O O
that N/A O O
won't N/A O O
lead N/A O O
to N/A O O
a N/A O O
screaming N/A O O
match N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
dining N/A O O
room N/A O O
. N/A O O
Perhaps N/A O O
you N/A O O
have N/A O O
seen N/A O O
Gordon N/A O O
Ramsay N/A O O
critique N/A O O
another N/A O O
chef's N/A O O
cooking N/A O O
on N/A O O
television? N/A O O
Don't N/A O O
do N/A O O
it N/A O O
like N/A O O
that. N/A O O
In N/A O O
general, N/A O O
the N/A O O
more N/A O O
specific N/A O O
your N/A O O
complaint, N/A O O
the N/A O O
more N/A O O
likely N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
understood. N/A O O
The N/A O O
worst, N/A O O
most N/A O O
useless N/A O O
and N/A O O
potentially N/A O O
dangerous N/A O O
complaints N/A O O
are N/A O O
broad, N/A O O
sweeping N/A O O
condemnations. N/A O O
"There N/A O O
is N/A O O
complaining N/A O O
that N/A O O
makes N/A O O
you N/A O O
think N/A O O
about N/A O O
what N/A O O
you're N/A O O
doing, N/A O O
and N/A O O
there N/A O O
is N/A O O
complaining N/A O O
where N/A O O
everybody N/A O O
thinks N/A O O
they're N/A O O
entitled N/A O O
to N/A O O
say N/A O O
anything," N/A O O
said N/A O O
Rita N/A O O
Sodi, N/A O O
the N/A O O
chef N/A O O
and N/A O O
owner N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
Tuscan N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
I N/A O O
Sodi N/A O O
in N/A O O
Manhattan. N/A O O
"Saying, N/A O O
‘This N/A O O
is N/A O O
terrible' N/A O O
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
complaining. N/A O O
That N/A O O
is N/A O O
being N/A O O
rude. N/A O O
It's N/A O O
like, N/A O O
‘You're N/A O O
ugly.' N/A O O
It's N/A O O
telling N/A O O
me N/A O O
that N/A O O
I'm N/A O O
ugly. N/A O O
It's N/A O O
personal. N/A O O
It's N/A O O
my N/A O O
food." N/A O O
Even N/A O O
when N/A O O
the N/A O O
person N/A O O
you're N/A O O
grousing N/A O O
to N/A O O
did N/A O O
not N/A O O
cook N/A O O
your N/A O O
pasta N/A O O
personally, N/A O O
you N/A O O
should N/A O O
proceed N/A O O
gently, N/A O O
in N/A O O
nonconfrontational N/A O O
terms. N/A O O
It N/A O O
may N/A O O
be N/A O O
helpful N/A O O
to N/A O O
imagine N/A O O
that N/A O O
you N/A O O
are N/A O O
speaking N/A O O
with N/A O O
an N/A O O
air N/A O O
traffic N/A O O
controller N/A O O
trying N/A O O
to N/A O O
land N/A O O
20 N/A O O
jets N/A O O
during N/A O O
a N/A O O
snowstorm; N/A O O
you N/A O O
would N/A O O
try N/A O O
very N/A O O
hard N/A O O
not N/A O O
to N/A O O
add N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
overall N/A O O
stress N/A O O
level N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
tower, N/A O O
even N/A O O
if N/A O O
your N/A O O
child N/A O O
was N/A O O
on N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
those N/A O O
jets. N/A O O
"If N/A O O
you N/A O O
can N/A O O
be N/A O O
patient, N/A O O
open N/A O O
and N/A O O
polite, N/A O O
that's N/A O O
really N/A O O
helpful," N/A O O
Ms. N/A O O
Shopsin N/A O O
said. N/A O O
"The N/A O O
more N/A O O
collaborative N/A O O
and N/A O O
open N/A O O
you N/A O O
can N/A O O
be N/A O O
-- N/A O O
‘Excuse N/A O O
me, N/A O O
I'm N/A O O
sorry' N/A O O
-- N/A O O
even N/A O O
though N/A O O
it's N/A O O
not N/A O O
your N/A O O
fault N/A O O
that N/A O O
it N/A O O
got N/A O O
messed N/A O O
up. N/A O O
People N/A O O
have N/A O O
to N/A O O
understand N/A O O
that N/A O O
sometimes N/A O O
to N/A O O
fix N/A O O
a N/A O O
mistake N/A O O
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
easy." N/A O O
And N/A O O
sometimes, N/A O O
a N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
can N/A O O
make N/A O O
customers N/A O O
happy N/A O O
by N/A O O
changing N/A O O
something N/A O O
that N/A O O
isn't N/A O O
a N/A O O
mistake N/A O O
at N/A O O
all. N/A O O
Occasionally, N/A O O
diners N/A O O
at N/A O O
Shopsin's N/A O O
who N/A O O
had N/A O O
ordered N/A O O
migas N/A O O
complained N/A O O
about N/A O O
finding N/A O O
cilantro N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
dish. N/A O O
Initially, N/A O O
the N/A O O
response N/A O O
would N/A O O
be N/A O O
that N/A O O
migas N/A O O
are N/A O O
supposed N/A O O
to N/A O O
have N/A O O
cilantro. N/A O O
Which N/A O O
may N/A O O
be N/A O O
true, N/A O O
but N/A O O
perhaps N/A O O
wasn't N/A O O
the N/A O O
point. N/A O O
Now, N/A O O
Ms. N/A O O
Shopsin N/A O O
asks N/A O O
customers N/A O O
whether N/A O O
they N/A O O
like N/A O O
cilantro. N/A O O
If N/A O O
the N/A O O
answer N/A O O
is N/A O O
no, N/A O O
there N/A O O
won't N/A O O
be N/A O O
any N/A O O
in N/A O O
their N/A O O
food, N/A O O
even N/A O O
if, N/A O O
strictly N/A O O
speaking, N/A O O
it N/A O O
belongs N/A O O
there. N/A O O
"Complaints N/A O O
do N/A O O
help N/A O O
change N/A O O
things," N/A O O
she N/A O O
said. N/A O O

Usually N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
found N/A O O
on N/A O O
a N/A O O
kaiser N/A O O
roll. N/A O O
Sometimes N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
seen N/A O O
on N/A O O
a N/A O O
bagel. N/A O O
But N/A O O
some N/A O O
Shelsky's N/A O O
customers N/A O O
requested N/A O O
it N/A O O
on N/A O O
a N/A O O
freshly N/A O O

with N/A O O

The N/A O O
bialy N/A O O
might N/A O O
have N/A O O
been N/A O O
custom-made N/A O O
for N/A O O
the N/A O O

the N/A O O
ones N/A O O

which N/A O O
are N/A O O

how N/A O O

you N/A O O

Beginning N/A O O

Mr. N/A O O
Russell N/A O O
slalomed N/A O O
through N/A O O
a N/A O O
series N/A O O
of N/A O O
restaurants N/A O O
that N/A O O
would N/A O O
hand N/A O O
him N/A O O
the N/A O O
keys N/A O O
on N/A O O
off N/A O O
nights N/A O O

an N/A O O

Mr. N/A O O
Russell's N/A O O
vision N/A O O
for N/A O O
Oxalis N/A B-EST B-EST
is N/A O O
the N/A O O
one N/A O O
behind N/A O O
the N/A O O
bistronomie N/A O O
movement N/A O O
in N/A O O
France N/A B-LOC B-LOC
and N/A O O
its N/A O O

carefully N/A O O

food N/A O O

without N/A O O

and N/A O O
it's N/A O O
one N/A O O
sign N/A O O
of N/A O O
his N/A O O
skill N/A O O
that N/A O O
this N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
come N/A O O
across N/A O O
as N/A O O
a N/A O O
cost-cutting N/A O O

though N/A O O
it N/A O O
must N/A O O

at N/A O O
least N/A O O
in N/A O O
part N/A O O
-- N/A O O
dinner N/A O O
is N/A O O
an N/A O O
extremely N/A O O
reasonable N/A O O
$60. N/A O O
Both N/A O O
the N/A O O
price N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
understated N/A O O
cooking N/A O O
style N/A O O
reminded N/A O O
me N/A O O
of N/A O O
Contra N/A B-EST B-EST
, N/A O O
which N/A O O
opened N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
five-course, N/A O O
$55 N/A O O
menu. N/A O O
The N/A O O
last N/A O O
time N/A O O
I N/A O O
went N/A O O
I N/A O O
ate N/A O O
a N/A O O
dish N/A O O
built N/A O O
around N/A O O
spaghetti-like N/A B-FOOD O
strands N/A O O
of N/A O O
rutabaga N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
under N/A O O
a N/A O O
warm N/A O O

whipped N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
Alpine N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD

These N/A O O
two N/A O O
mild-tasting N/A O O
ingredients N/A O O
were N/A O O
set N/A O O
in N/A O O
motion N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
force N/A O O

a N/A O O

a N/A O O
dark N/A O O

focused N/A O O
coffee-and-chicory N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
cream N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
sauce. N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
This N/A O O
was N/A O O
a N/A O O
rutabaga N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
that N/A O O
made N/A O O
me N/A O O
smile. N/A O O
Granted, N/A O O
I N/A O O
probably N/A O O
like N/A O O
rutabaga N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
more N/A O O
than N/A O O
the N/A O O
average N/A O O
person, N/A O O
but N/A O O
I N/A O O
suspect N/A O O
that N/A O O
exposure N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
rutabaga N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
at N/A O O
Oxalis N/A B-EST B-EST
would N/A O O
make N/A O O
the N/A O O
average N/A O O
person N/A O O
realize N/A O O
that N/A O O
I'm N/A O O
right. N/A O O
Meals N/A O O
begin N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
couple N/A O O
of N/A O O
bite-size N/A O O
snacks, N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
which N/A O O
tends N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
a N/A O O
crisp N/A O B-FOOD
potato N/A B-DISH I-FOOD
cake N/A I-DISH I-FOOD
dusted N/A O O
with N/A O O
bay-leaf N/A B-FOOD O
powder N/A I-FOOD O
and N/A O O
topped N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
chip N/A O O
of N/A O O
nori. N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
It N/A O O
looks N/A O O
harmless N/A O O
enough, N/A O O
but N/A O O
can N/A O O
produce N/A O O
powerful N/A O O
emotions, N/A O O
which N/A O O
are N/A O O
easier N/A O O
to N/A O O
understand N/A O O
once N/A O O
you N/A O O
know N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
potatoes N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
are N/A O O
stewed N/A O O
in N/A O O
duck N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
fat N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
and N/A O O
then N/A O O
deep-fried. N/A O O
The N/A O O
other N/A O O
snack N/A O O
might N/A O O
be N/A O O
some N/A O O
lightly N/A O O
dehydrated N/A B-DISH B-FOOD
beets N/A I-DISH I-FOOD
brushed N/A O O
with N/A O O
marjoram-infused N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
cream, N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
or N/A O O
tiny N/A O O
grilled N/A B-DISH B-FOOD
carrots N/A I-DISH I-FOOD
that N/A O O
you N/A O O
dip N/A O O
in N/A O O
chamomile N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
sabayon. N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
(This N/A O O
is N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
dishes N/A O O
that N/A O O
suggests N/A O O
the N/A O O
long N/A O O
shadow N/A O O
of N/A O O
Noma N/A B-EST B-EST
, N/A O O
which N/A O O
in N/A O O
its N/A O O
early N/A O O
days N/A O O
famously N/A O O
matched N/A O O
aged N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
carrots N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
with N/A O O
chamomile.) N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
The N/A O O
price N/A O O
seems N/A O O
meant N/A O O
to N/A O O
encourage N/A O O
frequent N/A O O
visits, N/A O O
but N/A O O
if N/A O O
you N/A O O
return N/A O O
often N/A O O
you N/A O O
may N/A O O
experience N/A O O
déjà N/A O O

At N/A O O
meals N/A O O
in N/A O O
December, N/A O O
January N/A O O
and N/A O O
February, N/A O O
I N/A O O
was N/A O O
always N/A O O
served N/A O O
some N/A O O
variation N/A O O
on N/A O O
raw N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
sea N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
scallops N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
with N/A O O
daikon N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
and N/A O O
apple N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
and N/A O O
some N/A O O
version N/A O O
of N/A O O
duck N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
breast, N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
sweet N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
potato N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
and N/A O O
yogurt. N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
The N/A O O
portions N/A O O
in N/A O O
both N/A O O
cases N/A O O
were N/A O O
restrained N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
flavors N/A O O
were N/A O O
outsize. N/A O O
The N/A O O
scallops N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
were N/A O O
cured N/A O O
in N/A O O
miso N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
and N/A O O
refrigerated N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O
few N/A O O
days N/A O O
and N/A O O
came N/A O O
out N/A O O
of N/A O O
it N/A O O
with N/A O O
something N/A O O
like N/A O O
the N/A O O
concentration N/A O O
of N/A O O
flavor N/A O O
that N/A O O
beef N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
gets N/A O O
from N/A O O
dry-aging, N/A O O
but N/A O O
none N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
funk. N/A O O
The N/A O O
duck's N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
flavor N/A O O
was N/A O O
less N/A O O
surprising, N/A O O
but N/A O O
there N/A O O
was N/A O O
some N/A O O
energy N/A O O
in N/A O O
its N/A O O
collision N/A O O
with N/A O O
sweet N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
potato N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
purée N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
and N/A O I-FOOD
fig-leaf N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
yogurt N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
tart N/A O O
enough N/A O O
to N/A O O
cause N/A O O
double-takes. N/A O O
Like N/A O O
the N/A O O
rest N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu, N/A O O
desserts N/A O O
are N/A O O
unshowy N/A O O
but N/A O O
can N/A O O
be N/A O O
highly N/A O O
impressive. N/A O O
One N/A O O
worked N/A O O
goat N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
milk N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
up N/A O O
into N/A O O
a N/A O O
thing N/A O O
of N/A O O
beauty: N/A O O
Some N/A O O
of N/A O O
it N/A O O
was N/A O O
made N/A O O
into N/A O O
a N/A O O
simple N/A O O
frozen N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
custard, N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
the N/A O O
rest N/A O O
cooked N/A O O
down N/A O O
into N/A O O
cajeta. N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
The N/A O O
cooking N/A O O
makes N/A O O
it N/A O O
clear N/A O O
why N/A O O
people N/A O O
chased N/A O O
Oxalis N/A B-EST B-EST
around N/A O O
Brooklyn N/A B-LOC B-LOC
in N/A O O
its N/A O O
various N/A O O
borrowed N/A O O
spaces, N/A O O
but N/A O O
other N/A O O
aspects N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
suggest N/A O O
that N/A O O
it N/A O O
hasn't N/A O O
quite N/A O O
figured N/A O O
out N/A O O
how N/A O O
to N/A O O
live N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
space N/A O O
of N/A O O
its N/A O O
own. N/A O O
A N/A O O
meal N/A O O
there N/A O O
can N/A O O
be N/A O O
a N/A O O
somewhat N/A O O
solemn N/A O O
experience, N/A O O
which N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
seem N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
what N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Russell N/A O O
and N/A O O
his N/A O O
partners N/A O O
are N/A O O
aiming N/A O O
for. N/A O O
The N/A O O
layout N/A O O
seems N/A O O
to N/A O O
work N/A O O
against N/A O O
it. N/A O O
The N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
is N/A O O
right N/A O O
up N/A O O
front, N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
bar N/A O O
is N/A O O
all N/A O O
the N/A O O
way N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
back, N/A O O
separated N/A O O
from N/A O O
the N/A O O
dining N/A O O
room N/A O O
by N/A O O
a N/A O O
glass N/A O O
door N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
glass N/A O O
wall. N/A O O
I N/A O O
can't N/A O O
imagine N/A O O
what N/A O O
the N/A O O
wall N/A O O
is N/A O O
for, N/A O O
unless N/A O O
Oxalis N/A B-EST B-EST
is N/A O O
planning N/A O O
to N/A O O
bring N/A O O
back N/A O O
the N/A O O
smoking N/A O O
section. N/A O O
Instead N/A O O
of N/A O O
serving N/A O O
as N/A O O
a N/A O O
street-side N/A O O
welcome N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
source N/A O O
of N/A O O
energy N/A O O
for N/A O O
the N/A O O
dining N/A O O
room, N/A O O
the N/A O O
bar N/A O O
feels N/A O O
like N/A O O
a N/A O O
waiting N/A O O
room. N/A O O
And N/A O O
while N/A O O
it N/A O O
takes N/A O O
reservations, N/A O O
the N/A O O
tasting N/A O O
menu N/A O O
isn't N/A O O
served N/A O O
there. N/A O O
The N/A O O
bar N/A O O
menu N/A O O
is N/A O O
à N/A O O
la N/A O O
carte. N/A O O
The N/A O O
dining N/A O O
room N/A O O
could N/A O O
use N/A O O
a N/A O O
little N/A O O
lift. N/A O O
It's N/A O O
as N/A O O
plain N/A O O
as N/A O O
a N/A O O
Shaker N/A O O
church, N/A O O
with N/A O O
clamshell-colored N/A O O
wainscoting N/A O O
below N/A O O
white N/A O O
walls N/A O O
unbroken N/A O O
by N/A O O
pictures N/A O O
or N/A O O
anything N/A O O
else. N/A O O
(All N/A O O
the N/A O O
art N/A O O
is N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
restroom.) N/A O O
The N/A O O
way N/A O O
the N/A O O
servers N/A O O
have N/A O O
been N/A O O
coached N/A O O
on N/A O O
their N/A O O
lines N/A O O
so N/A O O
far N/A O O
underlines N/A O O
the N/A O O
decorative N/A O O
stiffness. N/A O O
They N/A O O
say N/A O O
stuff N/A O O
like N/A O O
"Moving N/A O O
now N/A O O
into N/A O O
more N/A O O
sweet N/A O O
things N/A O O
…" N/A O O
rather N/A O O
than N/A O O
"Here's N/A O O
your N/A O O
dessert," N/A O O
and N/A O O
my N/A O O
neighbor N/A O O
one N/A O O
night N/A O O
was N/A O O
instructed N/A O O
to N/A O O
"sit N/A O O
back N/A O O
and N/A O O
relax," N/A O O
something N/A O O
that N/A O O
tends N/A O O
to N/A O O
go N/A O O
without N/A O O
saying N/A O O
in N/A O O
most N/A O O
restaurants. N/A O O
Things N/A O O
have N/A O O
loosened N/A O O
up N/A O O
since N/A O O
the N/A O O
liquor N/A O O
license N/A O O
came N/A O O
through. N/A O O
In N/A O O
the N/A O O
first N/A O O
few N/A O O
weeks, N/A O O
the N/A O O
servers N/A O O
were N/A O O
always N/A O O
trying N/A O O
to N/A O O
push N/A O O
a N/A O O
nonalcoholic N/A O O
beverage N/A O O
pairing N/A O O
for N/A O O
$20, N/A O O
and N/A O O
while N/A O O
the N/A O O
bar N/A O O
was N/A O O
mixing N/A O O
sodas N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
that N/A O O
were N/A O O
more N/A O O
interesting N/A O O
than N/A O O
many N/A O O
cocktails N/A B-FOOD O
around N/A O O
town, N/A O O
I'm N/A O O
not N/A O O
sure N/A O O
they N/A O O
were N/A O O
different N/A O O
enough N/A O O
from N/A O O
one N/A O O
another N/A O O
to N/A O O
justify N/A O O
drinking N/A O O
the N/A O O
whole N/A O O
slate. N/A O O
Now N/A O O
there N/A O O
are N/A O O
also N/A O O
wine N/A B-FOOD O
pairings, N/A O O
starting N/A O O
at N/A O O
$35. N/A O O
Sometimes N/A O O
I N/A O O
wondered N/A O O
whether N/A O O
it N/A O O
would N/A O O
get N/A O O
the N/A O O
air N/A O O
circulating N/A O O
if N/A O O
the N/A O O
bar N/A O O
popped N/A O O
up N/A O O

the N/A O O

Congee, N/A O O

customarily N/A O O
the N/A O O

a N/A O O

Mr. N/A O O
Ly N/A O O
cooks N/A O O
his N/A O O
congee N/A O O
with N/A O O
some N/A O O
chicken N/A O O
stock N/A O O
until N/A O O
it N/A O O
has N/A O O
the N/A O O
consistency N/A O O
of N/A O O
polenta, N/A O O
then N/A O O
spoons N/A O O
over N/A O O
it N/A O O
some N/A O O
sweet N/A O O
and N/A O O
savory N/A O O
braised N/A O O
oxtails N/A O O
in N/A O O
honey, N/A O O
fish N/A O O
sauce N/A O O
and N/A O O
brown N/A O O
butter. N/A O O
Everything N/A O O
about N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
wonderful, N/A O O
even N/A O O
the N/A O O
scallion N/A O O
greens N/A O O
on N/A O O
top. N/A O O
The N/A O O
first N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
seven N/A O O
beefs N/A O O
is N/A O O
typically N/A O O
boi N/A O O
tai N/A O O
chanh, N/A O O
a N/A O O
raw N/A O O
beef N/A O O
salad, N/A O O
and N/A O O
this N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
high N/A O O
point, N/A O O
too. N/A O O
Lean N/A O O

Pretty N/A O O
standard N/A O O
stuff N/A O O
so N/A O O
far, N/A O O
but N/A O O
then N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Ly N/A O O
bathes N/A O O
the N/A O O
salad N/A O O
in N/A O O
tangerine-lime N/A O O
vinaigrette, N/A O O
which N/A O O
has N/A O O
a N/A O O
positively N/A O O
buoyant N/A O O
effect, N/A O O
and N/A O O
splashes N/A O O
it N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
bright-green, N/A O O
lemony N/A O O
pulp N/A O O
of N/A O O
fresh N/A O O

In N/A O O
the N/A O O
middle N/A O O
of N/A O O
this N/A O O
$59 N/A O O
menu N/A O O
come N/A O O
the N/A O O
grilled N/A O O
meats, N/A O O
the N/A O O
courses N/A O O
for N/A O O
which N/A O O
the N/A O O

salad N/A O O
and N/A O O
rice N/A O O
paper N/A O O
wrappers N/A O O
have N/A O O
been N/A O O
waiting. N/A O O
The N/A O O
finest N/A O O
of N/A O O
these N/A O O
might N/A O O
be N/A O O
the N/A O O
relatively N/A O O
straightforward N/A O O
five-spice N/A O O
tongue, N/A O O
although N/A O O

are N/A O O
soothing N/A O O

the N/A O O
New N/A O O
York N/A O O
strip N/A O O
with N/A O O
marrow N/A O O
butter N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
clever N/A O O
way N/A O O
to N/A O O
acknowledge N/A O O
Manhattan's N/A O O
own N/A O O
beef-eating N/A O O
rituals, N/A O O
even N/A O O
if N/A O O
it N/A O O
would N/A O O
draw N/A O O
blank N/A O O
stares N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
streets N/A O O
of N/A O O
Saigon. N/A O O
If N/A O O
you, N/A O O
like N/A O O
me, N/A O O
are N/A O O
naturally N/A O O
skeptical N/A O O
when N/A O O
servers N/A O O
persistently N/A O O
push N/A O O
a N/A O O
big-ticket N/A O O
item, N/A O O
you N/A O O
might N/A O O
be N/A O O
tempted N/A O O
to N/A O O
blaze N/A O O
your N/A O O
own N/A O O
path N/A O O
through N/A O O
Madame N/A O O
Vo N/A O O
BBQ's N/A O O
menu. N/A O O
But N/A O O
once N/A O O
you've N/A O O
tried N/A O O
the N/A O O
bo N/A O O
bay N/A O O
mon N/A O O
you N/A O O
have, N/A O O
by N/A O O
and N/A O O
large, N/A O O
seen N/A O O
the N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
at N/A O O
its N/A O O
best. N/A O O
Yes, N/A O O
you N/A O O
could N/A O O
get N/A O O
the N/A O O
whole N/A O O
catfish, N/A O O
and N/A O O
if N/A O O
you N/A O O
are N/A O O
not N/A O O
into N/A O O
beef N/A O O
perhaps N/A O O
you N/A O O
should. N/A O O
Despite N/A O O
what N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
says, N/A O O
the N/A O O
catfish N/A O O
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
grilled, N/A O O
but N/A O O
fried N/A O O
and N/A O O
then N/A O O
baked. N/A O O
It N/A O O
was N/A O O
perfectly N/A O O
done N/A O O
the N/A O O
night N/A O O
I N/A O O
had N/A O O
it, N/A O O
and N/A O O
was N/A O O
filleted N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
table N/A O O
by N/A O O
a N/A O O
server N/A O O
who N/A O O
knew N/A O O
his N/A O O
way N/A O O
around N/A O O
a N/A O O
fish N/A O O
skeleton. N/A O O
By N/A O O
that N/A O O
time, N/A O O
all N/A O O
that N/A O O
was N/A O O
left N/A O O
to N/A O O
do N/A O O
was N/A O O
to N/A O O
wrap N/A O O
a N/A O O
chunk N/A O O
of N/A O O
fish N/A O O
in N/A O O
lettuce N/A O O
and N/A O O
rice N/A O O
paper N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
squeeze N/A O O
of N/A O O
grilled N/A O O
lemon N/A O O
and N/A O O
some N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
sautéed N/A O O
shallots, N/A O O
lemongrass N/A O O
and N/A O O
bird N/A O O
chiles N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
had N/A O O
ladled N/A O O
along N/A O O
the N/A O O
snaking N/A O O
curve N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
spine. N/A O O
If N/A O O
you N/A O O
are N/A O O
thinking N/A O O
about N/A O O
a N/A O O
vegetable, N/A O O
the N/A O O
skewered N/A O O
and N/A O O
grilled N/A O O
okra N/A O O
pods N/A O O
in N/A O O
soy N/A O O
are N/A O O
crunchy N/A O O
and N/A O O
unslimy. N/A O O
The N/A O O
other N/A O O
appetizers, N/A O O
though, N/A O O
can N/A O O
be N/A O O
tricky. N/A O O
One N/A O O
night, N/A O O
the N/A O O
grilled N/A O O
scallop N/A O O
brushed N/A O O
with N/A O O
duck N/A O O
fat N/A O O
was N/A O O
transporting; N/A O O
on N/A O O
another, N/A O O
it N/A O O
tasted N/A O O
too N/A O O
much N/A O O
like N/A O O
the N/A O O
grill. N/A O O
Spring N/A O O
rolls N/A O O
filled N/A O O
with N/A O O
short N/A O O
rib N/A O O
and N/A O O
bone N/A O O
marrow N/A O O
seemed N/A O O
pointlessly N/A O O
indulgent, N/A O O
and N/A O O
so N/A O O
did N/A O O
their N/A O O
truffle N/A O O
hoisin N/A O O
dipping N/A O O
sauce N/A O O
in N/A O O
which N/A O O
I N/A O O
couldn't N/A O O
taste N/A O O
the N/A O O
truffles. N/A O O
A N/A O O
few N/A O O
dishes N/A O O
might N/A O O
have N/A O O
been N/A O O
improved N/A O O
if N/A O O
they'd N/A O O
arrived N/A O O
while N/A O O
hot, N/A O O
like N/A O O
the N/A O O
extra-large N/A O O
grilled N/A O O
oysters N/A O O
under N/A O O
caramelized N/A O O
sea N/A O O
urchin N/A O O
mayonnaise N/A O O
or N/A O O
the N/A O O
charred N/A O O
sea N/A O O
urchin, N/A O O
basted N/A O O
in N/A O O
its N/A O O
shell N/A O O
with N/A O O
butter, N/A O O
sake N/A O O
and N/A O O
fish N/A O O
sauce. N/A O O
Grilled N/A O O
prawns N/A O O
brushed N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
lovely N/A O O
orange N/A O O
butter N/A O O
were N/A O O
slightly N/A O O
more N/A O O
mushy N/A O O
than N/A O O
two N/A O O
prawns N/A O O
sold N/A O O
for N/A O O
$38 N/A O O
should N/A O O
be. N/A O O
And N/A O O
while N/A O O
the N/A O O
44-ounce N/A O O
tomahawk N/A O O
steak N/A O O
was N/A O O
more N/A O O
than N/A O O
a N/A O O
fair N/A O O
deal N/A O O
at N/A O O
$90, N/A O O
it N/A O O
would N/A O O
have N/A O O
been N/A O O
helped N/A O O
by N/A O O
a N/A O O
more N/A O O
aggressive N/A O O
sear N/A O O
and N/A O O
more N/A O O
salt. N/A O O
On N/A O O
certain N/A O O
nights, N/A O O
the N/A O O
whole N/A O O
operation N/A O O
had N/A O O
a N/A O O
slack, N/A O O
inattentive N/A O O
feeling N/A O O
that's N/A O O
rare N/A O O
in N/A O O
new N/A O O
restaurants. N/A O O
The N/A O O
catfish N/A O O
sat N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
table, N/A O O
getting N/A O O
cold, N/A O O
while N/A O O
we N/A O O
waited N/A O O
for N/A O O
the N/A O O
table N/A O O
salad N/A O O
to N/A O O
show N/A O O
up. N/A O O
The N/A O O
thick N/A O O
stems N/A O O
of N/A O O
stir-fried N/A O O
morning N/A O O
glory N/A O O
would N/A O O
have N/A O O

better N/A O O
cut N/A O O
into N/A O O
shorter N/A O O
lengths. N/A O O

On N/A O O
March N/A O O
1, N/A O O
looking N/A O O
forward N/A O O
to N/A O O
spring, N/A O O
he N/A O O
added N/A O O
cherry N/A O O
leaves N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
mix. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Byun, N/A O O
a N/A O O
Korean-American, N/A O O
ferments N/A O O
daikon, N/A O O
cabbage N/A O O
and N/A O O
sesame N/A O O
seeds N/A O O
to N/A O O
make N/A O O
white N/A O O
kimchi, N/A O O
which N/A O O
he N/A O O
wraps N/A O O
inside N/A O O
nori N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O
tuna N/A O O
roll. N/A O O
You N/A O O
eat N/A O O
it N/A O O
like N/A O O
an N/A O O
ice N/A O O
cream N/A O O
cone, N/A O O
but N/A O O
faster. N/A O O
When N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Byun N/A O O
worked N/A O O
at N/A O O
Sushi N/A O O
Nakazawa, N/A O O
much N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
seafood N/A O O
he N/A O O
used N/A O O
was N/A O O
flown N/A O O
in N/A O O
from N/A O O
Japan. N/A O O
At N/A O O
Odo, N/A O O
almost N/A O O
all N/A O O
the N/A O O
fish N/A O O
have N/A O O
been N/A O O
caught N/A O O
off N/A O O
the N/A O O
East N/A O O
Coast N/A O O
of N/A O O
North N/A O O
America: N/A O O
Long N/A O O
Island N/A O O
black N/A O O
sea N/A O O
bass, N/A O O
Florida N/A O O
mackerel N/A O O
and N/A O O
North N/A O O
Carolina N/A O O
bluefin N/A O O
tuna, N/A O O
which N/A O O
may N/A O O
be N/A O O
several N/A O O
weeks N/A O O
old N/A O O
before N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Byun N/A O O
is N/A O O
ready N/A O O
to N/A O O
serve N/A O O
it. N/A O O
This N/A O O
sushi N/A O O
reflects N/A O O
the N/A O O
American N/A O O
region N/A O O
where N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
made, N/A O O
incorporates N/A O O
the N/A O O
Korean N/A O O
background N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
chef N/A O O
making N/A O O
it N/A O O
and N/A O O
still N/A O O
has N/A O O
an N/A O O
unmistakably N/A O O
Japanese N/A O O
spirit. N/A O O
This N/A O O
one N/A O O
course, N/A O O
if N/A O O
tripled N/A O O
in N/A O O
length, N/A O O
could N/A O O
be N/A O O
spun N/A O O
off N/A O O
into N/A O O
a N/A O O
separate N/A O O
establishment N/A O O
that N/A O O
would N/A O O
probably N/A O O
be N/A O O
among N/A O O
the N/A O O
top N/A O O
two N/A O O
dozen N/A O O
sushi N/A O O
restaurants N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
city. N/A O O
The N/A O O
second N/A O O
time N/A O O
an N/A O O
Odo N/A O O
course N/A O O
is N/A O O
prepared N/A O O
while N/A O O
you N/A O O
watch, N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
made N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
cocktail N/A O O
shaker N/A O O
and N/A O O
served N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
cocktail N/A O O
glass. N/A O O
It N/A O O
is, N/A O O
as N/A O O
you N/A O O
may N/A O O
have N/A O O
guessed, N/A O O
a N/A O O
cocktail, N/A O O
though N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
also N/A O O
the N/A O O
first N/A O O
of N/A O O
two N/A O O
desserts, N/A O O
sweetish N/A O O
and N/A O O
not N/A O O
especially N/A O O
boozy. N/A O O
Frank N/A O O
Cisneros, N/A O O
the N/A O O
sommelier, N/A O O
subordinates N/A O O
the N/A O O
alcohol N/A O O
to N/A O O
fresh N/A O O
fruit, N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
style N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
revered N/A O O
Tokyo N/A O O
bar N/A O O
Gen N/A O O
Yamamoto N/A O O
. N/A O O
Barrel-aged N/A O O
shochu N/A O O
is N/A O O
muddled N/A O O
with N/A O O
one N/A O O
or N/A O O
two N/A O O
sprightly N/A O O
segments N/A O O
of N/A O O
mikan N/A O O
orange, N/A O O
subjected N/A O O
to N/A O O
a N/A O O
calisthenic N/A O O
shake N/A O O
and N/A O O
strained N/A O O
into N/A O O
a N/A O O
delicately N/A O O
etched N/A O O
glass N/A O O
before N/A O O
a N/A O O
shimmer N/A O O
of N/A O O
sparkling N/A O O
wine N/A O O
is N/A O O
laid N/A O O
down N/A O O
on N/A O O
top. N/A O O
Orange N/A O O
juice N/A O O
in N/A O O
cocktails N/A O O
usually N/A O O
tastes N/A O O
diluted N/A O O
and N/A O O
weak; N/A O O
in N/A O O
this N/A O O
drink, N/A O O
it N/A O O
was N/A O O
radiant. N/A O O
I N/A O O
would N/A O O
say N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
drinkable N/A O O
dessert N/A O O
course N/A O O
could N/A O O
be N/A O O
expanded N/A O O
into N/A O O
a N/A O O
separate N/A O O
cocktail N/A O O
bar, N/A O O
except N/A O O
that N/A O O
Odo N/A O O
already N/A O O
has N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
those. N/A O O
Odo, N/A O O
which N/A O O
opened N/A O O
in N/A O O
December N/A O O
a N/A O O
few N/A O O
minutes' N/A O O
walk N/A O O
from N/A O O
the N/A O O
Flatiron N/A O O
Building, N/A O O
is N/A O O
entered N/A O O
through N/A O O
a N/A O O
door N/A O O
hidden N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
back N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
compact N/A O O
den N/A O O
-- N/A O O
cafe N/A O O
by N/A O O
day N/A O O
and N/A O O
bar N/A O O
by N/A O O
night N/A O O
-- N/A O O
called N/A O O
Hall. N/A O O
This N/A O O
arrangement N/A O O
seems N/A O O
to N/A O O
remind N/A O O
people N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
speakeasy, N/A O O
although N/A O O
it N/A O O
would N/A O O
take N/A O O
an N/A O O
especially N/A O O
clueless N/A O O
bootlegger N/A O O
to N/A O O
open N/A O O
a N/A O O
speakeasy N/A O O
inside N/A O O
a N/A O O
bar. N/A O O
So N/A O O
far, N/A O O
Hall N/A O O
has N/A O O
not N/A O O
been N/A O O
fully N/A O O
discovered, N/A O O
but N/A O O
it N/A O O
still N/A O O
gets N/A O O
busy N/A O O
enough N/A O O
at N/A O O
dinner N/A O O
time N/A O O
that N/A O O
you N/A O O
can N/A O O
be N/A O O
stranded N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
front N/A O O
door N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O
few N/A O O
minutes N/A O O
before N/A O O
anyone N/A O O
on N/A O O
staff N/A O O
notices. N/A O O
Some N/A O O
diners N/A O O
on N/A O O
their N/A O O
way N/A O O
to N/A O O
Odo N/A O O
will N/A O O
find N/A O O
this N/A O O
an N/A O O
awkward N/A O O
start N/A O O
to N/A O O
a N/A O O
meal N/A O O
that N/A O O
costs N/A O O
$200 N/A O O
before N/A O O
tax, N/A O O
tip N/A O O
and N/A O O
drinks. N/A O O
But N/A O O
they N/A O O
may N/A O O
also N/A O O
discern N/A O O
that N/A O O
Hall, N/A O O
lined N/A O O
with N/A O O
carved N/A O O
oak N/A O O
panels N/A O O
salvaged N/A O O
from N/A O O
what N/A O O
appears N/A O O
to N/A O O
have N/A O O
been N/A O O
a N/A O O
library N/A O O
or N/A O O
church N/A O O
vestry N/A O O
from N/A O O
around N/A O O
1900, N/A O O
is N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
neighborhood's N/A O O
most N/A O O
entrancing N/A O O
rooms; N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
corridor, N/A O O
which N/A O O
seems N/A O O
too N/A O O
narrow N/A O O
and N/A O O
definitely N/A O O
climbs N/A O O
on N/A O O
its N/A O O
way N/A O O
toward N/A O O
a N/A O O
too-short N/A O O
brass N/A O O
door N/A O O
with N/A O O
no N/A O O
handle, N/A O O
is N/A O O
perspective-altering N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
way N/A O O
a N/A O O
Surrealist N/A O O
would N/A O O
enjoy; N/A O O
and N/A O O
that N/A O O
Odo, N/A O O
a N/A O O
shadowy N/A O O
and N/A O O
windowless N/A O O
space N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
far N/A O O
side N/A O O
of N/A O O
that N/A O O
door N/A O O
is N/A O O
an N/A O O
unusually N/A O O
tranquil N/A O O
shelter N/A O O
from N/A O O
crowds, N/A O O
noise N/A O O
and N/A O O
anything N/A O O
else N/A O O
you N/A O O
might N/A O O
want N/A O O
to N/A O O
get N/A O O
away N/A O O
from N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O
couple N/A O O
of N/A O O
hours. N/A O O
The N/A O O
14 N/A O O
counter N/A O O
seats N/A O O
face N/A O O
the N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
and, N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
middle N/A O O
of N/A O O
it, N/A O O
a N/A O O
charcoal-gray N/A O O
island. N/A O O
This N/A O O
is N/A O O
where N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Odo N/A O O
and N/A O O
his N/A O O
cooks N/A O O
assemble N/A O O
the N/A O O
other N/A O O
courses N/A O O
I N/A O O
promised N/A O O
to N/A O O
tell N/A O O
you N/A O O
about. N/A O O
Duck N/A O O
breast N/A O O
has N/A O O
been N/A O O
grilled N/A O O
over N/A O O
charcoal N/A O O
and N/A O O
positioned N/A O O
between N/A O O
two N/A O O
sauces. N/A O O
One N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
black N/A O O
spill N/A O O
of N/A O O
concentrated N/A O O
soy N/A O O
spiced N/A O O
with N/A O O
sansho N/A O O
pepper; N/A O O
the N/A O O
other N/A O O
is N/A O O
an N/A O O
ivory N/A O O
pool N/A O O
of N/A O O
puréed N/A O O
apples N/A O O
and N/A O O
cream. N/A O O
These N/A O O
sauces N/A O O
contrast N/A O O
in N/A O O
every N/A O O
way N/A O O
you N/A O O
can N/A O O
think N/A O O
of, N/A O O
including N/A O O
East N/A O O
versus N/A O O
West, N/A O O
and N/A O O
they N/A O O
come N/A O O
together N/A O O
like N/A O O
opposing N/A O O
poles N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
magnet. N/A O O
A N/A O O
springy N/A O O
chunk N/A O O
of N/A O O
truffle-flavored N/A O O
mochi N/A O O
is N/A O O
crisped N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
grill N/A O O
and N/A O O
engulfed N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
white-miso N/A O O
soup N/A O O
that N/A O O
has N/A O O
grated N/A O O
white N/A O O
truffles N/A O O
floating N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
surface. N/A O O
You N/A O O
smell N/A O O
truffles N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
air N/A O O
first, N/A O O
get N/A O O
them N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
tip N/A O O
of N/A O O
your N/A O O
tongue N/A O O
next N/A O O
and N/A O O
finally N/A O O
taste N/A O O
them N/A O O
everywhere N/A O O
when N/A O O
they're N/A O O
released N/A O O
from N/A O O
the N/A O O
mochi. N/A O O
A N/A O O
croquette N/A O O
tastes N/A O O
something N/A O O
like N/A O O
an N/A O O
Italian N/A O O
rice N/A O O
ball N/A O O
made N/A O O
from N/A O O
New N/A O O
England N/A O O
clam N/A O O
chowder N/A O O
that N/A O O
has N/A O O
young N/A O O
bamboo N/A O O
shoots N/A O O
in N/A O O
it. N/A O O
This N/A O O
golden, N/A O O
breaded N/A O O
arancino N/A O O
is N/A O O
finished N/A O O
with N/A O O
dots N/A O O
of N/A O O
grated N/A O O
goat N/A O O
cheese. N/A O O
Shaved N/A O O

as N/A O O
thin N/A O O
as N/A O O
licorice N/A O O

are N/A O O
served, N/A O O
still N/A O O
cooking, N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
hot N/A O O
broth, N/A O O
a N/A O O
kaiseki N/A O O

Odo N/A O O
-- N/A O O
incidentally, N/A O O
the N/A O O
name N/A O O
is N/A O O
pronounced N/A O O
as N/A O O
a N/A O O
set N/A O O
of N/A O O
initials, N/A O O
O.D.O. N/A O O
-- N/A O O
pursues N/A O O
local N/A O O
ingredients N/A O O
not N/A O O
just N/A O O
for N/A O O
its N/A O O
sushi N/A O O
course N/A O O
but N/A O O
throughout N/A O O
its N/A O O
menu. N/A O O
The N/A O O
simmered N/A O O
lamb N/A O O
used N/A O O
to N/A O O
gambol N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
Hudson N/A O O

the N/A O O
croquetted N/A O O
topneck N/A O O
clams N/A O O
were N/A O O
raked N/A O O
in N/A O O
off N/A O O
Long N/A O O
Island N/A O O
and N/A O O
so N/A O O
on. N/A O O
Kaiseki's N/A O O
near-liturgical N/A O O
focus N/A O O
on N/A O O
timeliness N/A O O
almost N/A O O
seems N/A O O
to N/A O O
demand N/A O O
local N/A O O
ingredients, N/A O O
and N/A O O
they N/A O O
have N/A O O
been N/A O O
central N/A O O
to N/A O O
Niki N/A O O
Nakayama's N/A O O
strategy N/A O O
at N/A O O
n/naka N/A O O
in N/A O O

but N/A O O
less N/A O O
so N/A O O
for N/A O O
New N/A O O

few N/A O O
kaiseki N/A O O

to N/A O O
import N/A O O
traditional N/A O O
ingredients N/A O O
from N/A O O
Japan N/A O O
the N/A O O
minute N/A O O
they're N/A O O
available. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Odo N/A O O
came N/A O O
to N/A O O
New N/A O O
York N/A O O
as N/A O O
the N/A O O
chef N/A O O
of N/A O O
Kajitsu N/A O O
, N/A O O
the N/A O O
extraordinary N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
on N/A O O
East N/A O O
39th N/A O O
Street N/A O O
that N/A O O
follows N/A O O
the N/A O O
vegetarian N/A O O
cooking N/A O O
tradition N/A O O
known N/A O O
as N/A O O
shojin N/A O O
ryori, N/A O O
born N/A O O
centuries N/A O O
ago N/A O O
in N/A O O
Zen N/A O O
Buddhist N/A O O
temples. N/A O O
One N/A O O
contribution N/A O O
he N/A O O
made N/A O O
in N/A O O
his N/A O O
five N/A O O
years N/A O O
there N/A O O
was N/A O O
to N/A O O
freshen N/A O O
up N/A O O
the N/A O O
menus N/A O O
with N/A O O
more N/A O O
food N/A O O
grown N/A O O
nearby. N/A O O
In N/A O O
the N/A O O
first N/A O O
and N/A O O
last N/A O O
tastes N/A O O
of N/A O O
his N/A O O
February N/A O O
and N/A O O
March N/A O O
menus, N/A O O
he N/A O O
anchors N/A O O
Odo N/A O O
firmly N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
New N/A O O
York N/A O O
region. N/A O O
When N/A O O
you N/A O O
sit N/A O O
down, N/A O O
you N/A O O
are N/A O O
immediately N/A O O
poured N/A O O
a N/A O O
cup N/A O O
of N/A O O
cold N/A O O
sake. N/A O O
It N/A O O
is N/A O O
brewed N/A O O
in N/A O O
Brooklyn, N/A O O
and N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
very N/A O O
good, N/A O O
swirling N/A O O
with N/A O O

Then N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
end, N/A O O
after N/A O O
the N/A O O
fresh N/A O O
fruit, N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Odo N/A O O
serves N/A O O
ice N/A O O
cream N/A O O
made N/A O O
with N/A O O
kasu, N/A O O
the N/A O O
creamy N/A O O
solids N/A O O
left N/A O O
over N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
end N/A O O
of N/A O O
sake N/A O O
distillation. N/A O O
The N/A O O
ice N/A O O
cream N/A O O
looks N/A O O
like N/A O O
vanilla N/A O O
and N/A O O
tastes, N/A O O
not N/A O O
surprisingly, N/A O O
like N/A O O
fermented N/A O O
rice. N/A O O
This N/A O O
particular N/A O O
kasu N/A O O
is N/A O O
supplied N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
same N/A O O
brewery N/A O O
in N/A O O
Brooklyn N/A O O
that N/A O O
makes N/A O O
the N/A O O

Expanding N/A O O
his N/A O O
range N/A O O
to N/A O O
meat N/A O O

fish N/A O O
at N/A O O
Odo, N/A O O
he N/A O O
has N/A O O
kept N/A O O
the N/A O O
resourcefulness N/A O O
that N/A O O
limitations N/A O O
encourage. N/A O O
Somewhere N/A O O
along N/A O O
the N/A O O
way N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Odo N/A O O
also N/A O O
picked N/A O O
up N/A O O
technical N/A O O
skills N/A O O
in N/A O O
traditions N/A O O
far N/A O O
outside N/A O O
kaiseki. N/A O O
Each N/A O O
night, N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
gohan N/A O O
course, N/A O O
Odo N/A O O
offers N/A O O
a N/A O O
choice N/A O O
of N/A O O
three N/A O O
starchy N/A O O
dishes. N/A O O
This N/A O O
is N/A O O
where N/A O O
I N/A O O
encountered N/A O O
a N/A O O
very N/A O O
fine N/A O O
seafood N/A O O
curry N/A O O
over N/A O O
rice; N/A O O
an N/A O O
elegant N/A O O
bowl N/A O O
of N/A O O
short N/A O O
ramen N/A O O
noodles N/A O O
in N/A O O
king N/A O O
crab N/A O O
broth; N/A O O
and N/A O O
fresh N/A O O
soba N/A O O
served N/A O O
with N/A O O
little N/A O O
pieces N/A O O
of N/A O O
pickled N/A O O
vegetables N/A O O
and N/A O O
wasabi N/A O O
blossoms, N/A O O
looking N/A O O
a N/A O O
bit N/A O O
like N/A O O
broccoli N/A O O
florets N/A O O
but N/A O O
tasting N/A O O
like N/A O O
mustard. N/A O O
As N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
cocktail N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
sushi, N/A O O
each N/A O O
of N/A O O
these N/A O O
dishes N/A O O
could, N/A O O
if N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Odo N/A O O
wanted, N/A O O
be N/A O O
leveraged N/A O O
into N/A O O
separate N/A O O
specialized N/A O O
restaurants, N/A O O
or N/A O O
food-hall N/A O O
stands. N/A O O
You N/A O O
could N/A O O
tell N/A O O
yourself N/A O O
that N/A O O
$200 N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
large N/A O O
amount N/A O O
of N/A O O
money N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O
single N/A O O
meal N/A O O
or N/A O O
you N/A O O
could N/A O O
say N/A O O
that N/A O O
for N/A O O
the N/A O O
chance N/A O O
to N/A O O
visit N/A O O
all N/A O O
these N/A O O
different N/A O O
establishments N/A O O
without N/A O O
leaving N/A O O
your N/A O O
seat, N/A O O
it's N/A O O
a N/A O O
pretty N/A O O
good N/A O O
deal. N/A O O
Either N/A O O
way, N/A O O
you'd N/A O O
be N/A O O
right. N/A O O

a N/A O O
little N/A O O
salty, N/A O O
crunchy N/A O O

not N/A O O
brittle, N/A O O
more N/A O O

highly N/A O O

it's N/A O O

on N/A O O
Al N/A O O
Forno's N/A O O
menu N/A O O
reminded N/A O O
me N/A O O
of N/A O O
pies N/A O O
I'd N/A O O
eaten N/A O O
at N/A O O
Violet. N/A O O
One N/A O O
resembled N/A O O
the N/A O O
Atwells, N/A O O
but N/A O O
its N/A O O
pesto N/A O O
was N/A O O
made N/A O O
with N/A O O
asparagus N/A O O
rather N/A O O
than N/A O O
broccoli. N/A O O
For N/A O O
Violet's N/A O O
Beech N/A O O
Vibes, N/A O O
a N/A O O
thin N/A O O
layer N/A O O
of N/A O O
duxelles N/A O O
is N/A O O
spread N/A O O
from N/A O O
rim N/A O O
to N/A O O
rim, N/A O O
then N/A O O
topped N/A O O
with N/A O O
tahini, N/A O O
caramelized N/A O O
onions N/A O O
and N/A O O
pickled N/A O O
beech N/A O O
mushrooms. N/A O O
It N/A O O
reminds N/A O O
me N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
pissaladière N/A O O
in N/A O O
which N/A O O
the N/A O O
anchovies N/A O O
have N/A O O
been N/A O O
replaced N/A O O
by N/A O O
mushrooms. N/A O O
Al N/A O O
Forno N/A O O
makes N/A O O
a N/A O O
duxelles N/A O O
pizza, N/A O O
too, N/A O O
but N/A O O
tops N/A O O
it N/A O O
with N/A O O
unpickled N/A O O
white N/A O O
mushrooms, N/A O O
and N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
use N/A O O
tahini. N/A O O
And, N/A O O
of N/A O O
course, N/A O O
both N/A O O
places N/A O O
do N/A O O
a N/A O O
variation N/A O O
on N/A O O
a N/A O O
Neapolitan N/A O O
margherita, N/A O O
called N/A O O
the N/A O O
margarita N/A O O
in N/A O O
Providence N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
Classic N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
East N/A O O
Village. N/A O O
The N/A O O
difference N/A O O
between N/A O O
their N/A O O
dough N/A O O
recipes N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
quite N/A O O
put N/A O O
to N/A O O
rest N/A O O
the N/A O O
suspicion N/A O O
that N/A O O
Violet N/A O O
should N/A O O
be N/A O O
more N/A O O
conscientious N/A O O
about N/A O O
avoiding N/A O O
overlap N/A O O
even N/A O O
though N/A O O
Al N/A O O
Forno N/A O O
is N/A O O
180 N/A O O
miles N/A O O
away. N/A O O
Most N/A O O
diners, N/A O O
of N/A O O
course, N/A O O
will N/A O O
just N/A O O
be N/A O O
happy N/A O O
to N/A O O
have N/A O O
a N/A O O
new N/A O O
style N/A O O
of N/A O O
pizza N/A O O
in N/A O O
town. N/A O O
Any N/A O O
of N/A O O
Violet's N/A O O
pies, N/A O O
eaten N/A O O
before N/A O O
or N/A O O
after N/A O O
the N/A O O
iceberg-wedge N/A O O
salad N/A O O
with N/A O O
blue N/A O O
cheese N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
jolt N/A O O
of N/A O O
ranch N/A O O
dressing, N/A O O
or N/A O O
the N/A O O
frisée N/A O O
salad N/A O O
tossed N/A O O
with N/A O O
fried N/A O O
artichokes, N/A O O
would N/A O O
make N/A O O
an N/A O O
ideal N/A O O
fast N/A O O
dinner. N/A O O
Beyond N/A O O
that, N/A O O
the N/A O O
going N/A O O
can N/A O O
get N/A O O
tricky. N/A O O
All N/A O O
the N/A O O
pastas N/A O O
I N/A O O
tried N/A O O
seemed N/A O O
like N/A O O
rough N/A O O
drafts, N/A O O
from N/A O O
the N/A O O
radiatore N/A O O
baked N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
very N/A O O
salty N/A O O
vodka N/A O O
sauce N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
spaghetti N/A O O
con N/A O O
vongole N/A O O
con N/A O O
dashi, N/A O O
a N/A O O
Japanese-Italian N/A O O
blind N/A O O
date N/A O O
that N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
have N/A O O
the N/A O O
right N/A O O
chemistry. N/A O O
The N/A O O
two N/A O O
desserts N/A O O
I N/A O O
had N/A O O
were N/A O O
even N/A O O
stranger. N/A O O
Describing N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
them, N/A O O
a N/A O O
cheesecake N/A O O
with N/A O O
banana N/A O O
pudding N/A O O
on N/A O O
it, N/A O O
the N/A O O
server N/A O O
said, N/A O O
"I'm N/A O O
just N/A O O
going N/A O O
to N/A O O
tell N/A O O
you N/A O O
what N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
and N/A O O
if N/A O O
you N/A O O
guys N/A O O
want N/A O O
it, N/A O O
you N/A O O
can N/A O O
order N/A O O
it." N/A O O
If N/A O O
the N/A O O
warning N/A O O
had N/A O O
been N/A O O
any N/A O O
stronger N/A O O
it N/A O O
would N/A O O
have N/A O O
come N/A O O
with N/A O O
liability N/A O O
waivers. N/A O O
If N/A O O
you N/A O O
did N/A O O
want N/A O O
to N/A O O
build N/A O O
a N/A O O
longer N/A O O
meal, N/A O O
some N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
seafood N/A O O
appetizers N/A O O
can N/A O O
help. N/A O O
Not N/A O O
the N/A O O
"stuffies," N/A O O
baked N/A O O
stuffed N/A O O
littlenecks N/A O O
or N/A O O
cherrystones N/A O O
that N/A O O
could N/A O O
use N/A O O
more N/A O O
clam. N/A O O
The N/A O O
smoked N/A O O
mackerel, N/A O O
though, N/A O O
is N/A O O
excellent N/A O O
and N/A O O
comes N/A O O
with N/A O O
some N/A O O
unusually N/A O O
good N/A O O
fresh-fried N/A O O
potato N/A O O
chips. N/A O O
There N/A O O
are N/A O O
also N/A O O
shrimp N/A O O
that N/A O O
have N/A O O
been N/A O O
grilled N/A O O
with N/A O O
their N/A O O
heads N/A O O
and N/A O O
shells N/A O O
on, N/A O O
placed N/A O O
over N/A O O
johnnycakes N/A O O
and N/A O O
splashed N/A O O
with N/A O O
spiced N/A O O
piri-piri N/A O O
sauce. N/A O O
Johnnycakes, N/A O O
which N/A O O
are N/A O O
made N/A O O
of N/A O O
fried N/A O O
cornmeal N/A O O
mush N/A O O
and N/A O O
taste N/A O O
like N/A O O
it, N/A O O
are N/A O O
probably N/A O O
more N/A O O
strongly N/A O O
identified N/A O O
with N/A O O
Rhode N/A O O
Island N/A O O
than N/A O O
any N/A O O
other N/A O O
food. N/A O O
I N/A O O
have N/A O O
never N/A O O
been N/A O O
sure N/A O O
why, N/A O O
because N/A O O
johnnycakes N/A O O
can N/A O O
be N/A O O
found, N/A O O
if N/A O O
you N/A O O
really N/A O O
want N/A O O
to N/A O O
look N/A O O
for N/A O O
them, N/A O O
all N/A O O
along N/A O O
the N/A O O
Atlantic N/A O O
Coast. N/A O O
The N/A O O
only N/A O O
time N/A O O
I've N/A O O
seen N/A O O
Rhode N/A O O
Islanders N/A O O
eating N/A O O
them N/A O O
was N/A O O
on N/A O O
a N/A O O
Boy N/A O O
Scout N/A O O
camping N/A O O
trip, N/A O O
and N/A O O
boy N/A O O
scouts N/A O O
will N/A O O
eat N/A O O
anything N/A O O
if N/A O O
you N/A O O
leave N/A O O
them N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
woods N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O
few N/A O O
days. N/A O O
In N/A O O
any N/A O O
case, N/A O O
the N/A O O
johnnycakes N/A O O
that N/A O O
Violet N/A O O
places N/A O O
under N/A O O
the N/A O O
shrimp N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
piri-piri N/A O O
sauce N/A O O
are N/A O O
kind N/A O O
of N/A O O
wonderful. N/A O O
The N/A O O
cornmeal N/A O O
has N/A O O
a N/A O O
lush, N/A O O
right-off-the-cob N/A O O
flavor. N/A O O
I'd N/A O O
have N/A O O
them N/A O O
for N/A O O
breakfast, N/A O O
lunch N/A O O
or N/A O O
dinner. N/A O O
Is N/A O O
it N/A O O
possible N/A O O
that N/A O O

In O N/A O
2009, O N/A O
when O N/A O
it O N/A O
was O N/A O
new O N/A O
and O N/A O
Dan O N/A O

gave O N/A O

one O N/A O

and O N/A O
then O N/A O
lost O N/A O
track O N/A O
of O N/A O
it. O N/A O
In O N/A O
other O N/A O
words, O N/A O
the O N/A O
selection O N/A O
of O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O

For O N/A O
surprise O N/A O
value O N/A O
alone, O N/A O
it O N/A O
should O N/A O
have O N/A O
been O N/A O
one O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
year's O N/A O
most O N/A O
buzzed-about O N/A O

But O N/A O
the O N/A O
trumpets O N/A O
have O N/A O
been O N/A O
muted, O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
back O N/A O

seem O N/A O
to O N/A O
lack O N/A O
a O N/A O

This, O N/A O

The O N/A O

at O N/A O

seem O N/A O
to O N/A O
have O N/A O
an O N/A O
easy O N/A O
familiarity O N/A O
with O N/A O
Korean O N/A O
food. O N/A O
Some O N/A O
of O N/A O
them, O N/A O
at O N/A O
least, O N/A O
can O N/A O
probably O N/A O
thank O N/A O
Ms. O N/A O
Kwak O N/A O
for O N/A O
that. O N/A O
In O N/A O
1992, O N/A O
when O N/A O
she O N/A O
began O N/A O
serving O N/A O
the O N/A O
cuisine O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
East O N/A O
Village O N/A O
at O N/A O
her O N/A O
first O N/A O
restaurant, O N/A O
Dok O N/A O
Suni's, O N/A O
the O N/A O
words O N/A O
tteokbokki O N/A O
and O N/A O
seolleongtang O N/A O
and O N/A O
jajangmyeon O N/A O
did O N/A O
not O N/A O
roll O N/A O
off O N/A O
the O N/A O
tongues O N/A O
of O N/A O
most O N/A O
non-Koreans. O N/A O
But O N/A O
that's O N/A O
who O N/A O
she O N/A O
wanted O N/A O
to O N/A O
lure O N/A O
in O N/A O
with O N/A O
American O N/A O
music, O N/A O
date-night O N/A O
décor O N/A O
and O N/A O
Western-style O N/A O
service. O N/A O
Once O N/A O
she O N/A O
had O N/A O
them, O N/A O
she O N/A O
would O N/A O
tempt, O N/A O
teach, O N/A O
turn O N/A O
them O N/A O
on O N/A O
to O N/A O
the O N/A O
flavors O N/A O
she'd O N/A O
grown O N/A O
up O N/A O
with. O N/A O
Her O N/A O
mother, O N/A O
Myung O N/A O
Ja O N/A O
Kwak, O N/A O
shared O N/A O
cooking O N/A O
duties. O N/A O
Ms. O N/A O
Kwak's O N/A O
was O N/A O
not O N/A O
the O N/A O
take-it-or-leave-it O N/A O
approach O N/A O
of O N/A O
32nd O N/A O
Street, O N/A O
and O N/A O
she O N/A O
kept O N/A O
at O N/A O
it. O N/A O
She O N/A O
wrote O N/A O
"Dok O N/A O
Suni: O N/A O
Recipes O N/A O
From O N/A O
My O N/A O
Mother's O N/A O
Korean O N/A O

which O N/A O
was O N/A O
one O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
few O N/A O
Korean O N/A O
cookbooks O N/A O
in O N/A O
English O N/A O
when O N/A O
it O N/A O
came O N/A O
out, O N/A O
in O N/A O
1998. O N/A O
At O N/A O
her O N/A O
second O N/A O
restaurant, O N/A O
Do O N/A O
Hwa, O N/A O
she O N/A O
and O N/A O
her O N/A O
mother O N/A O
led O N/A O
customers O N/A O
deeper O N/A O
into O N/A O
unfamiliar O N/A O
ground. O N/A O
Each O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
restaurants O N/A O
stayed O N/A O
open O N/A O
for O N/A O
about O N/A O
two O N/A O
decades, O N/A O
which O N/A O
is O N/A O
a O N/A O
very O N/A O
long O N/A O
time O N/A O
in O N/A O
New O N/A O

If O N/A O
you O N/A O
want O N/A O
a O N/A O
metaphor O N/A O
for O N/A O
how O N/A O
effectively O N/A O
Ms. O N/A O
Kwak O N/A O
paved O N/A O
the O N/A O
way O N/A O
for O N/A O
restaurants O N/A O
like O N/A O
Atoboy O N/A O
, O N/A O
Soogil, O N/A O
Danji O N/A O
and O N/A O
others O N/A O
whose O N/A O
chefs O N/A O
weave O N/A O
Korean O N/A O
cuisine O N/A O
into O N/A O
new O N/A O
patterns, O N/A O
consider O N/A O
that O N/A O
one O N/A O
of O N/A O
them, O N/A O
Oiji, O N/A O
moved O N/A O
into O N/A O
its O N/A O

on O N/A O
First O N/A O

right O N/A O
after O N/A O
Dok O N/A O
Suni's O N/A O
moved O N/A O

Ms. O N/A O
Kwak O N/A O
is O N/A O
doing O N/A O
in O N/A O

isn't O N/A O
all O N/A O
that O N/A O
different O N/A O
from O N/A O

she O N/A O
has O N/A O
done O N/A O
all O N/A O
her O N/A O
career, O N/A O
except O N/A O
that O N/A O
by O N/A O
now O N/A O
South O N/A O
Korean O N/A O

has O N/A O
become O N/A O
comfort O N/A O
food O N/A O
for O N/A O
New O N/A O
York O N/A O
in O N/A O
general. O N/A O
Haenyeo O N/A O
does O N/A O
pay O N/A O
more O N/A O
attention O N/A O
to O N/A O
seafood O N/A O
than O N/A O
Dok O N/A O
Suni O N/A O
or O N/A O
Do O N/A O
Hwa O N/A O
did, O N/A O
though. O N/A O
Ms. O N/A O
Kwak O N/A O
hasn't O N/A O
gone O N/A O
pescatarian O N/A O
on O N/A O
us. O N/A O
She O N/A O
still O N/A O
serves O N/A O

pork O N/A O
and O N/A O
beef O N/A O
bulgogis O N/A O
with O N/A O

But O N/A O
her O N/A O
menu's O N/A O

has O N/A O
shifted O N/A O
slightly O N/A O
toward O N/A O
the O N/A O
ocean. O N/A O
This O N/A O
is O N/A O
good O N/A O
news, O N/A O
because O N/A O
the O N/A O
seafood O N/A O
at O N/A O
Haenyeo O N/A O
has O N/A O
a O N/A O
sparkle O N/A O
and O N/A O
sweetness O N/A O
you O N/A O
don't O N/A O
always O N/A O
find O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O

of O N/A O

A O N/A O
bibimbap O N/A O
variant O N/A O
may O N/A O
be O N/A O
the O N/A O
menu's O N/A O
sleeper O N/A O
dish, O N/A O
partly O N/A O
because O N/A O
it O N/A O

out O N/A O
looking O N/A O
like O N/A O
a O N/A O

It O N/A O
is O N/A O

At O N/A O

Hidden O N/A O

But O N/A O
there O N/A O
is O N/A O
a O N/A O

of O N/A O
spicy O N/A O

Both O N/A O
of O N/A O
them O N/A O
will O N/A O
break O N/A O

That's O N/A O

it, O N/A O
but O N/A O
it's O N/A O

and, O N/A O
with O N/A O
his O N/A O

Victor O N/A O

About O N/A O
four O N/A O
years O N/A O
ago, O N/A O
armed O N/A O
with O N/A O
picnic O N/A O

and O N/A O
a O N/A O

of O N/A O

the O N/A O
two O N/A O

began O N/A O

a O N/A O
different O N/A O
New O N/A O

The O N/A O
Puerto O N/A O

in O N/A O
New O N/A O

around O N/A O
1990, O N/A O
when O N/A O

of O N/A O

But O N/A O
there O N/A O
are O N/A O
not O N/A O
so O N/A O
many O N/A O
of O N/A O
these O N/A O
places O N/A O
left O N/A O
that O N/A O
we O N/A O

The O N/A O
Freakin O N/A O
Rican O N/A O
developed O N/A O
its O N/A O
act O N/A O
on O N/A O
the O N/A O
street-fair O N/A O
circuit, O N/A O
but O N/A O
it O N/A O
applied O N/A O
the O N/A O
same O N/A O
tactics O N/A O
that O N/A O
succeed O N/A O
at O N/A O
Smorgasburg O N/A O
and O N/A O
similar O N/A O
urban O N/A O
foraging O N/A O
grounds, O N/A O
where O N/A O
the O N/A O
ideal O N/A O
dish O N/A O
can O N/A O
be O N/A O
held O N/A O
in O N/A O
one O N/A O
hand, O N/A O
gets O N/A O
immediate O N/A O
attention, O N/A O
costs O N/A O
under O N/A O
$10 O N/A O
and O N/A O
can O N/A O
serve O N/A O
as O N/A O
a O N/A O
plank O N/A O
in O N/A O
a O N/A O
branding O N/A O
platform. O N/A O
This O N/A O
may O N/A O
explain O N/A O
why O N/A O
appetizers O N/A O
are O N/A O
the O N/A O
strong O N/A O
suit O N/A O
on O N/A O
the O N/A O
Freakin O N/A O
Rican O N/A O
menu. O N/A O
The O N/A O
sorullitos, O N/A O
Puerto O N/A O
Rico's O N/A O
answer O N/A O
to O N/A O
hush O N/A O
puppies, O N/A O
are O N/A O
an O N/A O
exception; O N/A O
they O N/A O
are O N/A O
dense O N/A O
and O N/A O
dry, O N/A O
as O N/A O
if O N/A O
the O N/A O
cornmeal O N/A O
hadn't O N/A O
absorbed O N/A O
enough O N/A O
water. O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
López's O N/A O
alcapurrias, O N/A O
though, O N/A O
are O N/A O
very O N/A O
good, O N/A O
even O N/A O
if O N/A O
the O N/A O
picadillo O N/A O
that O N/A O
runs O N/A O
down O N/A O
the O N/A O
middle O N/A O
of O N/A O
a O N/A O
tube O N/A O
of O N/A O
mashed O N/A O
fried O N/A O
plantains O N/A O
like O N/A O
the O N/A O
graphite O N/A O
in O N/A O
a O N/A O
pencil O N/A O
could O N/A O
be O N/A O
seasoned O N/A O
a O N/A O
little O N/A O
more O N/A O
forcefully. O N/A O
And O N/A O
his O N/A O
pasteles O N/A O
are O N/A O
exceptional. O N/A O
Pasteles O N/A O
are O N/A O
structured O N/A O
like O N/A O
tamales. O N/A O
Where O N/A O
the O N/A O
masa O N/A O
would O N/A O
be, O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
López O N/A O
makes O N/A O
a O N/A O
sweet, O N/A O
enjoyably O N/A O
gummy O N/A O
mash O N/A O
of O N/A O
green O N/A O
plantains, O N/A O
taro O N/A O
root O N/A O
and O N/A O
kabocha O N/A O
squash. O N/A O
The O N/A O
filling O N/A O
is O N/A O
a O N/A O
soft, O N/A O
rich O N/A O
vein O N/A O
of O N/A O
stewed O N/A O
pork O N/A O
shoulder O N/A O
with O N/A O
ham, O N/A O
bacon, O N/A O
red O N/A O
peppers O N/A O
and O N/A O
green O N/A O
olives. O N/A O
Rolled O N/A O
up O N/A O
in O N/A O
a O N/A O
banana O N/A O
leaf, O N/A O
these O N/A O
pasteles O N/A O
probably O N/A O
deserve O N/A O
their O N/A O
own O N/A O
float O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
Puerto O N/A O
Rican O N/A O
Day O N/A O
Parade. O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
López O N/A O
fries O N/A O
chicken O N/A O
in O N/A O
two O N/A O
styles. O N/A O
One, O N/A O
the O N/A O
chicharrones O N/A O
de O N/A O
pollo, O N/A O
is O N/A O
traditional. O N/A O
The O N/A O
other, O N/A O
the O N/A O
Freakin O N/A O
Crispy O N/A O
Wings, O N/A O
is O N/A O
not. O N/A O
Each O N/A O
has O N/A O
its O N/A O
rewards. O N/A O
The O N/A O
chicharrones, O N/A O
hacked O N/A O
into O N/A O
three-bite O N/A O
hunks, O N/A O
taste O N/A O
of O N/A O
cider O N/A O
vinegar O N/A O
and O N/A O
garlic O N/A O
powder O N/A O
and O N/A O
have O N/A O
a O N/A O
smooth, O N/A O
achiote-tinted O N/A O
buttermilk O N/A O
crust O N/A O
that O N/A O
breaks O N/A O
open O N/A O
with O N/A O
a O N/A O
pleasing O N/A O
crackle. O N/A O
The O N/A O
Freakin O N/A O
Crispy O N/A O
Wings O N/A O
are O N/A O
spicier, O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
shell O N/A O
is O N/A O
thicker O N/A O
and O N/A O
more O N/A O
deeply O N/A O
crevassed. O N/A O
These O N/A O
wings O N/A O
may O N/A O
owe O N/A O
more O N/A O
to O N/A O
Atlanta O N/A O
than O N/A O
to O N/A O
Mayagüez, O N/A O
although O N/A O
you O N/A O
can O N/A O
get O N/A O
them O N/A O
with O N/A O
a O N/A O
guava O N/A O
barbecue O N/A O
sauce O N/A O
that's O N/A O
reasonably O N/A O
tropical. O N/A O
Leave O N/A O
behind O N/A O
these O N/A O
appetizers, O N/A O
the O N/A O
core O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
street-fair O N/A O
business, O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
menu O N/A O
can O N/A O
start O N/A O
to O N/A O
appear O N/A O
unsteady. O N/A O
At O N/A O
dinner, O N/A O
the O N/A O
main O N/A O
courses O N/A O
tend O N/A O
to O N/A O
be O N/A O
fairly O N/A O
plain O N/A O
fried O N/A O
or O N/A O
grilled O N/A O
meat. O N/A O
Grilled O N/A O
pork O N/A O
chops O N/A O
splashed O N/A O
with O N/A O
mojo O N/A O
can O N/A O
be O N/A O
dry O N/A O
and O N/A O
dull, O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
grilled O N/A O
chicken O N/A O
breasts O N/A O
are O N/A O
not O N/A O
much O N/A O
more O N/A O
interesting. O N/A O
Baked O N/A O
pork O N/A O
ribs O N/A O
in O N/A O
a O N/A O
sweet O N/A O
barbecue O N/A O
sauce O N/A O
are O N/A O
tender O N/A O
enough, O N/A O
but O N/A O
they O N/A O
aren't O N/A O
very O N/A O
persuasive. O N/A O
On O N/A O
several O N/A O
nights, O N/A O
I O N/A O
found O N/A O
myself O N/A O
gazing O N/A O
longingly O N/A O
at O N/A O
the O N/A O
lunch O N/A O
specials O N/A O
on O N/A O
the O N/A O
back O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
menu, O N/A O
wondering O N/A O
why O N/A O
I O N/A O
couldn't O N/A O
have O N/A O
a O N/A O
brick O N/A O
of O N/A O
pastelón O N/A O
for O N/A O
dinner. O N/A O
(I O N/A O
came O N/A O
back O N/A O
for O N/A O
it O N/A O
one O N/A O
Thursday O N/A O
afternoon, O N/A O
and O N/A O
was O N/A O
glad O N/A O
I O N/A O
did.) O N/A O
Until O N/A O
more O N/A O
long-cooked O N/A O
dishes O N/A O
like O N/A O
it O N/A O
appear O N/A O
at O N/A O
dinnertime, O N/A O
consider O N/A O
a O N/A O
bowl O N/A O
of O N/A O
sancocho. O N/A O
Listed O N/A O
as O N/A O
"vegetable O N/A O
root O N/A O
soup" O N/A O
for O N/A O
$7, O N/A O
it O N/A O
doesn't O N/A O
sound O N/A O
like O N/A O
much O N/A O
of O N/A O
a O N/A O
meal. O N/A O
But O N/A O
it O N/A O
is O N/A O
a O N/A O
grab O N/A O
bag O N/A O
of O N/A O
a O N/A O
stew O N/A O
with O N/A O
at O N/A O
least O N/A O
two O N/A O
kinds O N/A O
of O N/A O
meat, O N/A O
great O N/A O
hunks O N/A O
of O N/A O

and O N/A O
yuca, O N/A O
a O N/A O

of O N/A O
inches O N/A O
of O N/A O
corn O N/A O
on O N/A O
the O N/A O
cob O N/A O
and O N/A O
a O N/A O
magical O N/A O
squash O N/A O
broth O N/A O
that O N/A O
has O N/A O
the O N/A O
consistency O N/A O
of O N/A O
heavy O N/A O
cream O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
color O N/A O
of O N/A O
very O N/A O
ripe O N/A O
mango. O N/A O

more O N/A O
subdued O N/A O
now. O N/A O
The O N/A O
kitchen O N/A O
is O N/A O
not O N/A O
seen O N/A O
as O N/A O
a O N/A O
beacon O N/A O
of O N/A O
innovation O N/A O
the O N/A O
way O N/A O
it O N/A O
used O N/A O
to O N/A O
be, O N/A O
perhaps O N/A O
because O N/A O
Ms. O N/A O
Rodriguez O N/A O
is O N/A O
less O N/A O
interested O N/A O
than O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
Ladner O N/A O
was O N/A O
in O N/A O
feats O N/A O
of O N/A O
technical O N/A O
derring-do O N/A O
like O N/A O
100-layer O N/A O
lasagnas O N/A O
. O N/A O
She O N/A O
gets O N/A O
her O N/A O
effects O N/A O
by O N/A O
following O N/A O
old O N/A O
Italian O N/A O
templates O N/A O
and O N/A O
putting O N/A O
them O N/A O
together O N/A O
so O N/A O
elegantly O N/A O
that O N/A O
they O N/A O
seem O N/A O
to O N/A O
light O N/A O
up O N/A O
from O N/A O
inside. O N/A O
There's O N/A O
an O N/A O
honesty O N/A O
to O N/A O
her O N/A O
approach O N/A O
-- O N/A O
she O N/A O
doesn't O N/A O
try O N/A O
to O N/A O
shoot O N/A O
out O N/A O
all O N/A O
the O N/A O
lights O N/A O
by O N/A O
supercharging O N/A O
dishes O N/A O
with O N/A O
fat O N/A O
-- O N/A O
but O N/A O
it's O N/A O
not O N/A O
the O N/A O
kind O N/A O
of O N/A O
peasant O N/A O
simplicity O N/A O
people O N/A O
usually O N/A O
mean O N/A O
when O N/A O
they O N/A O
talk O N/A O
about O N/A O
honesty O N/A O
in O N/A O
Italian O N/A O
food. O N/A O
It's O N/A O
a O N/A O
sophisticated O N/A O
honesty. O N/A O
You O N/A O
know O N/A O
chicken O N/A O
cacciatore, O N/A O
of O N/A O
course. O N/A O
Ms. O N/A O
Rodriguez's O N/A O
version O N/A O
is O N/A O
made O N/A O
from O N/A O
guinea O N/A O
hen O N/A O
breast, O N/A O
roasted O N/A O
until O N/A O
the O N/A O
skin O N/A O
crackles O N/A O
like O N/A O
parchment. O N/A O
What O N/A O
would O N/A O
be O N/A O
the O N/A O
body O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
stew O N/A O
is O N/A O
now O N/A O
a O N/A O
sauce; O N/A O
the O N/A O
tomato, O N/A O
celery O N/A O
and O N/A O
onion O N/A O
in O N/A O
it O N/A O
come O N/A O
through O N/A O
distinctly. O N/A O
Occupying O N/A O
a O N/A O
little O N/A O
sidecar O N/A O
is O N/A O
a O N/A O
pressed O N/A O
puck O N/A O
of O N/A O
braised O N/A O
leg O N/A O
meat O N/A O
under O N/A O
a O N/A O
single, O N/A O
Roman-style O N/A O
gnocco, O N/A O
a O N/A O
small O N/A O
featherbed O N/A O
of O N/A O
semolina O N/A O
held O N/A O
together O N/A O
by O N/A O
eggs, O N/A O
milk O N/A O
and O N/A O
cheese. O N/A O
One O N/A O
side O N/A O
has O N/A O
been O N/A O
broiled O N/A O
so O N/A O
hard O N/A O
it O N/A O
is O N/A O
nearly O N/A O
burned, O N/A O
which O N/A O
seems O N/A O
like O N/A O
a O N/A O
mistake O N/A O
at O N/A O
first, O N/A O
but O N/A O
turns O N/A O
out O N/A O
to O N/A O
supply O N/A O
the O N/A O
bit O N/A O
of O N/A O
campfire O N/A O
that O N/A O
this O N/A O
hunter's O N/A O
stew O N/A O
needs. O N/A O
It O N/A O
has O N/A O
to O N/A O
be O N/A O
far O N/A O
more O N/A O
complicated O N/A O
to O N/A O
prepare O N/A O
than O N/A O
the O N/A O
cacciatore O N/A O
at O N/A O
your O N/A O
neighborhood O N/A O
Italian O N/A O
restaurant, O N/A O
but O N/A O
it O N/A O
seems O N/A O
simpler, O N/A O
pared O N/A O
to O N/A O
essentials, O N/A O
and O N/A O
wonderful O N/A O
in O N/A O
every O N/A O
bite. O N/A O
I've O N/A O
never O N/A O
seen O N/A O
anyone O N/A O
wring O N/A O
as O N/A O
much O N/A O
flavor O N/A O
out O N/A O
of O N/A O
salsify O N/A O
as O N/A O
Ms. O N/A O
Rodriguez O N/A O
does. O N/A O
Sliced O N/A O
transparently O N/A O
thin O N/A O
and O N/A O
fried, O N/A O
it O N/A O
makes O N/A O
crunchy O N/A O
brown O N/A O
chips O N/A O
about O N/A O
half O N/A O
the O N/A O
size O N/A O
of O N/A O
an O N/A O
M&M. O N/A O
These O N/A O
decorate O N/A O
the O N/A O
top O N/A O
of O N/A O
a O N/A O
grilled-salsify O N/A O
pudding O N/A O
that O N/A O
has O N/A O
the O N/A O
refreshing O N/A O
bittersweetness O N/A O
of O N/A O
one O N/A O
of O N/A O
those O N/A O
plant-based O N/A O
Italian O N/A O
aperitifs. O N/A O
If O N/A O
it O N/A O
were O N/A O
not O N/A O
garnished O N/A O
with O N/A O
streaky O N/A O
leaves O N/A O
of O N/A O
radicchio, O N/A O
it O N/A O
could O N/A O
pass O N/A O
for O N/A O
a O N/A O
dessert. O N/A O
The O N/A O
menu O N/A O
structure O N/A O
has O N/A O
not O N/A O
changed, O N/A O
although O N/A O
the O N/A O
prices O N/A O
have. O N/A O
Everything O N/A O
can O N/A O
be O N/A O
had O N/A O
à O N/A O
la O N/A O
carte. O N/A O
Lunch O N/A O
is O N/A O
still O N/A O
a O N/A O
relative O N/A O
bargain, O N/A O
though O N/A O
the O N/A O
price O N/A O
has O N/A O
shimmied O N/A O
up O N/A O
to O N/A O
$59 O N/A O
for O N/A O
three O N/A O
courses. O N/A O
For O N/A O
a O N/A O
blowout O N/A O
$194 O N/A O
dinner, O N/A O
the O N/A O
Captain's O N/A O
Menu O N/A O
yields O N/A O
eight O N/A O
courses O N/A O
or O N/A O
so. O N/A O
Most O N/A O
people, O N/A O
however, O N/A O
go O N/A O
with O N/A O
the O N/A O
$164, O N/A O
five-course O N/A O
Menu O N/A O
del O N/A O

The O N/A O
primary O N/A O
argument O N/A O
in O N/A O
favor O N/A O
of O N/A O
this O N/A O
strategy O N/A O
is, O N/A O
to O N/A O
me, O N/A O
an O N/A O
overwhelming O N/A O
one: O N/A O
Two O N/A O
of O N/A O
those O N/A O
five O N/A O
courses O N/A O
are O N/A O
pasta. O N/A O
Del O N/A O
Posto's O N/A O
pastas O N/A O
are O N/A O
worth O N/A O
doubling O N/A O
up O N/A O
on. O N/A O
They O N/A O
can O N/A O
come O N/A O
in O N/A O
many O N/A O
forms. O N/A O
Delicate O N/A O
conical O N/A O
tortellini O N/A O
have O N/A O
hidden O N/A O
pockets O N/A O
of O N/A O
nettles O N/A O
and O N/A O
spring O N/A O
peas; O N/A O
they O N/A O
are O N/A O
half-submerged O N/A O
in O N/A O
a O N/A O
light O N/A O
spring-vegetable O N/A O
brodo O N/A O
in O N/A O
which O N/A O
Parmigiano-Reggiano O N/A O
rinds O N/A O
once O N/A O
bobbed O N/A O
like O N/A O
bay O N/A O
leaves. O N/A O
This O N/A O
is O N/A O
the O N/A O
spring O N/A O
minestrone. O N/A O
A O N/A O
single, O N/A O
plate-spanning O N/A O

topped O N/A O
with O N/A O
poached O N/A O
mussels O N/A O
and O N/A O
filled O N/A O
with O N/A O
spinach O N/A O
and O N/A O
fresh O N/A O
herbs O N/A O
-- O N/A O
not O N/A O
a O N/A O
lawnmower-mulch O N/A O
of O N/A O
greenery O N/A O
but O N/A O
a O N/A O
layer O N/A O
of O N/A O
emulsion O N/A O
as O N/A O
thin O N/A O
and O N/A O
velvety O N/A O
as O N/A O
the O N/A O
dough O N/A O
that O N/A O
envelops O N/A O
it. O N/A O
The O N/A O

the O N/A O
only O N/A O
convincing O N/A O

I've O N/A O
ever O N/A O

The O N/A O
range O N/A O
of O N/A O
flavors O N/A O
Ms. O N/A O
Wodder O N/A O
commands O N/A O
in O N/A O
her O N/A O
pastry O N/A O
kitchen O N/A O
seems O N/A O
unnecessarily O N/A O
limited O N/A O
to O N/A O
me, O N/A O
although O N/A O
I O N/A O
may O N/A O
be O N/A O
unfairly O N/A O
comparing O N/A O
her O N/A O
desserts O N/A O
with O N/A O
Mr. O N/A O
Headley's, O N/A O
which O N/A O
roamed O N/A O
all O N/A O
over O N/A O
the O N/A O
place. O N/A O
Individually, O N/A O
her O N/A O
desserts O N/A O
are O N/A O
soothing, O N/A O
often O N/A O
showcasing O N/A O
the O N/A O
comforts O N/A O
of O N/A O
dairy. O N/A O
More O N/A O
emphasis, O N/A O
some O N/A O
extra O N/A O
acidity O N/A O
or O N/A O
bitterness, O N/A O
might O N/A O
have O N/A O
brought O N/A O
an O N/A O
assemblage O N/A O
of O N/A O
quince O N/A O
paste, O N/A O
brown-butter O N/A O
gelato O N/A O
and O N/A O
griddled O N/A O
brioche O N/A O
into O N/A O
relief. O N/A O
But O N/A O
I O N/A O
appreciated O N/A O
the O N/A O
way O N/A O
winter O N/A O
squash O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
batter O N/A O
modified O N/A O
the O N/A O
sweetness O N/A O
of O N/A O
an O N/A O
olive O N/A O
oil-orange O N/A O
cake, O N/A O
and O N/A O
I O N/A O
enjoyed O N/A O
the O N/A O
moody O N/A O
sulkiness O N/A O
that O N/A O
amaro O N/A O
lent O N/A O
to O N/A O
a O N/A O
citrus O N/A O
salad O N/A O
served O N/A O
with O N/A O
the O N/A O
cake. O N/A O
Del O N/A O
Posto O N/A O
has O N/A O
in O N/A O
recent O N/A O
years O N/A O
picked O N/A O
up O N/A O
a O N/A O
reputation O N/A O
as O N/A O
a O N/A O
restaurant O N/A O
for O N/A O
one-percenters. O N/A O
It O N/A O
rarely O N/A O
gives O N/A O
that O N/A O
impression O N/A O
once O N/A O
you O N/A O
are O N/A O
inside, O N/A O
where O N/A O
servers O N/A O
solemnly O N/A O
accommodate O N/A O
just O N/A O
about O N/A O
anyone. O N/A O
There O N/A O
is O N/A O
a O N/A O
vegan O N/A O
menu O N/A O
at O N/A O
Del O N/A O
Posto. O N/A O
A O N/A O
vegetarian O N/A O
meal O N/A O
can O N/A O
be O N/A O
put O N/A O
together O N/A O
easily, O N/A O
and O N/A O
almost O N/A O
everything O N/A O
can O N/A O
be O N/A O
made O N/A O
without O N/A O
gluten, O N/A O
including O N/A O
the O N/A O
pasta. O N/A O
Yes, O N/A O
the O N/A O
stockpile O N/A O
of O N/A O
Champagnes O N/A O
includes O N/A O
some O N/A O
lock-and-key O N/A O
stuff, O N/A O
and O N/A O
should O N/A O
you O N/A O
require O N/A O
a O N/A O
Barolo O N/A O
costing O N/A O
between O N/A O
$2,000 O N/A O
and O N/A O
$4,000, O N/A O
one O N/A O
will O N/A O
quickly O N/A O
be O N/A O
added O N/A O
to O N/A O
your O N/A O
bill. O N/A O
But O N/A O
among O N/A O
the O N/A O
3,100 O N/A O
or O N/A O
so O N/A O
Italian O N/A O
labels O N/A O
superintended O N/A O
by O N/A O
Evan O N/A O
Clagnaz, O N/A O
the O N/A O

director, O N/A O
are O N/A O
more O N/A O
marked O N/A O
from O N/A O
$60 O N/A O
to O N/A O
$75 O N/A O
than O N/A O
I O N/A O
can O N/A O
count. O N/A O
Piemonte O N/A O
is O N/A O
a O N/A O
place O N/A O
to O N/A O
hunt, O N/A O
and O N/A O
Friuli, O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
Valle O N/A O
d'Aosta, O N/A O
for O N/A O
starters. O N/A O
Though O N/A O
the O N/A O
restaurant O N/A O
is O N/A O
not O N/A O
exclusively O N/A O
for O N/A O
rich O N/A O
people, O N/A O
it O N/A O
is O N/A O
explicitly O N/A O
for O N/A O
occasions. O N/A O
Once, O N/A O
when O N/A O
a O N/A O
reservationist O N/A O
called O N/A O
to O N/A O
confirm O N/A O
and O N/A O
asked O N/A O
whether O N/A O
I O N/A O
was O N/A O
celebrating O N/A O
anything O N/A O
special, O N/A O
I O N/A O
said O N/A O
no, O N/A O
and O N/A O
was O N/A O
gently O N/A O
laughed O N/A O
at: O N/A O
"Just O N/A O
a O N/A O
normal O N/A O
Tuesday O N/A O
night O N/A O
at O N/A O
Del O N/A O
Posto?" O N/A O
There O N/A O
is O N/A O
little O N/A O
danger O N/A O
that O N/A O
anyone O N/A O
will O N/A O
mistake O N/A O
a O N/A O
night O N/A O
at O N/A O
Del O N/A O
Posto O N/A O
for O N/A O
normal. O N/A O
If O N/A O
nothing O N/A O
else, O N/A O
the O N/A O
napkins O N/A O
and O N/A O
towels O N/A O
are O N/A O
a O N/A O
tip-off. O N/A O
First, O N/A O
there O N/A O
is O N/A O
a O N/A O
small O N/A O
hot O N/A O
linen O N/A O
napkin O N/A O
scented O N/A O
with O N/A O
tomato-vine O N/A O
oil, O N/A O
to O N/A O
wipe O N/A O
the O N/A O
dust O N/A O
of O N/A O
the O N/A O
outside O N/A O
world O N/A O
from O N/A O
your O N/A O
hands. O N/A O
Then O N/A O
a O N/A O
large O N/A O
white O N/A O
linen O N/A O
napkin, O N/A O
followed O N/A O
just O N/A O
before O N/A O
dessert O N/A O
by O N/A O
a O N/A O
small O N/A O
yellow O N/A O
one. O N/A O
It O N/A O
is O N/A O
given O N/A O
to O N/A O
you, O N/A O
and O N/A O
the O N/A O
white O N/A O
one O N/A O
is O N/A O
taken O N/A O
away, O N/A O
by O N/A O
a O N/A O
server O N/A O
using O N/A O
a O N/A O
large O N/A O
fork O N/A O
and O N/A O
spoon O N/A O
as O N/A O
tongs. O N/A O
When O N/A O
you O N/A O
go O N/A O
to O N/A O
the O N/A O
restrooms, O N/A O
you O N/A O
may O N/A O
encounter O N/A O
an O N/A O
attendant O N/A O
who O N/A O
has O N/A O
just O N/A O
restocked O N/A O
the O N/A O
hand O N/A O
towels O N/A O
from O N/A O
a O N/A O
large O N/A O
basket O N/A O
she O N/A O
carries O N/A O
on O N/A O
one O N/A O
arm, O N/A O
like O N/A O
Heidi O N/A O
out O N/A O
gathering O N/A O
wildflowers O N/A O
for O N/A O
Grandfather. O N/A O
There O N/A O
are O N/A O
little O N/A O
ceremonies O N/A O
like O N/A O
this O N/A O
from O N/A O
start O N/A O
to O N/A O
finish; O N/A O
I O N/A O
don't O N/A O
know O N/A O
of O N/A O
any O N/A O
other O N/A O
restaurant O N/A O
that O N/A O
performs O N/A O
quite O N/A O
so O N/A O
many O N/A O
tasks O N/A O
whose O N/A O
only O N/A O
real O N/A O
purpose O N/A O
is O N/A O
to O N/A O
draw O N/A O
attention O N/A O
to O N/A O
themselves. O N/A O
And O N/A O
these O N/A O
things O N/A O
are O N/A O
rarely O N/A O
done O N/A O
with O N/A O
a O N/A O
smile; O N/A O
employees O N/A O
seem O N/A O
to O N/A O
have O N/A O
been O N/A O
directed O N/A O
to O N/A O
keep O N/A O
a O N/A O
respectful, O N/A O
formal O N/A O
distance O N/A O
as O N/A O
they O N/A O
carry O N/A O
out O N/A O
your O N/A O
requests O N/A O
and O N/A O
perform O N/A O
other O N/A O
services O N/A O
you'd O N/A O
never O N/A O
think O N/A O
of O N/A O
requesting. O N/A O
They O N/A O
rarely O N/A O
seem O N/A O

the O N/A O

the O N/A O

Some O N/A O

it O N/A O

if O N/A O
enshrining O N/A O

reflects O N/A O
the O N/A O

so O N/A O
long? O N/A O
(And O N/A O
is O N/A O
it O N/A O
a O N/A O
coincidence O N/A O
that O N/A O

they O N/A O
also O N/A O

a O N/A O

this O N/A O

something O N/A O

Both O N/A O
the O N/A O
speckled O N/A O
zenryufun O N/A O

Either O N/A O

spread O N/A O
on O N/A O
a O N/A O
bamboo O N/A O

a O N/A O
sauce, O N/A O
either O N/A O
a O N/A O
peanut-buttery O N/A O
sesame O N/A O

the O N/A O

sauce. O N/A O
For O N/A O
larger O N/A O

more O N/A O
curious O N/A O
appetites, O N/A O
these O N/A O
dipping O N/A O
noodles, O N/A O
called O N/A O
seiro O N/A O
udon, O N/A O
can O N/A O
be O N/A O
dangled O N/A O
into O N/A O
a O N/A O
hot O N/A O
duck O N/A O

The O N/A O
cold O N/A O

accessorized O N/A O
with O N/A O
whipped O N/A O
mountain O N/A O
yam O N/A O
or O N/A O
tempura O N/A O
or O N/A O
both. O N/A O
If O N/A O
you O N/A O
had O N/A O
stumbled O N/A O
into O N/A O
Hanon O N/A O
under O N/A O
the O N/A O
impression O N/A O
that O N/A O
it O N/A O
was O N/A O
another O N/A O
generic O N/A O
Williamsburg O N/A O
noodle O N/A O
mill, O N/A O
the O N/A O
tempura O N/A O
would O N/A O
set O N/A O
you O N/A O
straight. O N/A O
The O N/A O
crust O N/A O
is O N/A O
engineered O N/A O
for O N/A O
udon, O N/A O
thick O N/A O
and O N/A O
substantial O N/A O
enough O N/A O
that O N/A O
it O N/A O
will O N/A O
not O N/A O
dissolve O N/A O
and O N/A O
float O N/A O
away O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
soup, O N/A O
yet O N/A O
somehow O N/A O
not O N/A O
oily O N/A O
or O N/A O
clunky. O N/A O
The O N/A O
tempura O N/A O
is O N/A O
served O N/A O
with O N/A O
sea O N/A O
salt, O N/A O
which O N/A O
will O N/A O
not O N/A O
only O N/A O
season O N/A O
the O N/A O
fried O N/A O
blowfish O N/A O
tails, O N/A O
shrimp, O N/A O
mushroom O N/A O
and O N/A O
vegetables, O N/A O
but O N/A O
will O N/A O
also O N/A O
do O N/A O
very O N/A O
good O N/A O
things O N/A O
to O N/A O
any O N/A O
noodles O N/A O
it O N/A O
happens O N/A O
to O N/A O
meet. O N/A O
With O N/A O
the O N/A O
hot O N/A O
soups, O N/A O
there O N/A O
is O N/A O
no O N/A O
choice O N/A O
of O N/A O
noodles. O N/A O
All O N/A O
are O N/A O
made O N/A O
with O N/A O
zenryufun. O N/A O
The O N/A O
plain O N/A O
broth, O N/A O
a O N/A O
dashi O N/A O
augmented O N/A O
by O N/A O
white O N/A O
soy O N/A O
sauce, O N/A O
is O N/A O
not O N/A O
so O N/A O
salty O N/A O
or O N/A O
concentrated O N/A O
that O N/A O
I O N/A O
didn't O N/A O
want O N/A O
to O N/A O
drink O N/A O
it O N/A O
all. O N/A O
It O N/A O
also O N/A O
performs O N/A O
well O N/A O
made O N/A O
into O N/A O
a O N/A O
thick-but-not-sludgy O N/A O

thin O N/A O

salty-sour O N/A O
mass O N/A O
of O N/A O

a O N/A O
soup O N/A O
of O N/A O
shaved O N/A O
beef O N/A O
and O N/A O
onions O N/A O
that O N/A O
tastes O N/A O
like O N/A O
a O N/A O
deeper, O N/A O
stronger O N/A O
version O N/A O
of O N/A O
French O N/A O
dip O N/A O

A O N/A O

make O N/A O
it O N/A O
to O N/A O
the O N/A O
menu O N/A O
as O N/A O
well. O N/A O
The O N/A O
beef-and-onion O N/A O
combination O N/A O
can O N/A O
also O N/A O
be O N/A O
had O N/A O
over O N/A O

slightly O N/A O
spicy O N/A O
cod O N/A O
roe O N/A O
is O N/A O
tossed O N/A O
with O N/A O
zenryufun O N/A O
for O N/A O
an O N/A O
excellent O N/A O
mentaiko O N/A O
pasta O N/A O
that, O N/A O
for O N/A O
once, O N/A O
relies O N/A O
on O N/A O
the O N/A O
roe O N/A O
rather O N/A O
than O N/A O
Kewpie O N/A O
mayonnaise O N/A O
to O N/A O
make O N/A O
an O N/A O
impression. O N/A O
The O N/A O
eventual O N/A O
plan O N/A O
is O N/A O
to O N/A O
sell O N/A O
both O N/A O
colors O N/A O

to O N/A O
grocery O N/A O

in O N/A O

the O N/A O
Sun O N/A O

of O N/A O
the O N/A O

would O N/A O
be O N/A O

is O N/A O
not O N/A O
to O N/A O

but O N/A O
to O N/A O
stay O N/A O

a O N/A O
meal: O N/A O
a O N/A O
chilled O N/A O
French O N/A O
red O N/A O
with O N/A O
the O N/A O
fried O N/A O
chicken O N/A O
and O N/A O
Japanese O N/A O
omelet, O N/A O
maybe, O N/A O
and O N/A O
something O N/A O
a O N/A O
bit O N/A O
brawnier O N/A O
with O N/A O
curry O N/A O
soup. O N/A O
Dessert O N/A O
could O N/A O
be O N/A O
a O N/A O
tofu O N/A O
blancmange, O N/A O
smooth O N/A O
and O N/A O
white O N/A O
and O N/A O
somewhat O N/A O
sweet, O N/A O
but O N/A O
there O N/A O
is O N/A O
more O N/A O
satisfaction O N/A O
in O N/A O
the O N/A O
grainy, O N/A O
earthy O N/A O
bricks O N/A O
of O N/A O
red O N/A O
bean O N/A O
paste. O N/A O
The O N/A O
meal O N/A O
might O N/A O
end O N/A O
with O N/A O
tea, O N/A O
to O N/A O
which O N/A O
the O N/A O
restaurant O N/A O
takes O N/A O
the O N/A O
same O N/A O
unhurried O N/A O
approach O N/A O
it O N/A O
applies O N/A O
to O N/A O
everything O N/A O
else. O N/A O
The O N/A O

Ms. O N/A O

boroughs. O O N/A
(I O O N/A
doubt O O N/A
he O O N/A
has O O N/A
any O O N/A
rivals O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
stand-up O O N/A
joints, O O N/A
either, O O N/A
but O O N/A
slice O O N/A
pizza O O N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
different O O N/A
game.) O O N/A
Two O O N/A
years O O N/A
ago, O O N/A
I O O N/A
posited O O N/A
that O O N/A
Razza, O O N/A
a O O N/A
pizzeria O O N/A
in O O N/A
Jersey O O N/A
City, O O N/A
made O O N/A
"the O O N/A
best O O N/A
pizza O O N/A
in O O N/A
New O O N/A
York." O O N/A
I O O N/A
don't O O N/A
regret O O N/A
writing O O N/A
that, O O N/A
but O O N/A
I O O N/A
would O O N/A
like O O N/A
to O O N/A
point O O N/A
out O O N/A
that O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Mangieri O O N/A
was O O N/A
not O O N/A
cooking O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
city O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A
time O O N/A
and O O N/A
that O O N/A
Razza's O O N/A
chef, O O N/A
Dan O O N/A
Richer, O O N/A
has O O N/A
said O O N/A
that O O N/A
he O O N/A
began O O N/A
taking O O N/A
pizza O O N/A
seriously O O N/A
only O O N/A
after O O N/A
he O O N/A
met O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Mangieri. O O N/A
Una O O N/A
Pizza O O N/A
Napoletana O O N/A
saw O O N/A
a O O N/A
rush O O N/A
of O O N/A
curious O O N/A
pie-eaters O O N/A
after O O N/A
it O O N/A
opened O O N/A
on O O N/A
Orchard O O N/A
Street O O N/A
a O O N/A
little O O N/A
more O O N/A
than O O N/A
a O O N/A
year O O N/A
ago. O O N/A
But O O N/A
the O O N/A
last O O N/A
few O O N/A
times O O N/A
I've O O N/A
gone, O O N/A
there O O N/A
were O O N/A
too O O N/A
many O O N/A
unclaimed O O N/A
chairs O O N/A
and O O N/A
bar O O N/A
stools. O O N/A
When O O N/A
Anthony O O N/A
Mangieri O O N/A
is O O N/A
making O O N/A
pizza, O O N/A
the O O N/A
right O O N/A
number O O N/A
of O O N/A
empty O O N/A
seats O O N/A
is O O N/A
zero, O O N/A
as O O N/A
any O O N/A
New O O N/A
Yorker O O N/A
who O O N/A
waited O O N/A
in O O N/A
line O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A
old O O N/A
Una O O N/A
Pizza O O N/A
Napoletana, O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
East O O N/A
Village O O N/A
from O O N/A
2004 O O N/A
to O O N/A
2009, O O N/A
could O O N/A
tell O O N/A
you. O O N/A
Press O O N/A
interest O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
new O O N/A
place O O N/A
has O O N/A
died O O N/A
down, O O N/A
too. O O N/A
So O O N/A
when O O N/A
I O O N/A
heard O O N/A
a O O N/A
rumor O O N/A
that O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Mangieri O O N/A
was O O N/A
thinking O O N/A
of O O N/A
leaving O O N/A
the O O N/A
city O O N/A
and O O N/A
taking O O N/A
his O O N/A
pizza O O N/A
with O O N/A
him, O O N/A
I O O N/A
was O O N/A
unnerved, O O N/A
to O O N/A
put O O N/A
it O O N/A
mildly. O O N/A
Asked O O N/A
about O O N/A
it, O O N/A
he O O N/A
told O O N/A
me O O N/A
he O O N/A
was O O N/A
considering O O N/A
it O O N/A
but O O N/A
hadn't O O N/A
made O O N/A
up O O N/A
his O O N/A
mind. O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Mangieri O O N/A
has O O N/A
left O O N/A
New O O N/A
York O O N/A
before, O O N/A
and O O N/A
I O O N/A
didn't O O N/A
like O O N/A
it O O N/A
then, O O N/A
either. O O N/A
This O O N/A
time, O O N/A
I O O N/A
wasn't O O N/A
going O O N/A
to O O N/A
let O O N/A
him O O N/A
get O O N/A
away O O N/A
without O O N/A
a O O N/A
fight. O O N/A
It O O N/A
is O O N/A
true O O N/A
that O O N/A
my O O N/A
review O O N/A
of O O N/A
Una O O N/A
Pizza O O N/A
Napoletana O O N/A
last O O N/A
year O O N/A
was O O N/A
decidedly O O N/A
mixed. O O N/A
It O O N/A
is O O N/A
also O O N/A
true, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
that O O N/A
almost O O N/A
every O O N/A
criticism O O N/A
I O O N/A
made O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
addressed. O O N/A
It O O N/A
has O O N/A
gone O O N/A
from O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
most O O N/A
confounding O O N/A
pizzerias O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
city O O N/A
to O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
most O O N/A
enjoyable. O O N/A
The O O N/A
problem O O N/A
with O O N/A
Una O O N/A
Pizza O O N/A
a O O N/A
year O O N/A
ago O O N/A
was O O N/A
that O O N/A
it O O N/A
was O O N/A
trying O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
two O O N/A
things O O N/A
at O O N/A
once. O O N/A
It O O N/A
was, O O N/A
of O O N/A
course, O O N/A
a O O N/A
Neapolitan O O N/A
pizzeria, O O N/A
serving O O N/A
classic, O O N/A
unadorned O O N/A
pies O O N/A
baked O O N/A
for O O N/A
about O O N/A
two O O N/A
minutes O O N/A
inside O O N/A
a O O N/A
wood-burning O O N/A
oven O O N/A
shaped O O N/A
like O O N/A
an O O N/A
igloo. O O N/A
But O O N/A
it O O N/A
was O O N/A
also O O N/A
a O O N/A
cutting-edge O O N/A
Lower O O N/A
East O O N/A
Side O O N/A
experiment. O O N/A
At O O N/A
the O O N/A
instigation O O N/A
of O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Mangieri's O O N/A
partners, O O N/A
the O O N/A
chefs O O N/A
Fabian O O N/A
von O O N/A
Hauske O O N/A
Valtierra O O N/A
and O O N/A
Jeremiah O O N/A
Stone, O O N/A
the O O N/A
kitchen O O N/A
brought O O N/A
forth O O N/A
appetizers O O N/A
that O O N/A
had O O N/A
rarely O O N/A
if O O N/A
ever O O N/A
been O O N/A
asked O O N/A
to O O N/A
live O O N/A
under O O N/A
one O O N/A
roof O O N/A
with O O N/A
a O O N/A
pizza. O O N/A
There O O N/A
was O O N/A
a O O N/A
jellylike O O N/A
mass O O N/A
of O O N/A
raw O O N/A
lobster O O N/A
inside O O N/A
a O O N/A
ring O O N/A
of O O N/A
chickpeas, O O N/A
and O O N/A
a O O N/A
rust-colored O O N/A
puddle O O N/A
of O O N/A
'nduja O O N/A
under O O N/A
raw O O N/A
turnips O O N/A
and O O N/A
nasturtium O O N/A
leaves. O O N/A
The O O N/A
wine O O N/A
list O O N/A
was O O N/A
virtually O O N/A
a O O N/A
treatise O O N/A
on O O N/A
natural O O N/A
wines, O O N/A
a O O N/A
long O O N/A
document O O N/A
full O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
names O O N/A
of O O N/A
eccentric O O N/A
producers O O N/A
and O O N/A
obscure O O N/A
European O O N/A
villages. O O N/A
In O O N/A
another O O N/A
restaurant, O O N/A
all O O N/A
this O O N/A
would O O N/A
have O O N/A
been O O N/A
the O O N/A
departure O O N/A
point O O N/A
for O O N/A
some O O N/A
adventurous O O N/A
evenings. O O N/A
But O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
pizzeria O O N/A
it O O N/A
led O O N/A
to O O N/A
some O O N/A
peculiar O O N/A
pairings, O O N/A
made O O N/A
the O O N/A
check O O N/A
a O O N/A
bit O O N/A
higher O O N/A
than O O N/A
you O O N/A
wanted O O N/A
and O O N/A
resulted O O N/A
in O O N/A
long O O N/A
waits O O N/A
before O O N/A
you O O N/A
were O O N/A
finally O O N/A
allowed O O N/A
to O O N/A
eat O O N/A
the O O N/A
delicious O O N/A
pizza O O N/A
you'd O O N/A
come O O N/A
for. O O N/A
Over O O N/A
the O O N/A
past O O N/A
year, O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
von O O N/A
Hauske O O N/A
and O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Stone O O N/A
have O O N/A
stepped O O N/A
aside, O O N/A
letting O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Mangieri O O N/A
call O O N/A
the O O N/A
shots. O O N/A
The O O N/A
wines O O N/A
on O O N/A
offer O O N/A
now O O N/A
number O O N/A
about O O N/A
15. O O N/A
They O O N/A
are O O N/A
still O O N/A
a O O N/A
likably O O N/A
eccentric O O N/A
lot, O O N/A
but O O N/A
picking O O N/A
one O O N/A
doesn't O O N/A
feel O O N/A
like O O N/A
studying O O N/A
for O O N/A
a O O N/A
master O O N/A
sommelier O O N/A
exam. O O N/A
The O O N/A
appetizers O O N/A
are O O N/A
simpler O O N/A
and O O N/A
less O O N/A
expensive: O O N/A
a O O N/A
plate O O N/A
of O O N/A
marinated O O N/A
white O O N/A
anchovies, O O N/A
a O O N/A
dish O O N/A
of O O N/A
warm O O N/A
Italian O O N/A
olives O O N/A
or O O N/A
a O O N/A
bowl O O N/A
of O O N/A
Little O O N/A
Gem O O N/A
lettuce O O N/A
with O O N/A
sunflower O O N/A
seeds O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
Caesarish O O N/A
dressing. O O N/A
I O O N/A
do O O N/A
miss O O N/A
the O O N/A
tiramisù O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A
opening O O N/A
menu, O O N/A
but O O N/A
the O O N/A
new O O N/A
cannoli O O N/A
filled O O N/A
with O O N/A
ricotta O O N/A
-- O O N/A
a O O N/A
blend O O N/A
of O O N/A
domestic O O N/A
cow's O O N/A
milk O O N/A
and O O N/A
Italian O O N/A
sheep's O O N/A
milk O O N/A
-- O O N/A
are O O N/A
nearly O O N/A
as O O N/A
good. O O N/A
It's O O N/A
common O O N/A
for O O N/A
a O O N/A
new O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
to O O N/A
trim O O N/A
its O O N/A
sails, O O N/A
but O O N/A
this O O N/A
one O O N/A
has O O N/A
trimmed O O N/A
its O O N/A
prices, O O N/A
too. O O N/A
In O O N/A
the O O N/A
beginning O O N/A
the O O N/A
five O O N/A
regular O O N/A
pizzas O O N/A
were O O N/A
all O O N/A
$25; O O N/A
now O O N/A
they O O N/A
range O O N/A
from O O N/A
$19 O O N/A
to O O N/A
$25, O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
two O O N/A
extra-complicated O O N/A
Friday O O N/A
and O O N/A
Saturday O O N/A
pizzas O O N/A
are O O N/A
priced O O N/A
at O O N/A
$26. O O N/A
I O O N/A
liked O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Mangieri's O O N/A
pies O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
East O O N/A
Village, O O N/A
I O O N/A
liked O O N/A
them O O N/A
more O O N/A
when O O N/A
he O O N/A
came O O N/A
back O O N/A
to O O N/A
town, O O N/A
and O O N/A
it's O O N/A
possible, O O N/A
just O O N/A
possible, O O N/A
that O O N/A
they've O O N/A
improved O O N/A
over O O N/A
the O O N/A
past O O N/A
year. O O N/A
He O O N/A
is, O O N/A
like O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Seeger, O O N/A
a O O N/A
minimalist. O O N/A
He O O N/A
lets O O N/A
you O O N/A
notice O O N/A
each O O N/A
ingredient: O O N/A
the O O N/A
little O O N/A
ping O O N/A
of O O N/A
sourness O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
Campanian O O N/A
buffalo O O N/A
mozzarella, O O N/A
for O O N/A
instance. O O N/A
Or O O N/A
the O O N/A
unruly, O O N/A
windswept-hillside O O N/A
aroma O O N/A
of O O N/A
dried O O N/A
Sicilian O O N/A
oregano. O O N/A
The O O N/A
precise O O N/A
crunch O O N/A
of O O N/A
each O O N/A
unrefined O O N/A
Trapani O O N/A
sea-salt O O N/A
crystal O O N/A
waiting O O N/A
to O O N/A
dissolve. O O N/A
The O O N/A
crust O O N/A
is O O N/A
so O O N/A
tender O O N/A
it O O N/A
barely O O N/A
fights O O N/A
fork, O O N/A
knife O O N/A
or O O N/A
teeth. O O N/A
Some O O N/A
diners O O N/A
will O O N/A
wish O O N/A
it O O N/A
put O O N/A
up O O N/A
more O O N/A
crackly O O N/A
resistance. O O N/A
You O O N/A
inhale O O N/A
it O O N/A
at O O N/A
least O O N/A
as O O N/A
much O O N/A
as O O N/A
you O O N/A
eat O O N/A
it. O O N/A
When O O N/A
you O O N/A
have O O N/A
finished, O O N/A
some O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
most O O N/A
popular O O N/A
pizzas O O N/A
in O O N/A
town O O N/A
will O O N/A
seem O O N/A
tough, O O N/A
leathery, O O N/A
overworked. O O N/A
Even O O N/A
if O O N/A
this O O N/A
is O O N/A
not O O N/A
the O O N/A
style O O N/A
you O O N/A
crave, O O N/A
you'll O O N/A
know O O N/A
that O O N/A
it's O O N/A
the O O N/A
work O O N/A
of O O N/A

the O O N/A
turmeric-and O O N/A
dill-scented O O N/A
fish O O N/A
dish O O N/A
that O O N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
specialty O O N/A
of O O N/A
a O O N/A
100-year-old O O N/A
Hanoi O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
same O O N/A
name. O O N/A
Her O O N/A
version, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
supplies O O N/A
less O O N/A
dill, O O N/A
less O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
and O O N/A
less O O N/A
satisfaction O O N/A
than O O N/A
some O O N/A
others. O O N/A
Her O O N/A
two O O N/A
improvisations O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
theme O O N/A
of O O N/A
Hanoi's O O N/A
best-known O O N/A
contribution O O N/A
to O O N/A
gastronomy, O O N/A
pho, O O N/A
are O O N/A
more O O N/A
effective. O O N/A
One O O N/A
gives O O N/A
you O O N/A
the O O N/A
soup O O N/A
without O O N/A
the O O N/A
noodles; O O N/A
floating O O N/A
in O O N/A

seasoned O O N/A

black O O N/A

The O O N/A
other O O N/A

springy O O N/A
mushrooms, O O N/A
bitter O O N/A
greens O O N/A
and O O N/A
chopped O O N/A
scallions. O O N/A
Its O O N/A
simplicity O O N/A
makes O O N/A
the O O N/A
impact O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
dish O O N/A
hard O O N/A
to O O N/A
explain O O N/A
until O O N/A
you O O N/A
learn O O N/A
that O O N/A
it O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
showered O O N/A
with O O N/A
Maggi O O N/A
Seasoning O O N/A
, O O N/A
a O O N/A
soylike O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
that O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
invisible O O N/A
secret O O N/A
of O O N/A
many O O N/A
Vietnamese O O N/A
dishes. O O N/A
Nodding O O N/A
toward O O N/A
Saigon, O O N/A
Ms. O O N/A

With O O N/A

it's O O N/A
beyond O O N/A

The O O N/A

Something O O N/A
called O O N/A
"warm O O N/A

is O O N/A
a O O N/A
quietly O O N/A
joyous O O N/A
celebration O O N/A
of O O N/A

the O O N/A

in O O N/A

(Yes, O O N/A
warm. O O N/A
It's O O N/A
wonderful.) O O N/A
And O O N/A
the O O N/A
chilled O O N/A

is O O N/A
going O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
my O O N/A
platonic O O N/A
ideal O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
dish O O N/A
from O O N/A
now O O N/A
on. O O N/A
But O O N/A
the O O N/A
crab O O N/A
cake O O N/A
had O O N/A
very O O N/A
little O O N/A
crab O O N/A
flavor, O O N/A
on O O N/A
two O O N/A
different O O N/A
nights, O O N/A
although O O N/A
it O O N/A
contained O O N/A
almost O O N/A
nothing O O N/A
else. O O N/A
Lobster O O N/A
thermidor O O N/A
(now O O N/A
there's O O N/A

I've O O N/A
not O O N/A
heard O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
long, O O N/A
long O O N/A
time) O O N/A
is O O N/A
so O O N/A
tender, O O N/A
its O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
so O O N/A
fluffy O O N/A
and O O N/A
rich, O O N/A
that O O N/A
eating O O N/A
it O O N/A
becomes O O N/A
an O O N/A
intimate O O N/A
act. O O N/A
Dover O O N/A
sole O O N/A
meunière, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
has O O N/A
neither O O N/A
the O O N/A
crisped O O N/A
skin O O N/A
nor O O N/A
the O O N/A
juicy O O N/A
flesh O O N/A
that O O N/A
can O O N/A
make O O N/A
this O O N/A
fish O O N/A
so O O N/A
alluring. O O N/A
Yes, O O N/A
life O O N/A
cannot O O N/A
be O O N/A
one O O N/A
giant O O N/A
plate O O N/A
of O O N/A
dancing O O N/A
butter-shrimp. O O N/A
Still, O O N/A
the O O N/A
gap O O N/A
between O O N/A
great O O N/A
and O O N/A
non-great O O N/A
items O O N/A
-- O O N/A
nothing O O N/A
comes O O N/A
close O O N/A
to O O N/A
bad O O N/A
-- O O N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
bit O O N/A
too O O N/A
wide O O N/A
and O O N/A
comes O O N/A
into O O N/A
view O O N/A
a O O N/A
bit O O N/A
too O O N/A
often. O O N/A
Regulars O O N/A
will O O N/A
learn O O N/A
to O O N/A
work O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu O O N/A
the O O N/A
way O O N/A

learn O O N/A
their O O N/A
way O O N/A
around O O N/A
the O O N/A
eighth O O N/A
hole O O N/A
at O O N/A
Pebble O O N/A
Beach. O O N/A
Some O O N/A
will O O N/A
love O O N/A
the O O N/A
prime O O N/A
rib, O O N/A
which O O N/A
could O O N/A
not O O N/A
be O O N/A
any O O N/A
more O O N/A
moist O O N/A
without O O N/A
breaking O O N/A
several O O N/A
laws O O N/A
of O O N/A
chemistry. O O N/A
Others O O N/A
will O O N/A
wish O O N/A
that O O N/A
it O O N/A
had O O N/A
more O O N/A
concentrated O O N/A
beef O O N/A
flavor O O N/A
and O O N/A
that O O N/A
the O O N/A
flaps O O N/A
and O O N/A
handles O O N/A
had O O N/A
not O O N/A
been O O N/A
trimmed O O N/A
off, O O N/A
perhaps O O N/A
in O O N/A
pursuit O O N/A
of O O N/A
some O O N/A
Kellerian O O N/A
quest O O N/A
for O O N/A
bovine O O N/A
symmetry. O O N/A
A O O N/A
large O O N/A
number O O N/A
will O O N/A
settle O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
roast O O N/A
chicken O O N/A
for O O N/A
two. O O N/A
The O O N/A
meat O O N/A
is O O N/A
juicy O O N/A
but O O N/A
not O O N/A
gushy, O O N/A
the O O N/A
flavor O O N/A
full O O N/A
but O O N/A
not O O N/A
salty, O O N/A
the O O N/A
jus O O N/A
dark O O N/A
but O O N/A
not O O N/A
over-reduced. O O N/A
After O O N/A
the O O N/A
chicken, O O N/A
the O O N/A
pastry O O N/A
chef, O O N/A
Alex O O N/A
McClenaghan, O O N/A
can O O N/A
offer O O N/A
a O O N/A
highly O O N/A
refined O O N/A
coconut O O N/A
cake O O N/A
or O O N/A
an O O N/A
urbane O O N/A
lemon O O N/A
meringue O O N/A
tart, O O N/A
but O O N/A
you'd O O N/A
almost O O N/A
have O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
insane O O N/A
not O O N/A
to O O N/A
get O O N/A
the O O N/A
chocolate O O N/A
cake. O O N/A
Certainly O O N/A
a O O N/A
close O O N/A
relative O O N/A
of O O N/A
devil's O O N/A
food O O N/A
cake, O O N/A
his O O N/A
version O O N/A
weaves O O N/A
dark-chocolate O O N/A

between O O N/A
its O O N/A
many, O O N/A
many O O N/A

all O O N/A
of O O N/A
them O O N/A
wrapped O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
dark-chocolate O O N/A
frosting. O O N/A
And O O N/A
there O O N/A
will O O N/A
be O O N/A
regulars, O O N/A
because O O N/A
the O O N/A

the O O N/A

I O O N/A
asked O O N/A
my O O N/A
server. O O N/A
Realizing O O N/A
that O O N/A
this O O N/A
was O O N/A
somewhat O O N/A
ambiguous, O O N/A
especially O O N/A
applied O O N/A
to O O N/A
a O O N/A
dish O O N/A
as O O N/A
laden O O N/A
with O O N/A
stuff O O N/A
as O O N/A
the O O N/A

I O O N/A
tried O O N/A
again. O O N/A
"Is O O N/A
it O O N/A
very O O N/A
filling, O O N/A
I O O N/A
mean?" O O N/A
My O O N/A
concern O O N/A
was O O N/A
a O O N/A
familiar O O N/A
one, O O N/A
to O O N/A
me O O N/A
at O O N/A
least. O O N/A
I O O N/A
was O O N/A
in O O N/A
Queens, B-LOC B-DISH N/A
at O O N/A
a O O N/A
new O O N/A

called O O N/A

and O O N/A
the O O N/A

was O O N/A
so O O N/A
appealing O O N/A
that O O N/A
I O O N/A
wanted O O N/A
to O O N/A
try O O N/A
it O O N/A
all. O O N/A
Already O O N/A
I O O N/A
was O O N/A
set O O N/A
on O O N/A
a O O N/A

bourekas, B-DISH B-DISH N/A

over O I-DISH N/A

I'd O O N/A
spotted O O N/A
another O O N/A
three O O N/A
or O O N/A
four O O N/A
dishes O O N/A
that O O N/A
I O O N/A
was O O N/A
probably O O N/A
going O O N/A
to O O N/A
tack O O N/A
on O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A
end O O N/A
of O O N/A
my O O N/A
order, O O N/A
as O O N/A
if O O N/A
by O O N/A
afterthought. O O N/A
I O O N/A
suspected O O N/A
that O O N/A
I O O N/A
could O O N/A
add O O N/A
a O O N/A
small O O N/A
bowl O O N/A
of O O N/A
kelle B-DISH B-DISH N/A
paca I-DISH I-DISH N/A
and O O N/A
still O O N/A
eat O O N/A
everything O O N/A
else. O O N/A
But O O N/A
a O O N/A
big O O N/A
bowl, O O N/A
one O O N/A
so O O N/A
thick O O N/A
with O O N/A
bits O O N/A
formerly O O N/A
affixed O O N/A
to O O N/A
a O O N/A
sheep's O O N/A
skull O O N/A
that O O N/A
a O O N/A
spoon O O N/A
would O O N/A
stand O O N/A
up O O N/A
in O O N/A
it, O O N/A
might O O N/A
tip O O N/A
the O O N/A
scale. O O N/A
The O O N/A
server O O N/A
pondered O O N/A
this O O N/A
for O O N/A
a O O N/A
while O O N/A
until O O N/A
a O O N/A
wiry O O N/A
man O O N/A
got O O N/A
up O O N/A
from O O N/A
his O O N/A
marble-topped O O N/A
table O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
corner O O N/A
and O O N/A
conferred O O N/A
with O O N/A
her. O O N/A
Wearing O O N/A
baggy O O N/A
jeans, O O N/A
a O O N/A
white O O N/A
T-shirt O O N/A
and O O N/A
a O O N/A
baseball O O N/A
cap O O N/A
that O O N/A
kept O O N/A
his O O N/A
zinc-colored O O N/A
ponytail O O N/A
in O O N/A
place, O O N/A
he O O N/A
looked O O N/A
like O O N/A
a O O N/A
contractor, O O N/A
maybe O O N/A
a O O N/A
painter O O N/A
who'd O O N/A
come O O N/A
by O O N/A
to O O N/A
touch O O N/A
up O O N/A
the O O N/A
moldings O O N/A
and O O N/A

Then O O N/A
he O O N/A
spoke O O N/A
to O O N/A
us O O N/A
about O O N/A
the O O N/A
sheep's B-DISH B-DISH N/A
head I-DISH I-DISH N/A
soup. I-DISH I-DISH N/A
"I O O N/A
am O O N/A
a O O N/A
genius," O O N/A
he O O N/A
began. O O N/A
"And O O N/A
even O O N/A
I O O N/A
don't O O N/A
know O O N/A
how O O N/A
to O O N/A

I O O N/A

in O O N/A

a O O N/A

that O O N/A

Lokanta's O O N/A
"roasted O O N/A

is O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
pilaf O O N/A
family, O O N/A
which O O N/A
means O O N/A
that O O N/A
the O O N/A
rice O O N/A
is O O N/A
not O O N/A
just O O N/A
a O O N/A
side O O N/A
dish O O N/A
but O O N/A
the O O N/A
heart O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
recipe, O O N/A
baked O O N/A
until O O N/A
alluringly O O N/A
sweet O O N/A
with O O N/A
currants, O O N/A

last O O N/A
minute. O O N/A
The O O N/A
lamb's O O N/A
job O O N/A
is O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
obligingly O O N/A
tender, O O N/A
and O O N/A
it O O N/A
succeeds, O O N/A
one O O N/A
reason O O N/A
the O O N/A
dish O O N/A
is O O N/A
requested O O N/A
by O O N/A
so O O N/A
many O O N/A
tables. O O N/A
To O O N/A
fend O O N/A
off O O N/A
boredom, O O N/A
I O O N/A
imagine, O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Yegen O O N/A
fills O O N/A
his O O N/A
manti O O N/A
with O O N/A
both O O N/A
lamb O O N/A
and O O N/A
beef. O O N/A
Each O O N/A
little O O N/A
dumpling O O N/A
is O O N/A
rolled O O N/A
by O O N/A
fingertip O O N/A
and O O N/A
is O O N/A
roughly O O N/A
the O O N/A
size O O N/A
of O O N/A
one. O O N/A
The O O N/A
meat O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
seasoned O O N/A
just O O N/A
forcefully O O N/A
enough O O N/A
that O O N/A
it O O N/A
will O O N/A
announce O O N/A
itself, O O N/A
politely O O N/A
but O O N/A
clearly, O O N/A
as O O N/A
it O O N/A
breaks O O N/A
through O O N/A
the O O N/A
dough. O O N/A
It O O N/A
would O O N/A
be O O N/A
possible O O N/A
to O O N/A
sit O O N/A
down O O N/A
in O O N/A
front O O N/A
of O O N/A
a O O N/A
bowl O O N/A
of O O N/A
these, O O N/A
spooning O O N/A
them O O N/A
up O O N/A
with O O N/A
their O O N/A
warm O O N/A
yogurt O O N/A
and O O N/A
chile O O N/A
oil O O N/A
and O O N/A
dried O O N/A
mint, O O N/A
and O O N/A
call O O N/A
for O O N/A
another O O N/A
bowl O O N/A
a O O N/A
minute O O N/A
later. O O N/A
Of O O N/A
course, O O N/A
the O O N/A
meal O O N/A
should O O N/A
begin O O N/A
with O O N/A
strips O O N/A
of O O N/A
nigella-dotted O O N/A
Turkish O O N/A
bread O O N/A
and O O N/A
a O O N/A
spread O O N/A
or O O N/A
two O O N/A
-- O O N/A
maybe O O N/A
memorably O O N/A
creamy O O N/A
purée O O N/A
of O O N/A
dried O O N/A
favas; O O N/A
or O O N/A
the O O N/A
roughly O O N/A
mashed O O N/A
eggplant, O O N/A
smoky O O N/A
without O O N/A
a O O N/A
trace O O N/A
of O O N/A
bitterness; O O N/A
and O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
strained-yogurt O O N/A
dips, O O N/A
either O O N/A
the O O N/A
tangy O O N/A
cacik, O O N/A
laced O O N/A
with O O N/A
minced O O N/A
cucumbers, O O N/A
or O O N/A
the O O N/A
labneh, O O N/A
as O O N/A
firm O O N/A
as O O N/A
a O O N/A
new O O N/A
mattress. O O N/A
Either O O N/A
will O O N/A
prove O O N/A
useful O O N/A
as O O N/A
the O O N/A
meal O O N/A
goes O O N/A
on. O O N/A
So O O N/A
will O O N/A
a O O N/A
simple O O N/A
salad, O O N/A
especially O O N/A
the O O N/A
one O O N/A
with O O N/A
white O O N/A
beans O O N/A
and O O N/A
purple O O N/A
onions. O O N/A
The O O N/A
tightly O O N/A
rolled, O O N/A
golden O O N/A
bourekas O O N/A
are O O N/A
like O O N/A
skinny O O N/A
Turkish O O N/A
spring O O N/A
rolls O O N/A
filled O O N/A
with O O N/A
dill O O N/A
and O O N/A
melting O O N/A
feta. O O N/A
Cold O O N/A
poached O O N/A
leeks, O O N/A
a O O N/A
frequent O O N/A
special, O O N/A
are O O N/A
more O O N/A
appealing O O N/A
than O O N/A
the O O N/A
cold O O N/A
poached O O N/A
artichokes O O N/A
that O O N/A
have O O N/A
a O O N/A
permanent O O N/A
spot O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu. O O N/A
If O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Yegen O O N/A
tells O O N/A
you O O N/A
that O O N/A
the O O N/A
grilled O O N/A
octopus O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
best O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
city, O O N/A
keep O O N/A
in O O N/A
mind O O N/A
that O O N/A
he O O N/A
rarely O O N/A
seems O O N/A
to O O N/A
leave O O N/A
his O O N/A
own O O N/A
restaurant. O O N/A
It's O O N/A
quite O O N/A
good, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
with O O N/A
a O O N/A
fugitive O O N/A
sweetness O O N/A
that O O N/A
may O O N/A
be O O N/A
supplied O O N/A
by O O N/A
the O O N/A
tomatoes O O N/A
and O O N/A
purple O O N/A
onions. O O N/A
Desserts O O N/A
run O O N/A
toward O O N/A
milky O O N/A
white O O N/A
puddings, O O N/A
nice O O N/A
if O O N/A
you O O N/A
are O O N/A
looking O O N/A
for O O N/A
a O O N/A
mild O O N/A
sedative. O O N/A
The O O N/A
baklava, O O N/A
imported O O N/A
from O O N/A
Turkey, O O N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
treat O O N/A
for O O N/A
those O O N/A
of O O N/A
us O O N/A
who O O N/A
like O O N/A
pistachios O O N/A
and O O N/A
think O O N/A
sugar O O N/A
syrup O O N/A
makes O O N/A
a O O N/A
better O O N/A
baklava O O N/A
sweetener O O N/A
than O O N/A
honey. O O N/A
The O O N/A
unlikely O O N/A
champion, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
butternut O O N/A
squash O O N/A
that O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
languorously O O N/A
baked O O N/A
in O O N/A
its O O N/A
own O O N/A
juices O O N/A
with O O N/A
nothing O O N/A
but O O N/A
sugar. O O N/A
The O O N/A
technique O O N/A
is O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
those O O N/A
small O O N/A
tricks O O N/A
that O O N/A

Some O O N/A

smuggle O O N/A

keep O O N/A

there O O N/A
is O O N/A
enough O O N/A
creativity O O N/A
across O O N/A
the O O N/A

a O O N/A

agnolotti, I-DISH I-DISH N/A
the O O N/A
X O O N/A

the O O N/A

There O O N/A
is O O N/A
one O O N/A
mystifying O O N/A
appetizer O O N/A
in O O N/A

the O O N/A
dueling O O N/A

flavors O O N/A
of O O N/A
sea O O N/A

cancel O O N/A
each O O N/A

out. O O N/A
For O O N/A
the O O N/A
most O O N/A
part, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
the O O N/A
plates O O N/A
don't O O N/A
overreach, O O N/A
for O O N/A
all O O N/A
the O O N/A
inventiveness O O N/A
on O O N/A
display. O O N/A
Asparagus O O N/A
dipped O O N/A
in O O N/A
aioli O O N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
good O O N/A
idea, O O N/A
of O O N/A
course, O O N/A
but O O N/A
what O O N/A
if O O N/A
the O O N/A
asparagus O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
steamed O O N/A
inside O O N/A
a O O N/A
wrapper O O N/A
of O O N/A
thinly O O N/A
shaved O O N/A
cedar O O N/A
until O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
nearly O O N/A
as O O N/A
smoky O O N/A
as O O N/A
country O O N/A
bacon? O O N/A
And O O N/A
what O O N/A
if O O N/A
the O O N/A
aioli O O N/A
is O O N/A
enhanced O O N/A
by O O N/A
truffles? O O N/A
It O O N/A
may O O N/A
sound O O N/A
overworked, O O N/A
but O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
such O O N/A
a O O N/A
thrill O O N/A
that O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
my O O N/A
guests O O N/A
asked O O N/A
for O O N/A
another O O N/A
plate O O N/A
before O O N/A
we O O N/A
could O O N/A
move O O N/A
on O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
main O O N/A
courses, O O N/A
throwing O O N/A
the O O N/A
rhythm O O N/A
for O O N/A
the O O N/A
evening O O N/A
right O O N/A
out O O N/A
the O O N/A
window. O O N/A
The O O N/A
night O O N/A
will O O N/A
pause O O N/A
again O O N/A
if O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
main O O N/A
courses O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
sweet O O N/A
potato, O O N/A
as O O N/A
everyone O O N/A
tries O O N/A
to O O N/A
figure O O N/A
out O O N/A
where O O N/A
it O O N/A
got O O N/A
its O O N/A
creaminess O O N/A
and O O N/A
savory O O N/A
depth. O O N/A
Even O O N/A
once O O N/A
you O O N/A
know O O N/A
it's O O N/A
been O O N/A
sealed O O N/A
up O O N/A
and O O N/A
baked O O N/A
inside O O N/A
a O O N/A
little O O N/A
coffin O O N/A
of O O N/A
sourdough O O N/A
that O O N/A
is O O N/A
streaked O O N/A
with O O N/A
green O O N/A
threads O O N/A
of O O N/A
wakame O O N/A
seaweed, O O N/A
you O O N/A
still O O N/A
can't O O N/A
quite O O N/A
believe O O N/A
that O O N/A
all O O N/A
this O O N/A
flavor O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
achieved O O N/A
with O O N/A
an O O N/A
ordinary O O N/A
sweet O O N/A
potato. O O N/A
Some O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
large O O N/A
pieces O O N/A
of O O N/A
fish O O N/A
and O O N/A
meat O O N/A
are O O N/A
showstoppers O O N/A
on O O N/A
their O O N/A
own, O O N/A
like O O N/A
the O O N/A
lobster O O N/A
that O O N/A
rests O O N/A
for O O N/A
four O O N/A
days O O N/A
in O O N/A
aged-beef O O N/A
fat O O N/A
before O O N/A
being O O N/A
broiled O O N/A
and O O N/A
set O O N/A
over O O N/A
some O O N/A
jammy O O N/A
ratatouille. O O N/A
When O O N/A
they O O N/A
are O O N/A
not, O O N/A
something O O N/A
else O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
plate O O N/A
usually O O N/A
is. O O N/A

one O O N/A

an O O N/A
evening-long O O N/A

of O O N/A
the O O N/A
peculiarities O O N/A
of O O N/A
dining O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
city, O O N/A
circa O O N/A
2019, O O N/A
is O O N/A
that O O N/A
the O O N/A
more O O N/A
high-functioning O O N/A
a O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
is, O O N/A
the O O N/A
less O O N/A
likely O O N/A
you O O N/A
are O O N/A
to O O N/A
encounter O O N/A
a O O N/A
proprietor. O O N/A
There O O N/A
are O O N/A
exceptions, O O N/A
of O O N/A
course, O O N/A
but O O N/A
often O O N/A
the O O N/A
most O O N/A
successful O O N/A
restaurateurs O O N/A
are O O N/A
very O O N/A
busy O O N/A
people, O O N/A
so O O N/A
they O O N/A
leave O O N/A
their O O N/A

in O O N/A
the O O N/A
hands O O N/A
of O O N/A

aren't O O N/A
always O O N/A
as O O N/A
smooth O O N/A
as O O N/A
professionals, O O N/A
but O O N/A
they O O N/A
are O O N/A
as O O N/A
attuned O O N/A
to O O N/A
what O O N/A
goes O O N/A
on O O N/A
in O O N/A
their O O N/A

they O O N/A

Their O O N/A
original O O N/A

His O O N/A

The O O N/A

are O O N/A
a O O N/A
new O O N/A

of O O N/A

it O O N/A
unexpectedly O O N/A

a O O N/A

dish. O O N/A
The O O N/A
bottom O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu O O N/A
is O O N/A
more O O N/A
substantial: O O N/A
The O O N/A

pork I-DISH I-DISH N/A

This O O N/A

of O O N/A

to O O N/A

The O O N/A
tiny O O N/A
yields O O N/A
of O O N/A
an O O N/A
urban O O N/A
garden O O N/A
wouldn't O O N/A
satisfy O O N/A
a O O N/A

but O O N/A
they O O N/A
can O O N/A
shuffle O O N/A
right O O N/A
onto O O N/A
the O O N/A

at O O N/A

when O O N/A
they're O O N/A
all O O N/A
gone. O O N/A
This O O N/A

("I O O N/A

up O O N/A

A O O N/A
year O O N/A

Belle O O N/A
Harlem O O N/A
eliminated O O N/A
tips O O N/A
and O O N/A
raised O O N/A
prices. O O N/A
If O O N/A
you O O N/A
take O O N/A
that O O N/A
into O O N/A
account, O O N/A
check O O N/A
totals O O N/A
can O O N/A
still O O N/A
seem O O N/A
high, O O N/A
especially O O N/A
if O O N/A
you O O N/A

be O O N/A
served O O N/A
pale, O O N/A

a O O N/A

that O O N/A
tastes O O N/A
like O O N/A
alcohol. O O N/A
The O O N/A
margins O O N/A
must O O N/A
be O O N/A
tight. O O N/A
At O O N/A
times O O N/A
you O O N/A
almost O O N/A
hear O O N/A
them O O N/A
squeak, O O N/A
as O O N/A
when O O N/A
Ms. O O N/A
Burnette O O N/A
anxiously O O N/A
reminds O O N/A
you O O N/A
that O O N/A
you O O N/A
were O O N/A
a O O N/A
few O O N/A
minutes O O N/A
late O O N/A
and O O N/A
suggests O O N/A
you O O N/A
order O O N/A
quickly O O N/A
so O O N/A
she O O N/A
can O O N/A
turn O O N/A
the O O N/A
seat O O N/A
in O O N/A
time O O N/A
for O O N/A
the O O N/A
next O O N/A

A O O N/A
professional O O N/A

But O O N/A
a O O N/A
manager O O N/A

That O O N/A

isn't O O N/A

there O O N/A
is O O N/A
an O O N/A

the O O N/A

between O O N/A

The O O N/A

to O O N/A
go O O N/A
to O O N/A

the O O N/A

the O O N/A

more O O N/A

the O O N/A

the O O N/A

can O O N/A
be O O N/A
ordered O O N/A
"simply O O N/A

I O O N/A
was O O N/A
never O O N/A
curious O O N/A
enough O O N/A
to O O N/A
try O O N/A
it, O O N/A
being O O N/A

heads; O O N/A
the O O N/A

in O O N/A

life-affirming O O N/A

almost O O N/A
pass O O N/A

English O O N/A
if O O N/A
it O O N/A
didn't O O N/A
come O O N/A
with O O N/A

Most O O N/A
distracting O O N/A
of O O N/A
all O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
whole O O N/A

a O O N/A
fish-shaped O O N/A

and O O N/A
other O O N/A
parts O O N/A
the O O N/A
bass O O N/A
itself O O N/A
won't O O N/A
be O O N/A
needing O O N/A
anymore. O O N/A
It O O N/A
takes O O N/A
a O O N/A
good O O N/A
10 O O N/A
minutes O O N/A
to O O N/A
unveil O O N/A
it, O O N/A
fillet O O N/A
it O O N/A
and O O N/A
then O O N/A
plate O O N/A
it O O N/A
together O O N/A
with O O N/A
slices O O N/A
of O O N/A

some O O N/A
tomato O O N/A
concassé O O N/A
and O O N/A
a O O N/A

and O O N/A
I O O N/A
doubt O O N/A
many O O N/A
movies O O N/A
playing O O N/A
in O O N/A

now O O N/A
can O O N/A
rival O O N/A

of O O N/A
pre-nouvelle O O N/A
cuisine O O N/A
given O O N/A
so O O N/A
much O O N/A
attention, O O N/A
you O O N/A
could O O N/A
ask O O N/A
whether O O N/A
whole O O N/A
fish O O N/A
en O O N/A
croute O O N/A
really O O N/A
makes O O N/A
sense O O N/A
after, O O N/A

kale O O N/A
salad. O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Vongerichten's O O N/A

approach O O N/A
may O O N/A
let O O N/A
him O O N/A
generate O O N/A

menu O O N/A
full O O N/A
of O O N/A
smart, O O N/A
reliably O O N/A
pleasurable O O N/A
food, O O N/A

it O O N/A
doesn't O O N/A
guarantee O O N/A
that O O N/A

will O O N/A
all O O N/A

In O O N/A

the O O N/A

which O O N/A

The O O N/A

of O O N/A

that O O N/A

Urges O O N/A

typically O O N/A
announce O O N/A
themselves O O N/A
three O O N/A

they O O N/A
don't O O N/A

haven't O O N/A
yet O O N/A
figured O O N/A
out O O N/A
what O O N/A
it O O N/A

for. O O N/A
For O O N/A
much O O N/A
of O O N/A
his O O N/A
life, O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
McNally O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
chipping, O O N/A
cracking, O O N/A
distressing O O N/A
and O O N/A
weathering O O N/A
interiors O O N/A
that O O N/A
are O O N/A
the O O N/A
architectural O O N/A
equivalent O O N/A
of O O N/A
rumpled O O N/A
sweaters O O N/A
two O O N/A
sizes O O N/A
too O O N/A
large. O O N/A
Perhaps O O N/A
the O O N/A
largest O O N/A
and O O N/A
certainly O O N/A
the O O N/A
most O O N/A
rumpled O O N/A
of O O N/A
all O O N/A
is O O N/A
Pastis. O O N/A
It O O N/A
doesn't O O N/A
have O O N/A
the O O N/A

at O O N/A
its O O N/A
former O O N/A
address, O O N/A
or O O N/A
the O O N/A
long O O N/A
communal O O N/A
table O O N/A
that O O N/A
sliced O O N/A
through O O N/A
the O O N/A
front O O N/A
room O O N/A
like O O N/A

surfboard. O O N/A
And O O N/A
the O O N/A
shelves O O N/A
of O O N/A
cigarette O O N/A

are O O N/A
definitely O O N/A
gone. O O N/A
( O O N/A
You O O N/A
could O O N/A
still O O N/A
smoke O O N/A
in O O N/A
restaurants O O N/A
in O O N/A
1999, O O N/A
when O O N/A
Pastis O O N/A
opened.) O O N/A

the O O N/A

white, O O N/A
framed O O N/A
by O O N/A
black O O N/A

The O O N/A
chairs O O N/A
still O O N/A
don't O O N/A
match. O O N/A
The O O N/A
ambient O O N/A
light O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
color O O N/A
of O O N/A
a O O N/A
Scotch O O N/A
and O O N/A
soda O O N/A
and O O N/A
makes O O N/A
everybody O O N/A
look O O N/A
the O O N/A
way O O N/A
they O O N/A
do O O N/A
after O O N/A
you've O O N/A
drunk O O N/A
one. O O N/A
On O O N/A
an O O N/A
antique O O N/A
mirror, O O N/A

one O O N/A
that O O N/A
looks O O N/A
like O O N/A
an O O N/A

someone O O N/A
has O O N/A
scrawled O O N/A
a O O N/A
menu O O N/A
of O O N/A
desserts, O O N/A
almost O O N/A
none O O N/A
of O O N/A
which O O N/A
Pastis O O N/A
actually O O N/A
serves. O O N/A
You O O N/A
can, O O N/A
however, O O N/A
get O O N/A
an O O N/A
energetically O O N/A
whisked O O N/A
dark-chocolate O O N/A
mousse O O N/A
under O O N/A
shaved O O N/A

a O O N/A
baba O O N/A

so O O N/A
drenched O O N/A
in O O N/A
booze O O N/A
that O O N/A
it O O N/A
might O O N/A
spontaneously O O N/A
combust O O N/A

it O O N/A

by O O N/A
a O O N/A
white O O N/A
dune O O N/A
of O O N/A
whipped O O N/A
Chantilly O O N/A

The O O N/A
most O O N/A
significant O O N/A
change O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A
first O O N/A
Pastis O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
second O O N/A
happened O O N/A
offstage. O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A

who O O N/A
had O O N/A
a O O N/A
stroke O O N/A
two O O N/A
years O O N/A
ago, O O N/A
has O O N/A
brought O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
restaurateur O O N/A
Stephen O O N/A
Starr O O N/A
as O O N/A
a O O N/A
partner O O N/A
who, O O N/A
essentially, O O N/A
manages O O N/A
everything O O N/A
except O O N/A
the O O N/A
design. O O N/A
Familiar O O N/A

other O O N/A

work O O N/A
alongside O O N/A
loyal O O N/A
retainers O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A
McNally O O N/A
empire. O O N/A
The O O N/A
McNally O O N/A
troops O O N/A
are O O N/A
exquisitely O O N/A
poised, O O N/A
self-assured, O O N/A
able O O N/A
to O O N/A
spot O O N/A
a O O N/A
misplaced O O N/A
butter O O N/A
knife O O N/A
from O O N/A
across O O N/A
the O O N/A
street. O O N/A
The O O N/A
Starr O O N/A
cadre O O N/A
is O O N/A
more O O N/A
casual, O O N/A
and O O N/A
occasionally O O N/A
a O O N/A
server O O N/A
will O O N/A
ask O O N/A
your O O N/A
opinion O O N/A
of O O N/A
"the O O N/A
flavors O O N/A
so O O N/A
far," O O N/A
a O O N/A
question O O N/A
that O O N/A
has O O N/A
surely O O N/A
never O O N/A
been O O N/A
uttered O O N/A
at O O N/A
Minetta O O N/A
Tavern O O N/A
. O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Starr O O N/A
has O O N/A
oversight O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
wine O O N/A
list, O O N/A
which O O N/A
is O O N/A
less O O N/A
conservative O O N/A
than O O N/A
a O O N/A
typical O O N/A
McNally O O N/A
lineup, O O N/A
and O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
food, O O N/A
which O O N/A
has O O N/A
not O O N/A
been O O N/A
a O O N/A
strong O O N/A
suit O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
McNally O O N/A
organization O O N/A
since O O N/A
the O O N/A
chefs O O N/A
Lee O O N/A

and O O N/A
Riad O O N/A
Nasr O O N/A
went O O N/A
out O O N/A
on O O N/A
their O O N/A
own. O O N/A
Pastis's O O N/A
chef, O O N/A
Michael O O N/A

was O O N/A
until O O N/A

Better O O N/A

would O O N/A

out O O N/A
simple, O O N/A

hunger-obliterating O O N/A
French O O N/A
cuisine O O N/A
drawn O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A

fast O O N/A

laden O O N/A
with O O N/A
chicken O O N/A

soft O O N/A
white O O N/A
pork O O N/A
fat O O N/A
in O O N/A
gobs O O N/A
the O O N/A
size O O N/A

gumdrops, O O N/A
although O O N/A
it O O N/A
could O O N/A
stand O O N/A
more O O N/A
salt, O O N/A
and O O N/A
I'd O O N/A
be O O N/A
happy O O N/A
to O O N/A
trade O O N/A
the O O N/A
slab O O N/A
of O O N/A
butter O O N/A
that O O N/A
comes O O N/A
with O O N/A
it O O N/A
for O O N/A
a O O N/A
pot O O N/A
of O O N/A
mustard. O O N/A
The O O N/A
pâté O O N/A
is O O N/A
made O O N/A
in O O N/A
house, O O N/A
as O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
gorgeously O O N/A
smooth O O N/A
boudin O O N/A
blanc. O O N/A
With O O N/A
the O O N/A
boudin, O O N/A
you O O N/A
want O O N/A
puréed O O N/A
potatoes O O N/A
that O O N/A
are O O N/A
almost O O N/A
liquid. O O N/A
That O O N/A
is O O N/A
what O O N/A
you O O N/A
get. O O N/A
You O O N/A
might O O N/A
argue O O N/A
that, O O N/A
when O O N/A
it O O N/A
offers O O N/A

to O O N/A
be O O N/A
dipped O O N/A
in O O N/A

this O O N/A
unextravagant O O N/A

breaks O O N/A
character. O O N/A
Does O O N/A
the O O N/A
same O O N/A
apply O O N/A
to O O N/A
garnishing O O N/A
sardines O O N/A
served O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A

with O O N/A
an O O N/A
ingot O O N/A
of O O N/A
prized, O O N/A
costly O O N/A
butter O O N/A
made O O N/A
by O O N/A
Jean-Yves O O N/A
Bordier? O O N/A
Maybe. O O N/A
I O O N/A
thought, O O N/A
in O O N/A
any O O N/A
case, O O N/A
that O O N/A
the O O N/A
sardines O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
olive O O N/A
oil O O N/A
they O O N/A
are O O N/A
packed O O N/A
in O O N/A
tended O O N/A
to O O N/A
talk O O N/A
over O O N/A
the O O N/A
butter. O O N/A
The O O N/A
half O O N/A
roast O O N/A
chicken O O N/A
is O O N/A
not O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
same O O N/A
class O O N/A
as O O N/A
the O O N/A
birds O O N/A
that O O N/A
Antoine O O N/A
Westermann O O N/A
cooked O O N/A
when O O N/A
he O O N/A
was O O N/A
still O O N/A
at O O N/A
Le O O N/A
Coq O O N/A
Rico O O N/A
, O O N/A
but O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
probably O O N/A
as O O N/A
good O O N/A
a O O N/A
roast O O N/A
chicken O O N/A
as O O N/A
any O O N/A
normal O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
can O O N/A
produce. O O N/A
The O O N/A
duck O O N/A
in O O N/A
olives, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
is O O N/A
misconceived; O O N/A
the O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
is O O N/A
thin, O O N/A
acrid O O N/A
and O O N/A
one-dimensional O O N/A
instead O O N/A
of O O N/A
head-spinningly O O N/A
rich, O O N/A
the O O N/A
way O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
at O O N/A

Those O O N/A

that O O N/A
are O O N/A
crunchy O O N/A

or O O N/A
they O O N/A

a O O N/A

At O O N/A

better O O N/A

When N/A O O
I N/A O O
wandered N/A O O
into N/A O O
the N/A O O
Gansevoort N/A O B-EST
Market N/A O I-EST
location N/A O O
in N/A O O
February, N/A O O
it N/A O O
seemed N/A O O
clear N/A O O
that N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Chávez N/A O O
could N/A O O
run N/A O O
an N/A O O
interesting N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
if N/A O O
he N/A O O
ever N/A O O
decided N/A O O
to N/A O O
put N/A O O
his N/A O O
food N/A O O
into N/A O O
something N/A O O
other N/A O O
than N/A O O
recyclable N/A O O
salad N/A O O
bowls. N/A O O
Then, N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
beginning N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
summer, N/A O O
he N/A O O
did N/A O O
just N/A O O
that, N/A O O
opening N/A O O
a N/A O O
sit-down N/A O O

sign N/A O O
that N/A O O
reads N/A O O
"tiger N/A O O

probably N/A O O
a N/A O O
reference N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
belief N/A O O
that N/A O O
drinking N/A O O
leftover N/A O O

solidly N/A O O
Peruvian N/A O B-CUISINE
that N/A O O

withstand N/A O O
the N/A O O
chimichurri N/A O B-FOOD
that N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O

brings N/A O O
in, N/A O O
by N/A O O
way N/A O O
of N/A O O
Argentina, N/A O B-LOC
as N/A O O
a N/A O O
final N/A O O
touch. N/A O O
He N/A O O
clearly N/A O O
has N/A O O
a N/A O O
soft N/A O O
spot N/A O O
for N/A O O
chimichurri N/A O B-FOOD
because N/A O O
he N/A O O
deploys N/A O O
it N/A O O
again N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
shrimp N/A O B-DISH
anticuchos N/A O I-DISH
(the N/A O O
shrimp N/A O B-FOOD
are N/A O O
very N/A O O
big N/A O O
and N/A O O
look N/A O O
even N/A O O
bigger N/A O O
because N/A O O
they're N/A O O
grilled N/A O O

served N/A O O

huancaína, N/A O B-FOOD
the N/A O O
spicy N/A O O
yellow N/A O O

is N/A O O
something N/A O O

Peru's N/A O B-LOC

My N/A O O
favorite N/A O O

a N/A O O

But N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O

has N/A O O
the N/A O O

to N/A O O
put N/A O O
several N/A O O

Mission N/A O O
Ceviche's N/A O O
servers, N/A O O
while N/A O O
eager N/A O O
to N/A O O

have N/A O O
a N/A O O
habit N/A O O
of N/A O O
singling N/A O O
out N/A O O
the N/A O O
most N/A O O
obvious N/A O O
dishes N/A O O
-- N/A O O
the N/A O O
classic N/A O B-DISH
ceviche, N/A O I-DISH
the N/A O O
octopus N/A O O
leg N/A O O
-- N/A O O
and N/A O O
pushing N/A O O
them N/A O O
so N/A O O
hard N/A O O
you N/A O O
might N/A O O
suspect N/A O O
the N/A O O
rest N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
minefield. N/A O O
It N/A O O
isn't. N/A O O
There N/A O O
is N/A O O
nothing N/A O O
to N/A O O
avoid N/A O O
unless N/A O O
the N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
brings N/A O O
back N/A O O
the N/A O O
bizarre N/A O O
strawberry-kiwi N/A O O
ceviche N/A O O
that N/A O O
showed N/A O O
up N/A O O
as N/A O O
a N/A O O
special N/A O O
one N/A O O
night. N/A O O
If N/A O O
you N/A O O
are N/A O O
being N/A O O
herded N/A O O
into N/A O O
getting N/A O O
the N/A O O
"Peruvian N/A O O
paella," N/A O O
you N/A O O
should N/A O O
know N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
other N/A O O
three N/A O O
main N/A O O
courses N/A O O
are N/A O O
also N/A O O
worth N/A O O
looking N/A O O
into, N/A O O
like N/A O O
the N/A O O
ají N/A O O
de N/A O O
gallina, N/A O O
shredded N/A O O
chicken N/A O O
breast N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
creamy N/A O O
ají N/A O O
amarillo N/A O O
sauce N/A O O
that N/A O O
is N/A O O
both N/A O O
soothing N/A O O
and N/A O O
spicy; N/A O O
or N/A O O
the N/A O O
seco N/A O O

a N/A O O
slowly N/A O O
braised N/A O O
short N/A O O

cilantro N/A O O
sauce. N/A O O
All N/A O O
are N/A O O
larger N/A O O
than N/A O O
average, N/A O O
too. N/A O O
Still, N/A O O
nothing N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
quite N/A O O
rivals N/A O O
the N/A O O
ceviches. N/A O O
They N/A O O
are N/A O O
served, N/A O O
yes, N/A O O
without N/A O O
lettuce N/A O O
or N/A O O
rice, N/A O O
and N/A O O
they N/A O O
are N/A O O
better N/A O O
for N/A O O
it. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Chávez's N/A O O
creative N/A O O
engine N/A O O
seems N/A O O
to N/A O O
have N/A O O
a N/A O O
high N/A O O
idle, N/A O O
and N/A O O
he N/A O O
has N/A O O
come N/A O O
up N/A O O
with N/A O O
different N/A O O
ways N/A O O

The N/A O O

a N/A O O
bloop N/A O O

the N/A O O

vegetarian N/A O O

where N/A O O
the N/A O O
fish N/A O O
is N/A O O

by N/A O O
shiitakes N/A O O

the N/A O O

the N/A O O
form N/A O O
of N/A O O
snow, N/A O O
frozen N/A O O
by N/A O O
liquid N/A O O
nitrogen. N/A O O
The N/A O O
art N/A O O
of N/A O O
ceviche-making N/A O O
has N/A O O
at N/A O O
least N/A O O
as N/A O O
much N/A O O
in N/A O O
common N/A O O
with N/A O O
mixology N/A O O
as N/A O O
with N/A O O
cooking, N/A O O
so N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
no N/A O O
surprise N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
cocktails N/A O O
are N/A O O
well N/A O O
calibrated N/A O O
and N/A O O
sing N/A O O
out N/A O O
with N/A O O
fresh N/A O O
lime. N/A O O
There N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
twist N/A O O

the N/A O O
pisco N/A O O
sour N/A O O

passion-fruit N/A O O

another N/A O O

the N/A O O
purple-corn N/A O O
drink N/A O O
chicha N/A O O
morada, N/A O O
although N/A O O
neither N/A O O
quite N/A O O
achieves N/A O O
the N/A O O
bracing N/A O O
elegance N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
original. N/A O O
And N/A O O
it's N/A O O
nice N/A O O
to N/A O O
see N/A O O

less N/A O O
well-known N/A O O

pisco N/A O O
highball N/A O O

lime N/A O O
juice N/A O O

be N/A O O
better?) N/A O O
Chicha N/A O O
morada N/A O O
appears N/A O O
again N/A O O

the N/A O O
raspadilla N/A O O

in N/A O O
The N/A O O
New N/A O O

in N/A O O
1998. N/A O O
She N/A O O

for N/A O O
the N/A O O
poor N/A O O

being N/A O O
paid N/A O O
more N/A O O
in N/A O O
Hong N/A O O

and N/A O O
China. N/A O O
That N/A O O
is N/A O O
as N/A O O
true N/A O O
as N/A O O
it N/A O O
was N/A O O
21 N/A O O
years N/A O O
ago, N/A O O
but N/A O O
what N/A O O
has N/A O O
changed N/A O O
is N/A O O
the N/A O O
rise N/A O O
of N/A O O
global N/A O O
Chinese N/A O O

groups, N/A O O
from N/A O O
the N/A O O

the N/A O O

solid N/A O O
Hao N/A O O
Noodle N/A O O
outposts N/A O O
and, N/A O O
now, N/A O O
to N/A O O
Hutong. N/A O O
The N/A O O
original N/A O O
Hutong N/A O O
opened N/A O O
in N/A O O
2003 N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
28th N/A O O

of N/A O O
a N/A O O
glass N/A O O
tower N/A O O
overlooking N/A O O
the N/A O O
Hong N/A O O
Kong N/A O O
harbor, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
dining N/A O O
room N/A O O
tries N/A O O
to N/A O O
conjure N/A O O
the N/A O O
atmosphere N/A O O
of N/A O O
Beijing's N/A O O
vanishing N/A O O
premodern N/A O O
alleys, N/A O O
or N/A O O
hutongs, N/A O O
by N/A O O
means N/A O O
of N/A O O
red N/A O O
paper N/A O O
lanterns, N/A O O
carved N/A O O
wooden N/A O O
doors N/A O O
and N/A O O
birdcages. N/A O O
The N/A O O
Manhattan N/A O O
branch N/A O O
makes N/A O O
a N/A O O
different N/A O O
impression. N/A O O
The N/A O O
entrance N/A O O
is N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
east N/A O O
side N/A O O
of N/A O O

Turn N/A O O
right N/A O O
and N/A O O
you N/A O O
are N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
narrow N/A O O
hallway N/A O O
between N/A O O
two N/A O O
soaring N/A O O
glass N/A O O
stacks N/A O O
of N/A O O
wine N/A O O
bottles, N/A O O
every N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
them N/A O O
for N/A O O
decorative N/A O O
purposes N/A O O
only. N/A O O
Turn N/A O O
left N/A O O
and N/A O O
you N/A O O
are N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
glittering, N/A O O
soaring, N/A O O
hard-edge N/A O O
dining N/A O O

The N/A O O
inspiration N/A O O
seems N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
Art N/A O O
Deco N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
pinch N/A O O
of N/A O O
cocaine; N/A O O
the N/A O O
blue N/A O O
leather N/A O O
banquettes, N/A O O
beveled N/A O O
mirrors N/A O O
and N/A O O
chandeliers N/A O O
of N/A O O
mirror-polished N/A O O

"Gentlemen N/A O O

A N/A O O
guest N/A O O
who N/A O O
has N/A O O
lived N/A O O
in N/A O O
China N/A O O
allowed N/A O O
his N/A O O
eyes N/A O O
to N/A O O
adjust N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
glinting N/A O O
light N/A O O
as N/A O O
he N/A O O
looked N/A O O
toward N/A O O
the N/A O O
ceiling, N/A O O
which N/A O O
seemed N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
far N/A O O
away. N/A O O
"It's N/A O O
very N/A O O
… N/A O O
yin," N/A O O
he N/A O O
said. N/A O O
Hutong N/A O O
is N/A O O
ostensibly N/A O O
a N/A O O
Northern N/A O O
Chinese N/A O O
restaurant. N/A O O
This N/A O O
is N/A O O
more N/A O O
apparent N/A O O
in N/A O O
Hong N/A O O
Kong N/A O O
than N/A O O
in N/A O O
Manhattan, N/A O O
where N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
has N/A O O
been N/A O O
pruned N/A O O
to N/A O O
about N/A O O
half N/A O O
the N/A O O
size. N/A O O
Lamb, N/A O O
a N/A O O
mainstay N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
northern N/A O O
provinces, N/A O O
was N/A O O
represented N/A O O
in N/A O O
August N/A O O
by N/A O O
a N/A O O
single N/A O O
dish, N/A O O
cumin-speckled N/A O O
ribs N/A O O
roasted N/A O O
languorously N/A O O
to N/A O O
a N/A O O
mind-altering N/A O O
tenderness. N/A O O
By N/A O O
the N/A O O
time N/A O O
of N/A O O
my N/A O O
last N/A O O
visit, N/A O O
lamb N/A O O
had N/A O O
ambled N/A O O
off N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
entirely. N/A O O
The N/A O O
most N/A O O
famous N/A O O
preparation N/A O O
from N/A O O
northern N/A O O
China, N/A O O
Peking N/A O O
duck, N/A O O
arrived N/A O O
at N/A O O
my N/A O O
table N/A O O
worse N/A O O
for N/A O O
wear N/A O O
and N/A O O
tear, N/A O O
carved N/A O O
haphazardly, N/A O O
with N/A O O
blobs N/A O O
of N/A O O
unmelted N/A O O
fat N/A O O
clinging N/A O O
to N/A O O
limp N/A O O
skin. N/A O O
The N/A O O
second N/A O O
course, N/A O O
a N/A O O
dark-meat N/A O O
stir-fry N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
folded N/A O O
in N/A O O
iceberg N/A O O
lettuce, N/A O O
was N/A O O
more N/A O O
skillfully N/A O O
done, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
sting N/A O O
of N/A O O
paying N/A O O
$84 N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O
whole N/A O O
duck N/A O O
with N/A O O
uncrisp N/A O O
skin N/A O O
lingered. N/A O O
Much N/A O O
of N/A O O
what N/A O O
hasn't N/A O O
been N/A O O
trimmed N/A O O
from N/A O O
the N/A O O
Hong N/A O O

equals N/A O O
it, N/A O O
I N/A O O
haven't N/A O O
found N/A O O
it N/A O O
yet. N/A O O
I N/A O O
did, N/A O O
however, N/A O O
have N/A O O
a N/A O O
cryptic N/A O O
encounter N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
log-cabin N/A O O
stack N/A O O
of N/A O O
okra N/A O O
doused N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
sweet N/A O O
wasabi N/A O O
sauce, N/A O O
and N/A O O
an N/A O O
inconclusive N/A O O
rendezvous N/A O O
with N/A O O
some N/A O O
steamed N/A O O
asparagus N/A O O
stalks N/A O O
whose N/A O O
tips N/A O O
were N/A O O
enrobed N/A O O
in N/A O O
white N/A O O
sesame N/A O O
sauce; N/A O O
it N/A O O
was N/A O O
as N/A O O
if N/A O O
somebody N/A O O
had N/A O O
tried N/A O O
to N/A O O
replicate N/A O O
strawberries N/A O O
dipped N/A O O
in N/A O O
white N/A O O
chocolate N/A O O
without N/A O O
access N/A O O
to N/A O O
strawberries N/A O O
or N/A O O
white N/A O O
chocolate. N/A O O
You N/A O O
could N/A O O
attempt N/A O O
to N/A O O
unknot N/A O O
these N/A O O
mysteries. N/A O O
Then N/A O O
again, N/A O O
you N/A O O
could N/A O O
simply N/A O O
begin N/A O O
your N/A O O
meal N/A O O
with N/A O O
dim N/A O O
sum. N/A O O
And N/A O O
then, N/A O O
after N/A O O
picking N/A O O
your N/A O O
way N/A O O
through N/A O O
the N/A O O
chile-besotted N/A O O
main N/A O O
courses, N/A O O
you N/A O O
could N/A O O
end N/A O O
it N/A O O
that N/A O O
way, N/A O O
too. N/A O O
There N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
dessert N/A O O
that N/A O O
mimics N/A O O
the N/A O O
shape N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
steamed N/A O O
bun, N/A O O
pleated N/A O O
and N/A O O
twisted N/A O O
into N/A O O
a N/A O O
pucker N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
top. N/A O O
It N/A O O
is N/A O O
made N/A O O
of N/A O O
white N/A O O
chocolate, N/A O O
the N/A O O
wrapper N/A O O
on N/A O O
this N/A O O
trompe N/A O O
l'oeil N/A O O
bao, N/A O O
and N/A O O
filled N/A O O
with N/A O O
white N/A O O
sesame N/A O O
cream N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
core N/A O O
of N/A O O
bittersweet N/A O O
salted N/A O O
caramel. N/A O O
Alongside N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
single N/A O O
scoop N/A O O
of N/A O O
ice N/A O O
cream N/A O O
made N/A O O
from N/A O O
lightly N/A O O
sweetened N/A O O
soy N/A O O
milk. N/A O O
The N/A O O
soy N/A O O
milk N/A O O
is N/A O O
extremely N/A O O
fresh. N/A O O
I N/A O O
don't N/A O O
mean N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
carton N/A O O
won't N/A O O
expire N/A O O
for N/A O O
another N/A O O
three N/A O O
weeks; N/A O O
I N/A O O
mean N/A O O
that N/A O O
somebody N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
was N/A O O
squeezing N/A O O
the N/A O O
soybeans N/A O O
shortly N/A O O
before N/A O O
the N/A O O
ice N/A O O
cream N/A O O
was N/A O O
frozen. N/A O O
This N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
snack N/A O O
from N/A O O
a N/A O O
Chinese N/A O O
childhood, N/A O O
bread N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
glass N/A O O
of N/A O O
milk, N/A O O
and N/A O O
it N/A O O
would N/A O O
be N/A O O
hard, N/A O O
after N/A O O
several N/A O O
courses N/A O O
of N/A O O
spice, N/A O O
to N/A O O
think N/A O O
of N/A O O
anything N/A O O
more N/A O O
welcome. N/A O O

Last N/A O O
month N/A O O
I N/A O O
had N/A O O
dinner N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
friend N/A O O
who N/A O O
lives N/A O O
a N/A O O
thousand N/A O O
miles N/A O O
away N/A O O
and N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
get N/A O O
to N/A O O
Manhattan N/A B-LOC B-LOC
as N/A O O
often N/A O O
as N/A O O
he N/A O O
once N/A O O
did. N/A O O
When N/A O O
I N/A O O
asked N/A O O
where N/A O O
he N/A O O
wanted N/A O O
to N/A O O
eat, N/A O O
he N/A O O
answered, N/A O O
a N/A O O
bit N/A O O
wistfully, N/A O O
"Somewhere N/A O O
that N/A O O
speaks N/A O O
of N/A O O
New N/A B-LOC B-LOC
York, N/A I-LOC I-LOC
a N/A O O
city N/A O O
I N/A O O
have N/A O O
lost N/A O O
touch N/A O O
with." N/A O O
At N/A O O
first, N/A O O
I N/A O O
looked N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O
place N/A O O
where N/A O O
we N/A O O
could N/A O O
be N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
thick N/A O O
of N/A O O
it N/A O O
all. N/A O O
I N/A O O
thought N/A O O
of N/A O O
Bar N/A B-EST B-EST
Pisellino N/A I-EST I-EST
, N/A O O
that N/A O O
narrow N/A O O
glass N/A O O
sarcophagus N/A O O
run N/A O O
by N/A O O
Rita N/A O O
Sodi N/A O O
and N/A O O
Jody N/A O O
Williams, N/A O O
where N/A O O
you N/A O O
drink N/A O O
your N/A O O
sgroppino N/A B-FOOD B-DISH
standing N/A O O
up N/A O O
between N/A O O
the N/A O O
window N/A O O
along N/A O O
Grove N/A B-LOC B-LOC
Street N/A I-LOC I-LOC
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
one N/A O O
along N/A O O
Seventh N/A B-LOC B-LOC
Avenue. N/A I-LOC I-LOC
People N/A O O
trickle N/A O O
in, N/A O O
eat N/A O O
some N/A O O
olives N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
tuna N/A B-DISH B-DISH
tramezzino, N/A I-DISH I-DISH
and N/A O O
head N/A O O
out N/A O O
again. N/A O O
Although N/A O O
it's N/A O O
about N/A O O
the N/A O O
size N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
subway N/A O O
car, N/A O O
you N/A O O
get N/A O O
the N/A O O
feeling N/A O O
that N/A O O
if N/A O O
you N/A O O
stayed N/A O O
long N/A O O
enough, N/A O O
you'd N/A O O
eventually N/A O O
see N/A O O
everybody N/A O O
you N/A O O
know. N/A O O
But N/A O O
a N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
that N/A O O
truly N/A O O
speaks N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
place N/A O O
New N/A B-LOC B-LOC
York N/A I-LOC I-LOC
has N/A O O
become N/A O O
over N/A O O
the N/A O O
past N/A O O
decade N/A O O
or N/A O O
so N/A O O
would N/A O O
be N/A O O
nearly N/A O O
the N/A O O
opposite N/A O O
of N/A O O
Bar N/A B-EST B-EST
Pisellino. N/A I-EST I-EST
This N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
would N/A O O
not N/A O O
be N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
thick N/A O O
of N/A O O
it N/A O O
all. N/A O O
It N/A O O
would N/A O O
be N/A O O
hushed, N/A O O
sheltered, N/A O O
exclusive, N/A O O
admitting N/A O O
no N/A O O
more N/A O O
than N/A O O
a N/A O O
handful N/A O O
of N/A O O
people N/A O O
at N/A O O
a N/A O O
time. N/A O O
It N/A O O
would N/A O O
protect N/A O O
those N/A O O
people, N/A O O
once N/A O O
they N/A O O
were N/A O O
inside, N/A O O
from N/A O O
crowds N/A O O
spilling N/A O O
in N/A O O
from N/A O O
the N/A O O
street, N/A O O
even N/A O O
from N/A O O
the N/A O O
street N/A O O
itself. N/A O O
It N/A O O
would N/A O O
join N/A O O
the N/A O O
steady N/A O O
march N/A O O
of N/A O O
new N/A O O
tasting N/A B-TYPE O
counters N/A I-TYPE O
and N/A O O
omakase N/A B-TYPE B-TYPE
hideaways. N/A I-TYPE O
And N/A O O
it N/A O O
would N/A O O
illustrate N/A O O
the N/A O O
growing N/A O O
ease N/A O O
with N/A O O
which N/A O O
New N/A O O
Yorkers N/A O O
of N/A O O
means N/A O O
can N/A O O
glide N/A O O
through N/A O O
and N/A O O
above N/A O O
the N/A O O
fray, N/A O O
slipping N/A O O
from N/A O O
one N/A O O
cloistered N/A O O
room N/A O O
to N/A O O
another N/A O O
in N/A O O
black N/A O O
cars N/A O O
without N/A O O
touching N/A O O
down. N/A O O
That N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
would N/A O O
be N/A O O
a N/A O O
lot N/A O O
like N/A O O
Frevo N/A B-EST B-EST
, N/A O O
which N/A O O
has N/A O O
been N/A O O
serving N/A O O
suave, N/A O O
$124 N/A O O
tasting N/A O O
menus N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
modern-French N/A B-CUISINE B-CUISINE
sensibility N/A O O
in N/A O O
Greenwich N/A B-LOC B-LOC
Village N/A I-LOC I-LOC
for N/A O O
the N/A O O
past N/A O O
four N/A O O
months. N/A O O
Frevo N/A B-EST B-EST
is N/A O O
the N/A O O
work N/A O O
of N/A O O
Franco N/A O O
Sampogna, N/A O O
who N/A O O
is N/A O O
the N/A O O
chef, N/A O O
and N/A O O
Bernardo N/A O O
Silva, N/A O O
the N/A O O
manager. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Sampogna N/A O O
is N/A O O
from N/A O O
Brazil N/A B-LOC B-LOC
and N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Silva N/A O O
comes N/A O O
from N/A O O
Portugal; N/A B-LOC B-LOC
they N/A O O
met N/A O O
10 N/A O O
years N/A O O
ago N/A O O
while N/A O O
working N/A O O
in N/A O O
restaurants N/A O O
in N/A O O
France, N/A B-LOC B-LOC
and N/A O O
quickly N/A O O
decided N/A O O
that N/A O O
one N/A O O
day N/A O O
they N/A O O
would N/A O O
open N/A O O
a N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
in N/A O O
New N/A B-LOC B-LOC
York N/A I-LOC I-LOC
City N/A I-LOC I-LOC
that N/A O O
would N/A O O
give N/A O O
diners N/A O O
"that N/A O O
feeling N/A O O
of N/A O O
being N/A O O
in N/A O O
your N/A O O
own N/A O O
secluded N/A O O
safe N/A O O
haven," N/A O O
as N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Sampogna N/A O O
put N/A O O
it. N/A O O
To N/A O O
get N/A O O
into N/A O O
Frevo, N/A B-EST B-EST
you N/A O O
first N/A O O
need N/A O O
to N/A O O
know N/A O O
that N/A O O
Frevo N/A B-EST B-EST
exists. N/A O O
There's N/A O O
no N/A O O
sign. N/A O O
When N/A O O
you N/A O O
arrive N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
correct N/A O O
address, N/A O O
what N/A O O
you N/A O O
see N/A O O
is N/A O O
an N/A O O
art N/A O O
gallery N/A O O
with N/A O O
just N/A O O
enough N/A O O
room N/A O O
on N/A O O
its N/A O O
white N/A O O
walls N/A O O
for N/A O O
the N/A O O
six N/A O O
abstract N/A O O
paintings N/A O O
that N/A O O
hang N/A O O
there N/A O O
fairly N/A O O
close N/A O O
together. N/A O O
The N/A O O
paintings N/A O O
are N/A O O
real N/A O O
paintings N/A O O
made N/A O O
by N/A O O
a N/A O O
real N/A O O
artist, N/A O O
Thomas N/A O O
Labarthe, N/A O O
who N/A O O
goes N/A O O
by N/A O O
Toma-L N/A O O
, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
gallery N/A O O
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
entirely N/A O O
a N/A O O
real N/A O O
gallery. N/A O O
If N/A O O
it N/A O O
were, N/A O O
the N/A O O
young N/A O O
woman N/A O O
who N/A O O
sits N/A O O
there N/A O O
keeping N/A O O
an N/A O O
eye N/A O O
on N/A O O
things N/A O O
would N/A O O
stare N/A O O
blankly N/A O O
ahead N/A O O
when N/A O O
you N/A O O
entered, N/A O O
instead N/A O O
of N/A O O
walking N/A O O
up N/A O O
to N/A O O
you N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
smile N/A O O
and N/A O O
reassuring N/A O O
you N/A O O
that, N/A O O
yes, N/A O O
you've N/A O O
come N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
right N/A O O
place. N/A O O
Then N/A O O
she N/A O O
reaches N/A O O
behind N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
canvases N/A O O
and N/A O O
it N/A O O
swings N/A O O
out N/A O O
on N/A O O
invisible N/A O O
hinges, N/A O O
leaving N/A O O
in N/A O O
its N/A O O
place N/A O O
a N/A O O
doorway N/A O O
through N/A O O
which N/A O O
you N/A O O
can N/A O O
see, N/A O O
illuminated N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
large, N/A O O
dark N/A O O
room, N/A O O
a N/A O O
stainless-steel N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
long, N/A O O
curving N/A O O
counter N/A O O
of N/A O O
polished N/A O O
quartzite. N/A O O
You N/A O O
hop N/A O O
up N/A O O
on N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
18 N/A O O
padded N/A O O
seats, N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
door N/A O O
clicks N/A O O
closed. N/A O O
You N/A O O
are N/A O O
in. N/A O O
When N/A O O
the N/A O O
door N/A O O
opens N/A O O
again, N/A O O
typically N/A O O
not N/A O O
for N/A O O
another N/A O O
half N/A O O
an N/A O O
hour, N/A O O
in N/A O O
will N/A O O
walk N/A O O
another N/A O O
set N/A O O
of N/A O O
people N/A O O
who, N/A O O
like N/A O O
you, N/A O O
knew N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
gallery N/A O O
was N/A O O
not N/A O O
a N/A O O
normal N/A O O
gallery. N/A O O
Let's N/A O O
say N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
misdirection N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
gallery N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
secret N/A O O
door N/A O O
do N/A O O
not N/A O O
make N/A O O
these N/A O O
newcomers N/A O O
feel N/A O O
sufficiently N/A O O
insulated N/A O O
from N/A O O
the N/A O O
outside N/A O O
world. N/A O O
Frevo N/A B-EST B-EST
gives N/A O O
them N/A O O
the N/A O O
opportunity N/A O O
to N/A O O
sit N/A O O
at N/A O O
a N/A O O
round N/A O O
chef's N/A O O
table N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
back N/A O O
corner N/A O O
around N/A O O
which N/A O O
a N/A O O
curtain N/A O O
can N/A O O
be N/A O O
drawn, N/A O O
as N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
hospital N/A O O
room. N/A O O
Much N/A O O
of N/A O O
this N/A O O
comes N/A O O
right N/A O O
out N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
neo-speakeasy N/A B-TYPE B-TYPE
handbook, N/A O O
although N/A O O
Frevo N/A B-EST B-EST
does N/A O O
throw N/A O O
itself N/A O O
into N/A O O
the N/A O O
act N/A O O
with N/A O O
an N/A O O
unusual N/A O O
level N/A O O
of N/A O O
commitment. N/A O O
The N/A O O
gallery, N/A O O
for N/A O O
instance, N/A O O
installed N/A O O
a N/A O O
new N/A O O
batch N/A O O
of N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Labarthe's N/A O O
canvases N/A O O
around N/A O O
Labor N/A O O
Day. N/A O O
But N/A O O
each N/A O O
time N/A O O
I N/A O O
went N/A O O
to N/A O O
Frevo, N/A B-EST B-EST
I N/A O O
stared N/A O O
at N/A O O
that N/A O O
curtain. N/A O O
Nobody N/A O O
ever N/A O O
closed N/A O O
it N/A O O
while N/A O O
I N/A O O
was N/A O O
there, N/A O O
but N/A O O
it N/A O O
still N/A O O
reminded N/A O O
me N/A O O
how N/A O O
easy N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
now N/A O O
for N/A O O
some N/A O O
New N/A O O
Yorkers N/A O O
to N/A O O
climb N/A O O
into N/A O O
the N/A O O
treehouse N/A O O
and N/A O O
pull N/A O O
the N/A O O
ladder N/A O O
up N/A O O
behind N/A O O
them. N/A O O
I N/A O O
have N/A O O

that N/A O O

The N/A O O
pleasures N/A O O
of N/A O O
this N/A O O
secluded N/A O O
safe N/A O O
haven N/A O O
are N/A O O
real, N/A O O
and N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Sampogna's N/A O O
cooking N/A O O
is N/A O O
focused N/A O O
and N/A O O
refined. N/A O O
I N/A O O
haven't N/A O O
been N/A O O
able N/A O O
to N/A O O
get N/A O O
his N/A O O
halibut N/A B-DISH B-DISH
dish N/A O O
out N/A O O
of N/A O O
my N/A O O
mind, N/A O O
for N/A O O
instance. N/A O O
The N/A O O
fish N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
rests N/A O O
on N/A O O
a N/A O O
thin, N/A O O
crisp N/A O O
platform N/A O O
of N/A O O
fried N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD

shellacked N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
dark N/A O O

marmalade; N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
this N/A O O
miniature N/A O O
mushroom N/A O O
tart N/A O O
drinks N/A O O
up N/A O O
the N/A O O
flavor N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
halibut N/A O O
as N/A O O
it N/A O O
goes, N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
oven, N/A O O
from N/A O O
raw N/A O O
to N/A O O
that N/A O O
just-cooked N/A O O
state N/A O O
where N/A O O
its N/A O O
flesh N/A O O
slides N/A O O
apart N/A O O
into N/A O O
thick N/A O O
and N/A O O
almost N/A O O
fluffy N/A O O
white N/A O O
flakes. N/A O O
Alongside N/A O O
the N/A O O
fish N/A O O
are N/A O O
bulbs N/A O O
of N/A O O
melted N/A O O
fennel, N/A O O
their N/A O O

Mr. N/A O O
Sampogna's N/A O O
opening N/A O O
salvo N/A O O
often N/A O O
involves N/A O O
quinoa N/A O O
doing N/A O O
something N/A O O
quinoa N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
usually N/A O O
do, N/A O O
and N/A O O
doing N/A O O
it N/A O O
quite N/A O O
nicely. N/A O O
I N/A O O
liked N/A O O
its N/A O O
freshness N/A O O
when N/A O O
it N/A O O
was N/A O O
used N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O

spooned N/A O O
over N/A O O
a N/A O O
demitasse N/A O O
of N/A O O
creamy N/A O O
hummus; N/A O O
I N/A O O
liked N/A O O
its N/A O O
crunch N/A O O
when N/A O O
it N/A O O
was N/A O O
dehydrated N/A O O
and N/A O O
sprinkled N/A O O
over N/A O O
a N/A O O
few N/A O O
mouthfuls N/A O O
of N/A O O
black N/A O O

topped N/A O O
with N/A O O
glistening N/A O O

A N/A O O
dish N/A O O
from N/A O O
early N/A O O

brought N/A O O
peas, N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
tail N/A O O
end N/A O O
of N/A O O
their N/A O O

together N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O

pistachio-tarragon N/A O O
cream N/A O O
and N/A O O
white N/A O O
puffs N/A O O
of N/A O O
coconut N/A O O

light N/A O O
and N/A O O
charming. N/A O O
I N/A O O
wished N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O

had N/A O O
exploited N/A O O
summer N/A O O
produce N/A O O

when N/A O O
I N/A O O
went N/A O O
back N/A O O
in N/A O O
August N/A O O
and N/A O O
September. N/A O O
His N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
is N/A O O
small N/A O O
enough N/A O O
that N/A O O
he N/A O O
could N/A O O
respond N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
market N/A O O
day N/A O O
by N/A O O
day, N/A O O
but N/A O O
so N/A O O
far N/A O O
this N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
seem N/A O O
to N/A O O
interest N/A O O
him. N/A O O
Frevo, N/A O O
at N/A O O
$124 N/A O O

of N/A O O
the N/A O O

it's N/A O O
$18 N/A O O

a N/A O O
serving N/A O O

This N/A O O

is N/A O O
not N/A O O
as N/A O O
grating N/A O O

it N/A O O

a N/A O O

charge N/A O O
of N/A O O
$355, N/A O O
but N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
still N/A O O
a N/A O O
snag N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
otherwise N/A O O
smooth N/A O O
hospitality N/A O O
provided N/A O O
by N/A O O
Frevo's N/A O O
small N/A O O
crew N/A O O

cooks. N/A O O
Everyone N/A O O
I've N/A O O
brought N/A O O
to N/A O O
Frevo N/A O O
has N/A O O
fallen N/A O O
under N/A O O
its N/A O O
spell, N/A O O
which N/A O O
is N/A O O
hard N/A O O
to N/A O O
resist. N/A O O
The N/A O O
music N/A O O
is N/A O O
slinky N/A O O
and N/A O O
sinuous. N/A O O
The N/A O O
room N/A O O
has N/A O O
a N/A O O
nocturnal N/A O O
theatricality; N/A O O
sitting N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
counter N/A O O

darkness N/A O O
behind N/A O O
you N/A O O

the N/A O O

can N/A O O
feel N/A O O
like N/A O O
attending N/A O O
an N/A O O
extremely N/A O O
elegant N/A O O
campfire. N/A O O
I N/A O O
still N/A O O
think N/A O O
Frevo N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
perfect N/A O O
spot N/A O O
to N/A O O
familiarize N/A O O
yourself N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
frictionless N/A O O
New N/A O O

of N/A O O
2019. N/A O O
Still, N/A O O
when N/A O O
my N/A O O
out-of-town N/A O O

arrived, N/A O O
we N/A O O
had N/A O O
our N/A O O
dinner N/A O O
at N/A O O

We N/A O O
were N/A O O
hungry N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O

of N/A O O
the N/A O O

over N/A O O
Manhattan N/A O O
on N/A O O
a N/A O O
very N/A O O
clear N/A O O
night. N/A O O
In N/A O O
both N/A O O
places, N/A O O
the N/A O O
patties N/A O O
are N/A O O
made N/A O O
with N/A O O
some N/A O O
portion N/A O O
of N/A O O
dry-aged N/A O O
prime N/A O O
beef, N/A O O

a N/A O O
dark N/A O O

that N/A O O
fills N/A O O
your N/A O O
head N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
instinct-triggering N/A O O

and N/A O O
flavors N/A O O
whose N/A O O
creation N/A O O
in N/A O O

was N/A O O
described N/A O O
by N/A O O
Louis N/A O O
Camille N/A O O
Maillard N/A O O
. N/A O O
There N/A O O
are N/A O O
some N/A O O
minor N/A O O
divergences. N/A O O
At N/A O O
Peter N/A O O
Luger, N/A O O
cheese N/A O O
is N/A O O
optional, N/A O O
while N/A O O
the N/A O O
top N/A O O
and N/A O O
sides N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
burger N/A O O
at N/A O O
Red N/A O O
Hook N/A O O

are N/A O O
tightly N/A O O
wrapped N/A O O
in N/A O O
glossy N/A O O
yellow N/A O O
American N/A O O
cheese N/A O O
by N/A O O
default. N/A O O
A N/A O O
thick N/A O O
cross-section N/A O O
of N/A O O
white N/A O O
onion N/A O O
is N/A O O
laid N/A O O
below N/A O O
the N/A O O
top N/A O O
bun N/A O O
at N/A O O
Luger. N/A O O
At N/A O O
Red N/A O O
Hook N/A O O
Tavern, N/A O O
the N/A O O
onion N/A O O
is N/A O O
stationed N/A O O
below N/A O O
the N/A O O
patty, N/A O O
where N/A O O
it N/A O O
helps N/A O O
keep N/A O O
the N/A O O
bottom N/A O O
bun N/A O O
dry, N/A O O
like N/A O O
a N/A O O
coaster. N/A O O
They N/A O O
give N/A O O
you N/A O O
a N/A O O
half-sour N/A O O
pickle N/A O O
spear N/A O O
and N/A O O
fries, N/A O O
too, N/A O O
which N/A O O
are N/A O O
about N/A O O
the N/A O O
same N/A O O
dimensions. N/A O O
The N/A O O
important N/A O O
difference N/A O O
between N/A O O
the N/A O O
burgers, N/A O O
though, N/A O O
is N/A O O
that N/A O O
lately N/A O O
Peter N/A O O
Luger's N/A O O
have N/A O O
tended N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
better N/A O O
in N/A O O
memory N/A O O
than N/A O O
in N/A O O
reality, N/A O O
while N/A O O
the N/A O O
Red N/A O O
Hook N/A O O
Tavern's N/A O O
is, N/A O O
right N/A O O
now, N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
few N/A O O
absolutely N/A O O
mandatory N/A O O
burgers N/A O O
in N/A O O
New N/A O O
York N/A O O
City. N/A O O
The N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
is N/A O O
overseen N/A O O
by N/A O O
Allison N/A O O
Plumer, N/A O O
a N/A O O
chef N/A O O
who N/A O O
has N/A O O
done N/A O O
most N/A O O
of N/A O O
her N/A O O
cooking N/A O O
in N/A O O
Brooklyn. N/A O O
She N/A O O
has N/A O O
an N/A O O
excellent N/A O O
dry-aged N/A O O
steak N/A O O
-- N/A O O
New N/A O O
York N/A O O
strip, N/A O O
naturally N/A O O
-- N/A O O
impressively N/A O O
browned N/A O O
and N/A O O
served N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
small N/A O O
cast-iron N/A O O
skillet N/A O O
full N/A O O
of N/A O O
creamed N/A O O
spinach, N/A O O
a N/A O O
touch N/A O O
so N/A O O
right N/A O O
it N/A O O
may N/A O O
qualify N/A O O
as N/A O O
art. N/A O O
It N/A O O
is N/A O O
the N/A O O
kind N/A O O
of N/A O O
detail N/A O O
that N/A O O
makes N/A O O
Red N/A O O
Hook N/A O O
Tavern N/A O O
something N/A O O
more N/A O O
than N/A O O
a N/A O O
place N/A O O
for N/A O O
the N/A O O
locals N/A O O
to N/A O O
get N/A O O
beer N/A O O
and N/A O O
burgers. N/A O O
Another N/A O O
is N/A O O
the N/A O O
golden N/A O O
chicken N/A O O
gravy N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
hint N/A O O
of N/A O O
butterscotch N/A O O
that N/A O O
is N/A O O
ladled N/A O O
into N/A O O
a N/A O O
well N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
mashed N/A O O
potatoes N/A O O
that N/A O O
come N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
half-chicken, N/A O O
which N/A O O
is N/A O O
advertised N/A O O
as N/A O O
simply N/A O O
pan-roasted, N/A O O
although N/A O O
it N/A O O
has N/A O O
the N/A O O
wonderfully N/A O O
stiff N/A O O
shards N/A O O
of N/A O O
skin N/A O O
you N/A O O
get N/A O O
from N/A O O
weighting N/A O O
down N/A O O
the N/A O O
bird N/A O O
as N/A O O
it N/A O O
cooks. N/A O O
Everybody N/A O O
who N/A O O
has N/A O O
eaten N/A O O
at N/A O O
Red N/A O O
Hook N/A O O
Tavern N/A O O
will N/A O O
tell N/A O O
you N/A O O
to N/A O O
get N/A O O
the N/A O O
country-ham-and-Cheddar N/A O O
croquettes N/A O O
on N/A O O
a N/A O O
creamy N/A O O
pool N/A O O
of N/A O O
whole-grain N/A O O
Dijonnaise. N/A O O
Everybody N/A O O
is N/A O O
right, N/A O O
too. N/A O O
Consensus N/A O O
has N/A O O
also N/A O O
formed N/A O O
around N/A O O
the N/A O O
wedge N/A O O
salad, N/A O O
which N/A O O
is N/A O O
clearly N/A O O
not N/A O O
a N/A O O
wedge, N/A O O
but N/A O O
is N/A O O
still N/A O O
a N/A O O
very N/A O O
fine N/A O O
salad, N/A O O
with N/A O O
blue N/A O O
cheese N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
thick, N/A O O
Lugeresque N/A O O
bacon N/A O O
slice N/A O O
flopped N/A O O
over N/A O O
individual N/A O O
leaves N/A O O
of N/A O O
romaine. N/A O O
There N/A O O
is N/A O O
considerably N/A O O
less N/A O O
unanimity N/A O O
about N/A O O
the N/A O O
roasted N/A O O
corn, N/A O O
kernels N/A O O
of N/A O O
which N/A O O
you N/A O O
are N/A O O
supposed N/A O O
to N/A O O
wrap N/A O O
in N/A O O
radicchio N/A O O
that N/A O O
you've N/A O O
first N/A O O
smeared N/A O O
with N/A O O
'nduja; N/A O O
I'm N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
camp N/A O O
that N/A O O
thinks N/A O O
it N/A O O
would N/A O O
be N/A O O
a N/A O O
fine N/A O O
dish N/A O O
for N/A O O
another N/A O O
restaurant. N/A O O
There N/A O O
is N/A O O
no N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
where N/A O O
I'd N/A O O
be N/A O O
glad N/A O O
to N/A O O
see N/A O O
littlenecks N/A O O
steamed N/A O O
with N/A O O
way N/A O O
too N/A O O
much N/A O O
stale, N/A O O
acrid N/A O O
garlic. N/A O O
Of N/A O O
course, N/A O O
there's N/A O O
no N/A O O
correct N/A O O
amount N/A O O
of N/A O O
stale, N/A O O
acrid N/A O O
garlic, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
really N/A O O
goes N/A O O
all N/A O O
in. N/A O O
There N/A O O
are N/A O O
two N/A O O
desserts. N/A O O
Both N/A O O
are N/A O O
sundaes N/A O O
. N/A O O
They N/A O O
do N/A O O
not N/A O O
have N/A O O
the N/A O O
thematic N/A O O
inevitability N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
creamed N/A O O
spinach, N/A O O
but N/A O O
they're N/A O O
put N/A O O
together N/A O O
with N/A O O
more N/A O O
sophistication N/A O O
than N/A O O
average. N/A O O
The N/A O O
truth N/A O O
is, N/A O O
though, N/A O O
that N/A O O
nothing N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
gives N/A O O
the N/A O O
burger N/A O O
a N/A O O
real N/A O O
run N/A O O
for N/A O O
its N/A O O
money. N/A O O
What N/A O O
does, N/A O O
or N/A O O
at N/A O O
least N/A O O
equals N/A O O
it N/A O O
as N/A O O
a N/A O O
reason N/A O O
to N/A O O
reserve N/A O O
a N/A O O
table N/A O O
a N/A O O
couple N/A O O

Mr. N/A O O

long N/A O O
time, N/A O O
the N/A O O

of N/A O O
a N/A O O

could N/A O O
be N/A O O
gauged N/A O O

a N/A O O

They N/A O O

they N/A O O

The N/A O O

Another N/A O O

of N/A O O
it N/A O O
nearly N/A O O
every N/A O O

were N/A O O
perfectly N/A O O

partly N/A O O
because N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
brooding N/A O O

they N/A O O
took N/A O O
on N/A O O
from N/A O O

(Mr. N/A O O

Although N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O

of N/A O O
the N/A O O
blind N/A O O
spots N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
one-person N/A O O
operation. N/A O O
It N/A O O
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
the N/A O O
easiest N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
to N/A O O
communicate N/A O O
with, N/A O O
having N/A O O
an N/A O O

no N/A O O

On N/A O O
a N/A O O
recent N/A O O
Sunday, N/A O O
when N/A O O
the N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
was N/A O O
supposed N/A O O
to N/A O O
open N/A O O
at N/A O O
1 N/A O O
p.m., N/A O O
a N/A O O
sign N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
front N/A O O
door N/A O O
announced N/A O O
that N/A O O
it N/A O O
would N/A O O
be N/A O O
delayed N/A O O
until N/A O O
1:30. N/A O O
That N/A O O
was N/A O O
the N/A O O
last N/A O O
communiqué; N/A O O
the N/A O O
doors N/A O O
were N/A O O
not N/A O O
unlocked N/A O O
until N/A O O
2. N/A O O
But N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Easton N/A O O
has N/A O O
a N/A O O
singular N/A O O
vision, N/A O O
and N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
the N/A O O
reason N/A O O
the N/A O O
food N/A O O
is N/A O O
so N/A O O
compelling. N/A O O
Looking N/A O O
around N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
place, N/A O O
you're N/A O O
not N/A O O
sure N/A O O
how N/A O O
it N/A O O
can N/A O O
keep N/A O O
going N/A O O
like N/A O O
this. N/A O O
But N/A O O
then N/A O O
the N/A O O
plates N/A O O
start N/A O O
to N/A O O
come N/A O O
out N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O

you N/A O O

Over N/A O O
the N/A O O
years, N/A O O
I N/A O O
have N/A O O
eaten N/A O O
many N/A O O
bowls N/A O O
of N/A O O
pasta N/A B-DISH B-FOOD
with N/A I-DISH O
clams N/A I-DISH B-FOOD
that N/A O O
have N/A O O
been N/A O O
rewired N/A O O
by N/A O O
a N/A O O
chef N/A O O
who N/A O O
was N/A O O
trying N/A O O
to N/A O O
stand N/A O O
out. N/A O O
But N/A O O
I N/A O O
had N/A O O
not N/A O O
come N/A O O
across N/A O O
one N/A O O
that N/A O O
made N/A O O
as N/A O O
much N/A O O
sense N/A O O
to N/A O O
me N/A O O
as N/A O O
the N/A O O
big, N/A O O

a N/A O O
new N/A O O
Greenwich N/A B-LOC B-LOC
Village N/A I-LOC I-LOC
restaurant N/A O O
called N/A O O
Babs N/A B-EST B-EST
this N/A O O
summer. N/A O O
Mind N/A O O
you, N/A O O
virtually N/A O O
the N/A O O
only N/A O O
Italian N/A B-CUISINE B-CUISINE
thing N/A O O
about N/A O O
the N/A O O
tagliatelle N/A B-DISH B-DISH
with N/A I-DISH I-DISH
clams N/A I-DISH I-DISH
at N/A O O
Babs N/A B-EST B-EST
was N/A O O
the N/A O O
tagliatelle. N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
The N/A O O
sauce N/A B-FOOD O
was N/A O O
a N/A O O
mustard N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
beurre N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
blanc, N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
those N/A O O
French N/A B-CUISINE B-CUISINE
sauces N/A B-FOOD O
that N/A O O
all N/A O O
culinary-school N/A O O

are N/A O O
supposed N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
able N/A O O
to N/A O O
make N/A O O
in N/A O O
their N/A O O
sleep. N/A O O
Mustard N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
beurre N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
blanc N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
is N/A O O
often N/A O O
found N/A O O
providing N/A O O
a N/A O O
decorous N/A O O
yellow N/A O O
veil N/A O O
over N/A O O
a N/A O O
chicken N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
breast N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
or N/A O O
salmon N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
fillet. N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
It N/A O O
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
normally N/A O O
poured N/A O O
over N/A O O
noodles. N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
But, N/A O O
tossed N/A O O
with N/A O O
salty N/A O O
French N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
ham N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
and N/A O O
Manila N/A O O
clams N/A O O
smaller N/A O O
than N/A O O
a N/A O O
thumbprint, N/A O O
it N/A O O
made N/A O O
a N/A O O
strangely N/A O O
exciting N/A O O
bowl N/A O O
of N/A O O
pasta N/A O O
that N/A O O
was N/A O O
much N/A O O
more N/A O O
coherent N/A O O
than N/A O O
it N/A O O
sounds. N/A O O
Once N/A O O
I N/A O O
got N/A O O
to N/A O O
know N/A O O
Babs N/A O O
better, N/A O O
I N/A O O
understood N/A O O
that N/A O O
strange N/A O O
excitement N/A O O
is N/A O O
what N/A O O
it N/A O O
does N/A O O
best. N/A O O
Its N/A O O
chef, N/A O O
Efrén N/A O O
Hernández, N/A O O
has N/A O O
talked N/A O O
about N/A O O
Babs N/A O O
as N/A O O
a N/A O O
European N/A O O
grill, N/A O O
and N/A O O
many N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
dishes N/A O O
are N/A O O
seared N/A O O
over N/A O O
hot N/A O O
charcoal, N/A O O
but N/A O O
he N/A O O
has N/A O O
a N/A O O
wider N/A O O
frame N/A O O
of N/A O O
reference N/A O O
than N/A O O
that. N/A O O
He N/A O O
was N/A O O
raised N/A O O
in N/A O O
Southern N/A O O
California N/A O O
by N/A O O
immigrants N/A O O
from N/A O O
Mexico, N/A O O
and N/A O O
Mexican N/A O O
cuisine N/A O O
runs N/A O O
through N/A O O
his N/A O O
menu N/A O O
like N/A O O
an N/A O O
underground N/A O O
stream N/A O O
that N/A O O
sometimes N/A O O
gurgles N/A O O
up N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
surface. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Hernández N/A O O
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
particularly N/A O O
interested N/A O O
in N/A O O
fusion, N/A O O
though; N/A O O
as N/A O O
far N/A O O
as N/A O O
I N/A O O
can N/A O O
tell, N/A O O
he N/A O O
likes N/A O O
rubbing N/A O O
cultures N/A O O
together N/A O O
to N/A O O
see N/A O O
what N/A O O
color N/A O O
the N/A O O
sparks N/A O O
will N/A O O
be. N/A O O
See, N/A O O
for N/A O O
example, N/A O O
what N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
calls N/A O O
divorced N/A O O
sea N/A O O
bream, N/A O O
a N/A O O
handsome N/A O O
dish N/A O O
that N/A O O
would N/A O O
be N/A O O
splashed N/A O O
around N/A O O
Instagram N/A O O
even N/A O O
more N/A O O
frequently N/A O O
than N/A O O
it N/A O O
already N/A O O
is N/A O O
if N/A O O
the N/A O O
dining N/A O O
tables N/A O O
were N/A O O
lighted N/A O O
by N/A O O
ceiling N/A O O
pinspots N/A O O
rather N/A O O
than N/A O O
disco-era N/A O O
chrome N/A O O
globes N/A O O
that N/A O O
look N/A O O
as N/A O O
if N/A O O
they N/A O O
were N/A O O
salvaged N/A O O
from N/A O O
Regine's N/A O O
. N/A O O
The N/A O O
bream N/A O O
is N/A O O
split, N/A O O
and N/A O O
one N/A O O
side N/A O O
brushed N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
red N/A O O
sauce N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
other N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
green N/A O O
sauce, N/A O O
before N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
grilled N/A O O
over N/A O O
charcoal. N/A O O
The N/A O O
dish N/A O O
is N/A O O
an N/A O O
allusion N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
two-tone N/A O O
pescado N/A O O
a N/A O O
la N/A O O
talla N/A O O
served N/A O O
at N/A O O
Contramar N/A O O
in N/A O O
Mexico N/A O O
City, N/A O O
itself N/A O O
derived N/A O O
from N/A O O
huevos N/A O O
divorciados, N/A O O
a N/A O O
breakfast N/A O O
of N/A O O
two N/A O O
fried N/A O O
eggs N/A O O
beneath N/A O O
two N/A O O
contrasting N/A O O
salsas. N/A O O
In N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Hernández's N/A O O
kitchen, N/A O O
though, N/A O O
the N/A O O
red N/A O O
adobo N/A O O
at N/A O O
Contramar N/A O O
is N/A O O
replaced N/A O O
by N/A O O
a N/A O O
Catalan N/A O O
romesco, N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
parsley N/A O O
salsa N/A O O
becomes N/A O O
a N/A O O
French N/A O O
pistou. N/A O O
But N/A O O
surely N/A O O
the N/A O O
tortilla N/A O O
on N/A O O
its N/A O O
own N/A O O
plate N/A O O
off N/A O O
to N/A O O
one N/A O O
side N/A O O
brings N/A O O
it N/A O O
back N/A O O
to N/A O O
Mexico? N/A O O
Not N/A O O
so N/A O O
fast. N/A O O
According N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu, N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
taloa, N/A O O
a N/A O O
Basque N/A O O
cornmeal N/A O O
cake N/A O O
that N/A O O
cooks N/A O O
from N/A O O
Bayonne N/A O O
to N/A O O
Bilbao N/A O O
have N/A O O
been N/A O O
griddling N/A O O
for N/A O O
centuries. N/A O O
The N/A O O
taloa N/A O O
at N/A O O
Babs N/A O O
is N/A O O
tender, N/A O O
smooth N/A O O
and N/A O O
floral. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Hernández N/A O O
has N/A O O
been N/A O O
cooking N/A O O
at N/A O O
Babs N/A O O
since N/A O O
it N/A O O
opened N/A O O
in N/A O O
July. N/A O O
He N/A O O
is N/A O O
also N/A O O
the N/A O O
chef N/A O O
at N/A O O
Mimi N/A O O
, N/A O O
a N/A O O
French N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
a N/A O O
block N/A O O
away N/A O O
that N/A O O
is N/A O O
owned N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
same N/A O O
people N/A O O
(Daniel N/A O O
Bennett, N/A O O
his N/A O O
brother N/A O O
Evan, N/A O O
and N/A O O
Louis N/A O O
Levy; N/A O O
they N/A O O
named N/A O O
Babs N/A O O
and N/A O O
Mimi N/A O O
after N/A O O
their N/A O O
grandmothers.) N/A O O
I N/A O O
haven't N/A O O
been N/A O O
back N/A O O
to N/A O O
Mimi N/A O O
since N/A O O
Liz N/A O O
Johnson N/A O O
was N/A O O
the N/A O O
chef N/A O O
. N/A O O
She N/A O O
was N/A O O
aiming N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O
style N/A O O
that N/A O O
was N/A O O
at N/A O O
once N/A O O
brawny N/A O O
and N/A O O
lavish, N/A O O
and N/A O O
since N/A O O
taking N/A O O
over N/A O O
last N/A O O
year N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Hernández N/A O O
has N/A O O
seemed N/A O O
to N/A O O
continue N/A O O
in N/A O O
that N/A O O
vein N/A O O
while N/A O O
bringing N/A O O
his N/A O O
far-ranging N/A O O
curiosity N/A O O
to N/A O O
bear. N/A O O
As N/A O O
they N/A O O
did N/A O O
at N/A O O
Mimi, N/A O O
the N/A O O
owners N/A O O
have N/A O O
planted N/A O O
a N/A O O
small N/A O O
curved N/A O O
bar N/A O O
right N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
door N/A O O
at N/A O O
Babs. N/A O O
The N/A O O
cocktails N/A O O
stirred N/A O O
and N/A O O
shaken N/A O O
there N/A O O
are N/A O O
mostly N/A O O
recognizable N/A O O
relatives N/A O O
of N/A O O
classics, N/A O O
like N/A O O
a N/A O O
martini N/A O O
made N/A O O
with N/A O O
two N/A O O
brands N/A O O
of N/A O O
gin. N/A O O
There's N/A O O
something N/A O O
charmingly N/A O O
self-deprecating N/A O O
about N/A O O
a N/A O O
cocktail N/A O O
list N/A O O
that N/A O O
includes N/A O O
Mount N/A O O
Gay N/A O O
and N/A O O
tonic, N/A O O
which N/A O O
seasoned N/A O O
barflies N/A O O
know N/A O O
as N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
drinks N/A O O
you N/A O O
can N/A O O
safely N/A O O
order N/A O O
in N/A O O
dives N/A O O
that N/A O O
don't N/A O O
do N/A O O
anything N/A O O
else N/A O O
right. N/A O O
The N/A O O
wine N/A O O
list, N/A O O
meanwhile, N/A O O
is N/A O O
mostly N/A O O
French N/A O O
and N/A O O
sticks N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
old N/A O O
guard; N/A O O
you N/A O O
can N/A O O
tell N/A O O
it's N/A O O
not N/A O O
trying N/A O O
especially N/A O O
hard N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
cool N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
way N/A O O
it N/A O O
has N/A O O
just N/A O O
one N/A O O
orange N/A O O
wine, N/A O O
lumped N/A O O
in N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
sparkling N/A O O
wines. N/A O O
Only N/A O O
the N/A O O
wine N/A O O
geeks N/A O O
will N/A O O
wish N/A O O
for N/A O O
more, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
rest N/A O O
of N/A O O
us N/A O O
might N/A O O
wish N/A O O
there N/A O O
were N/A O O
as N/A O O
many N/A O O
bottles N/A O O
costing N/A O O
around N/A O O
$50 N/A O O
as N/A O O
there N/A O O
are N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
$90 N/A O O
range. N/A O O
The N/A O O
numbers N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
can N/A O O
sneak N/A O O
up N/A O O
on N/A O O
you, N/A O O
too. N/A O O
My N/A O O
$48 N/A O O
lobster N/A O O
was N/A O O
a N/A O O
small N/A O O
creature N/A O O
that N/A O O
couldn't N/A O O
have N/A O O
weighed N/A O O
much N/A O O
more N/A O O
than N/A O O
a N/A O O
pound. N/A O O
The N/A O O
server N/A O O
brightly N/A O O
suggested N/A O O
dunking N/A O O
its N/A O O
tomalley N/A O O
into N/A O O
the N/A O O
smoked N/A O O
potato N/A O O
purée, N/A O O
and N/A O O
I N/A O O
would N/A O O
have N/A O O
tried N/A O O
it N/A O O
if N/A O O
I N/A O O
had N/A O O
found N/A O O
any N/A O O
tomalley. N/A O O
And N/A O O
while N/A O O
I N/A O O
can N/A O O
imagine N/A O O
happily N/A O O
paying N/A O O
$36 N/A O O
for N/A O O
Babs's N/A O O
lamb N/A O O
chops, N/A O O
I'd N/A O O
want N/A O O
them N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
served N/A O O
with N/A O O
something N/A O O
more N/A O O
compelling N/A O O
than N/A O O
the N/A O O
cold, N/A O O
underseasoned N/A O O
"Basque N/A O O
potato N/A O O
salad" N/A O O
into N/A O O
which N/A O O
some N/A O O
baby N/A O O
sardines N/A O O
had N/A O O
apparently N/A O O

But N/A O O
there N/A O O
is N/A O O
nothing N/A O O

with N/A O O

this N/A O O

you N/A O O
found N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Hernández N/A O O
knocking N/A O O
cuisines N/A O O
together N/A O O
again, N/A O O
this N/A O O
time N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
corn-and-chanterelles N/A O O
risotto N/A O O
under N/A O O
a N/A O O
slow-burning N/A O O
splash N/A O O
of N/A O O
Calabrian N/A O O
chile N/A O O
oil. N/A O O
He N/A O O
shows N/A O O
how N/A O O
well N/A O O
he N/A O O
can N/A O O
work N/A O O
in N/A O O
small N/A O O
strokes N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
layered N/A O O
appetizer N/A O O
of N/A O O
raw N/A O O
sea N/A O O
scallops, N/A O O
sweet N/A O O
potato N/A O O

and N/A O O
trout N/A O O
roe, N/A O O
seasoned N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
briny N/A O O
and N/A O O
fascinating N/A O O
salsa N/A O O
of N/A O O
chopped N/A O O
cucumbers, N/A O O
seaweed N/A O O
and N/A O O
fermented N/A O O
serrano N/A O O
chiles; N/A O O
or N/A O O
the N/A O O
fried N/A O O
cod N/A O O
cheeks, N/A O O
tender N/A O O
and N/A O O
crunchy N/A O O
over N/A O O
an N/A O O
orange N/A O O
slick N/A O O

romesco N/A O O
aioli. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Hernández's N/A O O
imagination N/A O O
fights N/A O O
against N/A O O
predictability. N/A O O
A N/A O O
crab N/A O O
salad, N/A O O
for N/A O O
instance, N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
need N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
interesting N/A O O
if N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
fresh, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
one N/A O O
at N/A O O
Babs N/A O O
is N/A O O
both. N/A O O
It's N/A O O
seasoned N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
gribiche N/A O O
that's N/A O O
full N/A O O
of N/A O O
chopped N/A O O
fresh N/A O O
dill, N/A O O
and N/A O O
then N/A O O
it's N/A O O
piled N/A O O
up N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
big N/A O O
beehive N/A O O
on N/A O O
top N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
smoked N/A O O
potato N/A O O
pancake. N/A O O
Like N/A O O
many N/A O O
small N/A O O
restaurants N/A O O
these N/A O O
days, N/A O O
Babs N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
offer N/A O O
many N/A O O
desserts, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
ones N/A O O
it N/A O O
does N/A O O
are N/A O O
far N/A O O
more N/A O O
intriguing N/A O O
than N/A O O
average. N/A O O
A N/A O O
fine N/A O O
apple N/A O O
galette N/A O O
is N/A O O
improved N/A O O
by N/A O O
a N/A O O
grating N/A O O
of N/A O O
Swiss-style N/A O O
cheese N/A O O
from N/A O O
Edelweiss N/A O O
Creamery N/A O O
in N/A O O
Wisconsin N/A O O
and N/A O O
by N/A O O
a N/A O O
drizzle N/A O O
of N/A O O
20-year-old N/A O O
Pedro N/A O O
Ximénez N/A O O
sherry, N/A O O
thick N/A O O
as N/A O O
syrup N/A O O
and N/A O O
tasting N/A O O
like N/A O O
chocolate N/A O O
and N/A O O
coffee. N/A O O
Why N/A O O
sherry N/A O O
with N/A O O
Swiss N/A O O
cheese? N/A O O
I N/A O O
don't N/A O O
know, N/A O O

After N/A O O
that, N/A O O
you N/A O O
might N/A O O
look N/A O O
into N/A O O
the N/A O O
fried N/A O O
pork-and-carrot N/A O O
won N/A O O
tons N/A O O
called N/A O O
pinsec N/A O O

(or, N/A O O
as N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
has N/A O O
them, N/A O O
pinsit N/A O O
frito). N/A O O
They N/A O O
are N/A O O
typically N/A O O
folded N/A O O
into N/A O O
triangles, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
ones N/A O O
at N/A O O
Tsismis N/A O O
are N/A O O
twisted N/A O O
into N/A O O
little N/A O O
cones N/A O O
that N/A O O
look N/A O O
like N/A O O
Hershey's N/A O O
kisses, N/A O O
though N/A O O
slightly N/A O O
bigger N/A O O
and N/A O O
golden-brown. N/A O O
Once N/A O O
they N/A O O
stop N/A O O
steaming, N/A O O
you N/A O O
can N/A O O
hold N/A O O
them N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
cowlick N/A O O
of N/A O O
fried N/A O O
wrapper N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
top N/A O O
and N/A O O
swish N/A O O
them N/A O O
around N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
sweet N/A O O
chile N/A O O
sauce. N/A O O
Won N/A O O
tons N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
same N/A O O

flop N/A O O
around N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
soup N/A O O
called N/A O O
pancit N/A O O
molo, N/A O O
although N/A O O
these N/A O O
are N/A O O
boiled. N/A O O
There N/A O O
is N/A O O
almost N/A O O
as N/A O O
much N/A O O
ground N/A O O
pork N/A O O

them N/A O O
as N/A O O
outside N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O

which N/A O O
is N/A O O
thick N/A O O
with N/A O O
garlic N/A O O
and N/A O O
chopped N/A O O
scallions. N/A O O
Even N/A O O
if N/A O O
it's N/A O O
well N/A O O
after N/A O O
5:thirsty N/A O O
and N/A O O
you're N/A O O
not N/A O O
sitting N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
bar, N/A O O
Jappy's N/A O O
wings N/A O O
are N/A O O
worth N/A O O
considering. N/A O O
Jappy N/A O O
is N/A O O
the N/A O O
chef, N/A O O
Jappy N/A O O
Afzelius, N/A O O
and N/A O O
he N/A O O
fries N/A O O
those N/A O O
wings N/A O O
with N/A O O
thinly N/A O O
sliced N/A O O
garlic N/A O O
and N/A O O
sends N/A O O
them N/A O O
out N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
dining N/A O O
room N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
salsa N/A O O
of N/A O O
raw N/A O O
mangoes, N/A O O
charred N/A O O
onions N/A O O
and N/A O O
chiles. N/A O O
The N/A O O
heat N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
salsa N/A O O
will N/A O O
not N/A O O
cause N/A O O
your N/A O O
shirt N/A O O
to N/A O O
burst N/A O O
into N/A O O
flames, N/A O O
but N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
hot N/A O O
enough N/A O O
to N/A O O
make N/A O O
your N/A O O
memory N/A O O
of N/A O O
Jappy's N/A O O
wings N/A O O
a N/A O O
lasting N/A O O
one. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Afzelius N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
native N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
Philippines N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
graduate N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
cooking N/A O O
academy N/A O O
in N/A O O
Manila, N/A O O
which N/A O O
shipped N/A O O
him N/A O O
off N/A O O
to N/A O O
Paris N/A O O
to N/A O O
intern N/A O O
in N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
Alain N/A O O
Ducasse's N/A O O
bistros. N/A O O
The N/A O O
Ducasse N/A O O
masterminds N/A O O
then N/A O O
sent N/A O O
him N/A O O
to N/A O O
work N/A O O
at N/A O O
Benoit N/A O O
in N/A O O
New N/A O O
York, N/A O O
after N/A O O
which N/A O O
he N/A O O
turned N/A O O
up N/A O O
as N/A O O
the N/A O O
sous-chef N/A O O
at N/A O O
a N/A O O
Filipino N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
in N/A O O
Brooklyn N/A O O
that N/A O O
was N/A O O
best N/A O O
known N/A O O
for N/A O O
its N/A O O
$100 N/A O O
doughnut N/A O O
-- N/A O O
ube-filled, N/A O O
Cristal-frosted N/A O O
and N/A O O
gold-leafed. N/A O O
Happily, N/A O O
nothing N/A O O
at N/A O O
Tsismis N/A O O
approaches N/A O O
that N/A O O
level N/A O O
of N/A O O
look-at-me N/A O O
desperation. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Afzelius's N/A O O
cooking N/A O O
is N/A O O
loose, N/A O O
unfussy N/A O O
and N/A O O
liberated. N/A O O
He N/A O O
tosses N/A O O
tradition N/A O O
under N/A O O
the N/A O O
bus N/A O O
when N/A O O
it N/A O O
suits N/A O O
him. N/A O O
The N/A O O
result N/A O O
is N/A O O
Filipino-American N/A O O
drinking N/A O O
food N/A O O
that N/A O O
tends N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
charmingly N/A O O
offhand. N/A O O
From N/A O O
time N/A O O
to N/A O O
time, N/A O O
it N/A O O
can N/A O O
lean N/A O O
toward N/A O O
sloppiness. N/A O O
One N/A O O
night N/A O O
the N/A O O
fried N/A O O
milkfish N/A O O
in N/A O O
pritong N/A O O
isda N/A O O
was N/A O O
so N/A O O
overdone N/A O O
that N/A O O
even N/A O O
topping N/A O O
it N/A O O
with N/A O O
calamansi N/A O O
juice, N/A O O
fish N/A O O
sauce N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
crisp, N/A O O
juicy N/A O O
spoonful N/A O O
of N/A O O
marinated N/A O O
chayote N/A O O
on N/A O O
top N/A O O
didn't N/A O O
revive N/A O O
it. N/A O O
A N/A O O
version N/A O O
of N/A O O
adobong N/A O O
manok, N/A O O
which N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Afzelius N/A O O
makes N/A O O
as N/A O O
a N/A O O
roasted N/A O O
chicken N/A O O
plus N/A O O
a N/A O O
soy-turmeric N/A O O
sauce N/A O O
rather N/A O O
than N/A O O
an N/A O O
all-in-one N/A O O
stew, N/A O O
would N/A O O
have N/A O O
been N/A O O
more N/A O O
successful N/A O O
if N/A O O
the N/A O O
smoked N/A O O
eggplant N/A O O
hadn't N/A O O
been N/A O O
so N/A O O
undercooked N/A O O
it N/A O O
squeaked. N/A O O
But N/A O O
the N/A O O
grilled N/A O O
eggplant N/A O O
on N/A O O
top N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
kare-kare N/A O O
was N/A O O
as N/A O O
soft N/A O O
as N/A O O
warm N/A O O
marrow, N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
other N/A O O
vegetables N/A O O
-- N/A O O
crisp N/A O O
green N/A O O
beans, N/A O O
bok N/A O O
choy, N/A O O
enoki N/A O O
mushrooms N/A O O
-- N/A O O
made N/A O O
a N/A O O
refreshing N/A O O
counterpoint N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
stewed N/A O O
oxtails N/A O O
in N/A O O
thick N/A O O
peanut N/A O O
sauce. N/A O O
Already N/A O O
pungent N/A O O
with N/A O O
shrimp N/A O O
paste, N/A O O
the N/A O O
kare-kare N/A O O
comes N/A O O
with N/A O O
extra N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
side N/A O O
that N/A O O

By N/A O O
this N/A O O

you N/A O O

your N/A O O

Housemade N/A O O

mine N/A O O

In N/A O O
lieu N/A O O
of N/A O O
hard N/A O O
spirits, N/A O O
sake N/A O O
is N/A O O
the N/A O O
backbone N/A O O
of N/A O O
most N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
cocktails. N/A O O
They N/A O O
are N/A O O
typically N/A O O
fleshed N/A O O
out N/A O O
with N/A O O
half N/A O O
a N/A O O
dozen N/A O O
other N/A O O
ingredients N/A O O
-- N/A O O
vermouth, N/A O O
Aperol, N/A O O
artichoke N/A O O
liqueur N/A O O
and N/A O O
bitters, N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
case N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
A N/A O O

which N/A O O
sound N/A O O
at N/A O O
first N/A O O
as N/A O O
if N/A O O
they N/A O O
had N/A O O
been N/A O O
assembled N/A O O
by N/A O O
walking N/A O O
through N/A O O
a N/A O O
liquor N/A O O

blindfolded, N/A O O
but N/A O O
which N/A O O
after N/A O O

closer N/A O O

reveal N/A O O
a N/A O O
degree N/A O O
of N/A O O
inner N/A O O
logic. N/A O O
If N/A O O
this N/A O O
does N/A O O
not N/A O O
pique N/A O O
your N/A O O
curiosity, N/A O O
the N/A O O
list N/A O O
of N/A O O
wines N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
glass N/A O O
is N/A O O
almost N/A O O
long N/A O O
enough N/A O O
to N/A O O
qualify N/A O O
Tsismis N/A O O
as N/A O O
a N/A O O
wine N/A O O
bar, N/A O O
although N/A O O
the N/A O O
choices N/A O O
are N/A O O
not N/A O O
as N/A O O
outré N/A O O
as N/A O O
they N/A O O
are N/A O O
across N/A O O
the N/A O O

Wildair N/A O O

In N/A O O

other N/A O O
varieties N/A O O
of N/A O O
flavored N/A O O
snow, N/A O O
Tsismis's N/A O O
halo-halo N/A O O
will N/A O O
probably N/A O O
be N/A O O
an N/A O O
instant N/A O O
hit. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Afzelius N/A O O
has N/A O O
the N/A O O
very N/A O O
good N/A O O
idea N/A O O
of N/A O O
putting N/A O O
coconut N/A O O
sorbet N/A O O
where N/A O O
the N/A O O
shaved N/A O O
ice N/A O O
would N/A O O
usually N/A O O
go; N/A O O
from N/A O O
there N/A O O
he N/A O O
goes N/A O O
to N/A O O
town N/A O O
with N/A O O
coconut N/A O O
jellies N/A O O
and N/A O O
what N/A O O
seems N/A O O
like N/A O O
every N/A O O
fresh N/A O O
fruit N/A O O
he N/A O O
can N/A O O
put N/A O O
his N/A O O
hands N/A O O
on. N/A O O
But N/A O O
discerning N/A O O
collectors N/A O O
of N/A O O
Filipino N/A O O
sweets N/A O O
should N/A O O
note N/A O O
that N/A O O
Tsismis N/A O O
serves N/A O O
excellent N/A O O
silvanas. N/A O O
A N/A O O
silvana N/A O O
is N/A O O
either N/A O O
a N/A O O
shrunken N/A O O
cake N/A O O
or N/A O O
a N/A O O
cookie N/A O O
with N/A O O
big N/A O O
ideas, N/A O O
depending N/A O O
on N/A O O
your N/A O O
perspective. N/A O O
It N/A O O
is N/A O O
made N/A O O
of N/A O O
two N/A O O
cashew N/A O O
meringues N/A O O
that N/A O O
are N/A O O
sandwiched N/A O O
together N/A O O
with N/A O O
buttercream N/A O O
and N/A O O
then N/A O O
painted N/A O O
with N/A O O
more N/A O O
buttercream, N/A O O
which N/A O O
holds N/A O O
cashew N/A O O
crumbs N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
outside N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
whole N/A O O
package. N/A O O
Once N/A O O
frosted N/A O O
and N/A O O
crumbed, N/A O O
it N/A O O
has N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
refrigerated N/A O O
or N/A O O
the N/A O O
buttercream N/A O O
will N/A O O
melt N/A O O
before N/A O O
it N/A O O
gets N/A O O
inside N/A O O
your N/A O O
mouth. N/A O O
No N/A O O
gold N/A O O
leaf N/A O O
adorns N/A O O
the N/A O O
silvanas. N/A O O
It N/A O O
would N/A O O
only N/A O O
get N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
way. N/A O O

the N/A O O
same N/A O O
as N/A O O
ever. N/A O O
The N/A O O
shrimp N/A B-DISH B-DISH
cocktail N/A I-DISH I-DISH
has N/A O O
always N/A O O
tasted N/A O O
like N/A O O
cold N/A O O
latex N/A O O
dipped N/A O O
in N/A O O
ketchup N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD

horseradish. N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
The N/A O O
steak N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
sauce N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
has N/A O O
always N/A O O
tasted N/A O O
like N/A O O
the N/A O O

ketchup N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD

horseradish N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
fortified N/A O O

Although N/A O O
the N/A O O
fries N/A B-DISH B-FOOD
are N/A O O
reasonably N/A O O
crisp, N/A O O
their N/A O O
insides N/A O O
are N/A O O
mealy N/A O O
and N/A O O
bland N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
way N/A O O
that N/A O O
fresh-cut N/A O O
potatoes N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD

Peter N/A B-EST B-EST

strangely N/A O O
similar: N/A O O
The N/A O O
bread N/A B-FOOD O
crumbs N/A I-FOOD O
on N/A O O
top N/A O O
were N/A O O
gold N/A O O
and N/A O O
crunchy, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
fish N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
underneath N/A O O
was N/A O O
dry N/A O O
and N/A O O
almost N/A O O
powdery. N/A O O
Was N/A O O
the N/A O O
Caesar N/A B-DISH B-DISH
salad N/A I-DISH I-DISH
always N/A O O
so N/A O O
drippy, N/A O O
the N/A O O
croutons N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
always N/A O O
straight N/A O O
out N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
bag, N/A O O
the N/A O O
grated N/A O O
cheese N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
always N/A O O
so N/A O O
white N/A O O
and N/A O O
rubbery? N/A O O
I N/A O O
know N/A O O
there N/A O O
was N/A O O
a N/A O O
time N/A O O
the N/A O O
German N/A B-DISH B-DISH
fried N/A I-DISH I-DISH
potatoes N/A I-DISH I-DISH
were N/A O O
brown N/A O O
and N/A O O
crunchy, N/A O O
because N/A O O
I N/A O O
eagerly N/A O O
ate N/A O O
them N/A O O
each N/A O O
time N/A O O
I N/A O O
went. N/A O O
Now N/A O O
they N/A O O
are N/A O O
mushy, N/A O O
dingy, N/A O O
gray N/A O O
and N/A O O
sometimes N/A O O
cold. N/A O O
I N/A O O
look N/A O O
forward N/A O O
to N/A O O
them N/A O O
the N/A O O
way N/A O O
I N/A O O
look N/A O O
forward N/A O O
to N/A O O
finding N/A O O
a N/A O O
new, N/A O O
irregularly N/A O O
shaped N/A O O
mole. N/A O O

Lunch N/A O O
one N/A O O
afternoon N/A O O
vividly N/A O O
demonstrated N/A O O
the N/A O O
kitchen's N/A O O
inconsistency: N/A O O
I N/A O O
ordered N/A O O
a N/A O O
burger, N/A B-DISH B-FOOD
medium-rare, N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
bar. N/A O O
So N/A O O
had N/A O O
the N/A O O
two N/A O O
people N/A O O
sitting N/A O O
to N/A O O
my N/A O O
right, N/A O O
it N/A O O
turned N/A O O
out. N/A O O
One N/A O O
of N/A O O
them N/A O O
got N/A O O
what N/A O O
we'd N/A O O
all N/A O O
asked N/A O O
for, N/A O O
a N/A O O
midnight-dark N/A O O
crust N/A O O
giving N/A O O
way N/A O O
to N/A O O
an N/A O O
evenly N/A O O
rosy N/A O O
interior N/A O O
so N/A O O
full N/A O O
of N/A O O
juices N/A O O
it N/A O O
looked N/A O O
like N/A O O
it N/A O O
was N/A O O
ready N/A O O
to N/A O O
cry. N/A O O
The N/A O O
other N/A O O
one N/A O O
got N/A O O
a N/A O O
patty N/A B-FOOD O
that N/A O O
was N/A O O
almost N/A O O
completely N/A O O
brown N/A O O
inside. N/A O O
I N/A O O
got N/A O O
a N/A O O
weird N/A O O
hybrid, N/A O O
a N/A O O
burger N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
whose N/A O O
interior N/A O O
shaded N/A O O
from N/A O O
nearly N/A O O
perfect N/A O O
on N/A O O
one N/A O O
side N/A O O
to N/A O O
gray N/A O O
and N/A O O
hard N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
other. N/A O O

served N/A O O
one N/A O O
night: N/A O O
The N/A O O
fillet N/A B-FOOD B-DISH
was N/A O O
ideal N/A O O

the N/A O O
other N/A O O
side N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
T-bone, N/A B-FOOD O
the N/A O O
strip, N/A B-FOOD B-DISH
ranged N/A O O
from N/A O O
medium-rare N/A O O
to N/A O O
medium-well. N/A O O
I N/A O O

compared N/A O O

Peter N/A B-EST B-EST

they N/A O O
don't N/A O O
count. N/A O O
Luger N/A B-EST B-EST
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
the N/A O O
city's N/A O O
oldest, N/A O O
but N/A O O
it's N/A O O
the N/A O O
one N/A O O
in N/A O O
which N/A O O
age, N/A O O
tradition, N/A O O
superb N/A O O
beef, N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
blistering N/A O O
heat, N/A O O
an N/A O O
instinctive N/A O O
avoidance N/A O O
of N/A O O
anything N/A O O
fancy N/A O O
and N/A O O
an N/A O O
immensely N/A O O
attractive N/A O O
self-assurance N/A O O
came N/A O O
together N/A O O
to N/A O O
produce N/A O O
something N/A O O
that N/A O O
felt N/A O O
less N/A O O
like N/A O O
a N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
than N/A O O
an N/A O O
affirmation N/A O O
of N/A O O
life, N/A O O
or N/A O O
at N/A O O
least N/A O O
life N/A O O
as N/A O O
it N/A O O

lived N/A O O
in N/A O O

This N/A O O
sounds N/A O O
ridiculously N/A O O
grand. N/A O O

ago N/A O O
I N/A O O
thought N/A O O
it N/A O O
was N/A O O
true, N/A O O
though, N/A O O
and N/A O O
so N/A O O
did N/A O O
other N/A O O
people. N/A O O
The N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
will N/A O O
always N/A O O
have N/A O O
its N/A O O
loyalists. N/A O O
They N/A O O
will N/A O O
laugh N/A O O
away N/A O O
the N/A O O
prices, N/A O O
the N/A O O
$16.95 N/A O O
sliced N/A O O
tomatoes N/A O O
that N/A O O
taste N/A O O
like N/A O O
1979, N/A O O
the N/A O O
$229.80 N/A O O
porterhouse N/A O O
for N/A O O
four. N/A O O
They N/A O O
will N/A O O
say N/A O O
that N/A O O
nobody N/A O O
goes N/A O O
to N/A O O
Luger N/A O O
for N/A O O
the N/A O O
sole, N/A O O
nobody N/A O O
goes N/A O O

the N/A O O
wine, N/A O O
nobody N/A O O
goes N/A O O

nobody N/A O O
goes N/A O O

the N/A O O
service. N/A O O
The N/A O O
list N/A O O
goes N/A O O
on, N/A O O
and N/A O O
gets N/A O O
harder N/A O O
to N/A O O
swallow, N/A O O
until N/A O O
you N/A O O
start N/A O O
to N/A O O
wonder N/A O O
who N/A O O
really N/A O O
needs N/A O O
to N/A O O
go N/A O O
to N/A O O
Peter N/A O O
Luger, N/A O O
and N/A O O
start N/A O O

is N/A O O
nobody. N/A O O

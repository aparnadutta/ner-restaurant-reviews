Some O
restaurants O
hit O
the O
ground O
at O
full O
tilt. O
This O
review O
concerns O
one O
of O
the O
others, O
a O
place O
that O
stumbled O
at O
the O
start, O
as O
ungainly O
as O
a O
day-old O
giraffe, O
and O
only O
recently O
found O
its O
footing. O
Bar B-LOC
Bolonat I-LOC
opened O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
Village I-LOC
in O
March O
in O
what O
seemed O
an O
auspicious O
location, O
a O
corner O
spot O
looking O
out O
on O
Abingdon B-LOC
Square I-LOC
Park I-LOC
through O
yards O
of O
windows. O
Two O
months O
in, O
Einat O
Admony, O
the O
chef O
and O
owner, O
was O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
closing O
it, O
she O
said O
in O
a O
phone O
interview. O
Nearly O
half O
of O
her O
54 O
seats O
had O
been O
taken O
away O
after O
the O
city O
ruled O
that O
one O
wing O
of O
the O
dining O
room O
was O
an O
unpermitted O
sidewalk O
enclosure. O
The O
disputed O
area O
was O
quarantined O
behind O
a O
velvet O
rope, O
although O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
imagine O
a O
crowd O
lining O
up O
for O
admission O
to O
this O
patch O
of O
bare O
cement O
floor. O
This O
put O
a O
strain O
on O
revenues, O
no O
doubt, O
and O
made O
the O
place O
look O
pretty O
weird. O
Even O
with O
reduced O
capacity, O
Bar B-EST
Bolonat I-EST
was O
afflicted O
by O
suboptimal O
acoustics. O
When O
I O
ate O
there O
early O
in O
the O
summer, O
the O
screeching O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
could O
have O
crushed O
scrap O
metal. O
It O
nearly O
crushed O
my O
desire O
to O
come O
back, O
too, O
but O
I O
held O
on O
because O
Ms. O
Admony O
was O
up O
to O
something O
original O
in O
the O
kitchen. O
The O
daughter O
of O
an O
Iranian O
mother O
and O
Yemenite O
father, O
she O
was O
combining O
the O
flavors O
of O
contemporary O
multiethnic O
Israel, O
where O
she O
grew O
up, O
with O
the O
idioms O
of O
modern O
restaurants O
in O
New B-LOC
York, I-LOC
where O
she O
has O
been O
cooking O
since O
getting O
a O
job O
in O
Bobby O
Flay O
's O
kitchen O
at O
Bolo B-EST
in O
1999. O
I'd O
never O
tasted O
anything O
exactly O
like O
her O
shrimp B-FOOD
in O
a O
Yemenite B-CUISINE
curry, B-FOOD
with O
a O
fiery O
shot O
of O
green B-FOOD
zhug I-FOOD
and O
a O
small O
round O
of O
fried B-FOOD
bread I-FOOD
called O
malawach B-FOOD
to O
soak O
up O
the O
spicy, O
turmeric-gold B-FOOD
coconut I-FOOD
milk. I-FOOD
I O
wanted O
more O
food O
like O
this O
in O
my O
life, O
but O
I O
wasn't O
in O
a O
big O
hurry O
to O
face O
the O
decibels O
again. O
Now, O
with O
sound-absorbing O
tiles O
up O
above, O
Bar B-EST
Bolonat I-EST
is O
a O
quieter O
restaurant, O
though O
it's O
not O
entirely O
library-like. O
(One O
small O
section O
of O
ceiling, O
without O
tiles, O
is O
angled O
like O
the O
soundboard O
of O
a O
grand O
piano, O
with O
a O
similar O
effect.) O
It's O
also O
bigger. O
In O
September, O
Ms. O
Admony O
finally O
appeased O
the O
bureaucrats O
and O
returned O
all O
her O
seats O
to O
active O
duty. O
While O
fixing O
up O
the O
space, O
she O
made O
other O
changes, O
replacing O
executive O
chefs O
until O
she O
found O
Molly O
Breidenthal. O
When O
I O
ate O
there O
this O
month, O
the O
cooking O
was O
more O
assured O
than O
it O
had O
been, O
the O
spices O
applied O
more O
fearlessly. O
The O
giraffe O
is O
on O
the O
move. O
Energetic O
seasoning O
drives O
Ms. O
Admony's O
cuisine O
at O
Bar B-EST
Bolonat, I-EST
as O
it O
does O
at O
her O
exemplary O
falafel B-FOOD
shops, O
Taïm B-EST
, O
and O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent O
her O
Mediterranean B-CUISINE
comfort B-CUISINE
food I-CUISINE
restaurant, O
Balaboosta B-EST
. O
One O
of O
Bar B-EST
Bolonat's I-EST
most O
likable O
dishes O
since O
the O
unsteady O
early O
days O
has O
been O
the O
lemony B-DISH
grilled I-DISH
baby I-DISH
artichokes I-DISH
with O
a O
creamy O
band O
of O
pistachio B-FOOD
yogurt I-FOOD
under O
a O
pale-green O
powder O
of O
dukkah. B-FOOD
That O
blend O
of O
chopped B-FOOD
nuts I-FOOD
and O
herbs B-FOOD
can O
get O
tired O
if O
it O
sits O
around O
too O
long, O
but O
Bar B-EST
Bolonat's I-EST
is O
extremely O
fresh, O
the O
pistachios B-FOOD
still O
sweet O
and O
bright O
green. O
A O
swipe O
of O
corn B-FOOD
purée I-FOOD
takes O
its O
seductive, O
toasty O
flavor O
from O
turmeric, B-FOOD
cardamom B-FOOD
and O
ground B-FOOD
cloves, I-FOOD
Ms. O
Admony's O
version O
of O
a O
warming O
spice O
blend O
called O
hawaij B-FOOD
that O
Yemenis O
stir O
into O
soups. B-FOOD
Together O
with O
the O
creeping O
heat O
and O
sweetness O
of O
a O
red B-FOOD
pepper I-FOOD
sauce, I-FOOD
the O
spiced B-FOOD
corn I-FOOD
makes O
something O
exciting O
out O
of O
a O
grilled B-DISH
octopus I-DISH
leg. I-DISH
Nearly O
everybody O
orders O
the O
Jerusalem-style B-DISH
sesame I-DISH
bagel, I-DISH
so O
light O
and O
fluffy O
it's O
almost O
an O
anti-bagel. O
Nearly O
everybody O
is O
right O
about O
this. O
What O
makes O
this O
racetrack-shaped O
bread B-FOOD
so O
hard O
to O
pass O
up O
is O
the O
spoonful O
of O
really O
fragrant O
and O
complex O
za'atar B-FOOD
that O
you O
dunk O
each O
piece O
into O
after O
giving O
it O
a O
preliminary O
bath O
in O
peppery B-FOOD
olive I-FOOD
oil. I-FOOD
When O
dishes O
were O
underwhelming, O
as O
several O
were O
one O
August O
night, O
timid O
seasoning O
could O
be O
to O
blame. O
"Za'atar B-DISH
ravioli," I-DISH
stuffed O
with O
smoky O
eggplant, B-FOOD
might O
have O
been O
interesting O
had O
it O
included O
some O
actual O
za'atar. B-FOOD
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
Bar B-EST
Bolonat's I-EST
zabzi, B-DISH
an O
Iranian B-CUISINE
fresh-herb B-FOOD
stew I-FOOD
served O
with O
soft O
specks O
of O
fresh O
couscous, B-FOOD
was O
fantastically O
vivid, O
and O
it O
could O
have O
become O
one O
of O
my O
favorites O
if O
the O
short B-FOOD
rib I-FOOD
in O
the O
stew B-FOOD
had O
not O
been O
tough O
and O
dry. O
The O
dishes O
at O
Bar B-EST
Bolonat I-EST
are O
meant O
to O
be O
shared O
-- O
everybody O
sing O
along O
-- O
and O
come O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
as O
they're O
ready. O
Or O
so O
the O
servers O
say. O
The O
menu O
is O
split O
into O
small, O
medium O
and O
large O
plates. O
As O
common O
sense O
would O
tell O
you O
if O
the O
servers O
weren't O
telling O
you O
otherwise, O
the O
bigger O
ones, O
like O
the O
lamb B-DISH
neck I-DISH
braised I-DISH
with I-DISH
dates I-DISH
and I-DISH
chestnuts I-DISH
until O
it O
is O
pull-apart O
tender, O
are O
a O
lot O
easier O
to O
split O
than O
the O
few O
mouthfuls O
of O
fluke B-DISH
ceviche I-DISH
with I-DISH
dried I-DISH
pomegranate I-DISH
seeds I-DISH
and I-DISH
juice. I-DISH
The O
kitchen O
could O
do O
more O
to O
help O
by, O
say, O
carving O
the O
pomegranate-glazed B-DISH
poussin I-DISH
instead O
of O
sending O
it O
out O
whole O
with O
a O
serrated O
knife. O
The O
bit O
about O
the O
dishes' O
showing O
up O
at O
random O
times O
is O
misleading, O
too, O
but O
in O
a O
good O
way. O
My O
table O
was O
never O
laden O
down O
with O
more O
plates O
than O
it O
could O
hold. O
This O
ought O
to O
go O
without O
saying, O
but O
in O
restaurants O
these O
days O
nothing O
does. O
Apart O
from O
one O
or O
two O
unscheduled O
leaves O
of O
absence O
one O
night, O
the O
service O
was O
generally O
excellent, O
with O
a O
professional O
bearing O
that O
signals O
Ms. O
Admony's O
intent O
to O
have O
Israeli B-CUISINE
cuisine O
taken O
seriously. O
The O
white O
napkins, O
polished O
stemware, O
sheer O
curtains O
and O
understated O
modern O
furniture O
are O
all O
a O
determined O
bid O
for O
the O
kinds O
of O
diners O
who O
would O
steer O
clear O
of O
anything O
resembling O
a O
hummus B-TYPE
hut. I-TYPE
For O
dessert, O
Ms. O
Admony O
makes O
a O
homey, O
from-scratch O
version O
of O
Milky, O
a O
chocolate B-FOOD
pudding I-FOOD
brand O
so O
central O
to O
Israeli O
life O
that O
it O
became O
the O
symbol O
of O
a O
protest O
this O
fall O
against O
the O
high O
cost O
of O
living. O
The O
halvah B-DISH
crème I-DISH
brûlée I-DISH
tastes O
more O
like O
butterscotch B-FOOD
than O
sesame, B-FOOD
but O
it O
is O
worth O
getting O
for O
the O
tuft O
of O
halvah B-FOOD
floss I-FOOD
on O
top. O
The O
most O
entertaining O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
dessert O
is O
a O
fried O
envelope O
of O
baklava B-DISH
with O
ice B-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
sealed O
inside, O
although O
the O
ice B-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
should O
be O
colder O
and O
the O
pastry B-FOOD
hotter O
if O
Ms. O
Admony O
wants O
to O
live O
up O
to O
the O
high O
standards O
once O
set O
by O
the O
fried B-DISH
ice I-DISH
cream I-DISH
at O
Chi-Chi's B-EST
. O
Having O
fought O
City O
Hall O
and O
the O
screaming O
demons O
of O
dining-room O
noise, O
she's O
probably O
ready O
for O
a O
new O
challenge. O

a O
city O
to O
which O

The O
style O
came O
from O
Naples B-LOC
with O
America's B-LOC
earliest O
pizzaioli B-TYPE
more O
than O
a O
century O
ago, O
and O
it's O
been O
rejuvenated O
by O
modern O
obsessives O
who O
precisely O
calibrate O
their O
flour B-FOOD
blends. O
What O
do O
we O
have O
to O
learn O
from O
Rome? B-LOC
Let's O
keep O
local O
pride O
in O
check O
for O
a O
minute. O
Marta's B-EST
crusts B-FOOD
are O
even O
thinner O
than O
what O
we O
think O
of O
as O
thin. O
Cooks O
in O

dough B-FOOD
flat O
with O
rolling O

Slipped O

The O
crust B-FOOD
at O
first-rank O
Roman B-CUISINE
pizzerias B-TYPE
like O
Da B-EST
Remo I-EST
in O
Testaccio B-LOC
is O
often O
compared O
to O
a O
cracker, B-FOOD
but O
crackers B-FOOD
crumble. O
This O
doesn't. O
It O
is O
more O
like O
the O
crust O
on O
a O
loaf O
of O
peasant O
bread B-FOOD
from O
which O
all O
the O
soft O
crumbs O
have O
been O
stripped. O
It O
is O
durably O
crisp, O
unbendingly O
flat, O
and O
when O
you O
hold O
a O
slice O
by O
the O
edge, O
the O
rest O
of O
it O
juts O
out O
above O
the O
table O
like O
a O
cliff. O
Because O
everything O
I O
know O
about O
cliffs O
was O
learned O
from O
Wile O
E. O
Coyote, O
I O
kept O
waiting O
for O
the O
tip O
on O
each O
Marta B-EST
slice O
to O
give O
way, O
but O
it O
never O
did. O
The O
pleasure O
of O
biting O
down O
on O
this O
pizza B-FOOD
is O
both O
physical O
and O
auditory. O
The O
noise O
detonates O
along O
the O
jaw O
and O
plows O
right O
into O
the O
inner O
ear. O
Every O
bite O
sounds O
and O
feels O
like O
that. O
There O
is O
no O
soupy O
middle O
of O
steamed O
dough B-FOOD
under O
wet O
tomatoes. O
It's O
pure O
crunch, O
all O
the O
way. O
What O
you O
lose O
with O
this O
style O
is O
the O
soft, O
springy, O
baguette-like O
curls O
at O
the O
edges O
of O
a O
Neapolitan O
pizza. O
The O
outer O
crusts O
of O
a O
Marta O
pie O
don't O
puff O
up; O
they O
stay O
hard O
and O
round, O
like O
grissini. O
When O
a O
pizza O
crust O
is O
all O
crackle, O
what's O
on O
top O
has O
to O
bring O
the O
flavor. O
This O
is O
where O
you O
see O
Mr. O
Anderer O
thinking O
like O
a O
cook. O
He O
has O
a O
great O
pizza-fied O
version O
of O
carbonara, O
with O
dots O
of O
egg O
and O
grated O
pecorino O
over O
crumbled, O
starchy O
potatoes O
and O
baconlike O
curls O
of O
guanciale. O
For O
a O
while, O
he O
was O
doing O
an O
enjoyable O
two-dimensional O
trippa O
alla O
Romana, O
too, O
spreading O
the O
rich, O
chile-boosted O
tomato O
sauce O
around O
the O
pie O
and O
arranging O
tender, O
not O
too O
chewy O
bands O
of O
tripe O
on O
top. O
In O
a O
more O
classical O
vein, O
the O
margherita, O
spread O
with O
flavorful O
tomatoes O
that O
are O
more O
pulp O
than O
sauce O
and O
punctuated O
with O
mozzarella, O
is O
superb. O
At O
$16, O
the O
buffalo O
mozzarella, O
richer O
and O
with O
a O
faint O
taste O
of O
the O
barnyard O
or O
wherever O
it O
is O
water O
buffaloes O
pass O
the O
time, O
is O
worth O
the O
$4 O
upgrade O
from O
the O
cow's O
milk O
variety. O
And O
if O
$18 O
seems O
high O
for O
a O
funghi O
pizza, O
note O
that O
the O
funghi O
in O
question O
are O
quartered O
chanterelles O
and O
frilly O
hen-of-the-woods, O
seasoned O
with O
thyme O
and O
just O
enough O
salt. O
Like O
almost O
all O
the O
toppings, O
the O
mushrooms O
are O
beautifully O
cooked O
with O
an O
insinuation O
of O
smoke; O
only O
the O
shoulder O
ham, O
layered O
between O
fontina O
and O
arugula, O
seemed O
to O
want O
more O
time O
in O
the O
oven, O
or O
maybe O
it O
needed O
to O
be O
sliced O
thin, O
so O
the O
edges O
could O
crisp O
and O
curl. O
Few O
pizzerias O
invest O
heavily O
in O
atmospherics, O
because O
pizza O
and O
the O
people O
who O
love O
it O
come O
and O
go O
in O
a O
few O
minutes. O
Still, O
it's O
a O
surprise O
just O
how O
little O
atmosphere O
the O
Union O
Square O
Hospitality O
Group O
has O
tried O
to O
conjure O
at O
Marta. O
The O
dining O
room, O
with O
its O
majestic O
high O
ceilings O
and O
blocky O
fluted O
columns, O
has O
the O
cold, O
empty O
monumentality O
of O
a O
19th-century O
bank. O
There's O
some O
energy O
at O
the O
counter O
that O
faces O
the O
ovens, O
but O
very O
little O
in O
the O
rows O
of O
square O
tables O
behind O
it. O
The O
restaurant O
is O
open O
to O
the O
hotel O
lobby, O
and O
after O
a O
while, O
the O
comings O
and O
goings O
can O
make O
you O
feel O
as O
if O
you're O
eating O
in O
the O
waiting O
room O
of O
a O
train O
station. O
Lingering O
over O
a O
long O
series O
of O
courses O
is O
not O
advised. O
Marta O
works O
best O
when O
treated O
as O
a O
pizzeria, O
not O
a O
restaurant. O
Main O
courses O
are O
available, O
but O
they O
are O
not O
as O
trustworthy O
as O
the O
pies. O
Pork O
ribs O
managed O
to O
be O
both O
charred O
and O
undercooked, O
while O
a O
slow-roasted O
short O
rib O
needed O
a O
more O
potent O
infusion O
of O
flavor O
than O
gremolata O
could O
give O
it. O
The O
mixed O
grill O
of O
lamb O
chops, O
ribs O
and O
sausage O
was O
a O
magnificent O
exception, O
but O
in O
general O
the O
larger O
plates O
are O
best O
for O
those O
who O
can't O
eat O
pizza. O
(Marta O
does O
not O
make O
gluten-free O
dough.) O
A O
quick O
appetizer O
while O
the O
pizza O
bakes O
is O
absolutely O
recommended, O
though. O
Wood O
smoke O
wraps O
around O
rabbit O
meatballs, O
heavily O
peppered O
and O
herbed. O
The O
kitchen O
does O
fine O
work O
with O
hot O
oil, O
swathing O
vegetable O
fritters O
or O
seafood O
fritto O
misto O
in O
a O
translucently O
thin, O
light-gold O
batter O
and O
gently O
browning O
the O
bread O
crumbs O
around O
green O
supplì O
shaped O
from O
very O
good O
basil O
risotto. O
After O
pizza, O
there O
is O
an O
affogato O
that O
is O
exactly O
right, O
an O
ice O
cream O
sandwich O
that's O
harder O
to O
like O
than O
it O
should O
be O
(the O
salted O
chocolate O
cookies O
could O
be O
thinner O
or O
softer, O
the O
pistachios O
crisper) O
and O
a O
cup O
of O
tiramisù O
that's O
bracingly O
drenched O
in O
espresso. O
It O
costs O
just O
$5, O
which O
is O
helpful O
because O
pizza O
and O
fried O
food O
both O
need O
bubbles. O
Marta O
has O
a O
few O
Italian O
sparkling O
wines, O
but O
the O
real O
action O
is O
in O
the O
stockpile O
of O
nearly O
40 O
Champagnes, O
from O
a O
$66 O
Roger O
Pouillon O
Cuvée O
de O
Réserve O
to O
some O
$300-plus O
vintage O
treats. O
Nobody O
goes O
to O
Rome O
for O
Champagne O
with O
pizza, O
either, O
but O
this O
isn't O
Rome. O

It O
can O
also O
be O
an O
immensely O

one. O
That O
sounds O
contradictory, O
but O
the O
same O
self-confidence O
that O
can O
get O
on O
your O
nerves O
also O
allows O
this O
crew O
to O
mess O
around O
with O
French B-CUISINE
cuisine O
with O
a O
hugely O
energizing O
lack O
of O
respect. O
In O
unnatural O
crossbreeding O
experiments, O
they O
force O
bistro B-CUISINE
cooking O
to O
mate O
with O
haute B-CUISINE

To O
make O
dinner O
less O
stuffy O

formal, O
they O
bring O
back O
stuffy O
formalities O

cut-glass O

frilly O
oyster O

They O
smudge O
the O

It O
may O
sound O

it O

nearly O
every O
weird O

makes O

The O

creates O
a O
parallel O
world O
where O
French B-FOOD
pastry I-FOOD
turns O
into O
Thai B-FOOD
curry; I-FOOD
it's O
as O
if O
the O

have O
imagined O
an O
alternative O
history O
in O

the O

several O

What O
if O

had O
embraced O
maximalism O
instead O
of O

full-frontal O

And O
what O
if, O
instead O
of O
teaching O

the O

For O
one O
thing, O

much O

as O
they O
can O
reasonably O
be O
asked O

Or, O
though O
this O
probably O
needed O
a O
push O
from O
the O
roast-chicken O
gold O

started O
at O
the O
NoMad O

they O
might O
have O
hit O
upon O
Dirty O
French's O
$72 O

feast. O
First O
to O
arrive O
is O
the O
sneakily O
rich O
(translation: O
you O
can't O
see O
the O
foie O
gras) O
white O
meat O
in O
mustard-herb O
sauce. O
Then O
the O
bird's O
hindquarters O
show O
up O
on O
a O
cutting O
board. O
They've O
been O
soaked O
in O
a O
Vietnamese O
marinade O
of O
soy, O
fish O
sauce O
and O
lemon O
grass, O
slowly O
cooked O
in O
melted O
chicken O
fat O
(oh O
yes O
they O
have), O
then O
grilled O
and O
freshened O
up O
with O
lime O
zest. O
The O
chicken O
comes O
with O
crepes, O
irrelevantly; O
just O
pick O
up O
a O
drumstick O
and O
get O
to O
work O
on O
that O
burnished O
skin. O
The O
chefs O
have O
an O
instinct O
for O
the O
right O
kind O
of O
too O
much, O
but O
some O
dishes O
trip O
into O
the O
wrong O
kind. O
A O
deeply O
aromatic O
and O
fairly O
traditional O
bouillabaisse O
was O
thick O
with O
octopus, O
mussels, O
monkfish O
and O
one O
small, O
whole, O
wonderful O
red O
mullet. O
Cuttlefish O
ink O
took O
the O
broth O
to O
the O
outer O
edge O
of O
intensity, O
but O
the O
medicinal O
taste O
of O
fresh O
marjoram O
in O
some O
spoonfuls O
went O
beyond O
it. O
And O
while O
duck O
heart O
kebabs O
unloaded O
at O
the O
table O
added O
brawn O
to O
a O
frisée O
and O
lardons O
salad, O
the O
blast O
of O
mustard O
in O
the O
dressing O
was O
an O
excessive O
use O
of O
force. O
A O
programmatic O
rollout O
of O
the O
formula O
-- O
Something O
Clearly O
French O
Under O
Heaps O
of O
Post-Colonial O
Exotica O
-- O
doesn't O
guarantee O
a O
sprinkling O
of O
magical O
pixie O
dust O
on O
every O
plate. O
Baked O
clams O
seemed O
perplexed O
by O
their O
thick O
jackets O
of O
almonds O
and O
Ethiopian O
spices, O
and O
so O
was O
I. O
A O
beautifully O
cooked O
trout O
meunière O
was O
speckled O
with O
sesame O
seeds O
and O
herbs, O
a O
mix O
that O
came O
across O
as O
an O
oddly O
neutered O
za'atar. O
Still, O
you O
can O
eat O
extraordinarily O
well O
by O
calling O
your O
shots O
and O
rolling O
with O
the O
loose, O
genial O
decadence O
of O
the O
place. O
The O
mood O
is O
set O
when O
a O
server O
comes O
over O
and O
says, O
in O
as O
laid-back O
a O
tone O
as O
anyone O
can O
manage O
while O
lugging O
an O
enormous O
19th-century O
sterling O
silver O

"I O

Oysters: O
Why O

It O

It O

on O
through O

Heather O

Mr. O

plan O
to O
open O
three O
original O
restaurants O
next O
year O
while O
continuing O
to O
build O
new O

The O
question O
is O
whether O
this O

leave O

the O

to O
keep O
refining O
their O
mongrel O
bistro O

out O

A O
little O
skepticism O
is O
in O
order O
when O
you O
hear O
about O
the O
work O
history O
of O
a O
chef O
running O
a O
kitchen O
for O
the O
first O
time. O
As O
frequent O
diners O
know O
from O
sad O
experience, O
it O
is, O
in O
fact, O
possible O
to O
cook O
in O
an O
acclaimed O
restaurant O
without O
picking O
up O
any O
of O
the O
qualities O
that O
it's O
acclaimed O
for. O
Even O
when O
actual O
skills O
have O
been O
learned, O
they O
are O
not O
always O
obvious. O
Or, O
occasionally, O
they're O
all O
too O
obvious, O
and O
you'll O
catch O
somebody O
in O
a O
two-person O
kitchen O
trying O
to O
replicate O
dishes O
originally O
assembled O
by O
a O
team O
of O
40. O
One O
interesting O
thing O
about O
Soogil O
Lim O
is O
that O
you O
can O
almost O
draw O
a O
straight O
line O
from O
his O
résumé O
to O
what's O
on O
the O
table O
at O
his O
four-month-old O
restaurant O
in O
the O
East B-LOC
Village, I-LOC
Soogil B-EST
. O
It's O
easy O
to O
spot O
the O
imprint O
of O
Hooni O
Kim's O
Hanjan O
, O
where O
he O
was O
the O
executive O
chef O
for O
four O
years. O
Mr. O
Lim O
lived O
in O
South B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
until O
he O
was O
28, O
so O
what O
he O
learned O
at O
Hanjan B-EST
was O
not O
how O
to O
make O
the O
country's O
traditional O
food O
but O
how O
to O
rework O
it O
into O
appealing, O
contemporary O
small O
plates. O
Daniel B-EST
, O
where O
he O
spent O
seven O
years O
and O
reached O
the O
rank O
of O
sous-chef, O
turns O
up O
in O
the O
French B-CUISINE
techniques O
Mr. O
Lim O
leans O
on, O
in O
the O
crisp O
presentations O
that O
carry O
an O
echo O
of O
nouvelle B-CUISINE
cuisine, O
in O
the O
tender O
braised B-DISH
short I-DISH
rib, I-DISH
in O
his O
fondness O
for O
foie B-FOOD
gras I-FOOD
and O
in O
his O
preference O
for O
skillfully O
modulating O
flavors O
rather O
than O
tossing O
umami O
grenades. O
It's O
also O
apparent, O
when O
you O
look O
around O
the O
dining O
room, O
that O
in O
his O
earlier O
jobs O
Mr. O
Lim O
spent O
most O
of O
his O
time O
in O
the O
kitchen; O
the O
lineage O
you O
taste O
in O
his O
cooking O
doesn't O
show O
up O
in O
the O
design. O
Soogil B-EST
(SOO-gil) O
doesn't O
evoke O
a O
rambunctious O
Korean B-CUISINE
pub B-TYPE
the O
way O
Hanjan B-EST
does. O
Nor O
is O
it O
a O

luxury B-TYPE

Daniel. B-EST
Under O
the O

of O
Mr. O

in O
what O

a O
plank O
floor. O
A O
few O
framed O
prints O
by O
Suzy O
Taekyung O
Kim, O
a O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
artist O
from O
South B-LOC
Korea, I-LOC
are O
suspended O
over O
the O
banquettes. O
French O
windows O
on O
the O
street O
can O
be O
thrown O
open O
if O
the O
weather O
ever O
cooperates. O
Hanging O
in O
the O
back O
is O
a O
curtain. O
Once O
in O
a O
while O
it O
parts O
just O
wide O
enough O
for O
Mr. O
Lim's O
face O
to O
appear O
while O
he O
scans O
the O
tables. O
Sometimes O
they O
are O
full. O
They O
should O
be O
full O
all O
the O
time, O
because O
cooking O
like O
this O
does O
not O
just O
sprout O
up O
through O
every O
crack O
in O
the O
sidewalk, O
particularly O
at O
prices O
that, O
with O
one O
or O
two O
exceptions, O
don't O
go O
over O
$20. O
A O
good O
window O
into O
Mr. O
Lim's O
mind O
is O
the O
bindaetteok B-DISH
appetizer. O
Usually O
these O
mung B-FOOD
bean I-FOOD
pancakes I-FOOD
present O
as O
flat, O
starchy O
discs O
whose O
golden O
surfaces O
hint O
at O
crunchiness O
without O
actually O
delivering O
it. O
The O
ones O
at O
Soogil, B-EST
fried O
in O
pork O
fat, O
have O
golden O
crusts O
like O
veal B-FOOD
cutlets; I-FOOD
by O
the O
time O
you've O
speared O
a O
piece O
with O
some O
chopped O
kimchi B-FOOD
and O
dunked O
it O
in O
the O
traditional O
dipping B-FOOD
sauce, I-FOOD
you O
have O
all O
the O
expected O
flavors, O
plus O
a O
formidable O
crunch O
to O
sweeten O
the O
deal. O
He O
tinkers O
with O
the O
glass B-FOOD
noodle I-FOOD
dish O
called O
japchae B-DISH
in O
less O
radical O
fashion. O
The O
noodles B-FOOD
themselves, O
shaped O
into O
a O
swirl O
with O
crisp O
shreds O
of O
vegetables B-FOOD
and O
oyster B-FOOD
mushrooms, I-FOOD
have O
drunk O
in O
more O
soy B-FOOD
and O
sesame B-FOOD
flavor O
than O
they O
typically O
do. O
And O
Mr. O
Lim O
seems O
to O
have O
tripled, O
at O
least, O
the O
amount O
of O
bulgogi, B-FOOD
a O
point O
he O
emphasizes O
by O
mounding O
the O
meat B-FOOD
over O
the O
noodles B-FOOD
so O
it O
looks O
like O
a O
sloppy B-FOOD
Joe I-FOOD
missing O
its O
top O
bun. B-FOOD
The O
care O
the O
kitchen O
pays O
to O
technique O
is O
obvious O
in O
the O
seafood B-FOOD
dishes; O
I've O
never O
had O
one O
that O
wasn't O
perfectly O
cooked. O
Monkfish, B-FOOD
which O
can O
come O
off O
as O
a O
rubber O
replica O
of O
some O
part O
of O
the O
anatomy O
I'd O
rather O
not O
think O
about, O
gets O
wrapped O
in O
a O
cabbage B-FOOD
or O
lettuce B-FOOD
leaf, O
gently O
poached, O
and O
sliced O
into O
neat O
little O
wheels. O
Arranged O
over O
stir-fried B-FOOD
vegetables I-FOOD
in O
a O
sea O
of O
fermented B-FOOD
chile I-FOOD
sauce, I-FOOD
it's O
terrific, O
and O
about O
as O
French B-CUISINE
as O
Korean B-CUISINE
cooking O
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
get. O
An O
almost O
silky O
consistency O
marks O
the O
mackerel B-DISH
that O
Soogil B-EST
serves, O
nigiri-style, O
over O
wads O
of O
rice B-FOOD
that O
have O
been O
seasoned O
with O
ssamjang B-FOOD
(standing O
in O
for O
wasabi?) B-FOOD
and O
wrapped O
in O
chard B-FOOD
leaves. I-FOOD
The O
tender O
Manila B-FOOD
clams, I-FOOD
squid B-FOOD
and O
shrimp B-FOOD
in O
the O
spicy B-DISH
tofu-seafood I-DISH
stew O
kept O
more O
of O
their O
natural O
juiciness O
than O
usual, O
although O
very O
firm O
shellfish B-FOOD
isn't O
necessarily O
a O
defect O
in O
that O
dish. O
Mr. O
Lim O
herds O
all O
the O
soft B-FOOD
tofu I-FOOD
into O
a O
flan O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
bowl, O
rather O
than O
letting O
cubes O
of O
it O
fend O
for O
themselves O
in O
the O
broth O
-- O
a O
move O
that O
nicely O
heightens O
the O
contrast O
of O
tofu O
and O
chiles. O
The O
least O
Korean O
thing O
on O
the O
menu O
must O
be O
the O
foie O
gras O
terrine, O
and O
it's O
also O
one O
of O
the O
only O
disappointments, O
with O
its O
crumbly O
Melba O
toasts O
and O
washed-out O
green-plum O
jelly. O
A O
dish O
called O
nurungji O
gras O
is O
something O
else O
entirely: O
a O
fine O
seared O
hunk O
of O
foie O
gras O
laid O
over O
spinach O
and O
pickled O
mushrooms O
on O
a O
springy, O
crunchy O
sizzled O
rice O
cake. O
Slabs O
of O
pork O
belly O
are O
braised O
until O
the O
fat O
streaks O
are O
nearly O
liquid. O
Then O
they're O
given O
a O
meaningful O
sear O
and O
served O
alongside O
a O
stripe O
of O
a O
sauce O
I've O
never O
had O
before, O
made O
with O
fermented O
shrimp O
and O
green O
plums O
and O
fresh O
red O
peppers: O
spicy, O
salty, O
sour O
and O
hot. O
The O
dish O
that O
breaks O
the O
$20 O
barrier O
is O
the O
short O
rib. O
If O
you've O
had O
Daniel's O
braised O
short O
ribs O
, O
the O
tenderness O
and O
concentration O
will O
be O
familiar O
to O
you, O
although O
Soogil's O
version O
is O
pointedly O
suffused O
with O
soy O
rather O
than O
red O
wine. O
Underlining O
the O
French O
connection, O
this O
block O
of O
beef O
is O
served O
with O
carrots, O
potatoes O
and O
winter O
squash. O
If O
you O
eat O
it O
by O
yourself, O
you O
could O
make O
dinner O
of O
it. O
After O
which O
you O
should O
probably O
investigate O
something O
that O
goes O
by O
the O
name O
Jenga O
Tower. O
Cigarettes O
of O
fried O
dough, O
chewy O
like O
rice O
sticks, O
are O
stacked O
like O
a O
log O
cabin, O
then O
dusted O
with O
sugar O
and O
misugaru, O
the O
powdered O
grain O
and O
bean O
blend O
Koreans O
use O
as O
an O
instant O
breakfast O
drink. O
You O
pull O
out O
a O
stick O
at O
the O
time O
until O
the O
tower O
falls O
and O
brings O
down O
the O
scoop O
of O
honey-and-chestnut O
gelato O
balanced O
on O
top. O
The O
dining O
room O
could O
take O
a O
few O
lessons O
in O
balance O
from O
that O
dessert. O
The O
lights O
could O
be O
dimmed O
by O
a O
few O
clicks. O
The O
pop O
music, O
while O
not O
actively O
awful, O
is O
just O
odd O
enough O
to O
be O
subliminally O
distracting. O
Soogil O
can't O
seem O
to O
find O
the O
right O
tone O
for O
service, O
either. O
Some O
nights O
it's O
very O
familiar O
and O
on O
others, O
peculiarly O
fussy O
-- O
a O
server O
insisted O
on O
giving O
the O
book O
I'd O
brought O
a O
chair O
of O
its O
own. O
These O
are O
minor O
snags, O
but O
sorting O
them O
out O
is O
tricky, O
especially O
for O
first-time O
restaurateurs. O
Somewhere O
in O
the O
middle O
is O
a O
relaxed, O
confident O
style O
that O
will O
match O
the O
spirit O
of O
Mr. O
Lim's O
cooking. O

I O
was O
drinking O
gin B-FOOD
and O
pineapple O
juice O
at O
the O
bar O
of O
Gabriel O
Stulman's O
newest O
restaurant, O
Simon O
& O
the O
Whale O
, O
and O
tasting O
folds O
of O
tongue O
pastrami O
laid O
over O
caramelized O
cauliflower, O
a O
combination O
that O
paid O
off O
against O
long O
odds, O
when O
applause O
broke O
out O
by O
the O
entrance. O
I O
hadn't O
heard O
anyone O
drop O
a O
glass O
or O
sing O
"Happy O
Birthday," O
so O
I O
asked O
the O
woman O
next O
to O
me, O
who O
had O
eaten O
there O
three O
or O
four O
times O
already, O
if O
she O
knew O
what O
the O
sudden O
ovation O
was O
about. O
"Have O
you O
been O
to O
Gabe's O
other O
places?" O
she O
asked. O
"They O
like O
to O
clap O
for O
people." O
I O
hadn't O
noticed O
that, O
but O
there O
were O
other O
Stulman O
touches O
that O
had O
been O
transferred O
from O
Bar O
Sardine, O
Jeffrey's O
Grocery O
, O
Fedora O
and O
Joseph O
Leonard O
to O
Simon O
& O
the O
Whale O
when O
it O
opened O
in O
February. O
Case O
studies O
in O
how O
to O
maximize O
miniature O
spaces, O
they O
are O
intimate O
neighborhood O
hangouts O
with O
elevator-size O
kitchens O
where O
the O
food O
and O
cocktails O
are O
more O
interesting O
than O
ought O
to O
be O
achievable O
under O
such O
conditions. O
It's O
a O
genre O
Mr. O
Stulman O
understands O
as O
well O
as O
anybody O
in O
the O
city. O
With O
76 O
seats O
in O
the O
new O
Freehand O
hotel O
on O
East O
23rd O
Street, O
Simon O
& O
the O
Whale O
isn't O
one O
of O
those. O
It's O
an O
Army O
mess O
hall O
by O
the O
standards O
of O
Mr. O
Stulman's O
Happy O
Cooking O
Hospitality O
group. O
But O
the O
design O
firm O
Roman O
and O
Williams O
has O
styled O
it O
like O
a O
California O
Craftsman O
house O
and O
subdivided O
it O
into O
niches O
and O
corners O
with O
open O
cabinets. O
It O
doesn't O
display O
its O
size O
the O
way O
Upland O
, O
another O
Roman O
and O
Williams O
project O
a O
few O
blocks O
north, O
does. O
Even O
the O
bar O
is O
personably O
scaled; O
it's O
configured O
like O
a O
horseshoe. O
Extensive O
personal O
research O
suggests O
this O
is O
the O
best O
possible O
shape O
a O
bar O
can O
have. O
Like O
all O
of O
Mr. O
Stulman's O
places, O
Simon O
& O
the O
Whale O
is O
thick O
with O
high-volume O
conversations O
when O
it O
is O
full, O
which O
is O
pretty O
much O
all O
night O
long. O
Like O
Jeffrey's O
Grocery O
and O
Joseph O
Leonard, O
its O
name O
comes O
from O
a O
relative O
-- O
in O
this O
case, O
Mr. O
Stulman's O
6-year-old O
son, O
who O
apparently O
received O
an O
impressive O
collection O
of O
whale-decorated O
baby O
gifts. O
Also O
familiar O
to O
Mr. O
Stulman's O
regulars O
will O
be O
the O
style O
of O
the O
servers. O
They're O
young, O
talkative, O
fresh-faced, O
enthusiastic, O
as O
if O
they O
are O
new O
to O
the O
city O
and O
haven't O
yet O
grown O
the O
protective O
exoskeleton O
of O
the O
hardened O
New O
Yorker. O
Our O
waiter O
one O
night O
showered O
us O
with O
recommendations O
for O
dishes, O
all O
of O
which O
he O
loved. O
We O
asked O
him O
about O
things O
he O
hadn't O
mentioned. O
He O
loved O
those, O
too. O
He O
loved O
the O
cocktails, O
a O
Happy O
Cooking O
strong O
suit, O
and O
was O
especially O
keen O
on O
one O
made O
with O
mezcal. O
"Mezcal O
never O
hurt O
anybody," O
he O
said O
brightly. O
Extensive O
personal O
research O
suggests O
this O
is O
untrue. O
One O
place O
where O
Simon O
& O
the O
Whale O
allows O
itself O
to O
spread O
out O
beyond O
the O
normal O
boundaries O
of O
the O
Stulman O
kingdom O
is O
breads O
and O
desserts. O
The O
restaurant O
shares O
a O
baker, O
Zoe O
Kanan, O
and O
a O
pastry O
chef, O
Charmaine O
McFarlane, O
with O
the O
hotel's O
second-floor O
cafe, O
Studio, O
also O
run O
by O
Happy O
Cooking. O
Both O
are O
very O
good O
at O
their O
jobs. O
Ms. O
Kanan O
makes O
the O
black, O
thick-crusted O
barley-rye O
bread O
flecked O
with O
anise O
seeds O
that O
comes O
with O
a O
halfhearted O
taramosalata O
and, O
more O
excitingly, O
a O
swipe O
of O
butter O
creamed O
with O
seaweed O
powder. O
The O
long O
thin O
toast, O
crackling O
with O
grains O
and O
seeds O
that O
sits O
under O
cured O
and O
smoked O
Arctic O
char O
and O
smoked O
sour O
cream? O
Hers. O
The O
poppy-seed O
torpedo O
roll O
that O
helps O
lift O
the O
fish O
sandwich O
with O
carrot-squash O
slaw O
above O
the O
ordinary? O
Also O
hers, O
although O
to O
be O
fair O
the O
long, O
flat O
fries O
also O
do O
their O
part. O
And O
if O
your O
spirits O
have O
been O
sunk, O
as O
mine O
have, O
by O
the O
skimpy O
and O
uninspired O
dessert O
choices O
around O
town O
these O
days, O
Ms. O
McFarlane O
will O
be O
an O
answered O
prayer. O
No O
mere O
afterthought, O
her O
panna O
cotta O
sits O
on O
a O
low O
base O
of O
semolina O
cake O
and O
is O
decked O
out O
with O
pink O
grapefruit O
fillets O
and O
grapefruit O
marmalade O
spiced O
with O
red O
juniper O
berries. O
A O
cooling O
evergreen O
moat O
of O
pine O
ice O
surrounds O
an O
earthy O
rye O
pudding O
that's O
enriched O
with O
brown O
butter; O
pears O
fried O
in O
honey O
are O
splayed O
out O
on O
top, O
and O
some O
acerbic O
cranberries O
prevent O
the O
whole O
thing O
from O
cloying. O
I O
defy O
you O
to O
eat O
it O
without O
smiling. O
I O
can't O
say O
I'm O
as O
taken O
with O
crunchy O
knotweed-rhubarb O
compote O
as O
a O
topping O
for O
a O
buckwheat O
cake O
as O
Ms. O
McFarlane O
seems O
to O
be, O
but O
the O
same O
dessert O
offers O
one O
of O
the O
most O
astonishing O
ice O
creams O
around. O
Made O
with O
beeswax, O
it O
is O
as O
deeply O
aromatic O
as O
honey O
but O
not O
as O
sweet, O
and O
its O
texture O
is O
intensely O
creamy O
but O
not O
at O
all O
waxy. O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
menu O
is O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
Matt O
Griffin, O
until O
recently O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
food O
at O
Fedora O
and O
Bar O
Sardine. O
He O
does O
a O
neat O
balancing O
trick O
here, O
giving O
his O
adventurous O
side O
free O
rein O
at O
times O
while O
more O
often O
using O
it O
to O
add O
interest O
to O
the O
standards O
a O
hotel O
restaurant O
probably O
needs. O
A O
winningly O
over-the-top O
recent O
special O
was O
a O
custard-soaked O
pain O
perdu O
under O
bacon O
jus, O
pickled O
cabbage O
and O
speck, O
like O
some O
kind O
of O
demented O
Reuben-croque O
monsieur O
hybrid. O
Liver O
and O
onions O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
less O
thrilling O
snack: O
pickled O
onions O
with O
deep-fried O
and O
overcooked O
chicken O
livers. O
Until O
it O
swam O
off O
the O
menu, O
there O
was O
an O
intriguing O
sideways O
version O
of O
squid O
ink O
risotto O
that O
had O
beech O
mushrooms O
and O
very O
tender O
squid O
confit O
over O
a O
black O
porridge O
of O
barley. O
Now O
there O
are O
spring O
peas, O
swirled O
with O
mint O
into O
a O
sauce O
for O
just-firm O
shrimp; O
the O
combination O
suggested O
pasta, O
but O
I O
was O
glad O
to O
have O
it O
without O
any O
starch O
getting O
in O
the O
way O
of O
the O
clear, O
sweet O
flavors. O
If O
it's O
pasta O
you O
want, O
Mr. O
Griffin O
has O
a O
glossy, O
chile-speckled O
bowl O
of O
spaghetti O
acqua O
pazza O
with O
littleneck O
clams O
and O
cherry O
tomatoes, O
and O
while O
the O
sauce O
is O
thicker O
and O
glossier O
than O
a O
normal O
acqua O
pazza, O
it O
is O
very O
good. O
What O
he O
calls O
a O
pork-collar O
Milanese O
is O
maybe O
a O
few O
millimeters O
too O
thick O
for O
the O
name, O
but O
I'll O
take O
it. O
The O
cut O
is O
more O
flavorful O
than O
a O
normal O
cutlet, O
and O
the O
apricot O
mostarda O
makes O
a O
pungent O
and O
welcome O
counterpoint. O
If O
you O
can't O
finish O
the O
whole O
thing, O
it O
will O
be O
taken O
away O
and O
replaced O
by O
a O
plastic O
action O
figure O
of O
a O
New O
York O
sports O
hero. O
This O
is O
your O
claim O
check. O
Mine O
was O
Don O
Mattingly, O
and O
I O
wondered O
if O
maybe O
the O
applause O
was O
for O
him. O
No, O
Mr. O
Stulman O
said O
on O
the O
phone O
a O
few O
days O
later. O
The O
woman O
he O
bought O
Fedora O
from, O
who O
has O
since O
died, O
was O
89 O
when O
she O
sold O
it O
and O
was O
still O
showing O
up O
each O
night. O
When O
she O
entered, O
people O
clapped. O
"We O
turned O
that O
into O
clapping O

Can O
anybody O
who O
has O
to O
think O
about O
the O
price O
of O
groceries O
still O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
sushi B-FOOD
scene O
in O
New B-LOC
York? I-LOC
Just O
in O
the O
past O
year O
we've O
gotten O
at O
least O
five O
omakase-only B-EST
sanctuaries O
-- O
Sushi B-EST
Noz, I-EST
Sushi B-EST
Amane, I-EST
Noda, B-EST
Shoji B-EST
at O
69 B-LOC
Leonard I-LOC
Street I-LOC
and O
Ichimura B-EST
at I-EST
Uchu I-EST
-- O
where O
the O
price O
of O
a O
meal, O
before O
drinks O
and O
tax, O
is O
somewhere O
between O
$250 O
and O
$300. O
If O
you O
were O
already O
inclined O
to O
think O
that O
the O
Japanese B-CUISINE
seafood B-FOOD
game, O
like O
so O
many O
other O
things O
in O
Manhattan, B-LOC
is O
rigged O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
robber O
barons, O
these O
restaurants O
won't O
change O
your O
mind. O
But O
the O
next O
time O
you O
despair O
of O
ever O
tasting O
another O
slice O
of O
yellowtail, B-FOOD
I'd O
suggest O
dropping O
into O
an O
izakaya B-TYPE
called O
Wokuni B-EST
for O
lunch O
or O
dinner. O
A O
short O
detour O
from O
Grand B-LOC
Central I-LOC
Terminal, I-LOC
it O
has O
been O
in O
business O
since O
October. O
So O
far O
it O
has O
not O
drawn O
much O
attention O
to O
itself. O
Given O
the O
mixed O
messages O
it O
sends O
out, O
this O
is O
understandable. O
It O
has O
soaring O
ceilings, O
a O
backlit O
bar O
with O
shelves O
so O
high O
the O
topmost O
bottles O
can O
be O
reached O
only O
by O
a O
gymnast, O
an O
undulating O
wall O
of O
overlapping O
tiles O
that O
suggests O
Frank O
Gehry O
in O
his O
fish-scale O
period, O
and O
a O
constant O
dance O
beat O
in O
the O
background O
that O
won't O
stop O
no O
matter O
how O
hard O
you O
cry. O
In O
other O
words, O
it O
looks O
like O
the O
Asian B-TYPE
fusion I-TYPE
restaurant O
in O
the O
lobby O
of O
a O
W B-LOC
hotel I-LOC
built O
around O
1999. O
The O
menu O
sings O
another O
tune, O
though. O
It O
is O
full O
of O
traditional O
izakaya B-TYPE
dishes O
like O
tofu B-DISH
agedashi I-DISH
and O
chicken B-DISH
karaage, I-DISH
rounded O
out O
by O
sashimi B-DISH
and O
grilled B-DISH
skewers. I-DISH
There O
is O
one O
twist, O
though: O
Wokuni B-EST
is O
much, O
much O
more O
interested O
in O
seafood B-FOOD
than O
the O
average O
izakaya. B-TYPE
As O
a O
rule, O
the O
fish B-FOOD
at O
Wokuni B-EST
is O
exceptionally O
good O
and O
almost O
bizarrely O
fresh, O
shipped O
daily O
from O
the O
Tsukiji B-LOC
fish O
market O
in O
Tokyo B-LOC
or O
from O
a O
fish O
farm O
in O
Nagasaki B-LOC
owned O
by O
the O
restaurant's O
parent O
company, O
Tokyo O
Ichiban O
Foods O
. O
(Its O
admirable O
motto: O
"We O
are O
changing O
the O
dietary O
culture O
in O
Japan O
with O
persistence.") O
Raw O
or O
cooked, O
the O
seafood B-FOOD
at O
Wokuni B-LOC
sets O
it O
apart O
from O
other O
izakayas B-TYPE
in O
New B-DISH
York, I-DISH
best O
seen O
as O
embassies O
of O
Japanese O
drinking O
culture O
in O
which O
the O
food O
plays O
the O
role O
of O
the O
ambassador's O
chauffeur. O
Sushi B-FOOD
is O
rare O
at O
standard O
izakayas, B-TYPE
but O
it O
is O
made O
and O
sold O
at O
Wokuni, B-EST
at O
very O
moderate O
prices. O
While O
many O
omakase B-TYPE
chefs O
age O
their O
fish B-FOOD
to O
make O
it O
supple O
and O
relaxed, O
the O
sushi B-FOOD
at O
Wokuni B-EST
is O
almost O
insolently O
fresh. O
And O
if O
you O
merely O
get O
a O
few O
$5 O
pieces O
of O
king B-DISH
yellowtail I-DISH
sushi, I-DISH
or O
$6 O
pieces O
of O
sea B-DISH
bream I-DISH
sushi, I-DISH
and O
maybe O
a O
slice O
or O
two O
of O
golden-eye B-DISH
snapper I-DISH
sushi I-DISH
at O
$9 O
each, O
you O
won't O
regret O
it. O
The O
fish B-FOOD
will O
be O
shiny. O
It O
will O
probably O
be O
chewy. O
The O
pinks O
and O
reds O
and O
ivories O
and O
whites O
in O
its O
flesh O
will O
be O
as O
distinct O
as O
if O
they'd O
been O
painted O
on O
with O
a O
nail-polish O
brush. O
But O
sushi B-FOOD
is O
not O
the O
highest O
use O
of O
Wokuni's B-DISH
seafood. B-FOOD
What O
the O
place O
lacks O
are O
the O
seasonal O
fish O
that O
can O
make O
a O
sushi O
excursion O
really O
memorable: O
gizzard O
shad, O
striped O
jack, O
firefly O
squid. O
When O
it O
comes O
to O
sashimi, O
though, O
this O
is O
not O
much O
of O
a O
liability, O
and O
the O
firmness O
of O
Wokuni's O
fish O
becomes O
a O
point O
in O
its O
favor. O
Before O
ordering O
sashimi O
-- O
or, O
in O
fact, O
anything O
else O
-- O
check O
the O
daily O
specials O
posted O
by O
the O
chef, O
Kuniaki O
Yoshizawa. O
They O
will O
almost O
always O
include O
several O
cuts O
of O
bluefin O
from O
farm-raised O
fish. O
If O
you O
come O
very O
early O
for O
lunch O
and O
manage O
to O
get O
the O
Wokuni O
don, O
a O
special O
that O
centers O
on O
a O
sashimi O
rice O
bowl O
and O
shrimp O
tempura, O
it O
will O
strike O
you O
as O
an O
incredible O
bargain O
at O
$24. O
The O
kitchen O
makes O
only O
five O
Wokuni-dons O
a O
day, O
though, O
so O
chances O
are O
you O
will O
have O
to O
content O
yourself O
with O
the O
kaisen-don, O
and O
chances O
are O
that O
even O
though O
it O
doesn't O
include O
tempura, O
the O
$18 O
you O
pay O
will O
still O
seem O
like O
one O
of O
the O
best O
raw-fish O
deals O
in O
town. O
Things O
get O
even O
more O
intriguing O
when O
Wokuni's O
seafood O
comes O
into O
contact O
with O
heat. O
Again, O
the O
specials O
should O
be O
your O
starting O
point. O
There O
may O
well O
be O
a O
grilled O
yellowtail O
collar. O
If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
ordering O
this O
at O
your O
favorite O
izakaya, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
bet O
that O
you O
will O
be O
surprised O
by O
how O
much O
cleaner O
and O
sweeter O
it O
tastes O
here. O
Bluefin O
collars O
and O
jaws O
are O
not O
served O
often O
enough O
for O
anybody O
to O
get O
into O
the O
habit O
of O
ordering O
them. O
The O
grilled O
collar O
at O
Wokuni O
one O
recent O
night O
was O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
pieces O
of O
cooked O
fish O
I've O
had O
in O
a O
long O
time, O
every O
bit O
of O
it O
worth O
chasing O
into O
the O
hollows O
of O
bone, O
skin O
and O
cartilage O
where O
it O
hid. O
It O
is O
not O
always O
available, O
but O
the O
grilled O
bluefin O
tail O
is, O
carved O
into O
a O
steak O
with O
the O
backbone O
sliced O
open O
so O
you O
can O
get O
at O
the O
teaspoonful O
of O
hot, O
clear O
jelly O
inside O
the O
spine. O
Mr. O
Yoshizawa O
has O
had O
the O
surprising O
idea O
of O
treating O
the O
angles O
and O
corners O
of O
the O
sea O
bream's O
body O
like O
chicken O
wings. O
Tucked O
into O
triangles, O
fried O
until O
crunchy O
and O
served O
with O
lemon, O
they O
are O
meant O
to O
be O
gnawned O
on O
between O
sips O
of O
sake. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
ei O
hire, O
a O
frequent O
special O
of O
cured, O
dried O
skate O
fin O
cut O
into O
squares, O
makes O
a O
chewy O
and O
likable O
sidekick O
to O
beer. O
Fish O
and O
chips, O
of O
course, O
will O
go O
with O
either O
-- O
the O
fish O
species O
changes O
from O
night O
to O
night, O
but O
it O
tends O
to O
be O
extremely O
fresh, O
crunchy O
and O
light O
on O
batter. O
The O
chips, O
made O
from O
the O
Japanese O
mountain O
yam, O
were O
never O
crunchy O
and O
always O
needed O
more O
salt. O
Sometimes O
salt O
came O
with O
them, O
and O
sometimes O
it O
didn't. O
Those O
yam O
fries O
are O
an O
example O
of O
what O
happens O
once O
you O
venture O
away O
from O
seafood O
at O
Wokuni: O
The O
ingredients O
aren't O
doing O
the O
heavy O
lifting O
anymore, O
and O
everything O
tastes O
sort O
of, O
well, O
ordinary. O
Certain O
things O
are O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
ordinary, O
like O
the O
fried O
tofu O
in O
dashi; O
the O
warm O
rolled O
omelet, O
particularly O
when O
topped O
with O
grilled O
freshwater O
eel; O
and O
the O
tender, O
ghost-white O
baby O
sardines O
with O
grated O
daikon. O
Others O
are O
on O
the O
wrong O
side, O
like O
the O
grilled O
scallops O
in O
butter O
and O
the O
monkfish O
liver O
that O
strongly O
recalled O
canned O
cat O
food. O
If O
I O
worked O
in O
the O
neighborhood, O
I O
would O
eagerly O
return O
at O
least O
once O
a O
week, O
sticking O
as O
closely O
as O
possible O
to O
the O
fish O
specials. O
I O
doubt O
I'd O
get O
bored, O
but O
I O
would O
keep O
my O
eye O
out O
for O
something O
that O
Wokuni O
could O
put O
on O
the O
menu, O
but O
so O
far O
hasn't. O
The O
parent O
company O
runs O
a O
farm O
that O
raises O
tiger O
blowfish, O
and O
about O
50 O
restaurants O
in O
Japan O
that O
serve O
it. O
Tiger O
blowfish O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
the O
most O
delicious O
kind O
of O
fugu. O
I O
think O
New O
York O
could O
make O
it O
feel O
appreciated O
on O
Lexington O
Avenue. O

-DOCSTART- O

Ever O
since O
Rich O
Torrisi O
and O
Mario O
Carbone O
began O
rehabilitating O
chicken B-DISH
Parm I-DISH
and O
Neapolitan B-DISH
cookies I-DISH
around O
2010, O
I've O
been O
waiting O
for O
other O
restaurants O
to O
carry O
the O
torch O
of O
Italian-American B-CUISINE
food O
boldly O
into O
the O
future. O
This O
is O
a O
major O
branch O
of O
American B-CUISINE
cuisine, O
too O
important O
for O
its O
fate O
to O
be O
left O
to O
the O
Olive B-EST
Garden. I-EST
For O
the O
most O
part, O
though, O
the O
torch O
has O
gone O
uncarried. O
I O
have O
been O
told O
that O
Palizzi B-EST
Social I-EST
Club, I-EST
in O
Philadelphia, B-LOC
may O
qualify, O
but O
because O
Palizzi B-EST
is O
a O
veritable O
club O
-- O
members O
and O
guests O
only, O
no O
new O
applications O
accepted O
-- O
I O
don't O
expect O
to O
eat O
there O
before O
the O
nation's O
tricentennial. O
Then O
in O
October, O
a O
place O
opened O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
Village I-LOC
that O
seemed O
to O
hit O
all O
the O
right O
tropes. O
It's O
called O
Don B-EST
Angie I-EST
. O
Two O
chefs O
share O
the O
kitchen O
-- O
Angela O
Rito O
and O
her O
husband, O
Scott O
Tacinelli O
-- O
and O
they O
make O
versions O
of O
chicken B-DISH
scarpariello I-DISH
, O
antipasto B-DISH
salad I-DISH
and O
braciole. B-DISH
The O
dining O
room O
brings O
back O
the O
high-glitz O
Italian B-CUISINE
restaurant O
décor O
of O
the O
1970s O
and O
'80s, O
the O
period O
when O
Formica O
and O
oil O
paintings O
of O
the O
Bay B-LOC
of I-LOC
Naples I-LOC
went O
out O
and O
mirrors O
with O
gold O
pinstripes O
came O
in. O
The O
floor O
is O
a O
black-and-white O
checkerboard. O
The O
bar O
is O
made O
of O
polished O
marble O
the O
color O
of O
beef B-DISH
carpaccio. I-DISH
There O
is O
a O
house O
Chianti, B-FOOD
and O
it O
comes O
in O
a O
straw-covered O
bottle. O
There O
is O
hope O
for O
a O
red-sauce O
renaissance, O
after O
all. O
Unfortunately, O
more O
or O
less O
from O
the O
day O
it O
opened, O
having O
dinner O
at O
Don B-EST
Angie I-EST
has O
been O
only O
marginally O
less O
difficult O
than O
eating O
at O
a O
private O
club. O
That O
has O
something O
to O
do O
with O
Ms. O
Rito's O
and O
Mr. O
Tacinelli's O
knack O
for O
cooking O
things O
that O
Instagram O
can't O
resist. O
The O
two O
spent O
three O
years O
running O
the O
kitchen O
at O
Quality B-EST
Italian I-EST
in O
Midtown, B-LOC
where O
they O
engineered, O
among O
other O
pieces O
of O
shutterbait, O
a O
chicken B-DISH
Parm I-DISH
that O
looked O
like O
a O
pizza. B-FOOD
There O
was O
some O
wonderful O
stuff O
at O
Quality B-EST
Italian I-EST
and O
some O
less O
wonderful O
stuff, O
and O
almost O
all O
of O
it O
either O
arrived O
on O
trolleys O
or O
was O
prepared O
at O
tableside O
or O
set O
on O
fire O
while O
you O
watched. O
The O
restaurant O
group O
behind O
Quality B-EST
Italian, I-EST
Quality O
Branded O
, O
is O
also O
backing O
Don B-EST
Angie. I-EST
So O
as O
I O
resigned O
myself O
to O
eating O
at O
Don B-EST
Angie I-EST
close O
to O
5:30 O
p.m., O
when O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
an O
unreserved O
table, O
I O
also O
braced O
for O
a O
dose O
of O
abracadabra. O
It O
arrived O
right O
on O
schedule O
with O
my O
first O
drink, O
which O
a O
server O
strained O
into O
a O
glass O
through O
a O
coffee O
filter O
cone O
lined O
with O
espresso B-FOOD
ice. I-FOOD
It O
was O
called O
Americano, B-DISH
Americano, I-DISH
and O
combined O
at O
least O
three O
meanings O
of O
the O
word: O
a O
highball, B-DISH
an O
Italian B-CUISINE
aperitif B-FOOD
wine I-FOOD
and O
a O
diluted O
shot O
of O
espresso. B-FOOD
The O
Americano B-DISH
highball, I-DISH
so O
simple O
that O
just O
about O
any O
bartender O
can O
make O
it, O
doesn't O
need O
much O
improvement. O
But O
I O
have O
to O
admit O
that O
the O
coffee B-FOOD
did O
give O
it O
some O
ballast. O
I'm O
also O
happy O
to O
report O
that O
this O
was O
one O
of O
the O
last O
bits O
of O
stagecraft O
I O
saw O
at O
Don B-EST
Angie. I-EST
Ms. O
Rito O
and O
Mr. O
Tacinelli O
have O
a O
few O
tricks O
up O
their O
sleeves, O
but O
they O
save O
them O
for O
the O
kitchen. O
The O
result O
is O
food O
that O
is O
creative O
in O
a O
more O
interesting O
and O
more O
consistently O
successful O
way O
than O
it O
was O
at O
Quality B-EST
Italian. I-EST
And O
it O
arrives O
at O
the O
table O
without O
the O
aid O
of O
trolleys. O
When O
you O
get O
a O
Caesar B-DISH
salad, I-DISH
the O
server O
doesn't O
whip O
together O
the O
dressing B-FOOD
on O
the O
spot. O
It's O
been O
done O
in O
the O
kitchen, O
where O
the O
chefs O
replaced O
romaine B-FOOD
with O
tender O
chrysanthemum B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
that O
taste O
like O
some O
newly O
discovered O
herb. O
(The O
feathery O
leaves O
firmly O
grip O
the O
dressing B-FOOD
and O
the O
fluffy O
rasped O
cheese, B-FOOD
too.) O
I O
can't O
remember O
seeing O
chrysanthemum B-FOOD
in O
an O
Italian B-CUISINE
restaurant O
before, O
and O
it O
shows O
the O
chefs' O
skill O
for O
cross-pollinating O
with O
other O
cuisines, O
especially O
Asian B-CUISINE
ones. O
While O
the O
Torrisi-Carbone B-EST
axis O
is O
generally O
faithful O
to O
Italian-American B-CUISINE
standards, O
using O
more O
expensive O
ingredients O
and O
more O
modern O
techniques O
but O
leaving O
the O
basic O
ideas O
intact, O
the O
Rito-Tacinelli O
approach O
is O
more O
radical. O
They O
trample O
on O
tradition O
when O
they O
feel O
like O
it. O
Prosciutto B-FOOD
and O
honeydew B-FOOD
melon I-FOOD
are O
tossed O
with O
candied B-FOOD
hazelnuts I-FOOD
and O
mint B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
in O
a O
lime, B-FOOD
tamarind I-FOOD
and I-FOOD
fish-sauce I-FOOD
dressing. I-FOOD
This O
very O
good O
salad, B-FOOD
which O
obviously O
glances O
toward O
Southeast B-LOC
Asia, I-LOC
is O
a O
smart O
way O
to O
handle O
an O
antipasto O
standby O
that O
is O
usually O
pointless O
except O
when O
melons B-FOOD
are O
in O
season. O
Their O
garlic B-DISH
bread I-DISH
turns O
out O
to O
be O
a O
very O
thin O
disc O
with O
garlic B-FOOD
chives I-FOOD
and O
melted O
cheese O
inside O
and O
sesame O
seeds O
on O
top. O
Lightweight, O
salty O
and O
irresistible, O
it's O
modeled O
on O
Ligurian O
focaccia O
di O
recco, O
but O
it O
may O
also O
bring O
to O
mind O
Turkish O
gozleme, O
Azeri O
kutab O
or O
even O
a O
Chinese O
scallion O
pancake. O
There's O
China O
again, O
in O
the O
pepperoni O
fried O
rice O
served O
under O
barbecued O
squid. O
Ignore O
the O
squid O
unless O
you O
like O
it O
leathery, O
and O
just O
focus O
on O
the O
rice, O
stirring O
it O
with O
labneh O
when O
the O
heat O
starts O
to O
rise. O
The O
dish O
everybody O
has O
seen O
on O
Instagram O
is O
the O
pasta O
called O
caramelle. O
In O
Italian O
it O
means O
caramel, O
as O
in O
candy, O
but O
the O
shape O
will O
remind O
most O
Americans O
of O
an O
elongated O
Tootsie O
Roll, O
with O
twists O
at O
either O
end O
of O
a O
drum O
that's O
filled O
with O
buffalo O
ricotta. O
Cameras O
come O
out O
because O
the O
dough O
is O
striped, O
with O
black O
sesame-flour O
bands O
alternating O
with O
ordinary O
egg O
pasta. O
The O
sesame O
barely O
registers; O
the O
fun O
of O
the O
dish O
is O
the O
sauce, O
a O
peppered, O
pickled O
cantaloupe O
that O
tastes O
like O
it's O
still O
percolating. O
But O
the O
dish O
that O
could O
be O
Don O
Angie's O
lasting O
contribution O
to O
the O
pasta O
sciences O
is O
the O
garganelli O
with O
meatball O
ragù. O
The O
central O
problem O
of O
red-sauce O
restaurants O
is O
this: O
Pasta O
and O
meatballs O
are O
always O
served O
together, O
but O
they O
remain O
stubbornly O
separate. O
Ms. O
Rito O
and O
Mr. O
Tacinelli O
have O
found O
a O
way O
out O
of O
this O
conundrum O
by O
crushing O
meatballs O
into O
a O
tomato-guanciale O
ragù. O
It's O
not O
quite O
as O
simple O
as O
I've O
made O
it O
sound, O
but O
you O
don't O
know O
that O
when O
you're O
eating O
it; O
you O
just O
think O
you're O
magically O
eating O
meatballs O
and O
pasta O
at O
the O
same O
time. O
They've O
also O
tried O
to O
salvage O
chicken O
scarpariello, O
a O
dish O
that O
is O
almost O
always O
overcooked. O
Their O
solution O
is O
to O
make O
a O
kind O
of O
pie O
with O
chicken O
meat O
pressed O
down O
into O
a O
kind O
of O
crust O
made O
of O
sausage. O
The O
flavors O
are O
accurate, O
and O
for O
once O
it's O
not O
dry, O
but O
it's O
not O
as O
engaging O
as O
other O
main O
courses, O
like O
the O
veal O
cutlet O
with O
speck O
and O
pickled O
mustard O
seeds, O
or O
the O
grilled O
fillet O
of O
orata O
next O
to O
herbed O
fregola, O
with O
buttermilk O
as O
the O
sauce. O
Reworking O
tiramisù O
almost O
never O
improves O
it, O
but O
as O
a O
change O
of O
pace O
I O
did O
like O
how O
the O
one O
at O
Don O
Angie O
shifted O
the O
emphasis O
from O
espresso O
to O
bittersweet O
cocoa. O
There's O
a O
delicious, O
if O
more O
conventional, O
plate O
of O
tender, O
light O
zeppole O
with O
tangy O
whipped O
robiola O
under O
an O
Andy O
Warhol O
mop O
of O
spun O
sugar O
that O
people O
go O
wild O
for. O
I O
was O
charmed O
by O
a O
smaller, O
quieter O
dessert: O
a O
mochi O
cake O
stuffed O
with O
fior O
di O
latte O
ice O
cream, O
with O
sea O
salt O
and O
a O
fragrant O
scribble O
of O
olive O
oil. O
It's O
like O
eating O
a O
mozzarella O
ball O
that O
wanted O
to O
become O
a O
dessert O
when O
it O
grew O
up, O
and O
did. O

Anthony O
Bourdain O
entered O
the O
literary O
stage O
with O
an O
inside O
tip, O
delivered O
in O
the O
gruff O
whisper O
of O
a O
racetrack O
tout: O
Don't O
order O
fish B-FOOD
on O
Mondays. O
It O
was O
the O
part O
that O
everybody O
remembered O
from O
his O
first O
published O
work, O
a O
long O
essay O
about O
the O
unglamorous O
and O
sometimes O
unsavory O
work O
of O
cooks O
and O
dishwashers O
that O
ran O
in O
The O
New O
Yorker O
in O
1999 O
and O
that O
made O
it O
almost O
impossible O
for O
waiters O
to O
sell O
seafood B-FOOD
between O
Sunday O
and O
Tuesday O
for O
at O
least O
a O
decade. O
And O
the O
advice O
gave O
Mr. O
Bourdain, O
a O
journeyman O
cook O
and O
chef O
nobody O
had O
heard O
of, O
a O
new O
career. O
Before O
he O
was O
found O
dead O
on O
Friday O
, O
in O
what O
the O
authorities O
were O
treating O
as O
a O
suicide, O
he O
was O
the O
witty, O
connected O
guide O
who, O
in O
memoirs, O
cookbooks O
and O
television O
shows, O
would O
tell O
you O
things O
that O
others O
wouldn't. O
In O
the O
glossy, O
cheerful, O
relentlessly O
promotional O
realms O
of O
food O
and O
travel O
writing, O
that O
left O
him O
a O
fair O
number O
of O
truths O
he O
could O
claim O
as O
his O
own, O
and O
he O
took O
full O
advantage O
of O
the O
situation. O
A O
close O
reader O
of O
Orwell O
, O
he O
modeled O
that O
first O
essay O
and O
the O
book O
that O
grew O
out O
of O
it, O
"Kitchen O
Confidential: O
Adventures O
in O
the O
Culinary O
Underbelly," O
on O
Orwell's O
"Down O
and O
Out O
in O
Paris O
and O
London." O
While O
other O
restaurant O
writers O
had O
helped O
build O
the O
cult O
of O
the O
creative, O
artistic O
chef, O
Mr. O
Bourdain O
made O
folk O
heroes O
out O
of O
the O
dishwasher O
and O
the O
line O
cook O
-- O
a O
job O
description O
previously O
known O
only O
to O
restaurant O
employees. O
He O
described O
their O
lives O
and O
their O
day-to-day O
work O
in O
concrete, O
indelible O
detail. O
When O
kitchens O
were O
being O
wrapped O
in O
a O
shimmering O
gauze O
of O
glamour, O
Mr. O
Bourdain O
got O
busy O
unwrapping O
them, O
revealing O
the O
injuries O
and O
addictions, O
low O
wages O
and O
high O
tempers O
that O
took O
a O
toll O
on O
workers. O
Among O
other O
things, O
he O
was O
one O
of O
the O
first O
writers O
to O
tell O
the O
dining O
public O
that O
many O
high-profile O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
restaurants O
would O
cease O
to O
function O
without O
the O
work O
and O
talents O
of O
Mexican O
employees. O
It O
was O
almost O
a O
casual O
aside, O
yet O
it O
suddenly O
opened O
new O
subjects O
to O
the O
purview O
of O
food O
writing: O
immigration O
policy, O
labor O
conditions, O
racism. O
He O
identified O
with O
the O
grunts, O
portraying O
himself O
as O
a O
slinger O
of O
cheap O
steaks B-FOOD
and O
French B-FOOD
fries. I-FOOD
The O
grunts, O
in O
turn, O
identified O
with O
him, O
not O
because O
of O
his O
contributions O
as O
a O
chef O
-- O
who O
can O
name O
an O
Anthony O
Bourdain O
dish? O
-- O
but O
because O
he O
told O
the O
world O
what O
the O
work O
was O
really O
like. O
And O
once O
he O
left O
kitchens O
behind O
for O
a O
career O
in O
travel O
television, O
he O
didn't O
lead O
his O
camera O
crews O
on O
a O
tour O
of O
the O
world's O
most O
luxurious O
resorts. O
He O
went O
to O
Detroit B-LOC
and O
the O
Bronx, B-LOC
Libya B-LOC
and O
Beirut. B-LOC
"Good O
food, O
good O
eating, O
is O
all O
about O
blood O
and O
organs, O
cruelty O
and O
decay," O
he O
wrote O
in O
the O
opening O
sentence O
of O
that O
New O
Yorker O
piece, O
and O
it O
set O
the O
tone O
for O
all O
the O
work O
that O
followed. O

] O
Mr. O
Bourdain O
was O
a O
blood-and-organs O
kind O
of O
guy, O
and O
he O
became O
identified O
with O
his O
unflinching, O
at O
times O
ostentatious, O
descriptions O
of O
life, O
death, O
sex O
and O
digestion. O
Footage O
of O
fly-speckled O
goats' O
heads O
in O
open-air O
markets O
was O
to O
his O
travel O
shows O
what O
harbor O
sunsets O
were O
for O
other O
programs. O
Although O
he O
wasn't O
immune O
to O
hyperbole, O
he O
had O
an O
old-school O
chain-smoking O
newspaper O
editor's O
hatred O
of O
self-serving O
hypocrisy, O
particularly O
in O
other O
television O
hosts. O
He O
delighted O
in O
mocking O
celebrity O
chefs O
like O
Guy O
Fieri O
(whose O
Times B-LOC
Square I-LOC
restaurant O
he O
called O
"the O
Terrordome") O
and O
Paula O
Deen O
("the O
worst, O
most O
dangerous O
person O
to O
America"). B-LOC
At O
times O
Mr. O
Bourdain's O
capacity O
as O
truth-teller O
could O
bleed O
into O
other, O
less O
salutary O
roles: O
the O
attention-seeking O
bully, O
the O
purveyor O
of O
well-polished O
shtick, O
the O
lecture-circuit O
fixture O
who, O
on O
cue, O
would O
curse O
like O
a O
line O
cook O
who O
has O
just O
chopped O
off O
the O
tip O
of O
his O
finger. O
"I O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
speaking O
engagements O
and O
sometimes O
I O
feel O
like O
I'm O
being O
paid O
to O
curse O
in O
front O
of O
people O
who O
haven't O
heard O
it O
in O
a O
while," O
he O
said O
in O
a O
2008 O
interview O
. O
In O
the O
past O
few O
months, O
as O
accusations O
of O
sexual O
harassment O
and O
predatory O
behavior O
have O
shaken O
the O
restaurant O
industry O
, O
Mr. O
Bourdain's O
swaggering O
accounts O
of O
kitchen O
life O
have O
come O
in O
for O
re-evaluation. O
He O
certainly O
took O
pleasure O
in O
telling O
outsiders O
what O
it O
was O
like. O
Was O
there O
some O
pride O
in O
there, O
too, O
in O
belonging O
to O
a O
band O
of O
misfits O
and O
rule-breakers? O
Had O
he O
helped O
to O
popularize O
a O
workplace O
culture O
in O
which O
misogyny O
and O
abuse O
were O
overlooked, O
tolerated O
and O
sometimes O
even O
celebrated? O
"To O
the O
extent O
which O
my O
work O
in O
‘Kitchen O
Confidential' O
celebrated O
or O
prolonged O
a O
culture O
that O
allowed O
the O
kind O
of O
grotesque O
behaviors O
we're O
hearing O
about O
all O
too O
frequently O
is O
something O
I O
think O
about O
daily, O
with O
real O
remorse," O
he O
wrote O
on O
Medium O
in O
December. O
Having O
regularly O
heaped O
disgust O
and O
outrage O
on O
Harvey O
Weinstein O
(who O
was O
accused O
of O
rape O
by O
Asia O
Argento, O
Mr. O
Bourdain's O
partner), O
he O
was O
also O
confronted O
with O
serious O
and O
deeply O
unsettling O
allegations O
about O
Mario O
Batali O
, O
a O
friend. O
"In O
these O
current O
circumstances, O
one O
must O
pick O
a O
side," O
Mr. O
Bourdain O
wrote. O
"I O
stand O
unhesitatingly O
and O
unwaveringly O
with O
the O
women." O
But O
if O
the O
feminist O
perspective O
was O
relatively O
new O
to O
his O
repertory, O
speaking O
out O
about O
sexual O
abuse O
was O
not. O
Long O
ago, O
in O
"Kitchen O
Confidential," O
he O
had O
written O
about O
a O
union O
shop O
steward O
who O
had O
inserted O
his O
fingers O
into O
Mr. O
Bourdain's O
rectum O
every O
day, O
in O
front O
of O
the O
other O
kitchen O
workers. O
Experiences O
like O
this O
may O
be O
common O
for O
male O
cooks, O
but O
they O
are O
not O
commonly O
discussed O
in O
public. O
Mr. O
Bourdain O
was O
too O
unsettled, O
his O
moral O
compass O
too O
twitchy, O
to O
have O
written O
an O
account O
of O
kitchen O
life O
that O
was O
purely O
celebratory O
or O
purely O
accusatory. O
"Life O
is O
complicated. O
It's O
filled O
with O
nuance. O
It's O
unsatisfying," O
he O
once O
said. O
"If O
I O
believe O
in O
anything, O
it O
is O
doubt." O

At O
some O
fateful O
moment O
in O
the O
13th O
century O
when O
Kublai O
Khan O
was O
preparing O
to O
lead O
the O
Mongol O
hordes O
into O
battle, O
hunger O
struck. O
With O
no O
time O
to O
make O
a O
roast B-FOOD
or O

the O
legend O
goes, O
the O
Great O
Khan's O
chef O
carved O
very O
thin O
slices O
of O
raw O
mutton B-FOOD

plunged O
them O

ancient O

the O

changed, O

shabu. I-DISH

like O
hot B-FOOD

shabu B-FOOD
shabu I-FOOD

swish O
the O
ingredients O
they O

Then O
on O
Delancey B-LOC

last O
fall, O
a O
new O
shabu B-TYPE
shabu I-TYPE
restaurant O
appeared O
where O
a O
chef O
standing O
behind O
a O
counter O
does O
all O
the O
cooking O
for O
no O
more O
than O
eight O
people O
at O
a O
time. O
Her O
name O
is O
Mako O
Okano. O
Out O
of O
a O
style O
of O
dining O
that O
has O
always O
been O
a O
big, O
informal O
free-for-all, O
she O
has O
built O
a O
quiet, O
refined, O
intimate O
spot O
called O
Shabushabu B-EST
Macoron I-EST
. O
Usually O
backed O
up O
by O
two O
other O
women, O
but O
occasionally O
working O
solo, O
Ms. O
Okano O
moves O
deliberately. O
She O
will O
gesture O
to O
the O
place O
mat, O
where O
the O
night's O
eight O
or O
10 O
courses O
are O
written O
out O
in O
Japanese, O
right O
to O
left, O
and O
then O
to O
another O
slip O
of O
paper O
with O
the O
same O
courses O
printed O
in O
English, O
again O
right O
to O
left. O
The O
price O
is O
$128. O
There O
are O
no O
choices O
to O
be O
made. O
Ms. O
Okano O
has O
modeled O
her O
restaurant O
on O
omakase B-TYPE
sushi I-TYPE
bars, I-TYPE
where O
the O
chef O
calls O
the O
tune. O
When O
I O
first O
arrived, O
I O
admit O
that O
I O
couldn't O
see O
the O
point O
of O
having O
a O
chef O
do O
the O
cooking O
when O
I O
was O
perfectly O
able O
to O
do O
my O
own O
dunking O
and O
swishing. O
Ms. O
Okano O
quickly O
poured O
two O
or O
three O
mouthfuls O
of O
yeasty, O
warm O
unfiltered O
sake B-FOOD
into O
a O
little O
saucer. O
This O
arrived O
with O
a O
snack O
-- O
cured B-DISH
salmon I-DISH
and I-DISH
salmon I-DISH
roe I-DISH
seasoned I-DISH
with I-DISH
fermented I-DISH
rice I-DISH
-- O
that O
artfully O
underscored O
the O
sake's B-FOOD
flavor. O
Then O
she O
turned O
and O
quietly O
addressed O
a O
sauté O
pan O
over O
the O
stove. O
When O
she O
turned O
around O
again O
she O
had O
cooked O
an O
omelet B-DISH
and O
flicked O
it O
into O
a O
roll O
in O
the O
Japanese B-CUISINE
style. O
Served O
in O
a O
bowl O
of O
hot, O

the O
egg B-FOOD

into O
a O
knot. O
Next O
she O
poached O
two O
pieces O
of O
abalone O
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
each O
in O
abalone O
broth. O
One O
she O
dabbed O
with O
a O
small, O
intense O
blip O
of O
the O
Japanese O
spice O
paste O
yuzu O
kosho. O
Over O
the O
other O
she O
spooned O
a O
sauce O
made O
from O
the O
abalone's O
liver. O
I O
ate O
them O
both, O
and O
was O
flooded O
first O
with O
pleasure O
then O
with O
embarrassment O
that O
I'd O
thought O
simmered O
food O
wasn't O
worth O
a O
chef's O
time. O
By O
the O
time O
I'd O
eaten O
a O
small O
tongue O
of O
sea O
urchin O
combined O
with O
silky O
rags O
of O
yuba O
still O
dripping O
with O
soy O
milk, O
I O
was O
on O
board O
for O
anything O
Ms. O
Okano O
wanted O
to O
cook. O
For O
some O
time O
the O
bubbles O
in O
an O
iron O
pot O
of O
dashi O
set O
over O
a O
countertop O
burner O
had O
been O
getting O
bigger O
and O
faster. O
Thin O
strips O
of O
Wagyu O
beef, O
streaked O
with O
so O
much O
fat O
they O
looked O
like O
stained O
glass, O
were O
stretched O
out O
on O
black O
slate O
with O
pinkish O
bands O
of O
pork O
belly. O
Raw O
vegetables O
-- O
cabbage, O
lettuce, O
enoki O
and O
shiitake O
mushrooms, O
half O
a O
brussels O
sprout O
and O
a O
cherry O
tomato O
on O
a O
wooden O
spear O
-- O
waited O
on O
a O
nearby O
plate. O
Before O
I O
knew O
it O
she O
had O
cooked O
the O
first O
piece O
of O
beef O
-- O
was O
it O
the O
A5 O
from O
Miyazaki O
or O
the O
A4 O
from O
Kagoshima? O
The O
flesh O
had O
twisted O
itself O
around, O
and O
now O
dusk-gray O
outer O
curls O
hid O
inner O
curves O
of O
faded O
pink. O
The O
flavors O
moved O
in O
rapid O
waves: O
first O
a O
few O
clinging, O
savory O
drops O
of O
dashi, O
then O
some O
already-melted O
beef O
fat, O
followed O
by O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
lean O
meat O
itself, O
sweet O
and O
refined. O
Finally O
came O
a O
second O
helping O
of O
fat, O
freshly O
melted O
now. O
When O
Ms. O
Okano O
fished O
out O
a O
piece O
of O
beef, O
she O
would O
suggest O
seasoning O
it O
with O
one O
or O
more O
of O
an O
almost O
comically O
large O
assortment O
of O
condiments O
and O
purées O
that O
she O
makes O
herself. O
She O
seemed O
to O
favor O
her O
ponzu, O
and O
so O
do O
I; O
it's O
more O
radiant O
with O
yuzu O
than O
any O
I've O
had O
before. O
I O
also O
liked O
the O
sweet O
soy O
once O
I O
learned O
to O
doctor O
it O
with O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
what O
Ms. O
Okano O
calls O
"gravy O
sauce," O
a O
dark O
liquid O
that O
makes O
meat O
taste O
meatier. O
Many O
dismal O
meals O
would O
be O
saved O
if O
I O
carried O
an O
eyedropper O
of O
gravy O
sauce O
around O
with O
me. O
Swabbing O
the O
pork O
belly O
in O
the O
sticky, O
thick O
sesame O
paste O
with O
toasted O
sesame O
seeds O
produces O
an O
effect O
similar O
to, O
but O
more O
subtle O
than, O
the O
combination O
of O
peanut O
butter O
and O
bacon. O
It's O
even O
better O
with O
a O
smear O
of O
salted O
plum, O
or O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
the O
yuzu-olive O
oil O
sauce O
that O
seems O
to O
have O
jetted O
in O
from O
Italy. O
The O
vegetables O
were O
spotless O
and O
fresh. O
A O
meal O
without O
them O
would O
be O
off O
kilter, O
perhaps O
to O
a O
degree O
that O
would O
cause O
grumbling O
from O
the O
digestive O
system, O
but O
on O
their O
own O
they O
are O
not O
a O
reason O
to O
go O
to O
Shabushabu O
Macoron. O
The O
chicken O
meatballs O
are, O
though. O
So O
are O
the O
green O
tea O
soba O
noodles O
that O
Ms. O
Okano O
somehow O
manages O
to O
cook O
in O
between O
everything O
else O
without O
seeming O
to O
leave O
the O
few O
square O
feet O
behind O
the O
counter. O
Soba O
is O
not O
standard O
with O
shabu O
shabu, O
but O
it O
is O
something O
she O
has O
experience O
making O
from O
her O
time O
in O
the O
kitchen O
at O
Cocoron O
, O
a O
soba-ya O
across O
Delancey O
Street. O
When O
she O
began O
talking O
about O
her O
dream O
of O
opening O
what O
she O
hoped O
would O
be O
the O
world's O
first O
omakase O
shabu O
shabu O
restaurant, O
Cocoron's O
owners O
listened. O
When O
she O
came O
back O
from O
a O
dunk-and-swish O
tour O
of O
Japan, O
they O
signed O
on O
as O
her O
partners. O
At O
times, O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
Ms. O
Okano O
can't O
believe O
it O
all O
worked O
out. O
After O
she'd O
cooked O
me O
three O
nearly O
identical O
meals, O
I O
wondered O
if O
she'd O
still O
be O
as O
giddy O
a O
year O
from O
now. O
Will O
she O
be O
able O
to O
change O
the O
menu O
with O
the O
seasons O
to O
keep O
things O
interesting? O
Can O
she O
stash O
surprise O
ingredients O
below O
the O
counter O
for O
repeat O
customers, O
the O
way O
sushi O
chefs O
do? O
None O
of O
these O
questions O
occurred O
to O
me O
the O
first O
two O
times O
I O
ate O
at O
her O
restaurant. O
I O
just O
sat O
there O
in O
something O
like O
a O
state O
of O
wonder O
while O
she O
cooked O
for O
me. O
This O
is, O
bizarrely, O
a O
rare O
experience O
at O
tasting O
counters, O
where O
chefs O
are O
often O
intent O
on O
intricacies O
of O
plating. O
The O
physical O
setting O
of O
Shabushabu O
Macoron O
strongly O
suggests O
a O
shoestring O
budget O
-- O
the O
paper O
towel O
roll O
in O
the O
restroom O
hangs O
from O
what O
may O
be O
an O
actual O
shoestring O
-- O
but O
sitting O
there O
while O
Ms. O
Okano O
stands O
a O
few O
inches O
away O
and O
makes O
your O
dinner O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
luxurious O
experiences O
this O
city O
currently O
offers. O

-DOCSTART- O

Real O
estate O
developers O
used O
to O
wait O
for O
restaurants O
to O
illuminate O
the O
sidewalks O
before O
they'd O
start O
investing O
in O
a O
neighborhood. O
They O
don't O
wait O
anymore. O
If O
there's O
no O
Florent B-EST
or O
Schiller's B-EST
Liquor I-EST
Bar I-EST
around, O
they O
simply O
have O
one O
built, O
synchronizing O
the O
opening O
with O
the O
move-in O
date O
of O
the O
first O
new O
apartments. O
This O
is O
the O
tactic O
being O
used O
by O
Hudson B-LOC
Yards I-LOC
, O
the O
glass-and-steel O
mountain O
range O
rising O
above O
a O
one-time O
dining O
wasteland O
where O
soon O
not O
just O
restaurants O
but O
an O
entire O
"restaurant O
collection" O
will O
flourish, O
including O
new O
projects O
from O
David O
Chang, O
José O
Andrés O
and O
others, O
all O
"curated" O
by O
Thomas O
Keller O
. O
And O
it O
is O
the O
approach O
taken O
by O
Henry O
Hall, O
a O
tower O
of O
rental O
apartments O
just O
north O
of O
Hudson B-LOC
Yards I-LOC
on O
West B-LOC
38th I-LOC
Street. I-LOC
To O
give O
the O
place O
the O
atmosphere O
and O
the O
hangout O
opportunities O
of O
a O
boutique O
hotel, O
Henry B-LOC
Hall I-LOC
has O
turned O
its O
first O
two O
floors O
over O
to O
a O
wine O
shop, O
a O
cocktail O
lounge, O
a O
private O
dining O
room O
and O
a O
restaurant. O
I O
am O
telling O
you O
all O
this O
because O
that O
restaurant, O
Legacy B-EST
Records, I-EST
is O
unusually O
good O
and O
very O
popular O
and O
if O
somebody O
invites O
you O
there, O
you O
should O
know O
why O
you O
are O
having O
dinner O
down O
the O
street O
from O
the O
Javits B-LOC
Convention I-LOC
Center I-LOC
and O
a O
stable O
where O
Central B-LOC
Park I-LOC
carriage O
horses O
go O
to O
be O
hosed O
down O
at O
night. O
And O
you O
will O
also O
know O
why O
Legacy B-EST
Records I-EST
seems O
eager O
to O
suggest O
that O
it O
has O
local O
roots O
-- O
so O
eager O
that O
it O
has O
essentially O
ginned O
up O
a O
history O
for O
itself O
that O
brings O
together O
sloppy O
research O
with O
a O
superficial O
tribute O
to O
black O
culture. O
It's O
not O
a O
combination O
that O
will O
appeal O
to O
everybody. O
Like O
the O
bar B-TYPE
and O
the O
wine B-TYPE
store, I-TYPE
Legacy B-EST
Records I-EST
is O
run O
by O
Delicious O
Hospitality, O
the O
company O
behind O
Pasquale O
Jones O
and O
Charlie O
Bird O
. O
The O
menu, O
as O
it O
is O
in O
those O
two O
restaurants, O
is O
essentially O
Italian, B-CUISINE
but O
less O
rustic O
and O
more O
expensive. O
This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
the O
group O
has O
routinely O
charged O
more O
than O
$30, O
and O
as O
much O
as O
$46, O
for O
main O
courses. O
(The O
prices, O
like O
the O
ones O
at O
Pasquale B-EST
Jones I-EST
but O
not O
Charlie B-EST
Bird, I-EST
include O
service.) O
I O
don't O
know O
for O
sure O
whether O
Ryan O
Hardy, O
the O
chef O
and O
one O
of O
the O
three O
partners, O
has O
upgraded O
to O
better O
purveyors, O
but O
I O
do O
know O
I O
was O
taken O
aback, O
often, O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
raw O
ingredients O
at O
Legacy B-EST
Records. I-EST
There O
was O
the O
raw B-DISH
sea I-DISH
scallop, I-DISH
so O
intensely O
fresh O
that O
its O
slices O
clung O
together O
stickily; O
Mr. O
Hardy O
had O
dressed O
it O
with O
dots O
of O
yogurt, B-FOOD
tiny O
oval O
basil B-FOOD
leaves, I-FOOD
toasted O
almonds O
and O
tart O
little O
pink O
cells O
of O
finger O
lime. O
There O
was O
chilled O
Dungeness O
crab, O
a O
few O
pristine O
white O
chunks O
under O
sea O
urchin O
foam, O
to O
be O
spooned O
from O
a O
shot O
glass. O
And O
tiles O
of O
yellowfin O
tuna O
belly, O
not O
as O
fatty O
as O
bluefin O
but O
very O
rich O
all O
the O
same, O
under O
bits O
of O
salted O
lemon O
peel O
and O
a O
splash O
of O
colatura, O
the O
Italian O
fish O
sauce. O
Again O
with O
the O
main O
courses, O
I O
stopped O
and O
wondered: O
Where O
did O
Mr. O
Hardy O
find O
lamb O
(with O
snap O
peas O
and O
smoked O
cream) O
that O
tasted O
as O
if O
it O
had O
never O
eaten O
anything O
but O
fresh O
herbs? O
How O
did O
he O
find O
a O
rib-eye O
that's O
so O
tender O
and O
deeply O
flavorful O
without O
being O
flabby? O
Mr. O
Hardy O
has O
been O
quick O
to O
make O
the O
most O
of O
what O
the O
market O
says O
is O
the O
first O
month O
of O
spring O
and O
the O
calendar O
says O
is O
the O
last. O
Creamy O
new-crop O
potatoes O
deserve O
a O
little O
appreciation O
before O
they're O
sent O
off O
to O
root O
cellars, O
and O
Mr. O
Hardy O
built O
a O
fine O
appetizer O
around O
them O
with O
leggy O
broccoli O
sprouts O
and O
melting O
chunks O
of O
fresh O
mozzarella O
spiked O
with O
anchovy. O
Charred O
snap O
peas O
made O
a O
tangy O
salad O
together O
with O
ramps O
in O
a O
peppery O
buttermilk O
dressing. O
But O
sweet O
English O
peas O
were O
swallowed O
up O
by O
a O
too-sharp O
risotto; O
seasoned O
with O
prosciutto, O
the O
rice O
took O
on O
more O
of O
the O
ham's O
saltiness O
than O
its O
sweetness. O
Legacy O
Records O
doesn't O
say O
anything O
particularly O
original, O
but O
it O
has O
a O
finesse O
that's O
new O
for O
this O
restaurant O
group. O
There's O
an O
exceptional O
plate O
of O
grilled O
pigeon, O
neatly O
carved O
and O
served O
with O
swooshes O
of O
nettle O
purée. O
It O
is O
at O
least O
as O
impressive O
as O
the O
dish O
that's O
becoming O
a O
breakout O
star O
for O
the O
restaurant: O
a O
duck O
breast, O
its O
skin O
rubbed O
with O
pepper, O
chiles, O
honey O
and O
fennel O
and O
then O
roasted O
until O
it O
has O
a O
deep, O
crusty O
bark O
that O
a O
Texas O
pitmaster O
would O
be O
proud O
of. O
Ordering O
wine O
is O
an O
event O
in O
itself. O
Robert O
Bohr O
and O
Grant O
Reynolds, O
who O
are O
Mr. O
Hardy's O
partners O
and O
the O
resident O
wine O
soothsayers, O
have O
seen O
to O
it O
that O
cultists O
can O
rub O
elbows O
with O
the O
Agraparts, O
Raveneaus O
and O
Gajas, O
while O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
will O
still O
find O
a O
few O
bottles O
under O
$100 O
from O
some O
of O
the O
most O
expensive O
arable O
land O
on O
earth. O
Oddly O
enough, O
the O
wine O
list O
makes O
less O
of O
an O
impression O
than O
the O
ones O
at O
Charlie O
Bird O
and O
Pasquale O
Jones, O
simply O
because O
you'd O
expect O
an O
ambitious O
cellar O
in O
a O
restaurant O
this O
expensive. O
Then O
again O
you O
might O
also O
expect O
a O
smart, O
artful O
dessert O
menu; O
if O
so, O
you're O
out O
of O
luck. O
There O
is O
ice O
cream O
with O
strawberries, O
a O
dark O
chocolate O
meringue O
and O
a O
selection O
of O
gelati, O
served O
in O
a O
cone; O
all O
perfectly O
pleasant, O
but O
there's O
more O
wit O
and O
creativity O
in O
the O
excellent O
cocktail O
roster O
administered O
by O
Jeff O
Bell. O
I'm O
sure O
there O
are O
people O
who O
are O
reluctant O
to O
go O
to O
Legacy O
Records O
because O
of O
how O
relentlessly O
noisy O
this O
team's O
downtown O
restaurants O
are. O
But O
they O
seem O
to O
have O
sent O
the O
acoustics O
to O
obedience O
school, O
because O
all O
the O
sound O
waves O
do O
what O
they're O
told: O
Conversations O
stay O
at O
their O
own O
tables, O
while O
the O
music O
stays O
in O
the O
background. O
Ken O
Fulk, O
who O
designed O
all O
the O
public O
spaces O
in O
the O
building, O
covered O
some O
wall O
panels O
with O
grasscloth, O
put O
glove-soft O
leather O
on O
the O
tabletops, O
and O
found O
other O
ways O
to O
dampen O
the O
noise. O
Legacy O
Records O
certainly O
doesn't O
look O
like O
any O
other O
restaurant; O
Mr. O
Fulk O
went O
to O
extremes, O
using O
some O
motifs O
from O
the O
1980s O
-- O
emphatic O
grids, O
metallic O
finishes, O
whites O
and O
country-club O
greens O
-- O
that O
not O
everybody O
is O
ready O
to O
see O
resurrected. O
Hanging O

on O

on O

"I O

Along O
with O
the O
constant O
hip-hop O
and O
vintage O
soul O
soundtrack O
and O
the O
restaurant's O
name O
-- O
taken, O
we O
are O
told, O
from O
a O
recording O
studio O
that O
once O
stood O
on O
this O
site O
-- O
Legacy O
Records O
tries O
to O
present O
itself O
as O
a O
homage O
to O
another O
era O
in O
music. O
If O
Legacy O
Recording O
Studios O
had O
been O
used O
by O
Mr. O
Gaye, O
Mr. O
Wonder O
and O
Ms. O
Ross, O
that O
homage O
might O
make O
sense. O
But O
it O
didn't. O
Lasting O
just O
from O
2001 O
to O
2009, O
the O
studio O
was O
built O
for O
and O
mostly O
used O
by O
orchestras, O
Broadway O
cast O
recordings O
and O
commercials. O
Legacy O
Records O
has O
taken O
this O
shred O
of O
history O
and O
turned O
it O
into O
a O
fantasy O
of O
black O
American O
music. O
Exhibited O
in O
a O
museum O
or O
gallery, O
Ms. O

on O
the O
different O
postures O
and O
personas O
available O
to O
black O
women. O
Hanging O
it O
next O
to O
the O
counter O
where O
pastries O
and O
coffee O
are O
sold O
by O
day O
strips O
out O
some O
of O
its O
meaning; O
it O
looks O
like O
an O
attempt O
to O
buy O
a O
personality O
for O
a O
restaurant O
that O
doesn't O
have O
one O
of O
its O
own. O
If O
anyone O
gets O
to O
decide O
who O
can O
use O
black O
culture O
for O
what O
purposes, O
it O
surely O
isn't O
me. O
But O
Legacy O
Records O
uses O
it O
in O
a O
gratuitous O
and O
offhanded O
way O
that O
made O
me O
uncomfortable. O
Stevie O
Wonder O
will O
always O
be O
cool, O
but O
a O
restaurant O
dreamed O
up O
by O
real O
estate O
developers O
doesn't O
automatically O
become O
cool O
by O
putting O
him O
on O
the O
wall. O

There O
isn't O
another O
bar B-TYPE
in O
the O
city O
like O
the O
one O
that O
opened O
in O
February O
as O
part O
of O
the O
redesign O
of O
David O
Chang's O
Momofuku B-EST
Ko. I-EST
One O
thing O
that O
sets O
it O
apart O
is O
that O
it O
doesn't O
have O
a O
name. O
Credit-card O
receipts O
call O
it O
"Momofuku B-EST
Ko," I-EST
even O
though O
it O
operates O
in O
its O
own O
little O
room O
with O
its O
own O
entrance. O
The O
door, O
a O
few O
steps O
past O
Ko's B-EST
along O
the O
East B-LOC
Village I-LOC
alley O
known O
as O
Extra B-LOC
Place, I-LOC
is O
marked O
"Ko." B-EST
The O
menus O
don't O
give O
a O
name O
at O
all. O
They O
don't O
look O
much O
like O
menus, O
either. O
They're O
notebooks O
in O
which O
the O
items O
available, O
presented O
in O
a O
short O
à O
la O
carte O
list O
(in O
contrast O
to O
the O
hourslong O
tastings O
offered O
for O
$255 O
at O
Ko), B-EST
are O
handwritten O
on O
a O
fresh O
page O
each O
day, O
by O
different O
employees O
using O
different O
pens. O
The O
date O
is O
at O
the O
top O
over O
a O
list O
of O
dishes O
that O
you O
will O
not O
find O
together O
anywhere O
else. O
Lately O
there O
has O
been O
a O
lucid, O
refreshing O
plate O
of O
raw B-FOOD
sea I-FOOD
scallops, I-FOOD
sliced O
cold O
and O
mixed O
with O
fresh O
green B-FOOD
shiso I-FOOD
and O
folds O
of O
pineapple, B-FOOD
red O
with O
ground O
chiles. B-FOOD
Lightly O
cured O
fillets O
of O
sardine B-FOOD
made O
a O
thrilling O
appearance O
last O
month O
in O
a O
brick-red O
oil B-FOOD
flavored O
with O
paprika, B-FOOD
cayenne, B-FOOD
and O
other O
components O
of O
tandoori B-FOOD
paste. I-FOOD
Both O
were O
solidly O
in O
the O
tradition O
of O
Momofuku B-EST
small O
plates O
that O
the O
world O
has O
known O
since O
Mr. O
Chang's O
Ssam B-EST
Bar I-EST
began O
remixing O
various O
Asian B-CUISINE
ideas O
after-hours. O
Both O
were O
wonderful. O
The O
savory O
pie B-FOOD
stuffed O
with O
fresh-made O
pork B-FOOD
sausage I-FOOD
patties I-FOOD
comes O
from O
another O
place O
entirely. O
You O
could O
tour O
the O
city's O
proudest O
French B-CUISINE
restaurants O
without O
coming O
across O
a O
more O
skillfully O
done O
puff B-FOOD
pastry I-FOOD
crust, I-FOOD
notched O
like O
a O
pinwheel O
and O
baked O
to O
a O
deep O
mahogany. O
The O
pie B-FOOD
costs O
$45 O
and O
typically O
serves O
two, O
sliced O
into O
half-moons. O
It O
is O
plated O
with O
a O
reduction B-FOOD
sauce, I-FOOD
as O
classical O
and O
French B-CUISINE
as O
it O
gets O
but O
with O
an O
insistent O
vein O
of O
acidity O
that O
somehow O
makes O
it O
modern. O
Even O
if O
you're O
used O
to O
the O
signature O
Momofuku B-EST
move O
of O
white-knuckle O
bungee O
jumping O
from O
the O
high O
end O
to O
the O
low, O
certain O
juxtapositions O
may O
call O
for O
Dramamine. O
Alongside O
the O
masterly O
pork B-DISH
pie, I-DISH
you O
can O
find O
a O
$5 O
sandwich B-FOOD
of O
pickled B-FOOD
daikon I-FOOD
and O
cucumber O
sticks O
inside O
a O
grilled O
and O
buttered O
Martin's O
hot O
dog O
roll. O
The O
pickle O
sandwich O
is O
just O
the O
thing O
to O
eat O
with O
the O
cold O
fried O
chicken O
that O
is O
battered O
three O
times, O
fried O
four O
times, O
brushed O
with O
a O
spicy O
mirin-yuzu O
glaze O
and O
served O
nearly O
at O
refrigerator O
temperature. O
I O
don't O
believe O
I've O
used O
that O
phrase O
approvingly O
in O
a O
review O
before, O
but O
then O
I O
don't O
think O
a O
restaurant O
has O
served O
me O
cold O
fried O
chicken O
as O
good O
as O
this O
before. O
By O
flipping O
through O
the O
menu O
pages O
you O
can O
pinpoint O
the O
dates O
when O
dishes O
were O
first O
served, O
and O
see O
others O
that O
came O
and O
went. O
The O
idea O
is O
for O
Ko's O
executive O
chef, O
Sean O
Gray, O
to O
use O
the O
bar O
as O
a O
"field O
for O
research O
and O
development O
for O
our O
culinary O
team," O
according O
to O
the O
website. O
Ideas O
are O
auditioned O
or O
refined O
before O
they O
graduate O
to O
Ko, O
which O
I O
gave O
three O
stars O
in O
a O
2015 O
review O
. O
Most O
menus, O
at O
least O
the O
ones O
that O
change O
over O
time, O
are O
works O
in O
progress, O
but O
few O
make O
that O
explicit O
the O
way O
the O
one O
at O
Ko's O
bar O
does. O
The O
cynical O
way O
to O
look O
at O
this O
is O
that O
bar O
customers O
are O
paying O
to O
serve O
as O
lab O
rats. O
This O
will O
not O
be O
everyone's O
idea O
of O
a O
fun O
night O
out. O
One O
recent O
evening, O
the O
menu O
was O
as O
meat-heavy O
as O
at O
Ssam O
Bar O
in O
the O
era O
when O
its O
menus O
still O
proclaimed, O
"We O
do O
not O
serve O
vegetarian-friendly O
items." O
Among O
the O
more O
substantial O
dishes O
that O
night O
was O
a O
mixed-meat O
sausage O
stuffed O
into O
a O
chicken O
neck O
and O
grilled. O
One O
end O
of O
the O
neck O
was O
open. O
The O
other O
was O
still O
attached O
to O
the O
chicken's O
head. O
It O
was O
a O
sensational O
sausage, O
but O
it O
did O
nothing O
to O
make O
Ko's O
bar O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
that O
you'd O
take O
your O
new O
pescatarian O
friend. O
The O
bar, O
run O
collaboratively O
by O
Mr. O
Gray O
and O
Su O
Wong O
Ruiz, O
the O
general O
manager, O
works O
best O
for O
diners O
who O
don't O
need O
a O
multitude O
of O
choices O
to O
be O
happy. O
To O
the O
extent O
that O
it O
resembles O
other O
places, O
it's O
probably O
most O
similar O
to O
a O
wine O
bar, O
with O
its O
tight O
menu, O
its O
casual O
drop-in-and-stay-awhile O
air O
and O
its O
carefully O
considered O
list O
of O
wines O
by O
the O
glass, O
which O
it O
shares O
with O
Ko. O
Anyone O
who O
wants O
a O
whole O
bottle O
can O
order O
one O
from O
the O
full O
Ko O
list, O
a O
virtual O
who's O
who O
of O
cult O
winemakers O
in O
certain O
specialties O
such O
as O
grower O
Champagne, O
chenin O
blanc O
from O
the O
Loire O
Valley O
and O
Burgundy O
of O
all O
stripes. O
On O
the O
notebook O
page O
facing O
the O
handwritten O
menu O
are O
two O
more O
wines O
that O
Ambrose O
Chiang, O
the O
beverage O
director, O
is O
pouring O
by O
the O
glass O
for O
one O
day O
only. O
Recently O
I've O
lucked O
into O
a O
precisely O
shaped O
Côte-Rôtie O
from O
Domaine O
Jasmin O
and O
a O
Saumur O
from O
Romain O
Guiberteau O
whose O
self-assurance O
I O
envied. O
These O
specials O
can O
cost O
twice O
as O
much O
as O
the O
regular O
by-the-glass O
pours, O
which O
tend O
to O
fall O
between O
$15 O
and O
$25. O
I O
can't O
figure O
out O
why O
the O
wine-geek O
crowd O
doesn't O
bring O
tents O
and O
sleeping O
bags O
to O
camp O
out O
at O
Ko's O
bar. O
And O
I O
don't O
understand O
why O
the O
place O
is O
almost O
never O
crowded, O
despite O
getting O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
press O
after O
it O
opened. O
The O
experimental O
nature O
of O
the O
menu O
can't O
be O
keeping O
people O
away; O
people O
expect O
that O
from O
Momofuku O
restaurants O
. O
The O
only O
dish O
that O
I O
thought O
wasn't O
totally O
successful O
was O
the O
fried O
zucchini O
made O
in O
the O
style O
of O
the O
fried O
chicken, O
and O
I O
was O
still O
glad O
I O
tried O
it. O
The O
prices O
are O
all O
over O
the O
place, O
but O
a O
meal O
here O
doesn't O
need O
to O
be O
expensive. O
While O
you O
are O
welcome O
to O
spend O
$100 O
on O
a O
sourdough O
crepe O
with O
50 O
grams O
of O
white-sturgeon O
caviar, O
you O
can O
just O
get O
the O
crepe O
alone O
for O
$8. O
It O
is O
excellent: O
shiny O
with O
tangy O
cave-age O
butter, O
speckled O
with O
oregano O
cinders O
and O
crunchy O
from O
a O
pass O
over O
hot O
Japanese O
charcoal. O
The O
chicken, O
meanwhile, O
is O
$7 O
a O
piece. O
The O
only O
reason O
I O
can O
think O
of O
for O
the O
empty O
seats O
is O
that O
the O
place O
is O
so O
hard O
to O
sum O
up. O
Try O
this O
description, O
then: O
Imagine O
an O
eccentric, O
highly O
polished O
David O
Chang O
restaurant O
that O
the O
world O
hasn't O
heard O
about O
yet. O

Coco B-EST

Those O
of O
you O
who O

out O
in O
Manhattan B-LOC

the O

have O
no O

Those O

rustic-chic O
Tuscan-esque B-CUISINE
restaurant, O
Coco B-EST

which O
got O
a O
three-star O

review O
from O
Marian O

in O
1991 O

and O
to O
its O
three O
New O

Le B-EST
Madri I-EST
in O
1989 O
, O
called O
"the O
hugs-and-kisses-I-love-your-hat-Ciao-baby O

it O
may O
be O
useful O
to O
remember O
that O
this O
was O
an O
era O
when O
pasta B-FOOD
was O
commonly O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
health O

So O
far O
that O
is O
not O
who O

to O
Coco B-EST
Pazzo I-EST

On O
balance, O
Mr. O
Luongo's O
version O
of O
Tuscan B-CUISINE

retrofitted O
for O
American O
appetites O
may O
be O
easier O
to O
see O
for O
what O
it O

that O

(He O

When O

a O

one. O
Nobody O
will O
think O
you're O
a O

is O
to O

a O
helping O

Soft O

polpettine I-FOOD
sit O
next O
to O
rigatoni B-FOOD
in O
sugo, B-FOOD
not O
on O

so O
you O
can O
have O
pasta B-FOOD
first O
and O
meatballs B-FOOD
second O
and O
tell O
yourself O
you're O
eating O
like O
a O
real O
Italian. O
Alternatively, O
you O
might O
go O
with O
the O
main O
courses O
marked O
"Per O
La O
Tavola." O
For O
once O
these O
plates O
really O
are O
meant O
for O
sharing: O
a O
substantial O
stack O
of O
spiced B-DISH

roasted I-DISH
baby-back I-DISH
ribs I-DISH
under O
a O
warm O
slaw B-FOOD
of O
cucumbers B-FOOD

tomatoes, B-FOOD
or O
a O
spread O
of O
grilled B-FOOD
rib-eye I-FOOD
slices O
served O
with O
a O
separate O
plate O
of O
"Tuscan B-DISH
fries," I-DISH
distinguishable O
from O
the O
regular O
kind O
by O
their O
fried B-FOOD
rosemary I-FOOD
needles. I-FOOD
Those O
fries B-FOOD
may O
be O
awesomely O
browned O
one O
week O
but O
ghostly O
and O
uncrisp O
the O
next. O
The O

the O

broth I-FOOD
as O
a O
second O
course O
after O
all O
the O
seafood B-FOOD
has O
been O
eaten O
might O
be O
60 O
seconds O
away O
from O
being O
al O

I O
am O
not O
enthusiastic O
about O
the O
slightly O
tough O
squid B-FOOD
in O
moist O
bread B-FOOD
crumbs, I-FOOD
baked O
rather O
than O
fried, O
although O
the O

restaurant, O
Morso, B-EST
next O
to O
the O

The O
soufflés B-FOOD
that O
the O
servers O
try O
to O
sell O
halfway O
through O
the O
meal O
can O
be O
a O
little O
soupy. O
But O
the O
blueberry B-DISH
crostata I-DISH
is O
a O
genuine O
pleasure, O
its O
crust B-FOOD
likably O
sweet O

tender. O
And O
you'll O
appreciate O
the O
clean, O
bright O

of O

SPEAKING O
OF O
laid-back O
restaurants O
where O
you O
can O
enjoy O
a O
pleasant O
and O
unpretentious O
summer O
meal, O
have O
you O
been O
to O
Yves? B-EST
It O
opened O
without O
much O
of O
a O
splash O
about O
two O
years O
ago, O
despite O
occupying O
a O
handsome, O
spare O
dining O
room O
whose O
white O
interior O
makes O
the O
most O
of O
the O
afternoon O
sunlight O
that O
hits O
its O
TriBeCa B-LOC
corner, O
opposite O
the O
restaurant O
Locanda B-EST
Verde. I-EST
I O
missed O
the O
original O
chef's O
tenure, O
but O
lately O
I've O
been O
intrigued O
by O
the O
cooking O
of O
Alex O
Baker, O
who O
took O
over O
in O
February. O
She O
is O
Paris-trained, B-LOC
having O
gone O
to O
culinary O
school O
and O
worked O
at O
Spring B-EST
and O
Le B-EST
Chateaubriand I-EST
there, O
before O
coming O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
to O
help O
open O
Rebelle B-EST
in O
2015. O
At O
Yves, B-EST
she O
interprets O
French B-CUISINE
food O
with O
an O
appealingly O
relaxed, O
seasonal O
attitude. O
In O
early O
June O
she O
brought O
little O
bright-green O
favas B-FOOD
and O
sticks O
of O
asparagus B-FOOD
together O
with O
fresh-herb B-FOOD
pappardelle, I-FOOD
and O
if O
you're O
wondering O
what O
makes O
that O
French, B-CUISINE
the O
answer O
is O
a O
pistou B-FOOD
loaded O
with O
tarragon B-FOOD
and O
chervil. B-FOOD
There O
was O
also O
a O
reassuringly O
gentle O
navarin B-DISH
of I-DISH
lamb, I-DISH
with O
a O
small O
spring O
garden O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
customary O
carrots B-FOOD
and O
potatoes: B-FOOD
grilled B-FOOD
baby I-FOOD
leeks I-FOOD
and O
asparagus B-FOOD
stalks, I-FOOD
and O
tender O
chard O
stems. O
Pan-fried O
steelhead O
trout O
is O
on O
the O
menu O
now, O
with O
a O
smooth, O
pale-green O
sauce O
of O
cucumbers, O
melons O
and O
avocados O
pooling O
beneath O
a O
jumble O
of O
warm O
young O
cucumbers. O
So O
is O
a O
side O
dish O
of O
recently O
picked O
pole O
beans O
and O
string O
beans O
charred O
on O
the O
grill O
and O
dressed O
with O
toasted-almond O
vinaigrette. O
As O
interpreted O
by O
Ms. O
Baker, O
mussels O
Provençal O
are O
not O
the O
usual O
mound O
of O
black O
shells O
in O
thin O
pink O
liquid O
with O
a O
few O
slices O
of O
baguette; O
the O
shells O
are O
gone, O
the O
mussels O
are O
good O
fat O
ones O
and O
their O
sauce O
is O
more O
concentrated, O
augmented O
with O
tomato O
paste O
and O
roasted O
cherry O
tomatoes O
and O
garnished O
with O
thick-crusted O
cubes O
of O
toasted O
bread. O
The O
snails O
are O
more O
traditional, O
parsley-garlic O
butter O
sloshing O
around O
in O
their O
shells. O
If O
these O
land O
snails O
wondered O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
on O
a O
bed O
of O
seaweed, O
they O
didn't O
show O
it. O
There O
is O
some O
unevenness O
in O
the O
kitchen O
to O
be O
worked O
out. O
The O
fluke O
meunière O
may O
be O
sautéed O
to O
a O
textbook O
golden O
crackle, O
or O
it O
could O
arrive O
looking O
as O
pale O
as O
a O
fish O
belly. O
The O
country O
ham O
sandwich O
could O
use O
bread O
that's O
easier O
to O
chew O
than O
the O
crust-armored O
baguettes O
from O
Bien O
Cuit. O
The O
restaurant O
is O
large, O
and O
service O
tends O
to O
arrive O
in O
rapid O
bursts O
separated O
by O
long O
pauses. O
The O
wine O
list O
is O
very O
lopsided O
in O
favor O
of O
three-figure O
bottles, O
an O
irritating O
move O
for O
a O
fairly O
casual O
spot. O
But O
Ms. O
Baker O
seems O
to O
be O
making O
the O
best O
of O
it. O
It's O
hard O
to O
be O
cross O
with O
a O
restaurant O
that O
makes O
its O
own O
boursin O
and O
brings O
it O
out O
in O
a O
dish O
so O
big O
I O
could O
never O
manage O
to O
finish O
it, O
even O
with O
a O
stack O
of O
toasted O
baguette O
to O
smear O
it O
on. O

French B-CUISINE
chefs O
who O
covet O
Michelin O
stars O
study O
the O
restaurants O
that O
get O
them, O
and O
the O
ones O
that O
don't, O
before O
deciding O
where O
to O
devote O
their O
money O
and O
attention. O
If O
there O
is O
a O
formula O
behind O
the O
rating O
system, O
which O
for O
many O
chefs O
is O
an O
article O
of O
faith, O
almost O
no O
one O
figured O
it O
out O
the O
first O
time. O
Joël O
Robucho O
n, O
who O
died O
on O
Monday O
at O
73 O
, O
came O
closer O
than O
anyone O
. O
Mr. O
Robuchon's O
first O
restaurant, O
Jamin, B-EST
was O
given O
one O
Michelin O
star O
in O
its O
first O
year. O
It O
got O
another O
in O
its O
second, O
and O
the O
next O
year O
it O
climbed O
to O
the O
top O
step, O
a O
three-star O
ranking. O
Mr. O
Robuchon O
was O
still O
in O
his O
late O
30s. O
What O
could O
he O
do O
for O
his O
next O
trick? O
There O
were O
new O
dishes O
to O
invent, O
new O
honors O
to O
win, O
new O
employees O
to O
terrify. O
The O
chef O
Eric O
Ripert, O
who O
was O
one O
of O
them O
, O
has O
said O
that O
he O
still O
has O
nightmares O
about O
covering O
plates O
with O
the O
precisely O
sized O
and O
spaced O
dots O
of O
sauce O
that O
were O
a O
Jamin B-EST
signature. O
Playing O
the O
kitchen O
tyrant, O
regularly O
berating O
young O
cooks O
for O
mistakes O
nobody O
else O
would O
notice, O
Mr. O
Robuchon O
embodied O
the O
old O
order. O
At O
the O
time, O
this O
boot-camp O
style O
of O
running O
a O
kitchen O
was O
state O
of O
the O
art. O
But O
it O
had O
already O
come O
to O
seem O
counterproductive, O
disrespectful O
and O
unprofessional O
long O
before O
his O
death. O
In O
retrospect, O
the O
internal O
forces O
that O
he O
gave O
vent O
to O
when O
he O
screamed O
at O
his O
cooks O
must O
have O
also O
tormented O
Mr. O
Robuchon. O
For O
most O
of O
his O
career O
he O
was O
restless, O
unsatisfied. O
At O
51, O
he O
tried O
to O
retire; O
of O
course, O
it O
didn't O
last. O
In O
2003 O
he O
returned, O
and O
this O
time O
he O
seemed O
determined O
not O
to O
give O
the O
Michelin O
inspectors O
what O
they O
wanted. O
L'Atelier B-EST
de I-EST
Joël I-EST
Robuchon I-EST
, O
his O
comeback, O
was O
staged O
in O
a O
former O
sushi B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
in O
Paris. B-LOC
He O
retained O
the O
basic O
setup. O
Diners O
sat O
at O
a O
counter, O
and O
rather O
than O
nigiri B-FOOD
and O
maki, O
they O
ate O
his O
spoonable O
pommes O
purées O
and O
langoustines O
fried O
inside O
a O
single O
leaf O
of O
paper-thin O
pastry. O
There O
were O
no O
tablecloths, O
no O
chandeliers, O
no O
elaborately O
carved O
and O
upholstered O
chairs O
that O
might O
have O
come O
from O
a O
garage O
sale O
at O
Versailles. O
Food O
was O
cooked O
behind O
the O
counter O
by O
chefs O
dressed O
in O
the O
same O
black O
tunics O
the O
servers O
wore. O
Sometimes O
the O
chefs O
even O
placed O
the O
dish O
in O
front O
of O
the O
diner. O
The O
French O
daily O
Le O
Figaro O
summed O
up O
the O
general O
reaction O
when O
it O
proclaimed, O
"C'est O
une O
revolution!" O
If O
you O
think O
the O
Figaro O
was O
overreacting, O
it's O
because O
the O
revolution O
succeeded. O
Today, O
expensive O
dining O
is O
more O
likely O
to O
mean O
stools O
and O
a O
counter O
than O
dining O
tables O
on O
a O
sea O
of O
carpeting. O
The O
trappings O
that O
Mr. O
Robuchon O
stripped O
away O
-- O
the O
linens, O
the O
large O
dining O
rooms, O
the O
kitchens O
kept O
out O
of O
sight O
-- O
were O
not O
just O
costly O
to O
maintain O
but, O
by O
that O
point, O
increasingly O
off-putting, O
especially O
to O
younger O
diners. O
Today O
we O
don't O
expect O
-- O
or O
even O
want O
-- O
carpeted, O
hushed O
spaces O
when O
we O
go O
out O
for O
meticulously O
prepared O
food. O
Mr. O
Robuchon O
was O
not O
the O
only O
chef O
of O
that O
era O
hoping O
to O
add O
to O
the O
restaurant O
experience O
by O
means O
of O
subtraction. O
In O
the O
same O
year, O
Paul O
Kahan O
and O
Donnie O
Madia O
opened O
Avec O
in O
Chicago, O
a O
long O
skinny O
restaurant O
dominated O
by O
its O
counter. O
Sitting O
on O
a O
bar O
stool O
was O
synonymous O
with O
eating O
at O
the O
chef O
David O
Chang's O
Momofuku O
restaurants O
in O
the O
first O
few O
years O
of O
his O
career, O
from O
Noodle O
Bar O
in O
2004, O
to O
Ssam O
bar O
in O
2006, O
to O
Ko O
in O
2008. O
The O
project O
of O
burying O
the O
old-fashioned O
signifiers O
of O
luxury O
and O
replacing O
them O
with O
new O
ones O

in O
fact, O
one O
of O
the O
major O
themes O
pursued O

over O

past O
15 O
years. O
But O
nobody O
made O
a O
splash O

like O
Mr. O

Flynn O

in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
three O
years O
ago O
as O
the O
chef O
of O
a O
pop-up B-TYPE
restaurant, I-TYPE
Eureka. B-EST
He O
was O
16 O
at O
the O
time, O
but O
he'd O
been O
charging O
money O
for O
tasting O
menus O
since O
he O
was O
13, O
running O
an O
early O
version O
of O
Eureka B-EST
in O
his O
mother's O
house O
in O
the O
San B-LOC
Fernando I-LOC
Valley I-LOC
in O
California. B-LOC
Earlier O
this O
year O
he O
opened O
a O
restaurant O
on O
the O
Lower B-LOC
East I-LOC
Side I-LOC
that O
is O
meant O
to O
be O
permanent, O
or O
as O
permanent O
as O
any O
business O
venture O
in O
Manhattan B-LOC
can O
be. O
This O
one O
is O
called O
Gem, B-EST
which O
if O
nothing O
else O
proves O
he's O
better O
at O
choosing O
names O
now O
that O
he's O
19. O
I O
haven't O
yet O
seen O
the O
new O
documentary O
about O
him, O
"Chef O
Flynn," O
but O
over O
the O
past O
six O
years O
my O
media O
diet O
has O
not O
been O
lacking O
in O
news O
about O
Mr. O
McGarry's O
productive O
adolescent O
years. O
I O
first O
learned O
about O
him O
from O
a O
brief O
New O
Yorker O
piece O
written O
when O
he O
was O
13, O
by O
which O
time O
he O
had O
made O
many O
of O
the O
recipes O
in O
"The O
French O
Laundry O
Cookbook" O
and O
cooked O
for O
a O
week O
at O
Eleven B-EST
Madison I-EST
Park. I-EST
He O
was O
working O
several O
days O
a O
week O
in O
a O
Los B-LOC
Angeles I-LOC
restaurant O
and O
had O
apprenticed O
at O
Next B-EST
and O
Alinea B-EST
by O
15, O
when O
he O
was O
the O
subject O
of O
a O
Times O
Magazine O
article O
. O
When O
he O
moved O
himself O
and O
his O
pop-up B-TYPE
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
at O
16, O
I O
read O
that O
his O
cooking O
was O
influenced O
by O
his O
time O
in O
the O
kitchens O
of O
Maaemo B-EST
in O
Norway B-LOC
and O
Geranium B-EST
in O
Denmark. B-LOC
Still, O
as O
I O
walked O
into O
Gem B-EST
the O
first O
time O
I O
was O
wondering, O
at O
some O
level, O
whether O
everyone O
had O
been O
too O
polite O
to O
tell O
him O
that O
his O
brownies B-FOOD
needed O
more O
time O
in O
the O
oven. O
Of O
course, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
answer O
to O
that O
before O
you O
buy O
advance O
tickets O
for O
the O
eight- O
to O
12-course O
meal O
at O
$155 O
a O
person, O
the O
only O
way O
to O
reserve O
a O
seat. O
But O
it O
doesn't O
take O
more O
than O
a O
few O
minutes O
at O
Gem B-EST
to O
see O
that O
the O
adults O
weren't O
just O
humoring O
Mr. O
McGarry. O
His O
cooking O
is O
nuanced, O
his O
plating O
is O
often O
lyrical O
and O
the O
flavors, O
at O
least O
this O
spring O
and O
summer, O
have O
been O
delicate, O
subtle O
and O
very O
fresh. O
The O
vegetables B-FOOD
and O
fruits B-FOOD
he O
uses O
in O
profusion O
look O
and O
taste O
as O
if O
they O
had O
dropped O
off O
the O
vine O
right O
on O
to O
the O
hand-spun, O
earth-toned O
ceramic O
dishes. O
My O
favorite O
Gem B-EST
dish O
so O
far, O
delicate O
and O
self-assured, O
was O
a O
morsel O
or O
two O
of O
grilled B-DISH
king I-DISH
crab I-DISH
legs I-DISH
lightly O
glazed O
with O
rose B-FOOD
petal I-FOOD
miso I-FOOD
and O
set O
beside O
soft O
chamomile-scented B-FOOD
potatoes I-FOOD
for O
ballast, O
red O
currants B-FOOD
for O
zing O
and O
some O
fluttering O
rose B-FOOD
petals I-FOOD
on O
top O
for O
the O
heck O
of O
it. O
A O
close O
rival O
was O
the O
chilled O
bowl O
of O
barely O
vinegared B-DISH
mackerel I-DISH
interwoven O
with O
grilled B-FOOD
cucumbers, I-FOOD
sliced O
plums B-FOOD
and O
salty O
red O
dabs O
of O
mashed O
fermented B-FOOD
plums. I-FOOD
The O
harmonies O
were O
right O
on O
key, O
with O
a O
Japanese B-CUISINE
mood O
that O
didn't O
cross O
the O
line O
into O
outright O
imitation. O
White B-FOOD
asparagus, I-FOOD
an O
ingredient O
that O
seems O
to O
flummox O
some O
American B-CUISINE
kitchens, O
was O
subjected O
to O
a O
wonderful O
treatment, O
patiently O
browned O
and O
basted O
in O
butter, B-FOOD
then O
finished O
with O
a O
reduced B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
jus I-FOOD
that O
had O
a O
glimmer O
of O
vadouvan B-FOOD
in O
it O
somewhere. O
Strewing O
the O
plate O
with O
tender, O
pale-green O
pine B-FOOD
needles I-FOOD
seemed O
like O
an O
affectation O
at O
first, O
but O
their O
flavor O
lifted O
and O
brightened O
the O
whole O
package. O
Mr. O
McGarry O
does O
fine O
work O
with O
deeper O
flavors, O
too. O
Each O
menu O

in O
a O
complicated, O

best O

Back O

the O
family O
home, O

at O
the O
Eureka B-EST

Mr. O

used O

In O

You O
couldn't O
ask O
for O
a O
more O
refreshing O
course O
on O
a O
hot O
summer O
night, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
it's O
clear O
that O
he O
has O
room O
to O
grow O
as O
a O
pastry O
chef. O
Dessert O
is O
served O
on O
low O
coffee O
tables O
in O
a O
loungey O
space O
called O
the O
Living B-EST

which O
by O

doubles O
as O
a O
cafe B-TYPE
selling O

Rousting O
diners O
from O
their O
tables O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
(called, O
aptly O
enough, O
the O
Dining B-EST
Room), I-EST
probably O
seemed O
like O
a O
good O
idea O
on O
paper, O
but O
in O
reality O
it's O
a O
bit O
silly. O
It's O
one O
of O
several O
hiccups O
that O
keep O
a O
meal O
at O
Gem B-EST
from O
gliding O
smoothly O
along. O
Servers O
may O
shoot O
their O
cuffs O
before O
fiddling O
with O
some O
small O
detail O
of O
the O
table O
setting, O
a O
fussiness O
that O
is O
not O
in O
keeping O
with O
the O
graceful, O
relaxed O
tone O
of O
the O
cooking. O
Wine O
glasses O
could O
sit O
empty O
for O
long O
stretches O
and O
the O
wines B-FOOD
themselves, O
both O
whites B-FOOD
and O
reds, B-FOOD
were O
almost O
always O
too O
warm. O
That O
Mr. O
Flynn O
is O
more O
polished O
as O
a O
chef O
than O
a O
restaurateur O
is O
understandable. O
He O
may O
need O
a O
more O
experienced O
partner O
to O
straighten O
out O
the O
dining O
room, O
and O
to O
help O
him O
edit O
the O
menus, O
too. O
With O
each O
meal, O
I O
had O
the O
sense O
there O
were O
at O
least O
two O
superfluous O
courses, O
and O
occasionally O
Mr. O
McGarry O
seems O
to O
be O
straining O
as O
he O
reaches O
for O
the O
sort O
of O
razzle-dazzle O
you'd O
get O
at O
Alinea B-EST
or O
Eleven B-EST
Madison I-EST
Park. I-EST
An O
elaborate O
lobster B-FOOD
course O
one O
night O
looked O
amazing, O
but O
wasn't. O
An O
attempt O
at O
eggplant B-DISH
carnitas, I-DISH
with O
an O
underseasoned O
salsa B-FOOD
of O
green B-FOOD
strawberries I-FOOD
and O
a O
charred, O
papery O
tortilla, B-FOOD
was O
enough O
to O
make O
you O
wish O
Mr. O
McGarry O
had O
eaten O
more O
tacos B-FOOD
before O
he O
left O
California. O
At O
times O
Mr. O
McGarry O
seems O
like O
a O
creative-writing O
student O
who O
fills O
his O
pages O
with O
footnotes O
because O
David O
Foster O
Wallace O
did O
it. O
It's O
too O
bad O
that O
he O
came O
of O
age O
in O
an O
era O
when O
many O
people O
believe O
that O
tasting O
menus O
are O
the O
highest O
form O
of O
kitchen O
artistry. O
Like O
the O
style O
of O
"Infinite O
Jest," O
those O
menus O
have O
to O
be O
the O
result O
of O
ideas O
that O
can't O
be O
contained O
any O
other O
way; O
they're O
not O
a O
blank O
space O
to O
be O
filled O
in. O
Mr. O
McGarry O
obviously O
learned O
a O
lot O
from O
his O
mentors, O
but O
he O
can O
cook O
in O
his O
own O
voice O
now, O
and O
it O
may O
be O
time O
to O
leave O
his O
idols O
behind. O

were O
downing O
shots O
of O

before O
that O

cool, O
and O
kept O
going O
after O

The O
East O
Village O
is O
a O
less O
interesting O
place O
without O
Surma. O
But O
the O
chain-store O
monoculture O
that O
might O
have O
seemed O
inevitable O
as O
the O
Ukrainian O
community O
fell O
away O
hasn't O
been O
the O
neighborhood's O
fate. O
Not O
yet. O
New O
Chinese O
restaurants O
have O
sprung O
up O
in O
the O
area O
over O
the O
past O
few O
years O
faster O
than O
the O
old O
Eastern O
European O
business O
have O
died O
off. O
In O
January, O
one O
of O
them O
moved O
into O
Surma's O
old O
address. O
It's O
called O
Le O
Sia, O
and O
it's O
thriving. O
Walk O
in O
any O
weekend O
night O
between O
6 O
and O
9, O
and O
a O
small O
throng O
will O
be O
waiting O
for O
seats O
by O
the O
entrance, O
below O
the O
kayaks O
that O
are O
stowed O
up O
by O
the O
ceiling O
as O
if O
this O
were O
the O
garage O
of O
somebody's O
summer O
house. O
During O
the O
week, O
Le O
Sia O
takes O
reservations, O
but O
that O
doesn't O
ease O
the O
demand O
by O
much. O
On O
some O
nights, O
the O
crowd O
is O
almost O
exclusively O
Chinese O
people O
of O
college O
age O
or O
slightly O
older, O
many O
of O
them O
lured O
out O
of O
their O
nearby O
New O
York O
University O
dorm O
rooms O
for O
steaming O
pans O
of O
shellfish, O
especially O
Le O
Sia's O
specialty, O
crayfish. O
Although O
a O
server O
there O
described O
the O
restaurant O
to O
me O
as O
"Cajun O
seafood," O
Le O
Sia O
is O
not O
serving O
Acadiana-style O
crayfish. O
Nor O
is O
it O
seasoning O
crayfish O
with O
the O
magical, O
butter-drenched O
combinations O
of O
Southeast O
Asian O
and O
Louisiana O
flavors O
like O
Thai O
basil-tamarind O
and O
lemongrass-ginger O
that O
were O
spawned O
in O
Vietnamese O
kitchens O
along O
Bellaire O
Boulevard O
in O
Houston. O
Yang O
Liu O
and O
Tianye O
Chen, O
who O
own O
the O
restaurant O
along O
with O
its O
chef, O
Zac O
Zhang, O
are O
following O
a O
separate, O
unbuttered O
Chinese O
tradition O
that O
they O
enjoyed O
before O
moving O
to O
the O
United O
States. O
It's O
a O
fairly O
young O
one, O
as O
Chinese O
food O
traditions O
go. O
Crayfish, O
or O
xiaolongxia, O
arrived O
in O
China O
sometime O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
20th O
century. O
After O
regarding O
the O
novel O
ingredient O
warily O
for O
a O
few O
decades, O
cooks O
built O
a O
cuisine O
around O
it. O
Eaters O
took O
to O
it O
so O
enthusiastically O
that O
by O
2016 O
the O
Chinese O
crayfish O
industry O
employed O
five O
million O
people O
and O
was O
worth O
$27 O
billion. O
One O
major O
farming O
center O
is O
Hubei O
province, O
which O
recently O
unveiled O
a O
59-foot-long O
crayfish O
sculpture O
that O
is O
said O
to O
be O
the O
world's O
largest. O
Its O
bright-red O
pincers O
are O
raised O
victoriously O
. O
Le O
Sia O
cooks O
crayfish O
and O
other O
shellfish O
-- O
lobster, O
shrimp, O
and O
Dungeness O
and O
snow O
crabs O
-- O
by O
boiling O
them O
first O
and O
then O
clacking O
them O
around O
in O
a O
hot O
wok O
with O
one O
of O
seven O
sauces. O
Each O
sauce O
can O
be O
further O
customized O
to O
one O
of O
four O
chile-heat O
levels, O
from O
mild O
to O
"fire." O
Whatever O
combination O
of O
sea O
animal O
and O
seasoning O
you O
ask O
for, O
it O
will O
arrive O
at O
the O
table O
almost O
before O
the O
words O
have O
left O
your O
mouth. O
For O
many O
customers O
the O
go-to O
order O
seems O
to O
be O
"crayfish O
hot O
and O
spicy, O
spicy." O
Hot O
and O
spicy O
sauce, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
make O
out, O
is O
based O
on O
soy, O
miso O
and O
garlic; O
the O
firepower O
comes O
from O
sliced O
pickled O
chiles, O
but O
the O
soy O
and O
miso O
give O
it O
a O
muscular O
heft. O
It O
may O
be O
my O
favorite O
Le O
Sia O
sauce, O
although O
it's O
a O
close O
call O
between O
that O
and O
its O
near O
relative, O
"numbing O
and O
spicy," O
which O
is O
propelled O
into O
tingling O
ma O
la O
territory O
by O
Sichuan O
peppercorns. O
I'm O
fascinated O
by O
the O
kimchi-lime O
sauce, O
which O
conforms O
to O
no O
seafood-boil O
tradition O
I O
know O
of; O
its O
flavor O
is O
angular, O
hybridized, O
invigorating O
and O
not O
as O
fiery O
as O
you O
might O
expect. O
The O
garlic O
sauce O
hits O
just O
one O
note, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
no O
prizes O
for O
guessing O
which O
one. O
There O
is O
also O
a O
sauce O
called O
"thirteen O
special-flavor O
herbal O
spices." O
I O
tried O
it O
twice, O
with O
wildly O
divergent O
outcomes. O
The O
first O
time O
it O
was O
a O
wonderful, O
nuanced O
aromatic O
blend O
of O
expected O
and O
unexpected O
Chinese O
spices. O
On O
a O
second O
try, O
it O
tasted O
like O
spiced O
seawater. O
The O
star O
ingredient O
can O
vary, O
too. O
Honesty O
compels O
me O
to O
note O
that O
the O
California O
crayfish O
Le O
Sia O
has O
been O
serving O
lately O
have O
a O
sweeter, O
finer O
flavor O
than O
the O
ones O
it O
was O
getting O
from O
Louisiana O
in O
the O
late O
spring. O
This O
will O
no O
doubt O
cost O
me O
some O
friends O
in O
New O
Orleans. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
those O
friendships O
are O
already O
on O
the O
rocks O
over O
my O
newspaper's O
insistence O
on O
calling O
the O
crustacean O
in O
question O
crayfish, O
rather O
than O
crawfish. O
Le O
Sia's O
shrimp, O
in O
my O
encounters O
with O
it, O
was O
bland O
and O
powdery. O
Dungeness O
crab O
arrived O
overcooked, O
the O
meat O
desperately O
stuck O
to O
the O
shell. O
Snow O
crab O
was O
much O
better: O
sweet O
and O
flaky O
in O
the O
legs, O
although O
the O
white O
bits O
at O
the O
joints O
were O
slightly O
broken O
down. O
But O
every O
time O
I O
ordered O
lobster O
it O
was O
juicy O
and O
sweet. O
It O
may O
be O
the O
safest O
choice, O
although O
I O
haven't O
completely O
given O
up O
on O
the O
crayfish O
entirely. O
At O
$15 O
for O
what O
looks O
like O
a O
very O
generous O
pound, O
it's O
worth O
taking O
a O
chance. O
As O
for O
the O
risks O
of O
eating O
without O
a O
pair O
of O
plastic O
gloves, O
kept O
in O
plentiful O
supply O
in O
sealed O
pouches O
on O
the O
table, O
or O
one O
of O
the O
synthetic-fabric O
black O
bibs O
with O
their O
swirling O
red O
claw-and-antenna O
designs, O
that O
is O
up O
to O
you. O
A O
vast O
stretch O
of O
the O
menu O
is O
taken O
up O
by O
northern-Chinese O
skewers O
of O
vegetables O
and O
animal O
parts O
of O
many O
kinds. O
These O
tend O
to O
arrive O
even O
faster O
than O
the O
other O
dishes, O
if O
that's O
possible. O
They O
are O
not O
bad O
as O
quick, O
casual O
snacks, O
particularly O
the O
"King O
of O
Kings" O
hot O
dog, O
carved O
into O
pink O
lobes O
that O
stick O
out O
like O
cat O
tongues. O
But O
other O
skewers O
suggest O
an O
assembly-line O
approach O
that O
you O
don't O
find O
among O
the O
better O
street-corner O
grills O
in O
Flushing, O
Queens. O
The O
application O
of O
the O
cumin O
and O
red O
pepper O
seasoning O
is O
often O
just O
as O
heavy O
on O
delicate O
ingredients O
as O
full-flavored O
ones, O
and O
the O
grilling O
times O
don't O
seem O
to O
be O
monitored O
closely. O
Tiny O
squid O
legs, O
lamb O
kidneys O
and O
enoki O
mushrooms O
were O
all O
dry O
and O
overdone. O
So O
was O
a O
main O
course O
of O
quail, O
purportedly O
smoked O
over O
lemongrass O
and O
pine O
cones. O
Wok-fried O
clams O
in O
garlic O
sauce O
were O
delicious, O
though, O
as O
were O
many O
of O
the O
cold O
appetizers, O
like O
a O
rose O
formation O
of O
pickled O
radish O
slices; O
smashed O
cucumbers O
in O
garlic O
sauce; O
and O
Harbin O
sausage. O
A O
specialty O
of O
northern O
China, O
Harbin O
sausage O
immigrated O
there O
from O
Eastern O
Europe. O
Pink O
and O
dense O
with O
smoked O
pork O
and O
fat, O
it O
is O
deeply O
reminiscent O
of O
kielbasa. O
It's O
right O
at O
home O
in O
the O
East O
Village. O

grow O
bigger, O
boozier, O
louder, O
more O
theatrical. O
If O
Nobu B-EST
did O
not O
exactly O
invent O
the O
Asian O
Party O
Temple O
restaurant O
genre, O
it O
certainly O
drew O
the O
blueprints. O
At O
these O
new O
Nobus, B-EST
Mr. O
Matsuhisa's O
food O
was O
still O
a O
major O
event, O
but O
not O
necessarily O
the O
main O
event. O
And O
the O
question O
was O
not O
just O
whether O
you O
felt O
like O
eating O
at O
Nobu B-EST
but O
whether O
you O
felt O
like O
being O
at O
Nobu. B-EST
The O
Malibu B-LOC
location O
in O
particular O
has O
a O
reputation O
for O
intense O
good-time O
vibes O
that O
can O
drive O
away O
customers O
who O
merely O
want O
to O
eat. O
All O
this O
was O
encapsulated O
for O
me O
in O
two O
brief O
scenes O
from O
my O
recent O
meals O
at O
Nobu B-EST
Downtown I-EST
and O
Nobu B-EST
Fifty I-EST
Seven I-EST
. O
The O
first O
episode O
took O
place O
while O
I O
was O
sitting O
at O
the O
sushi B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
of O
Nobu B-EST
Downtown. I-EST
This O
location, O
inside O
the O
old B-LOC
AT&T I-LOC
tower I-LOC
on I-LOC
Lower I-LOC
Broadway, I-LOC
is O
theoretically O
the O
successor O
to O
the O
first O
Nobu; O
it O
opened O
last O
year O
a O
few O
weeks O
after O
the O
original O
closed. O
The O
sushi B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
was O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
TriBeCa B-LOC
restaurant. O
The O
chefs O
behind O
it O
prepared O
or O
touched O
at O
least O
half O
the O
food, O
and O
seats O
there O
were O
so O
coveted O
that O
during O
the O
1990s, O
when O
even O
celebrities O
complained O
about O
how O
hard O
it O
was O
to O
get O
in, O
a O
mostly O
sushi O
restaurant O
called O
Next B-EST
Door I-EST
Nobu I-EST
was O
opened O
simply O
to O
contain O
the O
overflow. O
(It O
closed O
last O
year, O
too, O
and O
won't O
be O
replaced.) O
At O
Nobu B-EST
Downtown, I-EST
the O
upstairs O
sushi O
counter O
is O
on O
the O
far O
side O
of O
the O
cocktail B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
that O
the O
design O
firm O
Rockwell O
Group O
slipped O
in O
among O
the O
enormous O
fluted O
limestone O
columns O
that O
fill O
the O
building's O
ground O
floor O
like O
a O
petrified O
forest. O
I O
had O
just O
eaten O
a O
piece O
of O
Japanese B-FOOD
scallop I-FOOD
sushi I-FOOD
with O
a O
dangerous O
streak O
of O
wasabi B-FOOD
when O
an O
animated O
group O
of O
four O
new O
arrivals O
appeared O
next O
to O
me. O
The O
sushi O
chefs O
eyed O
them O
warily, O
because O
they O
appeared O
to O
intend O
to O
cluster O
around O
a O
single O
stool, O
the O
way O
people O
do O
at O
a O
bar. O
Soon O
it O
became O
apparent O
that O
they O
thought O
they O
were O
at O
the O
bar. O
But O
the O
people O
they O
mistook O
for O
bartenders O
were O
all O
busy O
slicing O
raw O
fish, O
so O
eventually O
the O
group O
moved O
on O
to O
look O
for O
somebody O
to O
make O
them O
a O
drink. O
Moments O
like O
this O
didn't O
tend O
to O
happen O
at O
the O
original O
Nobu, B-EST
but O
they O
do O
bring O
Nobu B-EST
Downtown I-EST
in O
line O
with O
Nobu B-EST
Fifty I-EST
Seven. I-EST
In O
business O
on O
57th O
Street O
since O
2005, O
Nobu B-EST
Fifty I-EST
Seven I-EST
is O
another O
two-story O
proposition. O
Between O
5 O
and O
7 O
p.m. O
its O
ground-floor O
lounge O
acts O
on O
young O
Midtown B-LOC
professionals I-LOC
like O
the O
fishing O
nets O
evoked O
by O
Rockwell O
Group's O
design. O
At O
the O
time O
the O
second O
scene O
took O
place, O
the O
bartenders O
looked O
as O
if O
they O
were O
struggling O
not O
to O
get O
caught. O
My O
cocktail, O
a O
Negroni-esque B-DISH
thing I-DISH
with I-DISH
sake I-DISH
in O
it O
that O
was O
ferried O
to O
my O
upstairs O
table O
from O
the O
downstairs O
bar, O
was O
neither O
shaken O
nor O
stirred; O
it O
was, O
in O
fact, O
almost O
hot. O
While O
I O
was O
waiting O
for O
the O
cocktail O
to O
be O
cooled O
by O
its O
single O
ice O
cube, O
a O
server O
was O
struggling O
to O
open O
a O
bottle O
of O
Champagne B-FOOD
for O
a O
table O
of O
at O
least O
10 O
men O
next O
to O
me. O
When O
the O
cork O
came O
out, O
he O
managed O
to O
spray O
the O
room O
in O
a O
manner O
usually O
seen O
in O
the O
Super O
Bowl O
champions' O
locker O
room. O
Everybody O
nearby O
got O
a O
little O
wet, O
including O
me O
and O
my O
guests, O
but O
nobody O
seemed O
to O
notice. O
Servers O
at O
both O
addresses O
have O
the O
brisk, O
well-drilled, O
impersonal O
and O
slightly O
numbed O
quality O
that O
comes O
of O
waiting O
on O
hundreds O
of O
people O
a O
day. O
At O
Nobu B-EST
Fifty-Seven, I-EST
one O
told O
me, O
"Our O
menu O
is O
kaiseki O
style, O
so O
it's O
like O
tapas. O
Everything O
is O
meant O
for O
sharing." O
I O
must O
have O
looked O
confused O
because O
he O
added, O
"Some O
dishes O
are O
going O
to O
be O
bigger O
than O
others." O
Nobu B-EST
Fifty-Seven I-EST
was O
given O
three O
stars O
in O
its O
last O
New O
York O
Times O
review O
, O
by O
Frank O
Bruni O
in O
2005. O
That's O
what O
Ruth O
Reichl O
gave O
the O
original O
in O
1995. O
After O
three O
recent O
visits O
to O
each O
location, O
I O
decided O
that, O
apart O
from O
minor O
menu O
variations, O
any O
qualitative O
difference O
in O
the O
food O
between O
the O
two O
branches O
is O
too O
subtle O
for O
me O
to O
make O
out. O
The O
chefs O
uptown O
are O
Taku O
Sato O
and O
Matt O
Hoyle. O
Downtown O
was O
led O
by O
Ricky O
Estrellado O
and O
Ryo O
Hasegawa O
until O
June, O
when O
Mr. O
Estrellado O
died O
suddenly. O
His O
successor O
has O
not O
been O
named. O
Both O
kitchens O
are O
models O
of O
superior O
ingredient O
shopping O
and O
consistent O
performance. O
When O
those O
classic O
Nobu B-EST
dishes O
appear, O
they O
will O
be O
exactly O
like O
the O
last O
time O
you O
had O
them. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
mayo-bathed B-DISH
fried I-DISH
shrimp, I-DISH
that O
may O
not O
be O
an O
entirely O
good O
thing. O
And O
I O
still O
think O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
caviar B-FOOD
that O
crowns O
tuna, B-FOOD
or O
salmon, B-FOOD
or O
yellowtail B-FOOD
tartare I-FOOD
gets O
elbowed O
out O
of O
the O
way O
by O
the O
wasabi-soy B-FOOD
sauce. I-FOOD
But O
the O
tiradito, B-DISH
slices O
of O
yellowtail B-FOOD
squirted O
with O
lemon B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
yuzu I-FOOD
juice, I-FOOD
then O
dotted O
with O
puréed B-FOOD
rocoto I-FOOD
pepper, I-FOOD
is O
always O
wonderfully O
bracing. O
The O
candylike O
black B-DISH
cod I-DISH
is O
as O
hard O
to O
deny O
as O
ever, O
even O
if O
the O
extra O
sweetening O
Mr. O
Matsuhisa O
gives O
this O
traditional O
Japanese B-CUISINE
dish O
strikes O
me O
as O
somewhat O
shameless. O
The O
sashimi B-DISH
salad I-DISH
and O
the O
lobster B-DISH
shiitake I-DISH
salads I-DISH
are O
both O
better O
than O
any O
salad O
from O
a O
global O
chain O
has O
the O
right O
to O
be. O
I O
don't O
know O
who O
orders O
the O
dishes O
marked O
Nobu O
Now, O
but O
I O
tried O
a O
few. O
Umami B-DISH
Chilean I-DISH
sea I-DISH
bass: I-DISH
not O
worth O
it, O
even O
for O
the O
slightly O
exotic O
return O
of O
a O
fish O
that O
hasn't O
been O
seen O
much O
since O
the O
'90s. O
Kumamoto B-DISH
shooters: I-DISH
a O
thrilling O
series O
of O
flavors O
that O
will O
recall O
the O
way O
you O
felt O
the O
first O
time O
you O
ate O
at O
Nobu. B-EST
Michele O
Goldsmith's O
desserts, O
served O
both O
uptown O
and O
downtown, O
are O
modern O
and O
playful O
and O
don't O
try O
too O
hard O
to O
follow O
the O
theme, O
whatever O
that O
is. O
Over O
the O
years, O
the O
Hudson B-EST
Street I-EST
Nobu I-EST
became O
something O
unusual, O
a O
restaurant O
that O
could O
serve O
tourists O
and O
families O
from O
around O
the O
corner O
with O
equal O
aplomb. O
But O
a O
meal O
at O
Nobu B-EST
is O
still O
among O
the O
best, O
although O
not O
the O
cheapest, O
ways O
to O
introduce O
children O
to O
raw B-FOOD
fish. I-FOOD
And O
sitting O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
can O
still O
provide O
the O
intimacy O
that O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
place O
lacks. O
The O
chefs O
behind O
the O
counter O
may O
not O
draw O
the O
kinmedai O
cultists O
who O
flock O
to O
Sushi B-EST
Zo I-EST
or O
Sushi B-EST
Ginza I-EST
Onodera I-EST
, O
but O
they O
know O
what O
they're O
doing, O
and O
they O
light O
up O
when O
they O
get O
a O
customer O
who O
can O
tell. O

Considering O
the O
history, O
the O
influence, O
the O
depth O
and O
the O
sophistication O
of O
Iranian B-CUISINE
food, O
it O
has O
always O
seemed O
unfair O
that O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
has O
so O
few O
places O
to O
eat O
it. O
Unfair O
to O
the O
cuisine O
and O
unfair O
to O
would-be O
eaters. O
If O
you O
want O
a O
symbol O
for O
the O
state O
of O
the O
cuisine O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City, I-LOC
Taste B-EST
of I-EST
Persia I-EST
NYC I-EST
will O
fit O
the O
bill. O
Until O
recently O
I O
might O
have O
called O
it O
the O
city's O
most O
promising O
Iranian B-CUISINE
kitchen, O
if O
the O
word O
kitchen O
weren't O
such O
a O
stretch. O
Taste B-EST
of I-EST
Persia I-EST
is O
a O
takeout O
operation O
squeezed O
into O
the O
front O
window O
of O
a O
Chelsea B-LOC
pizzeria, B-TYPE
except O
during O
the O
two O
months O
when O
fire O
damage O
forced O
it O
to O
take O
up O
temporary O
residence O
in O
a O
holiday O
market. O
It O
does O
show O
off O
some O
of O
the O
pleasures O
of O
the O
Iranian B-CUISINE
table, O
but O
not O
the O
table O
itself. O
So O
a O
new O
Brooklyn B-LOC
restaurant O
called O
Sofreh B-EST
, O
which O
joined O
the O
Iranian B-CUISINE
ranks O
in O
June, O
would O
have O
caused O
a O
stir O
even O
if O
the O
cooking O
weren't O
quite O
as O
good O
as O
it O
is. O
The O
dining O
room O
is O
spare O
and O
modern, O
with O
exposed O
rafters, O
molded O
plywood O
chairs O
and O
shades O
of O
soft O
white. O
You O
have O
to O
look O
carefully O
to O
see O
the O
breaks O
with O
garden-variety O
minimalism, O
like O
the O
echoes O
of O
medieval O
arches O
behind O
the O
bar O
and O
the O
Persian O
calligraphy O
carved O
into O
the O
plaster O
in O
the O
back, O
where O
a O
small O
deck O
hangs O
above O
a O
garden. O
Minimalism O
surrenders O
entirely O
in O
the O
bathroom, O
papered O
in O
a O
pulpy O
collage O
of O
posters O
from O
pre-revolutionary O
Iranian O
cinema. O
All O
summer, O
Iranian O
expats O
and O
hopeful O
fans O
of O
Iranian B-CUISINE
cuisine O
have O
been O
filing O
in, O
armed O
with O
questions: O
Does O
the O
saffron B-FOOD
rice I-FOOD
stand O
high O
in O
voluminous O
heaps O
of O
discrete O
grains? O
Are O
nigella B-FOOD
seeds I-FOOD
embedded O
in O
the O
dimpled, O
golden O
crusts O
of O
the O
oval O
loaves O
of O
barbari? B-FOOD
Do O
the O
cold O
shards O
of O
sorbet B-FOOD
frozen I-FOOD
around O
threads O
of O
noodles B-FOOD
in O
Sofreh's B-EST
faloodeh B-DISH
contain O
just O
enough O
rose B-FOOD
water I-FOOD
to O
soften O
the O
bite O
of O
lime B-FOOD
syrup? I-FOOD
Check, O
check O

on O
the O
street O
level O
of O
a O
Prospect B-LOC
Heights I-LOC
brownstone O
just O
off O
Flatbush B-LOC
Avenue, I-LOC
and O
the O

is O
largely O
in O
a O
domestic O
mode. O
Nasim O
Alikhani O
, O
who O
owns O
the O
restaurant O
with O
her O
husband, O
Theodore O
Petroulas, O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
menu. O
Ms. O
Alikhani O
has O
never O
worked O
in O
a O
restaurant O
before. O
Rather O
than O
following O
the O
plating O
fashions O
of O
more O
trend-conscious O
chefs, O
she O
models O
the O
cooking O
after O
the O
things O
she O
might O
make O
when O
company O
comes O
over. O
Platoons O
of O
kebabs B-FOOD
dominate O
the O
menus O
of O
other O
Iranian B-CUISINE
restaurants O
around O
town, O
but O
home O
kitchens O
are O
rarely O
built O
with O
vast O
indoor O
grills; O
Sofreh's B-EST
cooking, O
entrusted O
to O
two O
chefs O
named O
Ali O
Saboor O
and O
Soroosh O
Golbabae, O
revolves O
around O
the O
oven O
and O
stovetop. O
A O
loaf O
of O
barbari, B-FOOD
its O
crust O
baked O
to O
a O
Roman-pizza B-FOOD
crackle O
in O
a O
revolving O
oven, O
is O
served O
with O
many O
of O
the O
appetizers, O
and O
it O
is O
always O
gone O
so O
soon O
that O
I O
end O
up O
ordering O
one O
or O
two O
more. O
This O
flatbread B-FOOD
is O
of O
course O
ideal O
for O
tearing O
and O
swishing O
into O
the O
thick O
yogurt B-FOOD
dips, I-FOOD
one O
mixed O
with O
golden B-FOOD
raisins I-FOOD
and O
shredded O
cucumber, B-FOOD
another O
with O
minced O
shallots B-FOOD
and O
chives. B-FOOD
It O
is O
indispensable O
with O
the O
eggplant B-FOOD
mash I-FOOD
enriched O
with O
walnuts, B-FOOD
strained O
yogurt B-FOOD
and O
sweet O
fried B-FOOD
onions. I-FOOD
A O
loaf O
of O
barbari B-FOOD
is O
also O
spread O
with O
herbs B-FOOD
and O
feta O
that O
is O
more O
creamy O
than O
briny. O
Earlier O
in O
the O
summer O
Sofreh O
offered O
an O
appetizer O
of O
dry, O
underseasoned O
beef O
meatballs O
with O
sour O
cherries. O
One O
of O
the O
only O
things O
on O
the O
menu O
that O
was O
hard O
to O
warm O
up O
to, O
it O
has O
been O
replaced O
lately O
by O
beef O
kofte, O
made O
light O
and O
tender O
by O
rice O
and O
stewed O
split O
peas. O
The O
kofte O
sit O
in O
a O
gentle O
saffron-tomato O
sauce O
that O
is O
another O
natural O
partner O
for O
Sofreh's O
bread. O
Ms. O
Alikhani, O
59, O
grew O
up O
in O
the O
sprawling O
desert O
city O
Isfahan, O
and O
moved O
to O
the O
United O
States O
in O
her O
early O
20s. O
For O
years O
she O
cooked O
Iranian O
dishes O
from O
memory, O
and O
it O
would O
be O
decades O
before O
she O
traveled O
back O
to O
Iran O
to O
learn O
more O
about O
its O
food O
in O
preparation O
for O
opening O
Sofreh. O
Her O
version O
of O
ash, O
the O
herb O
and O
whole-wheat O
noodle O
stew, O
stands O
out O
on O
the O
menu O
because O
it O
stays O
so O
close O
to O
tradition. O
Other O
dishes O
show O
the O
acclimatizing O
effect O
of O
New O
York. O
It's O
an O
article O
of O
faith O
for O
chefs O
in O
the O
city O
that O
any O
dish O
can O
be O
improved O
by O
putting O
a O
poached O
egg O
on O
it. O
I'm O
not O
so O
sure O
that O
Sofreh's O
smoked O
eggplant O
halves O
with O
their O
sweet, O
garlic-drenched O
tomato O
sauce O
need O
one, O
though. O
Is O
the O
watermelon O
feta O
salad O
familiar O
from O
restaurants O
that O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
Iran? O
Maybe O
just O
a O
bit, O
but O
Sofreh's O
version O
stands O
out O
for O
its O
intriguing O
sauce O
of O
nigella O
seeds O
crushed O
into O
mint O
oil. O
And O
while O
the O
Shiraz O
salad O
isn't O
chopped O
to O
fine O
bits O
in O
the O
traditional O
way O
that O
makes O
it O
something O
like O
Iran's O
answer O
to O
pico O
de O
gallo, O
its O
sour O
purple O
flecks O
of O
sumac O
distinguish O
it O
from O
the O
herd O
of O
tomato-cucumber O
assemblages. O
The O
menu O
is O
fairly O
concise, O
and O
occasionally O
I O
wished O
that O
it O
plunged O
into O
tradition O
with O
less O
restraint. O
For O
a O
dish O
called O
"catch O
of O
the O
day," O
Ms. O
Alikhani O
has O
adapted O
ghalieh O
mahi, O
a O
tamarind-soured O
stew O
of O
fish O
and O
fresh O
herbs O
from O
southern O
Iran. O
In O
her O
version, O
a O
pan-seared O
hunk O
of O
whitefish O
-- O
halibut O
and O
cod O
have O
taken O
turns O
in O
the O
role O
-- O
is O
set O
over O
a O
long-cooked O
sauce. O
Dark O
with O
caramelized O
onions O
and O
fried O
cilantro O
and O
fresh O
fenugreek O
leaves, O
the O
sauce O
is O
hypnotically O
complex. O
Still, O
a O
sauce O
sitting O
under O
fish O
is O
not O
the O
same O
as O
one O
that O
has O
been O
cooked O
with O
fish O
so O
the O
flavors O
can O
get O
acquainted. O
A O
simple O
flattened O
and O
griddled O
half O
chicken, O
though, O
is O
a O
wonderful O
foil O
for O
a O
topping O
of O
tart O
barberries O
and O
a O
captivating O
sauce O
of O
dried O
Persian O
plums O
and O
saffron. O
And O
there's O
lovely O
simplicity O
to O
the O
braised O
lamb O
shank O
with O
roasted O
garlic O
and O
sizzled O
onions; O
the O
turmeric- O
and O
cinnamon-scented O
sauce O
might O
have O
been O
put O
on O
this O
earth O
to O
be O
spooned O
over O
fluffy O
rice. O
There O
is O
no O
shame O
in O
ending O
the O
meal O
with O
a O
goblet O
of O
thick O
yogurt O
parfait O
with O
jam O
and O
pistachios. O
But O
there O
are O
harder-to-find O
sweets, O
too, O
like O
the O
rose-water O
custard, O
grainy O
with O
rice O
flour, O
transformed O
into O
a O
sort O
of O
tart O
by O
a O
crust O
of O
chopped O
nuts. O
Saffron O
and O
rose-water O
ice O
cream O
is O
luxuriously O
rich O
despite O
a O
few O
stray O
ice O
crystals. O
And O
the O
faloodeh, O
one O
of O
the O
world's O
oldest O
frozen O
desserts, O
will O
put O
to O
rest O
all O
doubts O
about O
the O
wisdom O
of O
embedding O
sorbet O
in O
a O
nest O
of O
vermicelli, O
if O
there O
were O
any O
doubts O
to O
begin O
with. O

"People O
always O
say O
summer O
is O
not O
a O
good O
time O
for O
sushi," B-FOOD
Derek O
Wilcox O
said. O
"I O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
they're O
talking O
about." O
Early O
evening, O
the O
end O
of O
August, O
and O
the O
granite O
TriBeCa B-LOC
sidewalks O
outside O
Shoji B-EST
at O
69 B-LOC
Leonard I-LOC
Street I-LOC
were O
deserted. O
The O
restaurant O
was O
empty, O
too. O
I O
sat O
alone O
on O
one O
side O
of O
the O
counter, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
stood O
Mr. O
Wilcox, O
alone, O
as O
he O
usually O
is O
even O
when O
customers O
occupy O
all O
12 O
chairs. O
Although O
assistants O
work O
in O
the O
wings, O
the O
restaurant O
is O
essentially O
a O
one-man O
show. O
In O
the O
broad O
view, O
having O
the O
place O
to O
myself O
was O
unjust. O
In O
the O
year O
since O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
took O
over O
the O
restaurant O
-- O
at O
first O
his O
work O
there O
was O
termed O
a O
residency O
or O
pop-up, O
but O
in O
June O
the O
owner, O
Idan O
Elkon, O
announced O
that O
he'd O
put O
a O
ring O
on O
it O
and O
made O
the O
arrangement O
permanent O
-- O
he O
has O
firmly O
placed O
it O
in O
the O
top O
tier O
of O
the O
city's O
Japanese B-CUISINE
restaurants. O
On O
the O
basis O
of O
sushi B-FOOD
alone, O
Shoji B-EST
has O
few O
plausible O
rivals, O
and O
for O
sushi B-FOOD
embedded O
within O
a O
longer, O
kaiseki-derived O
menu, O
it O
has O
no O
parallel. O
There O
should O
be O
no O
empty O
seats, O
no O
matter O
how O
many O
New O
Yorkers O
are O
off O
lolling O
at O
the O
beach. O
Taking O
a O
selfish O
view, O
though, O
I O
wasn't O
particularly O
unhappy O
to O
be O
the O
only O
customer. O
Mr. O
Wilcox, O
who O
grew O
up O
in O
Virginia, B-LOC
cooked O
at O
a O
kaiseki B-TYPE
restaurant I-TYPE
in O
Kyoto B-LOC
called O
Kikunoi B-EST
for O
seven O
years O
and O
then O
spent O
three O
more O
at O
a O
traditionalist O
sushi B-TYPE
parlor I-TYPE
in O
the O
Ginza B-LOC
district I-LOC
of O
Tokyo. B-LOC
You O
might O
think O
of O
this O
as O
the O
equivalent O
of O
earning O
a O
master's O
degree O
followed O
by O
a O
Ph.D. O
in O
Japanese B-CUISINE
cuisine, O
and O
one O
side O
benefit O
of O
a O
meal O
across O
the O
counter O
from O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
is O
the O
chance O
to O
hear O
what O
he O
learned O
studying O
abroad. O
Show O
some O
curiosity O
and O
you O
could O
get O
a O
short O
education O
in O
the O
mineral-rich O
clay O
used O
by O
potters O
in O
the O
town O
of O
Shigaraki, B-LOC
or O
the O
various O
aliases O
and O
false O
names O
under O
which O
a O
particularly O
delicious, O
pink-fleshed O
fish O
known O
as O
akamutsu B-DISH
in O
Japan B-LOC
travels O
under O
when O
it O
is O
away O
from O
home. O
On O
this O
August O
night, O
I O
was O
about O
to O
get O
a O
two-hour O
schooling O
on O
the O
pleasures O
of O
summer O
sushi. B-FOOD
Mr. O
Wilcox's O
opening O
move O
was O
a O
squiggle O
of O
what O
looked O
like O
short, O
thick O
noodles B-FOOD
and O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
lengths O
of O
chilled O
eggplant; B-FOOD
Mr. O
Wilcox O
had O
given O
them O
a O
cool O
bath O
in O
the O
light O
sauce O
in O
which O
icy O
coils O
of O
somen B-FOOD
noodles I-FOOD
are O
dipped O
in O
summer. O
Laid O
over O
the O
top O
were O
two O
tongues O
of O
bafun O
sea O
urchin, O
a O
species O
with O
the O
color O
of O
a O
nearly O
ripe O
persimmon. O
With O
one O
dish, O
he O
had O
shooed O
away O
the O
heat O
outside, O
shown O
off O
the O
uncanny O
harmony O
of O
urchin O
and O
eggplant, O
and O
introduced O
a O
minor O
theme O
of O
the O
night, O
the O
summer O
urchin O
harvest O
in O
Japan. O
This O
overture O
out O
of O
the O
way, O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
lifted O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
machete. O
This O
was O
a O
hamo O
knife, O
a O
heavy O
swath O
of O
sharp O
steel O
that O
can O
reduce O
the O
daggertooth O
pike O
conger's O
dozens O
of O
tiny O
bones O
to O
edible O
smithereens; O
before O
the O
first O
one O
was O
forged O
in O
the O
19th O
century, O
he O
explained, O
the O
eel O
had O
to O
be O
fully O
cooked O
and O
separated O
from O
its O
skeleton. O
This O
hamo O
would O
be O
quickly O
scorched O
on O
one O
side O
and O
served O
with O
a O
lick O
of O
wasabi O
and O
puréed O
salt-cured O
plums O
thinned O
with O
dashi. O
Sashimi O
came O
next O
in O
the O
form O
of O
shioko, O
or O
kanpachi O
caught O
when O
it O
is O
young O
and O
its O
flavor O
is O
leaner O
and O
softer O
than O
it O
will O
get O
later O
in O
the O
year. O
This O
was O
followed O
by O
a O
local O
fish O
that O
in O
the O
spring O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
had O
told O
me O
he O
didn't O
like, O
striped O
bass. O
He O
had O
been O
working O
with O
it, O
though, O
salting O
it O
overnight O
and O
then O
grilling O
it O
until O
the O
skin O
crackled. O
Now O
I O
don't O
want O
striped O
bass O
cooked O
any O
other O
way. O
After O
this O
was O
Mr. O
Wilcox's O
nod O
to O
the O
kaiseki O
tradition O
known O
as O
takiawase, O
a O
plate O
of O
simmered O
vegetables O
and, O
in O
this O
case, O
seafood: O
a O
small O
potato, O
some O
Japanese O
eggplant, O
a O
crisp O
pink O
ginger O
shoot O
and O
the O
most O
flavorful O
piece O
of O
octopus O
I O
have O
ever O
put O
in O
my O
mouth. O
After O
my O
first O
meal O
at O
Shoji O
I O
learned O
to O
hope O
that O
chawan O
mushi, O
a O
bowl O
of O
steaming-hot O
tofu O
custard, O
was O
on O
the O
menu. O
In O
spring O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
made O
it O
with O
spot O
prawns, O
but O
tonight, O
in O
homage O
to O
clambake O
season, O
he O
was O
serving O
lobster O
chawan O
mushi. O
To O
this O
point, O
the O
menu O
had O
faithfully O
followed O
kaiseki's O
ritualized O
sequence O
of O
courses O
and O
its O
stopwatch-precise O
attention O
to O
seasonality. O
It O
was O
about O
to O
veer O
in O
a O
different O
direction, O
but O
it O
was O
enough O
to O
suggest O
that O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
could O
open O
a O
kaiseki O
restaurant O
that O
would O
set O
a O
new O
standard O
in O
the O
city. O
I'm O
not O
sure O
the O
city O
would O
support O
it, O
but O
it O
would O
be O
spectacular O
while O
it O
lasted. O
The O
different O
direction, O
of O
course, O
was O
sushi. O
Accounting O
for O
just O
about O
half O
the O
Shoji O
menu, O
the O
sushi O
portion O
is O
briefer O
and O
offers O
less O
variety O
than O
the O
full O
monty O
at, O
say, O
Sushi O
Amane O
or O
Ginza O
Sushi O
Onodera O
. O
But O
I'm O
not O
sure O
any O
competitor O
outflanks O
Shoji O
on O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
seafood O
it O
does O
serve, O
or O
in O
the O
timeliness O
with O
which O
it O
serves O
up O
exactly O
the O
specimens O
most O
worth O
tracking O
down O
at O
any O
given O
moment. O
In O
spring, O
when O
bioluminescent O
firefly O
squid O
are O
spawning O
in O
Japanese O
bays, O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
gets O
them. O
In O
August, O
when O
cuttlefish O
are O
thumbnail O
size, O
unbelievably O
smooth O
and O
as O
meltingly O
soft O
as O
the O
thinnest O
sheet O
of O
nova O
at O
Russ O
& O
Daughters O
, O
he O
will O
lay O
three O
of O
those O
over O
a O
single O
finger O
of O
rice. O
He O
tracks O
bluefin O
that O
has O
been O
caught O
from O
healthy O
stocks, O
like O
the O
o-toro O
from O
Ireland O
that O
he O
served O
last O
spring O
and O
that O
was O
so O
seductive O
it O
could O
have O
been O
captioned O
"the O
guy O
she O
told O
you O
not O
to O
worry O
about." O
While O
in O
Japan, O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
learned O
to O
make O
fresh O
ikura O
from O
sacs O
of O
salmon O
roe, O
a O
slow O
process O
that O
requires O
massaging O
the O
eggs O
apart O
by O
hand O
in O
many O
changes O
of O
water. O
Normally O
the O
roe O
is O
then O
heavily O
cured O
with O
sugar O
and O
salt, O
but O
the O
roe O
he O
was O
serving O
last O
month O
was O
very O
lightly O
seasoned O
before O
being O
spooned O
into O
a O
shot O
glass O
and O
served O
as O
is O
-- O
sticky, O
fatty, O
sweet O
and O
fresh. O
After O
the O
last O
piece O
of O
fish, O
the O
kaiseki O
format O
kicks O
in O
again O
with O
a O
soup, O
which O
may O
be O
as O
simple O
as O
a O
classic O
bowl O
of O
miso O
or O
may O
break O
with O
tradition, O
like O
the O
extraordinary O
corn O
soup O
I O
ate O
in O
August. O
There O
will O
be O
something O
cold O
and O
refreshing, O
maybe O
a O
granita O
made O
from O
ginger O
or O
matcha, O
and O
finally O
a O
more O
substantial O
dessert. O
Sometimes O
this O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
tart O
with O
seasonal O
fruit O
-- O
candied O
kumquats, O
maybe, O
or O
white O
peaches O
and O
blueberries O
-- O
arranged O
in O
a O
mochi O
wafer O
called O
monaka. O
For O
all O
this O
the O
charge O
is O
$252, O
service O
included. O
A O
shorter O
menu O
is O
available O
at O
$190, O
or O
a O
longer O
one O
at O
$295, O
again O
with O
service O
included. O
That O
service O
is O
somewhat O
minimal; O
lately O
it O
has O
meant O
a O
single O
employee O
assiduously O
refilling O
water O
glasses O
and O
taking O
orders O
from O
a O
drinks O
list O
whose O
cheapest O
item O
is O
a O
$12 O
bottle O
of O
beer. O
Could O
my O
server O
have O
been O
more O
adept O
at O
deciphering O
the O
wines, O
sakes, O
shochus O
and O
Haitian O
rums O
Mr. O
Elkon O
and O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
have O
put O
together? O
Perhaps, O
but O
I O
wouldn't O
necessarily O
want O
the O
scene O
cluttered O
by O
a O
sommelier O
in O
full O
pocket-square-and-cuff-links O
regalia. O
More O
employees O
hovering O
at O
the O
counter O
might O
take O
away O
from O
the O

Mr. O
Wilcox O
builds O
with O
the O
people O
he O
feeds. O

in O
a O
2015 O
Hungry O
City O
column, O
was O
situated O
around O
the O
corner O
on O
Canal B-LOC
Street I-LOC
and O
had O
just O
four O
seats O
at O
a O
single O
counter. O
In O
June, O
Ms. O
Pang O
and O
her O
new O
business O
partner, O
Moonlynn O
Tsai, O
relocated O
to O
a O
larger, O
if O
still O
fairly O
intimate, O
space O
a O
few O
steps O
above O
the O
sidewalk. O
You O
order O
at O
the O
counter O
and O
receive O
a O
number O
on O
a O
metal O
stand, O
a O
kind O
of O
promissory O
note O
for O
the O
food O
and O
beverages. O
If O
you O
show O
up O
on O
a O
weekday O
in O
the O
morning O
or O
afternoon, O
when O
seats O
are O
not O
hard O
to O
come O
by O
and O
the O
room O
has O
a O
languid, O
unhurried O
air, O
you O
could O
get O
just O
a O
cup O
of O
bek-kopi B-DISH
and O
linger O
over O
it O
with O
a O
newspaper. O
You O
will O
probably O
want O
more O
than O
that, O
though. O
From O
9 O
a.m., O
when O
the O
doors O
open, O
until O
10 O
p.m., O
when O
they O
close, O
you O
can O
get O
nasi B-DISH
lemak, I-DISH
Malaysia's O
national O
dish O
and O
a O
particular O
favorite O
at O
breakfast. O
I O
don't O
know O
another O
kitchen O
in O
the O
city O
where O
the O
fragrances O
of O
coconut B-FOOD
and O
pandan B-FOOD
leaf I-FOOD
infuse O
the O
rice B-FOOD
as O
elegantly, O
or O
where O
the O
tiny O
dried B-FOOD
fish, I-FOOD
which O
Kopitiam B-EST
fries O
with O
peanuts, B-FOOD
form O
a O
caramelized O
crust O
that O
erases O
the O
distinction O
between O
sweet O
and O
savory. O
Or O
your O
breakfast O
could O
be O
a O
bowl O
of O
two B-FOOD
eggs I-FOOD
boiled O
just O
long O
enough O
to O
turn O
the O
whites O
opaque O
while O
leaving O
the O
yolks O
free O
to O
billow O
into O
mushroom-soy B-FOOD
broth I-FOOD
underneath. O
Or O
it O
might O
be O
fish B-DISH
ball I-DISH
soup, I-DISH
grape-size O
globes O
of O
ground B-FOOD
fish I-FOOD
in O
a O
cloudy O
white O
broth; B-FOOD
if O
the O
grains O
of O
white O
pepper O
on O
the O
surface O
aren't O
intense O
enough O
for O
you, O
you O
can O
stir O
in O
a O
little O
fish B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
spiced O
with B-FOOD
bird's I-FOOD
eye I-FOOD
chiles. I-FOOD
Rice B-FOOD
vermicelli I-FOOD
can O
be O
added, O
too, O
but O
the O
soup B-FOOD
is O
easier O
to O
appreciate O
in O
pure O
liquid O
form. O
For O
mornings O
when O
nothing O
but O
a O
cannonball O
dive O
into O
sugar O
will O
do, O
Kopitiam B-EST
is O
ready O
with O
a O
sculptural O
pile O
of O
thick-cut O
French B-DISH
toast I-DISH
battered I-DISH
with O
Milo B-FOOD
malt-chocolate I-FOOD
powder, I-FOOD
a O
Malaysian B-CUISINE
passion, O
with O
streams O
of O
sweetened B-FOOD
condensed I-FOOD
milk I-FOOD
playing O
the O
part O
that O
in O
this O
country O
is O
normally O
taken O
by O
maple O
syrup. O
Eat O
the O
whole O
stack O
and O
you O
will O
know O
the O
answer O
to O
the O
musical O
question O
posed O
by O
the O
Cramps: O
How O
far O
can O
too O
far O
go? O
At O
10:30 O
a.m. O
Ms. O
Pang, O
the O
chef, O
adds O
a O
gang O
of O
new O
dishes O
to O
the O
breakfast O
crew, O
and O
all O
of O
them O
stick O
around O
until O
closing O
time. O
There O
are O
fresh O
little O
oysters B-FOOD
embedded O
in O
a O
thin O
browned O
omelet, B-FOOD
rice B-DISH
noodles I-DISH
in I-DISH
a I-DISH
chilled I-DISH
sesame-oil I-DISH
broth I-DISH
with O
a O
growl O
of O
chile O
heat O
and O
spicy B-DISH
skate I-DISH
steamed I-DISH
in I-DISH
banana I-DISH
leaves, I-DISH
the O
classic O
acoustic O
version O
of O
the O
dish O
that O
Max O
Ng O
plays O
with O
amplifiers O
and O
wah-wah O
pedals O
at O
Momofuku B-EST
Ssam I-EST
Bar I-EST
. O
Any O
of O
these O
could O
make O
a O
small O
meal. O
But O
one O
of O
the O
most O
inviting O
aspects O
of O
Kopitiam B-EST
is O
Ms. O
Pang's O
fidelity O
to O
the O
Malaysian B-CUISINE
love I-CUISINE
of O
snacks. O
Pandan B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
wrapped O
around O
a O
kind O
of O
chicken B-FOOD
sausage; I-FOOD
ground B-FOOD
five-spice I-FOOD
pork I-FOOD
rolled O
inside O
bean-curd B-FOOD
skins I-FOOD
and O
fried; O
fried O
strips O
of O
mackerel B-FOOD
sausage I-FOOD
with O
a O
curry-leaf B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
-- O
any O
of O
them O
makes O
a O
fine O
appetizer, O
but O
each O
could O
just O
as O
easily O
be O
the O
entire O
goal O
of O
a O
between-meals O
stop O
at O
Kopitiam. B-EST
For O
that O
matter, O
so O
could O
the O
small O
sweets O
like O
pulut: B-DISH
triangular, O
pandan-wrapped O
bundles O
of O
sticky B-FOOD
rice I-FOOD
tinted O
with O
blue B-FOOD
morning I-FOOD
glory I-FOOD
flowers I-FOOD
and O
spread O
with O
toasted B-FOOD
coconut I-FOOD
sugar I-FOOD
or O
house-made O
coconut B-FOOD
jam. I-FOOD
Ms. O
Pang O
is O
devoted O
to O
cakes O
as O
well. O
You O
get O
the O
sense O
that O
if O
it O
were O
physically O
possible, O
she'd O
bake O
every O
cake O
she O
knows O
every O
day, O
but O
she O
settles O
for O
one O
or O
two O
in O
an O
unpredictable O
rotation. O
You O
may O
find O
the O
caramel-brown B-DISH
honeycomb I-DISH
cake, I-DISH
with O
its O
intriguing O
structure O
of O
hollow O
vertical O
columns O
at O
the O
bottom, O
or O
you O
may O
find O
her O
coconut B-DISH
cake, I-DISH
or O
there O
may O
be O
some O
fresh O
surprise. O
Snacks O
and O
sweets O
tend O
to O
get O
edged O
out O
of O
the O
spotlight O
in O
New O
York O
restaurants, O
where O
there's O
always O
pressure O
to O
order O
something O
big. O
This O
is, O
after O
all, O
a O
city O
that O
turned O
the O
casual O
tapas B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
into O
the O
peculiar O
genre O
known O
as O
the O
tapas B-TYPE
restaurant. I-TYPE
There O
is O
no O
such O
pressure O
inside O
Kopitiam, B-EST
at O
least O
on O
weekdays. O
Weekend O
brunch O
is O
another O
story, O
as O
it O
often O
is. O
The O
menu O
is O
the O
same, O
but O
the O
crowds O
thicken. O
A O
sign-in O
sheet O
is O
kept O
outside O
the O
door, O
next O
to O
the O
pink O
pay O
phone O
(25 O
cents; O
it O
works), O
and O
hopeful O
customers O
sit O
on O
ceramic O
garden O
stools O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
stoop O
listening O
for O
their O
names. O
When O
you're O
finally O
called, O
you O
may O
feel O
silly O
getting O
nothing O
more O
than O
tannic O
milky B-FOOD
tea I-FOOD
and O
a O
bundle O
of O
blue B-FOOD
sticky I-FOOD
rice. I-FOOD
And O
when O
demand O
peaks, O
chaos O
can O
creep O
in, O
suggesting O
that O
Kopitiam B-EST
is O
still O
figuring O
out O
the O
mechanics O
of O
its O
larger O
space. O
Servers O
may O
pop O
by O
anxiously O
to O
ask, O
"Did O
you O
get O
all O
your O
food?" O
and O
the O
answer O
may O
be O
no. O
Drink O
orders O
may O
stack O
up. O
Once O
the O
white B-FOOD
coffee I-FOOD
was O
off O
the O
menu; O
another O
time, O
no O
coffee B-FOOD
at O
all O
was O
being O
poured; O
and O
for O
a O
short O
time O
one O
day, O
both O
coffee O
and O
tea O
were O
unavailable, O
an O
awkward O
state O
of O
affairs O
for O
a O
coffee B-TYPE
and I-TYPE
tea I-TYPE
parlor. I-TYPE
Even O
with O
a O
backlog O
of O
tickets, O
though, O
the O
food O
trickling O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
is O
almost O
unfailingly O
terrific. O
Maybe O
the O
stir-fried B-DISH
duck I-DISH
tongues I-DISH
I O
ate O
last O
time O
could O
have O
slid O
from O
their O
cartilaginous O
framework O
more O
easily. O
Then O
again, O
maybe O
I O
wasn't O
in O
the O
right O
mood O
for O
duck B-FOOD
tongues. I-FOOD

-DOCSTART- O

During O
the O
five O
years O
Village B-EST
Cafe I-EST
has O
been O
open, O
I O
must O
have O
driven O
the O
length O
of O
Coney B-LOC
Island I-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
a O
dozen O
times O
without O
noticing O
it. O
At O
best O
I O
might O
have O
spotted O
the O
tiny O
parking O
lot O
in O
Midwood, B-LOC
with O
tattered O
red, O
blue O
and O
silver O
streamers O
flapping O
over O
its O
10 O
or O
so O
spaces, O
giving O
it O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
world's O
smallest O
used-car O
dealership. O
In O
the O
back O
is O
a O
wide, O
single-story O
structure O
that O
looks O
like O
the O
trailer O
office O
where O
you O
would O
sit O
down O
to O
discuss O
loan O
options O
with O
Marty O
from O
financing. O
But O
that O
building O
is O
an O
Azerbaijani B-CUISINE
restaurant O
that O
stands O
out O
among O
the O
dining O
outposts O
of O
former O
Soviet O
republics O
that O
stretch O
north O
from O
Brighton B-FOOD
Beach, I-FOOD
and O
each O
time O
I've O
gone O
inside O
I O
was O
given O
not O
a O
credit O
check, O
but O
a O
test O
of O
my O
appetite's O
limits. O
This O
is O
not O
just O
because O
almost O
every O
platter O
of O
food O
that O
leaves O
the O
kitchen O
at O
Village B-EST
Cafe I-EST
seems O
intended O
to O
feed O
an O
actual O
village. O
I O
run O
into O
trouble O
because O
there O
are O
so O
many O
things O
I O
want O
to O
order O
and O
so O
few O
things O
I O
am O
willing O
to O
leave O
on O
the O
table O
as O
the O
meal O
winds O
down. O
There O
will O
never O
be O
a O
time O
when O
I O
go O
to O
Village B-EST
Cafe I-EST
and O
decide O
not O
to O
have O
at O
least O
one O
qutab, B-FOOD
if O
not O
all O
three. O
The O
menu O
gives O
the O
name O
of O
this O
delicate O
Azerbaijani B-CUISINE
flatbread, B-FOOD
the O
diameter O
of O
a O
pita B-FOOD
but O
thinner, O
as O
kutaby. B-DISH
Either O
way, O
it O
is O
very O
good O
when O
stuffed O
with O
minced, O
quietly O
spiced O
chicken B-FOOD
or O
lamb. B-FOOD
It O
is O
exceptional O
when O
filled O
with O
greens: O
spinach, B-FOOD
scallions, B-FOOD
and O
dill B-FOOD
and O
cilantro, O
two O
fresh O
herbs O
that O
turn O
up O
again O
and O
again O
in O
Azerbaijani O
cooking. O
I O
will O
always O
want O
the O
crimped O
dumplings, O
the O
size O
and O
shape O
of O
chicken O
drumettes, O
that O
the O
English O
menu O
calls O
ravioli O
and O
the O
servers O
call O
pelmeni. O
Filled O
with O
chicken O
or O
lamb, O
these O
dumplings O
can O
be O
boiled, O
but O
the O
urge O
to O
ask O
for O
them O
fried O
is O
overwhelming, O
and O
the O
fried O
ones O
are O
better O
dunked O
in O
the O
tomato-pepper O
sauce O
that O
I O
would O
call O
salsa O
if O
I O
were O
not O
in O
an O
Azerbaijani O
restaurant. O
There O
will O
be O
liver O
on O
my O
table, O
too. O
Maybe O
it O
will O
be O
Turkish O
style, O
little O
fried O
cubes O
under O
a O
tart O
purple O
dusting O
of O
ground O
sumac. O
Or O
the O
liver O
may O
be O
added O
to O
bits O
of O
lamb O
hearts, O
kidney O
and O
testicles, O
and O
cooked O
with O
onions O
and O
potato O
cubes O
in O
a O
fantastically O
oily O
hash O
called O
djiz O
biz. O
Whether O
I O
will O
eat O
guru O
hingal O
will O
depend O
on O
how O
far O
in O
advance O
I've O
planned O
my O
meal, O
because O
it O
generally O
has O
to O
be O
ordered O
a O
day O
ahead. O
It O
is O
a O
noodle O
dish: O
very O
thin, O
wide O
sheets O
of O
pasta O
under O
a O
sauce O
of O
onions O
and O
ground O
lamb O
fried O
in O
its O
own O
fat O
until O
it O
is O
magnificently O
crunchy. O
If O
you O
poured O
chile O
oil O
over O
guru O
hingal, O
it O
would O
taste O
Sichuanese; O
stew O
the O
lamb O
with O
tomatoes O
and O
you O
could O
mistake O
the O
sauce O
for O
Bolognese. O
But O
it's O
from O
Azerbaijan, O
and O
it's O
good O
with O
yogurt. O
And O
I O
will O
have O
soup, O
even O
if O
nobody O
else O
does, O
because O
Village O
Cafe's O
kitchen O
understands O
how O
to O
make O
it. O
The O
kufta-bozbash O
is O
a O
strong, O
well-skimmed O
lamb O
broth O
with O
chickpeas O
and O
a O
single, O
tender O
lamb-rice O
meatball, O
as O
big O
as O
an O
apple. O
The O
broth O
for O
dushbara O
soup O
is O
similar, O
but O
the O
ballast O
is O
provided O
by O
miniature O
lamb O
dumplings O
about O
the O
size O
of O
M&Ms. O
Cilantro O
and O
dried O
mint O
are O
added O
to O
both O
soups O
at O
the O
last O
minute, O
and O
the O
mint O
is O
especially O
helpful. O
Village O
Cafe's O
hot O
borscht, O
strong O
and O
decidedly O
unvegetarian, O
outperforms O
some O
I've O
had O
in O
Brighton O
Beach. O
Instead O
of O
sour O
cream, O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
spoonful O
of O
yogurt. O
The O
cuisine O
of O
Azerbaijan O
often O
echoes O
those O
of O
its O
neighbors O
Georgia, O
Armenia O
and O
Iran, O
but O
other O
dishes, O
like O
borscht, O
were O
hauled O
down O
from O
Eastern O
Europe O
in O
the O
strong O
arms O
of O
Mother O
Russia. O
We O
can O
also O
thank O
Russia O
for O
the O
insane O
music O
videos O
that O
play O
on O
Village O
Cafe's O
two O
televisions, O
typically O
with O
the O
volume O
off O
while O
American O
pop O
of O
the O
'80s O
plays O
on O
the O
sound O
system. O
You O
sit O
at O
what O
appear O
to O
be O
varnished O
picnic O
tables O
with O
chairs O
instead O
of O
benches. O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
décor O
looks O
like O
a O
Brighton O
Beach O
yard O
sale: O
a O
mushroom O
cookie O
jar, O
an O
embroidered O
peasant O
smock, O
a O
camouflage O
cap, O
a O
samovar O
or O
two, O
a O
collection O
of O
beaded O
handbags, O
several O
ceramic O
cows, O
three O
statues O
of O
fat O
chefs O
with O
toques O
and O
mustaches, O
and O
two O
giant O
forks O
mounted O
on O
the O
wall. O
For O
atmosphere, O
Village O
Cafe O
is O
roundly O
beaten O
by O
my O
second-favorite O
Azerbaijani O
restaurant O
in O
Brooklyn, O
Old O
Baku O
in O
Kensington. O
Walk O
past O
the O
awning O
that O
says O
"private O
club," O
past O
the O
curtained O
booths O
in O
the O
front O
dining O
room, O
past O
the O
open O
kitchen O
where O
chefs O
scoop O
burning O
coals O
to O
keep O
the O
fire O
under O
the O
kebabs O
going O
strong, O
and O
you O
enter O
a O
courtyard O
from O
another O
country. O
Almost O
everybody O
at O
Old O
Baku O
is O
smoking O
under O
the O
arbor O
of O
grape O
vines O
that O
weave O
around O
strings O
of O
white O
lights. O
If O
you O
go O
in O
the O
fall, O
you O
might O
be O
brought O
a O
plate O
of O
purple O
grapes, O
newly O
picked O
a O
few O
feet O
away. O
But O
Village O
Cafe O
gains O
its O
edge O
on O
Old O
Baku O
in O
the O
kitchen. O
The O
stewed O
fruit O
ladled O
over O
saffron O
rice O
in O
its O
plov, O
for O
instance, O
is O
a O
richer O
and O
more O
varied O
compilation O
of O
dried O
plums, O
apricots, O
chestnuts O
and O
deeply O
browned O
lamb. O
The O
salads O
are O
brighter, O
too, O
if O
you O
can O
get O
over O
some O
of O
the O
names. O
The O
menu O
was O
evidently O
written O
by O
someone O
with O
a O
weakness O
for O
poetry, O
so O
the O
salads O
are O
called O
things O
like O
"Journey O
to O
Baku," O
"Winter O
Fun" O
and O
"Unexpected O
Guests." O
The O
Journey O
to O
Baku O
is O
worth O
taking; O
it's O
a O
sharply O
seasoned, O
smoky O
eggplant O
mash O
with O
peppers O
and O
tomatoes. O
The O
kidney O
beans O
in O
a O
traditional O
lobio O
salad O
are O
creamy, O
salty O
and O
well-oiled O
under O
their O
topping O
of O
chopped O
walnuts O
and O
cilantro. O
Main O
course O
names O
incline O
toward O
the O
allusive O
as O
well, O
with O
one O
chicken O
cutlet O
called O
"Miracle O
of O
Village" O
and O
another O
-- O
buried O
under O
a O
white O
pillow O
of O
cheese O
and O
cream O
sauce O
-- O
that O
goes O
by O
"Mother O
In O
Laws O
Chicken." O
But O
really, O
the O
best O
place O
to O
go O
once O
all O
the O
amenities O
have O
been O
polished O
off O
is O
the O
kebabs. O
The O
quail O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
wizened. O
The O
grilled O
testicles O
with O
a O
hint O
of O
lemon O
in O
their O
lightly O
browned O
surfaces O
will O
always O
be O
a O
niche O
proposition. O
But O
the O
lamb O
ribs, O
the O
marinated O
lamb O
chops O
known O
as O
chalahac O
and O
the O
flatbread-wrapped O
Azerbaijani O
version O
of O
kofte O
called O
lulya O
kebabs O
(made O
from O
chicken O
or O
lamb) O
are O
extremely O
good. O
The O
vegetable O
skewer O
choices O
begin O
and O
end O
with O
blistered O
tomatoes O
and O
softly O
collapsing O
eggplant. O
Both O
are O
worthwhile. O
So O
is O
the O
side O
dish O
called O
"homemade O
potatoes," O
if O
there O
is O
any O
room O
left O
on O
the O
table. O
Sliced O
and O
fried O
with O
onions, O
they O
narrowly O
beat O
out O
the O
pretty O
good O
fries. O
A O
cup O
or O
two O
of O
strong O
dark O
tea O
will O
speed O
your O
recovery O
from O
this O
onslaught. O
Dessert O
may O
not. O
Still, O
there O
is O
something O
to O
be O
said O
for O
trying O
a O
Napoleon O
made O
like O
baklava O
and O
a O
baklava O
made O
like O
a O

Shrinking O
modesty O
is O
not O
the O
normal O
attitude O
for O
restaurants O
with O
a O
view. O
The O
Rainbow B-EST
Room I-EST
had O
Art O
Deco O
razzmatazz O
and O
its O
revolving O
dance O
floor; O
Windows B-EST
on I-EST
the I-EST
World, I-EST
before O
terrorists O
destroyed O
it, O
served O
cocktails O
in O
a O
room O
named O
the O
Greatest O
Bar O
on O
Earth. O
Manhatta B-EST
, O
which O
recently O
opened O
on O
the O
60th O
floor O
of O
an O
International O
Style O
tower O
downtown, O
doesn't O
follow O
their O
lead. O
It O
is O
the O
least O
show-offy O
skyscraper O
restaurant O
you've O
ever O
seen. O
The O
whole O
operation O
is O
very O
orderly O
and O
well O
behaved, O
apart O
from O
its O
refusal O
to O
spell O
its O
own O
name O
correctly. O
(The O
reference O
is O
to O
the O
Lenni O
Lenape O
name O
Manahatta, O
or O
Mannahatta, O
meaning O
"island O
of O
many O
hills," O
but O
without O
the O
second O
"a" O
the O
name O
just O
looks O
incomplete. O
It's O
like O
a O
child O
named O
Henr.) O
A O
dedicated O
door O
around O
the O
corner O
from O
the O
building's O
main O
entrance O
brings O
you O
into O
a O
foyer O
that, O
with O
its O
sleek O
chairs O
and O
coffee O
tables, O
looks O
like O
the O
lobby O
of O
one O
of O
those O
1960s O
white-brick O
apartment O
buildings O
in O
the O
East O
40s O
and O
50s. O
When O
you O
get O
out O
of O
the O
elevator O
-- O
it O
goes O
to O
just O
one O
floor, O
the O
top O
-- O
a O
short O
walk O
leads O
to O
another O
sparsely O
furnished O
sitting O
area, O
this O
one O
looking O
out O
the O
windows O
toward O
the O
harbor O
and O
the O
Verrazzano-Narrows O
Bridge. O
When O
the O
lounge O
hasn't O
been O
rented O
out O
for O
parties O
and O
sealed O
off, O
it's O
busier O
than O
the O
foyer O
downstairs, O
but O
it O
still O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
designed O
for O
people O
who O
are O
waiting O
for O
their O
dates O
to O
get O
back O
from O
the O
restroom. O
In O
the O
other O
direction O
are O
Manhatta's B-EST
bar, B-TYPE
a O
longish O
counter O
whose O
seats O
face O
uptown, O
and O
its O
dining O
room, O
which O
looks O
both O
north O
and O
east O
toward O
Brooklyn. B-LOC
The O
color O
scheme, O
navy-blue O
leather O
and O
dark O
wood, O
might O
strike O
the O
Knickerbocker O
Club O
's O
board O
as O
a O
little O
too O
conservative. O
An O
open O
kitchen O
has O
been O
dropped O
down O
into O
the O
middle O
of O
all O
this, O
but O
the O
overall O
design O
strategy O
is O
to O
sit O
back O
and O
let O
the O
windows O
do O
the O
work. O
Danny O
Meyer, O
whose O
Union B-EST
Square I-EST
Hospitality I-EST
Group I-EST
runs O
Manhatta B-EST
through O
a O
management O
contract O
with O
the O
building's O
owner, O
told O
The O
New O
York O
Times O
last O
year O
that O
Manhatta B-EST
would O
not O
be O
as O
flamboyant O
as O
a O
typical O
top-floor O
restaurant. O
"Those O
kinds O
of O
places O
often O
do O
not O
live O
up O
to O
expectations; O
they O
try O
too O
hard O
to O
live O
up O
to O
the O
view," O
he O
said. O
"I O
expect O
to O
conceive O
of O
it O
like O
a O
ground-floor O
restaurant, O
as O
a O
place O
people O
might O
want O
to O
visit O
regularly." O
You O
can't O
blame O
Mr. O
Meyer O
for O
not O
wanting O
to O
open O
a O
mediocre O
splashy O
restaurant, O
but O
Manhatta B-EST
flirts O
dangerously O
with O
being O
a O
mediocre O
unsplashy O
restaurant. O
The O
chef, O
Jason O
Pfeifer, O
doesn't O
quite O
let O
that O
happen. O
His O
French B-CUISINE
menu, O
grounded O
in O
seasonal O
flavors, O
is O
fairly O
priced O
at O
$78, O
including O
tip, O
for O
a O
three-course O
prix O
fixe. O
A O
good O
amount O
of O
it O
is O
very O
likable, O
but O
there O
are O
more O
spongy O
patches O
than O
there O
probably O
should O
be. O
At O
their O
best, O
Manhatta's B-EST
better O
appetizers O
and O
main O
courses O
are O
fleshed O
out O
with O
fruits O
and O
vegetables O
so O
ripe O
and O
pristine O
they O
seem O
to O
come O
from O
a O
Greenmarket B-LOC
stall O
that O
only O
Mr. O
Pfeifer O
can O
see. O
A O
melon B-DISH
and I-DISH
cucumber I-DISH
salad I-DISH
with O
fluffy O
curds O
of O
feta B-FOOD
was O
an O
exploration O
of O
melonic O
potential; O
each O
section O
of O
fruit O
was O
a O
bit O
different, O
some O
infused O
with O
citrus, O
others O
dripping O
with O
unfiltered O
garden-patch O
sweetness, O
all O
of O
them O
tangy O
with O
white O
balsamic O
vinegar. O
An O
admirably O
cooked O
brick O
of O
halibut O
was O
paired O
with O
bittersweet O
fennel O
bulbs O
and O
a O
mustard O
sauce O
with O
a O
gentle O
but O
effective O
bite. O
Raw O
nectarine O
crescents, O
braised O
lettuces O
and O
tender O
thin O
wheels O
of O
immature O
corn O
on O
the O
cob O
augmenting O
a O
main O
course O
of O
chicken O
were O
their O
charming O
selves, O
and O
all O
the O
better O
for O
their O
slinky O
dressing O
of O
chicken O
jus. O
Sweet O
black O
figs O
stood O
in O
for O
apples O
in O
a O
memorable O
little O
tarte O
Tatin O
garnished O
with O
raw O
pale-green O
figs. O
(Jennifer O
Bretania O
and O
Vanesa O
Beltran O
share O
the O
pastry O
duties.) O
Gently O
marinated O
hen-of-the-woods O
mushrooms O
made O
an O
exquisitely O
woodsy O
counterpoint O
to O
ruffles O
of O
shaved O
La O
Marotte O
sheep O
cheese. O
But O
generous O
applications O
of O
produce O
don't O
always O
save O
the O
food O
from O
seeming O
a O
bit O
safe, O
conservative O
and O
slightly O
dated. O
Mr. O
Pfeifer, O
who O
spent O
eight O
years O
in O
the O
kitchen O
at O
Maialino O
, O
Mr. O
Meyer's O
Roman-inspired O
restaurant, O
is O
now O
cooking O
French O
food O
in O
the O
post-nouvelle O
mode O
that O
Daniel O
Boulud O
has O
been O
artfully O
fomenting O
for O
years. O
Mr. O
Boulud O
has O
earned O
the O
right O
to O
keep O
working O
in O
that O
groove O
as O
long O
as O
he O
likes, O
but O
it's O
strange O
to O
find O
a O
young O
chef O
at O
a O
new, O
high-profile O
destination O
doing O
it O
when O
others O
around O
the O
city O
are O
pushing O
ahead O
with O
contemporary O
interpretations O
of O
French O
cuisine. O
And O
when O
Manhatta O
turns O
to O
the O
classics, O
its O
use O
of O
French O
idioms O
seems O
skin-deep O
compared O
with O
Laetitia O
Rouabah's O
light O
touch O
and O
sophisticated O
technique O
at O
Benoit O
, O
or O
Marie-Aude O
Rose's O
painstaking O
elevations O
of O
cafe O
cooking O
at O
La O
Mercerie O
, O
or O
Daniel O
Rose's O
intelligent, O
neoclassical O
excavations O
of O
silver-cloche O
cuisine O
at O
Le O
Coucou O
. O
Where O
Le O
Coucou O
brought O
back O
quenelles O
as O
helium-light O
pike O
dumplings O
in O
dizzyingly O
rich O
lobster-brandy O
sauce, O
Manhatta O
turns O
them O
into O
quivering O
balls O
of O
pudding O
distantly O
scented O
with O
seafood. O
Of O
all O
the O
ways O
a O
modern O
chef O
might O
grapple O
with O
cassoulet, O
the O
sublimely O
burly O
Languedocian O
assault O
on O
the O
digestive O
system, O
upending O
it O
over O
a O
crisp O
and O
golden O
chicken O
paillard O
has O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
strangest. O
Manhatta O
isn't O
the O
first O
restaurant O
to O
update O
veal O
blanquette O
with O
meat O
that's O
roasted O
rather O
than O
stewed, O
but O
the O
sauce O
is O
so O
blandly O
milky O
that O
it's O
hardly O
there. O
And O
while O
modern O
desserts O
can O
stray O
into O
savory O
territory O
more O
than O
they O
did O
in O
Escoffier's O
day, O
a O
vanilla O
soufflé O
with O
butterscotch O
sauce O
probably O
shouldn't O
taste O
salty. O
Some O
of O
this O
was O
dispiriting, O
but O
I O
never O
got O
up O
from O
the O
table O
in O
a O
bad O
mood. O
There O
are O
grace O
notes O
throughout O
the O
restaurant, O
like O
the O
dark, O
shiny O
little O
canelés O
that O
show O
up O
with O
dessert. O
This O
being O
a O
Union O
Square O
Hospitality O
production, O
the O
servers O
seem O
to O
be O
trained O
mind O
readers. O
A O
pair O
of O
the O
mismatched O
binoculars O
scattered O
around O
the O
restaurant O
materialized O
just O
when O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
locate O
the O
clock O
tower O
in O
the O
Consolidated O
Edison O
Building; O
before O
I'd O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
point O
out O
a O
fruit O
fly O
in O
my O
wine O
(did O
it O
ride O
up O
with O
me O
in O
the O
elevator?) O
a O
sommelier O
spirited O
the O
glass O
away O
and O
brought O
a O
fresh O
one. O
Mr. O
Meyer O
was O
probably O
right O
to O
take O
a O
dialed-down O
approach O
to O
the O
top-floor O
restaurant O
genre. O
It O
dates O
from O
a O
more O
innocent O
age, O
when O
people O
could O
look O
at O
the O
financial O
district's O
unblinking O
grids O
of O
lighted O
windows O
as O
the O
bland O
face O
of O
high-stakes O
cheating O
that O
we've O
come O
to O
recognize O
from O
"Margin O
Call" O
and O
"Billions." O
At O
the O
time O
of O
the O
financial O
crisis, O
Manhatta's O
building O
was O
the O
headquarters O
of O
JPMorgan O
Chase O
-- O
a O
relatively O
minor O
player O
in O
the O
three-card-monte O
game O
of O
mortgage-backed O
securities, O
but O
a O
player O
nonetheless. O
Ten O
years O
have O
gone O
by, O
but O
it's O
still O
too O
soon O
for O
revolving O
dance O
floors. O

A O
card O
is O
set O
down O
in O
front O
of O
you O
before O
each O
new O
course O
arrives O
at O
Atomix B-EST
, O
the O
tasting-menu O
restaurant O
in O
Murray B-LOC
Hill I-LOC
run O
by O
Junghyun O
Park O
and O
his O
wife, O
Jeungeun. O
Each O
is O
printed O
with O
a O
boldface O
transliteration O
of O
a O
Korean B-CUISINE
word O
under O
an O
abstract O
design O
of O
geometric O
shapes O
and O
lines. O
They O
look O
like O
flashcards O
from O
a O
school O
run O
by O
progressive O
graphic O
designers. O
"Your O
first O
course O
is O
guk, B-DISH
which O
means O
soup," B-FOOD
a O
server O
will O
say. O
"This O
card O
is O
for O
hwe, B-DISH
Korean O
for O
raw." O
"Jorim B-DISH
is O
next. O
Jorim O
means O
it's O
been O
braised." O
This O
sounds O
as O
if O
it O
would O
get O
old, O
but O
it O
doesn't. O
Very O
early O
on, O
you O
learn O
that O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
these O
vocabulary O
exercises O
lie O
dishes O
of O
wonderful O
intricacy, O
sophistication O
and O
beauty. O
One O
after O
another, O
each O
of O
the O
10 O
courses O
in O
the O
$175 O
meal O
opens O
up O
new O
ideas O
about O
Korean O
cuisine O
and O
culture. O
In O
the O
Atomix O
pedagogical O
method, O
instruction O
is O
followed O
closely O
by O
reward. O
(While O
we O
are O
working O
on O
vocabulary: O
The O
restaurant's O
name O
is O
pronounced, O
somewhat O
counterintuitively, O
a-toe-mix.) O
[Read O
about O
some O
of O
the O

Many O
of O
the O
rewards O
are O
the O
kind O
you O
eat, O
of O
course. O
Guk-which-means-soup O
is O
a O
shimmering O
broth O
that O
Mr. O
Park, O
the O
chef, O
makes O
from O
fermented O
tomatoes O
and O
kelp; O
chilled O
and O
poured O
over O
scallop O
slices O
layered O
between O
slivers O
of O
green O
tomato O
that O
have O
been O
marinated O
in O
Korean O
fig O
vinegar, O
the O
broth O
has O
an O
electrifying O
sweet-sour O
balance. O
The O
dish O
may O
not O
scream O
"Korean O
cuisine," O
but O
the O
next O
one O
does. O
This O
is O
hwe O
-- O
Korean O
for O
raw, O
you'll O
recall, O
and O
also O
the O
term O
for O
Korean-style O
sashimi. O
The O
fish O
is O
striped O
jack, O
brushed O
with O
plum O
vinegar O
sauce. O
Slices O
of O
it O
are O
folded O
around O
a O
mild O
fermented O
chile, O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
sesame O
oil O
and O
bits O
of O
kimchi O
made O
from O
cabbage O
and O
ramps. O
Sitting O
over O
each O
slice O
of O
jack O
is O
a O
crisp O
square O
of O
gim, O
which O
the O
Japanese O
call O
nori. O
Pinch O
some O
fish O
inside O
the O
gim O
and O
eat O
it, O
and O
the O
flavors O
that O
unspool O
are O
some O
of O
those O
that O
are O
brought O
to O
the O
table O
with O
Korean O
sashimi, O
but O
they're O
put O
together O
with O
a O
harmony O
that's O
hard O
to O
achieve O
when O
you O
swab O
them O
yourself O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
a O
few O
glasses O
of O
soju. O
Inspired O
by O
a O
poem O
from O
the O
Choson O
era, O
Mr. O
Park O
summoned O
an O
entirely O
different O
set O
of O
flavors O
for O
the O
hwe O
on O
Atomix's O
opening O
menu, O
which O
ran O
from O
late O
May O
to O
early O
September. O
Then, O
the O
fish O
was O
sea O
bream, O
firm O
and O
chewy, O
marinated O
overnight O
with O
ginger O
in O
a O
magnificently O
good O
tangerine O
vinegar O
from O
the O
island O
of O
Jeju. O
Eaten O
with O
sea O
urchin, O
plain O
spinach, O
sparkling O
shards O
of O
jelly O
made O
from O
pale O
young O
soy O
sauce, O
and O
Chinese-mustard O
leaves O
fermented O
in O
some O
wonderful O
way, O
it O
was O
so O
deeply O
harmonic O
I O
wouldn't O
have O
minded O
if O
Mr. O
Park O
had O
served O
it O
over O
and O
over O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
meal. O
Centuries O
before O
it O
became O
the O
fashion O
among O
American O
chefs, O
fermentation O
was O
a O
pillar O
of O
Korean O
cuisine. O
Atomix O
exploits O
it O
in O
all O
kinds O
of O
ways. O
Fermentation O
bends O
a O
mix O
of O
juices O
from O
Korean O
pears, O

and O
pineapple O
toward O
a O
cidery O
direction O
that O
makes O
it O
a O
thrilling O
marinade, O
braising O
liquid O
and O
sauce O
for O
exquisitely O
rich O
Wagyu O
strip O
loin. O
It's O
the O
foundation O
for O
an O
array O
of O
vinegars O
you O
won't O
find O
on O
the O
average O
table O
in O
Koreatown: O
cherry O
blossom, O
persimmon, O
mugwort, O
birch. O
And, O
of O
course, O
fermentation O
is O
behind O
the O
restaurant's O
arsenal O
of O
pickled O
vegetables, O
the O
most O
interesting O
of O
which O
may O
be O
the O
tart O
brussels O
sprouts O
that O
Mr. O
Park O
serves O
in O
banchan O
format O
alongside O
roast O
duck O
with O
a O
mole O
sauce O
that O
could O
pass O
muster O
in O
Mexico O
if O
Mr. O
Park O
did O
not O
up O
the O
funk O
level O
with O
gochujang. O
Some O
of O
these O
ingredients O
were O
fermented O
or O
otherwise O
preserved O
in O
South O
Korea. O
Many O
more O
were O
put O
up O
for O
storage O
at O
Atoboy O
, O
the O
Parks' O
other O
restaurant, O
over O
the O
past O
year O
or O
more O
as O
the O
Parks O
prepared O
to O
open O
Atomix. O
Atoboy's O
food O
is O
woven O
around O
traditional O
banchan O
dishes, O
and O
while O
Mr. O
Park O
gives O
himself O
room O
to O
play, O
the O
cooking O
there O
stays O
true O
to O
the O
fairly O
simple O
origins O
of O
banchan. O
His O
tasting O
menus O
at O
Atomix O
make O
a O
quantum O
leap O
in O
complexity. O
It's O
like O
seeing O
the O
guy O
who O
strums O
the O
12-string O
guitar O
on O
the O
L O
platform O
pick O
up O
a O
conductor's O
baton O
and O
lead O
an O
orchestra O
through O
a O
Mahler O
symphony. O
On O
the O
back O
of O
Atomix's O
flashcards O
he O
lists O
the O
components O
of O
each O
dish, O
and O
each O
of O
their O
ingredients O
-- O
around O
20 O
on O
average, O
very O
few O
of O
them O
ordinary O
and O
none O
of O
them O
out O
of O
place. O
Nothing O
at O
Atomix O
tastes O
confused O
or O
overburdened. O
The O
dishes O
are O
even O
more O
elaborate O
than O
those O
at O
Jungsik O
, O
the O
rarefied O
Korean-inspired O
restaurant O
downtown O
where O
Mr. O
Park O
was O
the O
chef O
de O
cuisine O
before O
he O
and O
his O
wife O
struck O
out O
on O
their O
own. O
And O
while O
Jungsik O
seems O
determined O
to O
stuff O
Korean O
flavors O
into O
an O
outdated O
French O
formality, O
Atomix O
is O
warm, O
contemporary O
and O
Korean O
at O
just O
about O
every O
turn. O
The O
Parks, O
who O
were O
raised O
in O
South O
Korea, O
hired O
a O
Seoul O
architecture O
firm, O
Studio O
Writers, O
to O
remake O
two O
floors O
of O
a O
secretive-looking O
townhouse O
on O
East O
30th O
Street. O
Upstairs O
is O
a O
small O
bar O
where O
you O
can O
slither O
into O
a O
pale-leather O
booth O
to O
idle O
over O
smartly O
conceived O
snacks O
like O
soy-marinated O
scallop O
jerky; O
beef O
tartare, O
mixed O
with O
red O
and O
black O
pepper, O
and O
under O
a O
snowfall O
of O
pecorino; O
or O
fried O
wings O
stuffed O
with O
fried O
rice O
and O
dusted O
with O
ground O
Sichuan O
peppercorns. O
Stairs O
descend O
to O
a O
bright, O
skylit O
lounge O
of O
upholstered O
benches O
where O
the O
tasting O
menu O
kicks O
off O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
hors O
d'oeuvres O
and O
drinks. O
The O
idea O
must O
be O
for O
you O
to O
leave O
the O
shuffle O
of O
Manhattan O
behind O
in O
stages, O
but O
I O
always O
spent O
my O
few O
minutes O
in O
this O
way O
station O
eyeing O
the O
comfortable, O
dark, O
wood-clad O
den O
a O
few O
steps O
away O
where O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
meal O
is O
served O
at O
a O
14-seat O
counter. O
The O
natural O
materials O
and O
simple O
lines O
in O
the O
tasting O
room O
seem O
to O
bow O
toward O
Korea's O
long O
Zen O
tradition, O
and O
a O
kind O
of O
purposeful O
calm O
reigns O
there. O
Servers O
and O
cooks O
all O
wear O
flowing, O
boat-neck O
shirts O
in O
a O
shimmering O
pewter O
color O
that O
gives O
them O
a O
slight O
science-fiction O
look; O
they O
are O
the O
work O
of O
a O
Korean-born O
New O
York O
designer, O
Sungho O
Ahn. O
Ms. O
Park, O
who O
goes O
by O
Ellia, O
glides O
behind O
the O
counter, O
smiling O
and O
holding O
out O
a O
cloth O
case O
to O
offer O
a O
pair O
of O
the O
Korean-made O
chopsticks O
she O
collects. O
They're O
beautiful O
objects, O
and O
so O
are O
the O
handmade O
plates O
and O
bowls O
that O
begin O
to O
file O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen, O
each O
made O
by O
a O
potter O
or O
glass O
worker O
or O
wood O
carver O
in O
South O
Korea. O
These O
artisans O
are O
identified O
on O
the O
menu O
cards, O
whose O
abstract O
designs O
are O
the O
work O
of O
a O
South O
Korean O
artist. O
Tasting O
menus O
can O
be O
arid O
and O
sterile O
when O
a O
chef O
doesn't O
have O
much O
to O
say. O
The O
format O
comes O
to O
life O
when O
a O
restaurant O
is O
overflowing O
with O
ideas, O
like O
Atomix. O
The O
way O
the O
Parks O
put O
Korean O
culture O
in O
the O
foreground O
recalls O
the O
early O
days O
of O
the O
Four O
Seasons, O
which O
moved O
beyond O
European O
models O
of O
formal O
dining O
by O
hiring O
an O
American O
architect O
and O
American O
industrial O
designers O
to O
go O
along O
with O
the O
American O
ingredients O
and O
even O
American O
wines. O
The O
Four O
Seasons O
had O
a O
Swiss O
chef, O
though. O

The O
rise O
of O
Sichuan B-CUISINE
food O
in O
New O
York O
has O
made O
the O
past O
decade O
or O
two O
a O
glorious O
era O
for O
prowlers O
of O
Chinese B-CUISINE
restaurants. O
Chongqing B-DISH
chicken I-DISH
and O
mung-bean B-DISH
jelly I-DISH
proliferated O
as O
skilled O
chefs O
flocked O
to O
the O
city. O
But O
while O
the O
miles O
of O
dan B-DISH
dan I-DISH
noodles I-DISH
and O
mountains O
of O
Sichuan O
peppercorns O
have O
been O
exhilarating, O
they O
have O
tended O
to O
overshadow O
the O
cuisine O
of O
another O
great O
chile-haunted O
region, O
Hunan. O
Part O
of O
the O
problem O
is O
nomenclature. O
The O
word O
Hunan O
on O
a O
restaurant's O
front O
window O
tends O
to O
say O
as O
much O
about O
the O
actual O
cooking O
inside O
as O
pandas O
and O
bamboo O
on O
the O
sign. O
At O
first O
glance O
it O
can O
be O
hard O
to O
distinguish O
Hunan O
Garden, O
say, O
from O
Hunan O
House O
until O
you O
see O
the O
menus O
and O
learn O
that O
the O
former O
name O
signifies O
egg O
rolls O
while O
the O
latter O
promises O
the O
red-braised O
pork O
that O
Mao O
used O
to O
dote O
on. O
Fake O
Hunans O
outnumber O
real O
ones, O
which O
is O
one O
reason O
to O
celebrate O
the O
appearance O
of O
Hunan O
Slurp O
. O
Operating O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
since O
May, O
Hunan O
Slurp O
lives O
up O
to O
both O
halves O
of O
its O
name. O
When O
people O
in O
Hunan O
get O
hungry O
for O
a O
bowl O
of O
noodles, O
what O
they O
have O
in O
mind O
are O
mifen: O
long, O
white O
strands O
made O
from O
pounded O
rice, O
so O
smooth O
they O
may O
slither O
right O
out O
of O
the O
chopsticks O
of O
inexperienced O
slurpers. O
Chances O
for O
New O
Yorkers O
to O
practice O
their O
antiskid O
chopstick O
techniques O
have O
been O
limited, O
generally O
speaking, O
to O
the O
rice O
noodles O
of O
other O
parts O
of O
Asia. O
When O
you O
could O
find O
Hunanese O
noodles O
around O
town, O
they O
tended O
to O
be O
tucked O
away O
on O
larger O
menus O
with O
so O
many O
other O
Hunanese O
opportunities O
that O
they O
were O
rarely O
given O
a O
chance O
to O
slither. O
Hunan O
Slurp O
offers O
some O
of O
those O
opportunities, O
too. O
The O
chef O
and O
proprietor, O
Chao O
Wang, O
comes O
from O
Hunan's O
second-largest O
city, O
Hengyang, O
and O
fills O
the O
menu O
with O
both O
traditional O
Hunanese O
dishes O
and O
his O
own O
innovations. O
But O
noodles O
are O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
restaurant. O
[Read O
about O
some O
of O
the O
best O
new O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
City O
(for O
now).] O
They O
peek O
out O
from O
underneath O
slices O
of O
beef, O
tofu O
and O
barbecued O
pork, O
all O
fanned O
out O
like O
a O
hand O
of O
poker, O
in O
a O
soup-less O
wonder O
called O
Hometown O
Lu O
Fen. O
The O
sauce O
is O
in O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
bowl, O
and O
should O
absolutely O
be O
augmented O
with O
some O
of O
the O
chopped O
pickled O
red O
chiles O
in O
oil O
served O
in O
a O
small O
dish O
on O
the O
side. O
In O
the O
string O
bean O
mifen, O
the O
noodles O
weave O
around O
a O
fried O
egg O
and O
a O
scattering O
of O
ground O
Berkshire O
pork, O
stir-fried O
to O
a O
crackle O
with O
little O
rounds O
of O
sliced, O
pickled O
green O
beans. O
There O
is O
no O
slick O
of O
chile O
oil O
on O
top, O
and O
the O
pale O
broth O
looks O
harmless O
enough, O
but O
once O
the O
soup O
is O
stirred O
together O
it O
will O
take O
the O
crease O
out O
of O
a O
pair O
of O
newly O
pressed O
trousers. O
A O
little O
red O
sheaf O
of O
dried O
chile O
threads O
bobbing O
in O
the O
wild O
pepper O
and O
beef O
soup O
gives O
you O
an O
idea O
what O
you O
are O
in O
for, O
if O
the O
name O
hasn't O
already O
given O
away O
the O
game. O
But O
with O
Hunan O
Slurp's O
noodles, O
as O
with O
Hunanese O
food O
generally, O
heat O
is O
part O
of O
the O
message; O
it's O
never O
the O
medium. O
Stock O
is O
to O
the O
cook O
what O
pitch O
is O
to O
the O
opera O
singer, O
goes O
a O
Chinese O
proverb. O
Hunan O
Slurp's O
soup O
stocks O
are O
rounded O
and O
cloudy O
from O
long-boiled O
bones O
and O
meat, O
and O
they O
tend O
to O
get O
better O
the O
longer O
they O
linger O
with O
their O
toppings. O
(So O
do O
the O
noodles.) O
A O
master O
class O
in O
the O
art O
of O
broth O
subtlety O
is O
provided O
by O
the O
two-part O
soup O
that O
goes O
by O
the O
under-promising O
name O
fish O
fillet O
mifen. O
Part O
One O
is O
an O
oversize O
ceramic O
bowl O
of O
milky O
white O
pork-and-fish O
stock O
strewn O
with O
flower O
petals, O
pea O
shoots, O
purple O
basil O
and O
other O
fresh O
herbs. O
It O
arrives O
on O
a O
wooden O
tray O
next O
to O
Part O
Two, O
the O
noodles, O
which O
get O
their O
own O
bowl. O
The O
broth's O
flavor O
was O
elusive O
at O
first, O
more O
a O
texture O
than O
a O
taste. O
Within O
minutes O
the O
steamed O
fish O
in O
the O
broth, O
together O
with O
the O
herbs, O
had O
transformed O
it O
into O
something O
splendid. O
Like O
many O
of O
the O
new O
Chinese O
restaurants O
that O
have O
sprouted O
in O
the O
East O
Village, O
Hunan O
Slurp O
pays O
attention O
to O
appearances. O
Under O
a O
backlighted O
logo O
that O
spells O
out O
SLURP O
in O
elongated, O
noodly O
letters, O
a O
sheet O
of O
glass O
on O
First O
Avenue O
frames O
the O
long, O
tunneled O
dining O
room, O
designed O
by O
New O
Practice O
Studio O
. O
The O
interior O
is O
sheathed O
in O
wooden O
slats O
that O
run O
up O
one O
wall, O
arch O
their O
way O
across O
the O
ceiling O
and O
fall O
down O
the O
opposite O
wall. O
Depending O
on O
your O
frame O
of O
mind, O
eating O
at O
Hunan O
Slurp O
can O
feel O
like O
sitting O
under O
a O
rack O
of O
drying O
noodles O
or O
finding O
yourself O
inside O
the O
belly O
of O
a O
particularly O
tidy O
whale. O
A O
glassed-in O
kitchen O
lies O
in O
the O
back, O
its O
shelves O
stacked O
with O
colorfully O
glazed O
modern O
Chinese O
plates O
and O
bowls O
that O
you O
won't O
find O
in O
the O
restaurant-supply O
shops O
on O
the O
Bowery. O
Once O
you O
leave O
the O
noodle O
section O
of O
the O
menu O
behind, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
find O
cooking O
that O
doesn't O
necessarily O
live O
up O
to O
the O
standard O
set O
by O
the O
crockery. O
I'm O
told O
that O
the O
bands O
of O
cumin-seasoned O
beef O
speared O
with O
toothpicks O
can O
be O
crisp O
and O
well-browned, O
but O
the O
ones O
I O
got O
were O
gray O
and O
floppy. O
And O
the O
sweet-and-sour O
spareribs, O
an O
appetizer, O
were O
far O
more O
sweet O
than O
sour, O
and O
tough, O
too. O
On O
the O
best O
available O
evidence, O
Mr. O
Wang's O
palate O
skews O
a O
bit O
sweet. O
This O
is O
unusual O
in O
a O
Hunanese O
kitchen, O
but O
only O
those O
spareribs O
were O
off-puttingly O
sugary. O
A O
multicolored O
salad O
of O
chilled O
cherry O
tomatoes O
was O
bright O
and O
refreshing O
despite O
a O
fruity O
marination O
in O
plum O
juice. O
(A O
similar O
dish O
sometimes O
turns O
up O
at O
Hao O
Noodle O
and O
Tea O
by O
Madam O
Zhu's O
Kitchen O
, O
where O
it O
is O
sweeter, O
and O
still O
very O
enjoyable.) O
And O
the O
hint O
of O
sugar O
in O
stir-fried O
chicken O
did O
not O
soften O
the O
toothy O
bite O
of O
young O
ginger, O
or O
hide O
the O
ginger's O
natural O
sweetness, O
either. O
You O
may O
not O
notice O
the O
bias O
toward O
sweetness O
anyway, O
given O
the O
kitchen's O
open O
embrace O
of O
chiles. O
An O
electrical O
current O
of O
heat O
crackles O
through O
the O
dim-sum-style O
chicken O
feet, O
cooked O
until O
they O
are O
falling-off-the-toe O
tender. O
Bright O
green O
chiles O
animate O
a O
stir-fry O
of O
julienne O
potatoes, O
cooked O
so O
fast O
they're O
still O
stiff. O
They O
also O
bring O
not O
just O
spice O
but O
crunch O
to O
a O
classic O
Hunanese O
sauté O
of O
pork O
and O
garlic O
topped O
with O
an O
egg O
fried O
to O
a O
ruffled, O
golden O
crisp. O
The O
chiles O
knocked O
around O
in O
a O
very O
hot O
wok O
with O
sweet, O
juicy O
cabbage O
are O
small, O
red, O
sun-dried O
and O
noticeably O
fruity O
under O
their O
mouth-zapping O
heat. O
The O
spice O
level O
is O
more O
subdued O
in O
the O
excellent O
stir-fry O
of O
pork O
and O
smoked O
tofu, O
and O
it's O
almost O
undetectable O
in O
a O
very O
likable O
preparation O
of O
skinny O
eggplant O
sections O
topped O
with O
discs O
of O
bell O
pepper; O
the O
skins O
are O
left O
on O
the O
eggplants, O
which O
gives O
the O
appetizer O
something O
of O
the O
appearance O
of O
tuna O
maki O
wrapped O
with O
purple O
seaweed. O
Meals O
tend O
to O
move O
quickly. O
For O
this O
you O
may O
be O
thankful O
on O
busy O
nights O
when O
those O
wood O
slats O
go O
from O
attractive O
design O
elements O
to O
unnervingly O
effective O
sounding O
boards. O
As O
in O
other O
Chinese O
restaurants O
in O
the O
neighborhood, O
the O
crowd O
tends O
to O
be O
young, O
bright, O
quick O
and O
eager O
to O
get O
on O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
evening. O
As O
the O
dinner O
rush O
ends, O
the O
howl O
subsides. O
Maybe O
ice O
cream O
is O
on O
the O
agenda, O
or O
a O
classic O
dessert O
soup O
of O
mung O
beans O
and O
barley O
in O
syrup. O
Or O
maybe O
a O
pot O
of O
tea, O
loose-leaf, O
brewed O
at O
the O
table O
while O
you O
think O
about O
chiles O
and O
rice O
and O
pork O
and O
wonder O
how O
many O
more O
Hunanese O
chefs O
can O

Earlier O
this O
year O
Henry, B-EST
a O
new O
restaurant O
in O
the O
lobby O
of O
the O
Life B-LOC
Hotel I-LOC
on O
West B-LOC
31st I-LOC
Street, I-LOC
quietly O
died. O
You O
wouldn't O
know O
it O
to O
look O
around O
the O
place O
on O
any O
recent O
night O
at O
8, O
when O
a O
seamless O
playlist O
of O
hip-hop O
and O
R&B O
unspools O
as O
servers O
carry O
stacked O
beef B-FOOD
ribs I-FOOD
to O
what O
seems O
like O
every O
third O
table. O
What O
changed? O
In O
August, O
the O
chef O
Joseph O
Johnson O
, O
better O
known O
as O
JJ, O
was O
made O
a O
partner O
and O
assumed O
control O
of O
the O
kitchen. O
What O
he O
has O
done O
is O
less O
a O
makeover O
than O
a O
takeover; O
his O
imprint O
radiates O
out O
from O
his O
Afrocentric O
menu O
to O
animate O
the O
whole O
enterprise. O
The O
playlist, O
which O
can O
run O
from O
noon O
until O
8 O
the O
next O
morning O
without O
repeating O
a O
track, O
is O
his. O
Mr. O
Johnson's O
initials O
now O
hang O
in O
the O
front O
window, O
flooding O
the O
nearby O
tables O
with O
pink O
neon. O
The O
initials O
have O
migrated O
to O
the O
restaurant's O
website O
as O
well, O
where O
its O
name O
is O
now O
given O
as O
Henry B-EST
at I-EST
Life I-EST
Hotel I-EST
by I-EST
JJ I-EST
. O
These O
are O
not O
subtle O
gestures, O
but O
subtlety O
has O
rarely O
saved O
a O
restaurant O
on O
the O
brink O
of O
failure. O
Mr. O
Johnson O
has O
been O
busy O
hiring O
new O
employees O
for O
the O
front O
and O
back O
of O
the O
house, O
and O
the O
racial O
mix O
he O
has O
already O
achieved O
is O
as O
impressive O
as O
it O
is O
rare. O
Diversifying O
a O
restaurant's O
service O
staff O
is O
one O
of O
the O
surest O
ways O
to O
diversify O
the O
audience, O
and O
on O
many O
nights O
brown O
faces O
and O
white O
faces, O
topknots O
and O
braids, O
headscarves O
and O
headbands, O
sit O
side O
by O
side, O
giving O
Henry B-EST
more O
the O
appearance O
of O
a O
restaurant O
in O
Harlem B-LOC
than O
of O
one O
just O
off O
Herald B-LOC
Square. I-LOC
It O
was O
in O
Harlem, B-LOC
as O
chef O
de O
cuisine O
at O
a O
slinky O
neighborhood O
hangout O
called O
the O
Cecil B-EST
and O
the O
history-drenched O
jazz O
supper O
club O
Minton's B-EST
, O
that O
Mr. O
Johnson O
made O
his O
name. O
Fleshing O
out O
a O
notion O
suggested O
by O
Alexander O
Smalls, O
the O
consulting O
chef O
in O
both O
places, O
Mr. O
Johnson O
explored O
the O
African O
diaspora, O
the O
imprint O
that O
Africans O
have O
put O
on O
cooking O
around O
the O
world. O
He O
does O
something O
similar O
at O
Henry, B-EST
although O
his O
view O
has O
grown O
to O
embrace O
flavors O
from, O
say, O
India B-EST
and O
Southeast B-EST
Asia I-EST
that O
turn O
up O
in O
Africa B-EST
and O
in O
diasporic O
countries O
like O
Jamaica B-EST
and O
Barbados. B-EST
He O
calls O
the O
menu O
at O
Henry B-EST
"Pan-African." B-CUISINE

This O
is O
a O
big O
story O
-- O
too O
big O
to O
be O
told O
in O
full O
by O
one O
restaurant, O
or O
two O
for O
that O
matter. O
But O
it's O
an O
important O
story, O
and O
it O
certainly O
beats O
Henry's B-EST
original O
idea O
of O
tying O
the O
restaurant O
to O
the O
history O
of O
Life O
magazine, O
which O
was O
once O
published O
in O
the O
same O
building, O
and O
to O
Henry O
Luce O
, O
who O
bought O
it O
in O
1936, O
then O
radically O
remade O
it O
and O
moved O
it O
to O
other O
quarters. O
This O
concept O
was O
so O
wispy O
that O
Henry's B-EST
first O
chef, O
Michael O
Vignola, O
resorted O
to O
an O
all-things-to-all-people O
menu O
of O
foie B-DISH
gras I-DISH
sliders I-DISH
and O
meatball O
pizza. O
Just O
how O
vast O
Mr. O
Johnson's O
scope O
has O
become O
will O
be O
clear O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
appetizer O
course. O
(Here O
I O
am O
assuming O
that O
you O
have O
chosen O
a O
traditional O
two- O
or O
three-course O
meal O
rather O
than O
eating O
all O
15 O
items O
on O
the O
menu, O
in O
full O
and O
in O
order; O
this O
route O
costs O
$390 O
and O
is O
called O
"It O
Was O
All O
a O
Dream," O
after O
a O
Notorious O
B.I.G. O
lyric.) O
There O
are O
littleneck O
clams, O
battered O
with O
rice O
flour O
and O
crunchy O
with O
shaved O
fennel O
and O
Asian O
pear. O
All O
of O
this O
is O
dotted O
with O
a O
tangerine-colored O
fluff O
of O
piri-piri O
sauce O
that O
is O
less O
ferociously O
spicy O
than O
the O
scalding O
piri-piris O
of O
Angola, O
Mozambique O
or O
South O
Africa. O
You O
are O
welcome O
to O
get O
a O
half-dozen, O
but O
at O
my O
table O
a O
full O
dozen O
went O
quickly. O
Benne O
seeds, O
the O
heirloom O
variety O
of O
sesame O
brought O
to O
North O
America O
on O
slave O
ships, O
add O
a O
flavor O
that O
is O
something O
like O
toasted O
almonds O
mixed O
with O
coffee O
beans O
to O
tuna O
tartare. O
The O
tuna O
is O
topped O
with O
a O
chip O
of O
curried O
peanut O
brittle O
and O
spooned O
over O
shiso O
leaves; O
you O
pinch O
the O
leaf O
and O
pop O
it O
in O
your O
mouth, O
where O
good O
things O
start O
to O
happen. O
And O
as O
you're O
adjusting O
to O
this O
cross-pollination O
of O
Africa O
and O
Japan, O
Indo-Caribbean O
cuisine O
appears O
on O
the O
horizon: O
a O
plate O
of O
folded O
roti O
with O
dips. O
The O
spinach O
chutney O
is O
a O
little O
joyless, O
but O
the O
inky O
purée O
of O
eggplant O
sweetened O
with O
dates O
is O
a O
terrific O
idea. O
Why O
Mr. O
Johnson O
puts O
a O
fried O
egg O
on O
the O
roti O
is O
unclear. O
When O
your O
meal O
at O
Henry O
is O
over, O
you O
may O
wish O
you O
had O
been O
sent O
home O
with O
a O
world O
map O
showing O
the O
history O
of O
forced O
African O
migration O
and O
spice-trade O
routes. O
While O
it's O
going O
on, O
though, O
you O
generally O
flow O
with O
the O
inner O
logic O
the O
way O
you O
can O
get O
into O
a O
hip-hop O
track O
without O
being O
able O
to O
name O
every O
last O
sample. O
Generally, O
but O
not O
always. O
I O
believe O
I O
understood O
some O
of O
the O
reasoning O
behind O
chopped O
collard O
greens O
and O
cashews O
tossed O
with O
a O
coconut O
dressing, O
but O
I O
still O
find O
raw O
collards O
somewhat O
rough O
going O
after O
the O
first O
few O
mouthfuls. O
Is O
the O
seared O
salmon O
with O
rice O
noodles, O
edamame O
and O
bok O
choy O
a O
reference O
to O
the O
Vietnamese O
community O
in O
Senegal? O
To O
me O
it O
tasted, O
not O
unpleasantly, O
like O
something O
one O
of O
the O
better O
Asian O
fusion O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
would O
have O
served O
20 O
years O
ago. O
Henry's O
shrimp O
and O
pork O
dumplings, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
are O
nondescript O
little O
blobs; O
they O
sit O
in O
an O
aromatic O
"Harlem O
curry," O
informed O
by O
Bengali O
cooking, O
that O
deserves O
a O
better O
dance O
partner. O
You O
could O
say O
the O
same O
about O
the O
intensely O
herb-scented O
seafood O
broth O
in O
a O
seafood O
boil O
that O
Mr. O
Johnson O
calls O
the O
Afropot; O
the O
clams O
and O
king O
crab O
legs O
were O
very O
good, O
but O
the O
prawns O
were O
unappealingly O
soft O
and O
the O
mussels O
not O
quite O
fleshy O
enough. O
The O
cooking, O
though, O
has O
been O
getting O
tighter O
over O
the O
past O
month, O
picking O
up O
from O
a O
first O
and O
somewhat O
droopy O
meal O
on O
a O
night O
when O
Mr. O
Johnson O
was O
not O
in O
the O
kitchen. O
Tamarind O
jerk O
chicken O
had O
no O
spice O
to O
speak O
of. O
A O
parcel O
of O
rice O
supposedly O
inspired O
by O
Dominican O
concón O
had O
as O
much O
crunch O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
left O
out O
on O
the O
counter O
overnight, O
and O
the O
eggplant O
curry O
ladled O
over O
it O
tasted O
more O
like O
a O
halfheartedly O
seasoned O
tomato O
sauce. O
The O
second O
time O
I O
tried O
it, O
the O
rice O
had O
a O
golden O
crackle O
and O
the O
curry O
was O
worth O
paying O
attention O
to. O
Apart O
from O
the O
seared O
scallops O
in O
a O
remarkably O
good O
hominy O
broth O
with O
cilantro O
pistou, O
those O
bone-in O
ribs O
are O
the O
most O
rewarding O
main O
course. O
The O
rewards O
are O
not O
so O
much O
the O
short O
ribs O
themselves, O
though O
they O
are O
flavorful O
and O
tender; O
the O
thrill O
of O
the O
dish O
is O
in O
the O
battery O
of O
little O
sides O
like O
stir-fried O
millet, O
spiced O
black O
beans O
and O
a O
hoisin O
sauce O
I O
wanted O
to O
take O
home O
to O
keep O
on O
hand O
for O
Chinese-food O
emergencies. O
I O
also O
thought O
about O
pocketing O
a O
Foie O
Crispy O
Treat, O
and O
I O
would O
have O
gotten O
away O
with O
it O
because O
everybody O
else O
at O
the O
table O
thought O
they O
were O
too O
weird. O
Weird O
they O
are, O
but O
interesting, O
too. O
Maybe O
you'd O
be O
happier O
with O
the O
sweet O
potato O
pie O
in O
a O
crisp O
butter O
crust, O
very O
old O
school O
apart O
from O
the O
purple O
yam O
in O
the O
filling. O
True, O
at O
some O
point O
in O
your O
meal O
a O
hotel O
guest O
may O
decide O
to O
march O
through O
the O
dining O
room O
with O
a O
full O
set O
of O
luggage. O
But O
under O
Mr. O
Johnson, O
Henry O
is O
under O
no O
risk O
of O
being O
capsized O
by O
that O
kind O
of O
distraction. O
He O
has O
pulled O
the O
restaurant O
back O
from O
the O
edge O
of O
failure, O
and O
that's O
a O
rare O
trick. O

For O
most O
of O
its O
time O
on O
earth, O
the O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
slice O
has O
not O
been O
seen O
as O
a O
product O
that O
needed O
tinkering. O
Yes, O
pizza B-FOOD
in O
the O
city O
has O
been O
accessorized O
with O
toppings O
from O
crayfish B-FOOD
(not O
bad) O
to O
Buffalo B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
(hmm) O
to O
Caesar B-FOOD
salad I-FOOD
(no, O
no, O
no, O
no, O
no). O
But O
the O
foldable, O
portable O
triangles O
of O
cheese, B-FOOD
sauce B-FOOD
and O
dough B-FOOD
themselves O
were O
generally O
held O
to O
be O
a O
natural O
resource O
that O
was O
perfect O
as O
is, O
much O
like O
the O
soft, O
unfiltered O
city O
tap O
water O
claimed O
to O
be O
the O
source O
of O
their O
excellence. O
Some O
pizzerias O
try O
to O
make O
a O
better O
slice. O
Very O
few O
try O
to O
make O
a O
different O
slice. O
Mama's O
Too O
makes O
a O
different O
slice. O
It O
combines O
some O
of O
the O
most O
appealing O
elements O
of O
a O
Neapolitan O
pie O
with O
the O
most O
satisfying O
aspects O
of O
the O
archetypal O
product O
sold O
on O
paper O
plates O
from O
sidewalk O
windows. O
It O
is O
as O
if O
Frank O
Tuttolomondo, O
the O
owner O
and O
pie O
architect O
of O
this O
informal O
but O
very O
serious O
pizzeria O
on O
the O
Upper O
West O
Side, O
has O
learned O
how O
to O
genetically O
modify O
pizza. O
The O
bulge O
of O
crust O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
what O
Mama's O
Too O
calls O
the O
"house O
slice" O
is O
brown, O
more O
rough O
than O
smooth O
and O
baked O
to O
a O
ferocious O
crackle. O
You O
could O
tear O
it O
off O
and O
enjoy O
it O
on O
its O
own, O
or O
maybe O
with O
butter O
or O
olive O
oil, O
just O
as O
you O
can O
with O
the O
best O
Neapolitans. O
Yet O
the O
flat O
layer O
of O
crust O
on O
the O
bottom O
is O
firm, O
without O
the O
soupy O
center O
of O
the O
Neapolitan O
style. O
True O
to O
New O
York O
form, O
you O
can O
hold O
it O
in O
the O
air O
by O
the O
curved O
rim O
and O
it O
will O
stay O
flat O
and O
parallel O
to O
the O
floor. O
As O
they O
do O
at O
Totonno's O
and O
some O
other O
brick-oven O
pizzerias, O
Mr. O
Tuttolomondo O
lays O
the O
cheese O
down O
before O
the O
sauce. O
Rather O
than O
drippy, O
milky O
discs O
of O
fresh O
mozzarella, O
though, O
he O
covers O
the O
raw O
dough O
(after O
priming O
it O
with O
olive O
oil) O
in O
shreds O
of O
a O
slice-friendly O
variety O
that O
is O
known O
in O
the O
trade O
as O
low-moisture O
mozzarella O
and O
that O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
call O
pizza O
cheese. O
Over O
this, O
he O
ladles O
a O
few O
blots O
of O
tomato O
pulp. O
This O
helps O
the O
crust O
to O
bake O
through O
without O
getting O
soggy, O
keeps O
the O
cheese O
from O
sliding O
off O
the O
crust, O
and O
most O
of O
all O
lets O
you O
taste O
the O
tomatoes, O
which O
are O
very O
good. O
You O
could, O
I O
suppose, O
think O
of O
the O
house O
slice O
as O
a O
white O
pizza O
with O
tomato-sauce O
topping. O
After O
the O
pie O
comes O
out O
of O
the O
oven, O
Mr. O
Tuttolomondo O
sprinkles O
it O
with O
grated O
two-year-old O
Parmigiano-Reggiano. O
Basil O
leaves O
are O
the O
last O
to O
go O
on. O
At O
this O
point, O
you O
can O
pay, O
walk O
out O
the O
door O
and O
amble O
toward O
Broadway O
and O
106th O
Street O
cradling O
your O
slice O
in O
a O
paper O
plate O
and O
taking O
bites O
as O
you O
go. O
In O
other O
words, O
you O
can O
have O
the O
traditional O
sidewalk O
pizza O
experience, O
but O
you O
will O
be O
tasting O
flavors O
you O
normally O
find O
only O
in O
high-minded O
sit-down O
pizzerias O
like O
Sorbillo O
, O
Ops O
or O
Una O
Pizza O
Napoletana O
. O
Those O
bloodhounds O
who O
follow O
the O
city's O
melted-mozzarella O
trail O
will O
recognize O
that O
Mama's O
Too O
is O
part O
of O
a O
great O
reawakening O
of O
slice O
culture. O
Unlike O
brick-oven O
pizza, O
which O
came O
from O
Europe O
and O
relied O
on O
preindustrial O
technology, O
the O
New O
York O
slice O
is O
a O
lowly O
American O
hybrid. O
It O
is O
baked O
in O
gas O
ovens, O
and O
the O
sheer O
number O
of O
places O
selling O
it O
suggests O
that O
it O
requires O
no O
special O
skill. O
When O
it O
is O
praised, O
we O
don't O
talk O
about O
its O
artisanal O
roots; O
we O
call O
it O
the O
humble O
slice, O
the O
street-corner O
slice, O
the O
slice O
of O
the O
common O
man O
and O
woman. O
The O
ordinary O
slice O
and O
its O
heftier O
cousin, O
the O
Sicilian-style O
square, O
were O
probably O
first O
rehabilitated O
with O
superior O
ingredients O
and O
a O
sophisticated O
understanding O
of O
baking O
by O
Best O
Pizza O
in O
Williamsburg, O
Brooklyn, O
in O
2010. O
Today, O
serious O
pizza O
hobbyists O
talk O
about O
their O
favorite O
slices O
by O
reeling O
off O
the O
dough's O
rising O
time O
and O
hydration O
levels. O
North O
Brooklyn O
is O
still O
the O
center O

neoclassical O

movement, O

and, O
most O
recently, O

the O
forward-thinking O

is O

in O
Manhattan, O
too, O
at O
Scarr's O
on O
the O
Lower O
East O
Side O
and O
Corner O
Slice O
in O
the O
Gotham O
West O
Market. O
The O
goal O
of O
the O
neoclassicists O
is, O
essentially, O
to O
return O
to O
the O
golden O
age O
of O
New O
York O
takeout O
pizza, O
which O
survives O
at O
places O
like O
Di O
Fara O
in O
Midwood, O
Brooklyn, O
one O
of O
the O
holy O
sites O
of O
the O
neoclassical O
church. O
Paulie O
Gee's O
Slice O
Shop, O
Scarr's O
and O
other O
neoclassicist O
joints O
cultivate O
a O
self-consciously O
vintage O
atmosphere, O
styling O
their O
logos O
and O
signs O
and O
interiors O
so O
they O
look O
like O
a O
place O
where O
Johnny O
Boy O
and O
Charlie O
in O
"Mean O
Streets" O
might O
have O
gone O
for O
a O
pepperoni O
slice O
and O
a O
Coke. O
Mr. O
Tuttolomondo O
does O
not O
fetishize O
the O
past. O
Perhaps O
this O
is O
because O
he O
lived O
it. O
For O
almost O
60 O
years O
his O
family O
has O
owned O
a O
series O
of O
old-school O
slice O
joints O
in O
the O
neighborhood. O
The O
current O
incarnation O
is O
literally O
on O
a O
street O
corner, O
at O
the O
intersection O
of O
106th O
Street O
and O
Amsterdam O
Avenue. O
It O
is O
called O
Mama's O
Pizza O
. O
He O
didn't O
open O
Mama's O
Too O
a O
block O
away O
to O
outdo O
his O
parents; O
he's O
bringing O
their O
product O
into O
a O
new O
era. O
If O
the O
neoclassicists O
are O
like O
the O
folk O
revivalists O
who O
collected O
old O
acoustic O
78s, O
he O
is O
Dylan O
at O
the O
Newport O
Folk O
Festival O
in O
1965. O
When O
Mama's O
Too O
opened O
in O
December, O
it O
also O
served O
housemade O
pasta. O
It's O
still O
on O
the O
menu O
board O
that O
hangs O
on O
one O
wall, O
but O
Mr. O
Tuttolomondo O
has O
stopped O
serving O
it O
to O
concentrate O
on O
pizza. O
Besides O
the O
house O
slice, O
he O
also O
makes O
squares O
that O
he O
sees O
as O
a O
marriage O
of O
rectangular O
Sicilian O
pizza O
with O
Roman O
pizza O
al O
taglio. O
The O
crust O
is O
much O
taller O
than O
the O
Roman O
style, O
and O
taller O
than O
some O
Sicilians, O
too, O
but O
it O
is O
airy O
and O
chewy. O
On O
the O
bottom O
it O
has O
the O
bronze O
color, O
the O
cratered O
surface O
and O
the O
pan-fried O
crunch O
of O
the O
bread O
on O
a O
grilled O
cheese O
sandwich. O
The O
edges, O
where O
the O
dough O
meets O
the O
pan, O
have O
a O
gold O
fringe O
of O
browned O
cheese, O
known O
among O
students O
of O
pizza O
styles O
as O
a O
"frico O
crust." O
This O
fringe O
is, O
of O
course, O
crunchy O
and O
delicious. O
The O
most O
impressive O
square O
is, O
I O
think, O
the O
pepperoni. O
Unlike O
most O
of O
the O
others, O
it O
incorporates O
tomato O
sauce. O
The O
mozzarella O
is O
baked O
until O
it O
begins O
to O
brown. O
The O
pepperoni O
slices O
are O
small O
and O
concave, O
like O
contact O
lenses O
made O
of O
meat. O
Crunchy O
around O
the O
rims, O
these O
little O
cups O
are O
half-filled O
with O
spicy O
red O
oil. O
It O
may O
sound O
as O
if O
I O
approached O
this O
slice O
with O
cool, O
analytical O
detachment. O
The O
truth O
is O
I O
ripped O
into O
it O
like O
a O
pack O
of O
hyenas. O
The O
other O
squares O
tend O
to O
be O
white O
pies O
with O
toppings. O
Again, O
tomato O
sauce O
is O
one O
of O
the O
toppings. O
In O
one O
case O
it's O
a O
thick O
and O
creamy O
layer O
of O
vodka O
sauce, O
one O
of O
the O
ideas O
that O
separates O
Mama's O
Too O
from O
the O
neoclassicists. O
Mr. O
Tuttolomondo O
also O
makes O
a O
cacio O
e O
pepe O
Sicilian O
pie, O
essentially O
a O
four-cheese O
pizza O
in O
which O
one O
of O
the O
cheeses O
is O
pecorino; O
the O
whole O
slice O
hums O
with O
black O
pepper. O
The O
square O
topped O
with O
Gorgonzola O
dolce O
and O
pears O
works O
in O
a O
way O
that O
combination O
often O
doesn't, O
although O
half O
a O
slice O
was O
enough O
for O
me. O
The O
shop O
is O
small, O
and O
if O
you O
sit O
at O
one O
of O
the O
handful O
of O
red O
counter O
stools O
you O
will O
share O
the O
small O
tiled O
floor O
up O
front O
with O
neighbors O
waiting O
for O
takeout O
and O
delivery O
guys. O
There O
are O
no O
vintage O
soda O
refrigerators O
or O
letterboard O
signs, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
small O
photograph O
of O
Robert O
De O
Niro O
eating O
pizza O
and O
a O
much O
bigger O
one O
of O
John O
Travolta O
in O
"Saturday O
Night O
Fever," O
biting O
into O
his O
double-decker O
slice. O
The O
picture O
is O
in O
black O
and O
white O
except O
for O
the O
pizza. O
Tinted O
orange O
and O
red, O
it O
glows O
like O
a O
beacon. O


-DOCSTART- O

Almost O
everybody O
is O
calling O
Misi B-EST
, O
the O
latest O
endeavor O
from O
the O
chef O
Missy O
Robbins, O
a O
pasta B-TYPE
restaurant. I-TYPE
That's O
not O
quite O
right. O
Yes, O
Ms. O
Robbins O
has O
given O
half O
of O
her O
menu O
over O
to O
long O
noodles B-FOOD
and O
short O
ones; O
strands O
of O
linguine B-FOOD
with O
chopped O
garlic B-FOOD
and O
a O
double O
dose O
of O
fish B-FOOD
in O
the O
form O
of O
chopped O
anchovies O
and O
drizzled O
colatura; O
circles O
filled O
with O
ricotta O
whipped O
until O
it O
is O
as O
soft O
as O
cream; O
pinched O
rings O
of O
tortelli O
stuffed O
with O
mascarpone O
and O
spinach; O
the O
deeply O
ridged O
Sardinian O
shells O
known O
as O
malloreddus; O
and O
other O
Italian O
marvels O
of O
starch O
formation. O
True, O
anybody O
who O
has O
been O
to O
Ms. O
Robbins's O
other O
restaurant, O
Lilia O
, O
also O
located O
in O
Williamsburg, O
Brooklyn, O
knows O
that O
the O
pasta O
there O
reliably O
steals O
the O
show O
from O
everything O
else O
on O
the O
table. O
When O
those O
people O
show O
up O
at O
Misi, O
odds O
are O
good O
that O
they O
will O
not O
have O
chosen O
that O
day O
to O
start O
a O
keto O
diet. O
Moreover, O
Misi O
has O
a O
greater O
variety O
of O
pasta O
than O
Lilia, O
so O
many O
that O
the O
architecture O
makes O
space O
for O
them. O
Misi O
is O
across O
the O
street O
from O
the O
old O
Domino O
refinery O
on O
the O
East O
River, O
where O
the O
cranes O
used O
to O
unload O
sugar O
from O
barges O
in O
the O
open O
air O
so O
that O
on O
days O
when O
the O
wind O
was O
right O
you O
could O
taste O
it O
on O
your O
tongue O
a O
mile O
away. O
Next O
to O
the O
dining O
room, O
facing O
the O
factory's O
remains, O
is O
a O
separate, O
glassed-in O
workshop O
where O
the O
temperature O
and O
humidity O
are O
kept O
at O
consistent O
dough-friendly O
levels. O
There, O
the O
long O
noodles, O
etc., O
are O
rolled O
out O
and O
cut O
long O
before O
5:30 O
each O
night, O
when O
Misi's O
front O
door O
is O
unlocked O
and O
the O
crowd O
waiting O
in O
line O
for O
walk-in O
seats O
begins O
to O
snake O
eagerly O
forward. O
And O
to O
be O
sure, O
if O
you O
watch O
Ms. O
Robbins O
and O
her O
kitchen O
crew O
at O
the O
end O
of O
one O
of O
two O
long O
dining O
counters, O
you'll O
see O
the O
same O
quick O
motion O
over O
and O
over: O
an O
almost O
surreptitiously O
quick O
trip O
of O
hand O
to O
mouth, O
a O
sharp O
bite O
and O
an O
appraising O
chew O
to O
decide O
if O
that O
batch O
of O
pasta O
is O
ready O
to O
be O
pulled O
from O
the O
water. O
Some O
chefs O
show O
their O
mastery O
over O
pasta O
by O
pressing O
it O
thinner O
than O
a O
screen O
protector O
for O
an O
iPhone. O
Ms. O
Robbins O
likes O
hers O
to O
have O
body O
and O
heft, O
and O
the O
chew O
test O
is O
the O
most O
reliable O
way O
to O
tell O
when O
thick O
pasta O
like O
that O
is O
ready. O
You O
are O
very O
unlikely O
to O
get O
a O
piece O
that O
is O
undercooked O
at O
its O
core, O
or O
one O
that O
doesn't O
fight O
back O
enough O
to O
let O
you O
know O
it O
is O
still O
alive. O
You O
get O
this O
just-in-between O
texture O
in O
the O
stubs O
of O
mezze O
rigatoni O
with O
a O
simple, O
glossy, O
ripe O
tomato O
sauce O
that's O
been O
stewed O
with O
whole O
garlic O
cloves O
-- O
30 O
to O
a O
batch, O
according O
to O
the O
menu. O
You O
get O
it O
again O
in O
the O
corzetti, O
discs O
about O
the O
diameter O
of O
a O
Red O
Bull O
can O
that O
are O
pressed O
with O
a O
wooden O
stamp O
to O
give O
them O
a O
target O
pattern. O
In O
October, O
Misi O
served O
these O
ridged O
coins O
with O
another O
tomato O
sauce, O
this O
one O
barely O
cooked, O
just O
some O
Sungold O
tomatoes O
warmed O
until O
they O
broke O
open O
and O
their O
yellow O
pulp O
spilled O
out. O
Fresh O
basil, O
thyme O
and O
chervil O
were O
scattered O
over O
the O
top, O
as O
good O
an O
illustration O
as O
any O
of O
how O
Ms. O
Robbins O
makes O
her O
food O
stand O
out O
without O
deviating O
from O
an O
Italian O
reliance O
on O
simple, O
unmanipulated O
ingredients. O
But O
to O
call O
Misi O
a O
pasta O
restaurant O
would O
be O
to O
overlook O
its O
highly O
impressive O
work O
with O
vegetables. O
They O
are O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
menu's O
other O
half, O
sneakily O
headlined O
"antipasti." O
This O
is O
where O
you O
will O
find O
a O
globe O
eggplant O
roasted O
until O
it O
is O
as O
soft O
and O
easy O
to O
spread O
as O
cream O
cheese; O
the O
cut O
surfaces O
are O
dressed O
with O
Calabrian O
chiles, O
and O
the O
taste O
of O
lemon O
juice O
seems O
to O
have O
found O
its O
way O
to O
the O
center O
of O
the O
eggplant. O
There O
are O
fleshy O
and O
firm O
chanterelles, O
too, O
lightly O
pickled O
and O
preserved O
in O
olive O
oil O
until O
they're O
brought O
to O
the O
table O
crisscrossed O
with O
rosemary O
needles. O
Grilled O
runner O
beans O
with O
garlic O
and O
chiles O
have O
been O
around O
lately, O
too, O
in O
a O
big O
heap O
that O
I O
would O
have O
enjoyed O
more O
if O
a O
few O
stringy, O
leathery O
beans O
had O
not O
gotten O
past O
the O
inspectors O
in O
the O
kitchen. O
Like O
the O
pastas, O
Misi's O
vegetables O
tend O
to O
bring O
together O
only O
a O
few O
ingredients, O
often O
applied O
in O
ways O
you O
don't O
quite O
expect. O
I O
don't O
know O
where O
else O
you O
will O
taste O
pistachios O
and O
anchovies O
combined O
with O
skinny, O
leaf-bud-green O
leeks O
marinated O
in O
vinegar, O
or O
a O
kind O
of O
panzanella O
made O
with O
grilled O
bread, O
capers, O
fresh O
oregano O
and O
chunks O
of O
zucchini O
that O
are O
still O
tender O
after O
a O
quick O
poaching O
in O
olive O
oil. O
And O
though O
the O
gently O
roasted O
tomatoes O
won't O
come O
back O
to O
the O
menu O
until O
next O
summer, O
you O
can O
try O
imagining O
how O
their O
dusting O
of O
fennel O
seeds O
and O
cracked O
coriander O
seeds O
responds O
to O
a O
last-minute O
squirt O
of O
spicy O
honey. O
There O
are O
enough O
of O
these O
vegetables, O
and O
enough O
meatless O
pastas, O
that O
a O
vegetarian O
could O
eat O
extremely O
well O
at O
Misi O
just O
by O
watching O
out O
for O
things O
like O
bottarga O
and O
staying O
away O
entirely O
from O
the O
creamy O
pork O
sugo O
tossed O
with O
strangozzi. O
(Meat O
eaters, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
may O
find O
the O
sugo O
helps O
restore O
chafed O
nerves.) O
Although O
Misi O
doesn't O
let O
its O
kitchen O
range O
as O
widely O
as O
Lilia's, O
it O
is O
a O
more O
successful O
restaurant O
in O
several O
ways. O
The O
menu O
has O
been O
distilled O
down O
to O
essentials, O
and O
the O
whole O
enterprise O
seems O
more O
carefully O
thought O
through. O
The O
restaurant O
is O
on O
the O
ground O
floor O
of O
a O
new O
apartment O
building O
by O
SHoP O
Architects O
, O
who O
chose O
to O
leave O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
middle O
that O
you O
could O
fly O
a O
helicopter O
through. O
The O
developer, O
Two O
Trees O
, O
recruited O
Ms. O
Robbins O
and O
her O
business O
partner, O
Sean O
Feeney, O
and O
gave O
them O
a O
chance O
to O
build O
the O
virgin O
space O
to O
their O
needs. O
The O
acoustics O
are O
better O
than O
at O
Lilia, O
and O
traffic O
between O
tables O
flows O
more O
smoothly. O
The O
interior O
is O
unusually O
good, O
with O
narrow O
horizontal O
wall O
tiles O
in O
white O
and O
nooks O
for O
stacked O
plates O
that O
make O
them O
part O
of O
the O
décor. O
As O
at O
Lilia, O
the O
wine O
list O
practically O
begs O
you O
to O
take O
something O
new O
for O
a O
whirl: O
a O
catarratto O
from O
Sicily, O
a O
Corsican O
niellucciu, O
or O
a O
croatina-ughetta O
blend O
from O
Lombardy O
softened O
with O
some O
uva O
rara. O
Of O
course, O
you O
could O
stick O
to O
a O
$45 O
Lambrusco, O
or O
get O
a O
$250 O
Champagne O
from O
David O
Léclapart, O
after O
which O
you O
can O
try O
flying O
through O
the O
hole O
in O
the O
building O
yourself. O
If O
we O
are O
striving O
for O
total O
accuracy, O
though, O
we O
need O
to O
call O
Misi O
a O
pasta-vegetables-and-gelato O
restaurant. O
Its O
gelato O
is O
made O
in O
house; O
there O
are O
about O
six O
kinds O
at O
any O
given O
moment. O
The O
flavors O
open O
up O
right O
away, O
in O
part O
because O
Misi O
serves O
them O
just O
below O
the O
melting O
point O
and O
in O
part O
because O
the O
ingredients O
are O
used O
prodigally. O
There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
almonds O
in O
the O
almond, O
and O
the O
espresso O
could O
keep O
you O
up O
an O
extra O
hour. O
But O
even O
the O
unflavored O
fior O
di O
latte, O
made O
with O
milk, O
cream O
and O
sugar, O
comes O
at O
you O
in O
a O
rush. O
There O
are O
no O
desserts O
other O
than O
gelato. O
The O
only O
decision O
to O
make O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
night O
is O
which O
one O
you're O
going O
to O
have. O

by O
hawkers O
at O
folding O
tables O
and O
rolling O
carts O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
road; O
the O
gravy-soaked O
stews B-FOOD
and O
sauceless O
dry B-FOOD
curries I-FOOD
patiently O
made O
from O
25 O
or O
so O
vegetables B-FOOD
and O
seasonings, O
all O
of O
them O
chopped, O
ground, O
fried O
and O
simmered O
at O
home O
by O
those O
keepers O
of O
the O
culinary O
flame O
known O
collectively O
as O
the O
aunties O
-- O
we've O
seen O
interpretations O
of O
this O
food, O
squeezed O
from O
eyedroppers O
and O
prepared O
for O
their O
photo O
shoots O
with O
edible O
flowers. O
But O
new O
places O
cooking O
the O
genuine O
article O
have O
been O
scarce. O
There O
is O
a O
problem O
of O
missing O
context O
here; O
twists O
on O
tradition O
don't O
really O
resonate O
when O
tradition O
is O
hard O
to O
find O
in O
its O
untwisted O
form. O
And O
for O
anyone O
who O
truly O
loves O
Indian B-CUISINE
cooking, O
there O
is O
a O
more O
pressing O
problem O
of O
missing O
flavor. O
Five O
dots O
of O
tandoori-spice B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
just O
won't O
land O
on O
the O
taste O
buds O
with O
the O
impact O
of O
a O
full O
plate O
of O
charred O
and O
steaming O
tandoori B-DISH
chicken, I-DISH
no O
matter O
how O
evenly O
spaced O
those O
dots O
are. O
I O
hadn't O
given O
much O
thought O
to O
either O
problem, O
to O
tell O
the O
truth, O
until O
I O
made O
it O
to O
the O
out-of-the-way O
patch O
of O
Long B-LOC
Island I-LOC
City I-LOC
where O
Adda B-EST
Indian I-EST
Canteen I-EST
operates. O
This O
is O
not O
the O
part O
of O
that O
neighborhood O
where O
high-rise O
apartments O
grow O
overnight O
and O
Amazon O
will O
soon O
tiptoe O
in O
with O
25,000 O
employees. O
Adda B-EST
is O
east O
of O
all O
that, O
under O
a O
National O
Guard O
recruiting O
office, O
surrounded O
by O
a O
thicket O
of O
railroad O
tracks O
and O
highway O
overpasses. O
Unless O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
it, O
you O
are O
not O
likely O
to O
end O
up O
in O
the O
small O
dining O
room, O
in O
which O
Indian O
tabloids O
have O
been O
upcycled O
as O
wallpaper. O
Once O
I'd O
found O
it, O
one O
of O
the O
first O
things O
I O
ate O
was O
the O
kaleji B-DISH
masala, I-DISH
chicken B-FOOD
livers I-FOOD
in O
a O
dark O
gravy O
seasoned O
with O
fresh B-FOOD
ginger I-FOOD
and O
garam B-FOOD
masala. I-FOOD
Right O
away O
I O
realized O
that O
this O
was O
the O
kind O
of O
Indian O
food O
the O
city O
has O
been O
hungry O
for, O
or O
at O
least O
the O
kind O
that O
I'd O
been O
hungry O
for: O
made O
with O
care O
but O
no O
pretense; O
seasoned O
for O
people O
who O
love O
the O
interplay O
of O
spices; O
presented O
without O
apology O
in O
all O
its O
brown, O
lumpy O
glory; O
and O
complex O
in O
ways O
that O
demand O
full O
attention. O
Adda O
(ah O
DAH) O
Indian O
Canteen O
was O
opened O
in O
September O
by O
Roni O
Mazumdar, O
who O
owns O
it, O
and O
Chintan O
Pandya, O
who O
is O
the O
chef. O
The O
two O
men O
already O
run O
Rahi O
, O
in O
Greenwich O
Village, O
perhaps O
the O
best O
of O
the O
casual, O
modernizing O
Indian O
restaurants, O
where O
Mr. O
Pandya O
serves O
original O
notions O
like O
tandoori O
skate O
and O
sends O
almost O
everything O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
decorated O
with O
edible O
flowers. O
They've O
taken O
another O
angle O
at O
Adda, O
mining O
family O
recipes O
and O
the O
lessons O
Mr. O
Pandya O
absorbed O
from O
civilian O
cooks O
around O
India. O
The O
menu O
travels O
beyond O
the O
standard O
north O
Indian O
dishes O
most O
New O
Yorkers O
already O
know, O
but O
even O
those O
dishes, O
when O
they O
appear, O
are O
prepared O
so O
emphatically O
that O
they O
don't O
resemble O
anything O
else O
in O
town. O
Adda O
is O
a O
lusty, O
full-throated O
defense O
of O
traditional O
cooking. O
Saag O
paneer, O
the O
grayest O
of O
old O
gray O
mares O
in O
many O
Indian O
restaurants, O
is O
coltishly O
energetic O
at O
Adda. O
The O
cheese O
is O
made O
in O
the O
kitchen, O
and O
it's O
gorgeously O
soft, O
while O
the O
saag O
is O
a O
tart O
and O
peppery O
mix O
of O
wilted O
arugula, O
sorrel, O
spinach O
and O
mustard O
greens. O
Mr. O
Pandya O
does O
very O
well O
by O
the O
class O
of O
sidewalk O
treats O
called O
chaat. O
Each O
delivers O
the O
messy O
riot O
you'd O
hope O
for, O
busy O
with O
crunchy O
hieroglyphs O
of O
fried O
noodles O
and O
splattered O
with O
yogurt O
and O
tamarind O
sauce. O
One O
chaat O
is O
anchored O
by O
a O
big O
kale O
fritter, O
another O
by O
several O
smaller O
chips O
of O
battered, O
spiced O
lentil O
cakes, O
and O
a O
third O
by O
fried O
smashed O
potatoes O
and O
chickpeas. O
But O
discerning O
chaat O
lovers O
should O
probably O
go O
directly O
to O
the O
dahi O
batata O
puri, O
soft O
potato O
packed O
into O
hollow O
globes O
of O
fried O
dough O
that O
you O
can O
pick O
up O
and O
eat O
with O
your O
fingers, O
like O
chocolates. O
Anything O
that O
passes O
through O
Adda's O
tandoor O
is O
worth O
investigating. O
Seekh O
kebabs, O
made O
with O
lamb O
that's O
coarsely O
ground O
by O
hand, O
come O
out O
of O
the O
tandoor O
juicier O
and O
pinker O
than O
the O
usual; O
Mumbai-style O
tandoori O
macchi, O
a O
skewered O
pompano O
rubbed O
with O
ground O
mustard O
seeds O
and O
cilantro, O
is O
lightly O
charred O
and O
smoky O
after O
roasting, O
but O
still O
moist; O
bhatti O
da O
murgh, O
a O
double-marinated O
chicken O
thigh O
and O
drumstick, O
is O
so O
thickly O
crusted O
with O
coriander O
and O
cumin O
that O
it O
crunches O
when O
you O
bite O
it. O
My O
server O
expressed O
an O
enthusiasm O
about O
the O
poussin O
-- O
plunged O
into O
the O
tandoor O
in O
one O
piece O
after O
marinating O
in O
vinegar, O
yogurt, O
fresh O
red O
chiles O
and O
kala O
namak, O
the O
sulfurous O
black O
salt O
of O
India O
-- O
that O
you O
typically O
find O
in O
new O
converts O
to O
a O
cult. O
After O
tasting O
it, O
I O
was O
ready O
to O
join. O
He O
was O
enthusiastic O
about O
almost O
everything, O
as O
it O
turned O
out; O
the O
service O
at O
Adda O
is O
nothing O
if O
not O
eager O
to O
talk O
up O
the O
food. O
(Getting O
your O
water O
glass O
refilled O
is O
another O
story.) O
Placing O
a O
dish O
of O
yogurt O
and O
pomegranate O
seeds O
next O
to O
the O
goat O
biryani O
that O
is O
steamed O
under O
a O
lid O
of O
dough, O
he O
said, O
"This O
is O
going O
to O
be O
your O
best O
friend O
when O
the O
spice O
in O
the O
biryani O
starts O
to O
hit O
you." O
It O
was, O
in O
fact, O
one O
of O
the O
fiercest O
biryanis O
I've O
ever O
met, O
and O
the O
yogurt O
tamed O
it O
so O
that O
I O
could O
taste O
the O
tender O
goat O
meat O
and O
crisp, O
bittersweet O
fried O
onions. O
Few O
things O
on O
the O
menu O
are O
quite O
as O
chile-drenched O
as O
the O
biryani, O
but O
Mr. O
Pandya O
definitely O
favors O
India's O
more O
intense O
flavors. O
Adda O
is O
not O
big O
on O
soft-spoken O
cream O
sauces; O
the O
coconut O
milk O
in O
the O
Malvani O
prawn O
curry O
from O
the O
South O
Konkan O
coast, O
for O
instance, O
has O
a O
pronounced O
kick. O
(It's O
very O
good O
if O
you O
get O
it O
on O
a O
night O
when O
the O
prawns O
are O
firm O
and O
not O
spongy.) O
And O
while O
Adda O
does O
serve O
some O
vegetables, O
it O
would O
not O
make O
my O
list O
of O
the O
20 O
best O
local O
Indian O
restaurants O
for O
vegetarians. O
It O
would, O
however, O
be O
the O
place O
I'd O
send O
you O
if O
you O
want O
to O
know O
how O
good O
Delhi O
butter O
chicken O
can O
be. O
Or O
if O
you O
don't O
yet O
believe O
that O
rara O
gosht, O
chunks O
of O
lamb O
stewed O
on O
the O
bone O
with O
spiced O
minced O
lamb, O
is O
not O
redundant O
but O
luxurious. O
And O
Adda O
is O
the O
first O
restaurant O
I'd O
tell O
you O
about O
if O
you O
woke O
up O
one O
morning O
hungry O
for O
bheja O
fry, O
goat O
brains O
cooked O
with O
onions, O
ginger O
and O
a O
considerable O
number O
of O
fresh O
green O
chiles. O
"Like O
soft O
scrambled O
eggs," O
our O
server O
said, O
accurately. O
I O
might O
point O
out O
that O
a O
typical O
Indian O
bheja O
fry O
is O
drier, O
with O
a O
higher O
ratio O
of O
brains O
to O
sauce. O
But O
I O
would O
not O
necessarily O
mean O
that O
as O
a O
complaint. O

-DOCSTART- O

Alex O
Raij O
and O
Eder O
Montero O
met O
while O
working O
in O
the O
kitchen O
of O
a O
sprawling, O
impersonal, O
gloomy O
modern-Spanish B-CUISINE
restaurant O
that O
lasted O
about O
two O
years. O
They O
went O
on O
to O
get O
married O
and, O
as O
joint O
chefs O
and O
owners, O
opened O
a O
string O
of O
compact, O
intimate, O
slinky O
modern-Spanish B-CUISINE
restaurants O
that O
are O
still O
in O
business. O
Their O
one O
misfire O
was O
a O
small, O
intimate O
non-Spanish O
coffee B-TYPE
shop I-TYPE
in O
Cobble B-LOC
Hill, I-LOC
Brooklyn. I-LOC
After O
dusting O
themselves O
off, O
they O
replaced O
the O
cafe O
tables O
with O
taller O
and O
longer O
ones, O
traded O
the O
pastry O
cases O
for O
a O
bar, O
installed O
a O
stripe O
of O
backlighted O
glass O
blocks O
that O
cast O
a O
subaqueous O
glow O
on O
the O
room, O
and O
in O
September O
reopened O
as O
Saint B-EST
Julivert I-EST
Fisherie I-EST
. O
And O
what O
is O
a O
fisherie, B-TYPE
you O
ask, O
having O
quickly O
consulted O
your O
French, O
Spanish O
and O
English O
dictionaries O
and O
found O
no O
such O
word? O
Saint B-EST
Julivert I-EST
is O
my O
first, O
but O
if O
it O
is O
anything O
to O
go O
by, O
then O
a O
fisherie B-TYPE
is O
a O
seafood B-TYPE
establishment I-TYPE
that O
aspires O
to O
be O
more O
than O
a O
raw B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
but O
does O
not O
want O
to O
be O
mistaken O
for O
a O
full-bore O
restaurant. O
Wines B-FOOD
come O
mostly O
from O
coastal O
regions O
(and O
are O
organized O
by O
the O
nearest O
body O
of O
salt O
water). O
Small O
plates O
abound. O
And O
if O
you O
guessed O
that O
they O
are O
something O
like O
the O
tapas B-FOOD
that O
Ms. O
Raij O
and O
Mr. O
Montero O
explore O
at O
El B-EST
Quinto I-EST
Pino I-EST
, O
Txikito B-EST
and O
La B-EST
Vara I-EST
, O
but O
without O
the O
running O
Spanish B-CUISINE
theme, O
you O
are O
not O
far O
off. O
Not O
that O
the O
menu O
is O
entirely O
un-Spanish. O
The O
octopus B-DISH
carpaccio I-DISH
from O
Txikito B-EST
makes O
a O
special O
guest O
appearance O
at O
Saint B-EST
Julivert I-EST
Fisherie, I-EST
the O
way O
the O
Fresh O
Prince O
once O
turned O
up O
on O
an O
episode O
of O
"Blossom." O
Under O
marjoram B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
and O
pinprick O
grains O
of O
Espelette B-FOOD
pepper, I-FOOD
the O
carpaccio B-DISH
is O
as O
good O
as O
you O
remember; O
the O
warm O
plate O
halfway O
melts O
the O
fattier O
bits O
of O
octopus B-FOOD
into O
delicious O
goo. O
There O
is O
another O
cameo: O
El B-EST
Quinto I-EST
Pino's I-EST
very O
fine O
combination O
of O
pink-fleshed B-DISH
anchovies I-DISH
with I-DISH
cold I-DISH
vanilla I-DISH
butter. I-DISH
The O
butter B-FOOD
soothes O
the O
anchovies B-FOOD
the O
way O
the O
vermouth B-FOOD
in O
a O
martini B-DISH
helps O
the O
gin B-FOOD
settle O
down. O
(On O
a O
related O
topic, O
the O
short O
cocktail O
list O
includes O
a O
deceptively O
soft-spoken O
number O
called O
the O
Kanpai B-DISH
Martini. I-DISH
It's O
a O
variation O
on O
the O
Vesper, B-DISH
which O
itself O
is O
the O
amended O
martini B-DISH
that O
Ian O
Fleming O
had O
James O
Bond O
order O
in O
"Casino O
Royale.") O
At O
times O
Saint B-EST
Julivert I-EST
reminds O
me O
of O
Cal B-EST
Pep I-EST
, O
in O
Barcelona, B-LOC
Spain, I-LOC
whose O
plain, O
cramped O
counter O
looks O
like O
the O
last O
place O
in O
the O
world O
where O
you O
are O
going O
to O
have O
an O
epiphany O
of O
the O
taste O
buds, O
right O
up O
until O
the O
moment O
the O
txipirones B-FOOD
and O
thumbtack-size O
clams B-FOOD
knock O
you O
off O
your O
barstool. O
Like O
Cal B-EST
Pep, I-EST
and O
unlike O
nearly O
every O
other O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
restaurant, O
Saint B-EST
Julivert I-EST
serves O
gooseneck B-DISH
barnacles I-DISH
when O
they're O
available, O
boiling O
them O
with O
bay B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
and O
salt B-FOOD
and O
mounding O
them O
on O
a O
cloth O
napkin O
before O
they O
cool O
so O
that O
when O
you O
twist O
the O
wrinkled O
sheath O
of O
skin O
away O
from O
the O
sweet, O
edible O
meat B-FOOD
inside O
there O
is O
a O
good O
chance O
somebody O
in O
the O
vicinity O
will O
get O
hit O
with O
a O
squirt O
of O
hot O
barnacle B-FOOD
juice. I-FOOD
Mostly, O
though, O
any O
Spanish-ness B-CUISINE
in O
Saint B-EST
Julivert I-EST
has O
more O
to O
do O
with O
its O
spirit O
than O
its O
recipes, O
which O
come O
from O
all O
over: O
the O
deep-fried O
Puerto B-CUISINE
Rican I-CUISINE
cylinders O
of O
cornmeal B-FOOD
known O
as O
sorrullitos; B-DISH
a O
kanpachi O
collar O
whose O
juicy O
meat O
is O
shockingly O
white O
under O
a O
black O
rub O
of O
jerk O
spices; O
tender O
slices O
of O
warm O
beef O
tenderloin O
on O
a O
fist-size O
roll, O
known O
in O
Portugal O
as O
a O
prego O
sandwich. O
There O
is O
also O
the O
crispy O
tuna O
bake, O
a O
peculiarly O
satisfying O
hybrid O
that O
crosses O
a O
tuna O
noodle O
casserole O
by O
way O
of O
India O
with O
fideuà, O
the O
Spanish O
dish O
that O
treats O
pasta O
like O
the O
rice O
in O
paella. O
The O
noodles, O
short O
ridged O
tubes, O
are O
toasted O
and O
cooked O
with O
oil-cured O
tuna O
in O
a O
tomato O
sauce O
that O
is O
seasoned O
with O
turmeric O
and O
curry O
leaves. O
It O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
fearless, O
not O
to O
mention O
filling, O
dishes O
on O
a O
menu O
that O
could O
use O
a O
little O
more O
of O
both O
qualities. O
Although O
Saint O
Julivert O
works O
with O
exceptional O
seafood, O
and O
treats O
it O
with O
the O
care O
that O
fans O
of O
Ms. O
Raij O
and O
Mr. O
Montero O
have O
come O
to O
expect, O
the O
menu O
plays O
it O
safe O
more O
often O
than O
it O
should. O
Like O
all O
of O
the O
couple's O
restaurants, O
Saint O
Julivert O
toggles O
between O
innovation O
and O
tradition. O
But O
the O
other O
places O
explore O
Spanish O
cuisine, O
so O
when O
they O
toss O
off O
a O
straight-ahead O
classic O
like O
patatas O
bravas, O
there's O
a O
reason. O
When O
Saint O
Julivert O
serves O
fluke O
ceviche O
or O
a O
crab O
and O
avocado O
salad O
dressed O
with O
yuzu O
juice O
and O
trout O
roe, O
it O
can O
seem O
to O
be O
grasping O
at O
ideas O
that O
other O
restaurants O
are O
already O
doing O
-- O
even O
when O
Saint O
Julivert O
does O
them O
better. O
The O
sautéed O
skate O
splashed O
with O
Manzanilla O
could O
not O
be O
fresher O
or O
more O
skillfully O
browned, O
but O
do O
the O
garlic O
chips O
and O
sliced O
dried O
chiles O
on O
top O
make O
this O
version O
of O
a O
well-known O
standard O
one O
I'll O
remember O
a O
month O
from O
now? O
Maybe O
not, O
although O
at O
the O
time O
I O
was O
very O
happy O
to O
have O
it, O
not O
least O
because O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
things O
on O
the O
menu O
the O
size O
of O
a O
standard O
main O
course. O
Even O
if O
you're O
an O
old O
hand O
at O
navigating O
the O
shallow O
waters O
of O
small O
plates, O
it O
can O
be O
unnervingly O
easy O
to O
spend O
more O
than O
$100 O
on O
food O
and O
drinks O
at O
Saint O
Julivert O
and O
still O
wonder O
whether O
you've O
actually O
had O
dinner. O
Seafood O
this O
good O
is O
expensive, O
but O
the O
menu O
doesn't O
stray O
very O
far O
above O
$20; O
the O
result O
is O
that O
portions O
can O
seem O
somewhat O
airy. O
When O
there's O
an O
inexpensive O
opportunity O
to O
pad O
out O
a O
dish, O
Saint O
Julivert O
doesn't O
always O
take O
it. O
I O
understand O
why O
I O
can't O
have O
more O
than O
three O
excellent O
wild O
shrimp O
in O
a O
$21 O
bowl O
of O
red O
pozole, O
but O
couldn't O
there O
be O
more O
than O
a O
spoonful O
of O
hominy O
kernels? O
Saltines O
fried O
in O
canola O
oil O
are O
served O
with O
the O
ceviche O
and O
with O
a O
cold O
and O
highly O
appealing O
bowl O
of O
pickled O
shrimp O
under O
pink O
pickled O
onions; O
grilled O
bread O
slices O
accompany O
the O
mackerel O
whipped O
into O
a O
hummus-like O
orange O
spread O
with O
piri-piri O
oil. O
Still, O
each O
time O
I O
went, O
somebody O
at O
my O
table O
asked O
for O
more O
bread. O
None O
of O
Saint O
Julivert's O
issues O
are O
insoluble. O
The O
lighting O
could O
be O
warmed O
up O
so O
the O
room O
looks O
less O
like O
an O
aquarium. O
A O
few O
more O
dishes O
you O
won't O
see O
anywhere O
else, O
like O
the O
tuna O
bake, O
would O
make O
it O
harder O
to O
resist. O
Another O
two O
or O
three O
large O
plates O
would O
make O
it O
a O
place O
you O
think O
of O
when O
you're O
hungry. O
The O
excellent O
$19 O
prego O
sandwich O
is O
more O
snack O
than O
dinner, O
until O
you O
pay O
another O
$7 O
to O
have O
fried O
oysters O
tucked O
into O
the O
roll O
beside O
the O
beef, O
making O
it O
into O
a O
kind O
of O
crunchy O
carpetbagger. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
that's O
worth O
doing O
even O
if O
you're O
not O
hungry. O

There O
is O
a O
good O
case O
to O
be O
made O
for O
not O
reviewing O
the O
newly O
relocated O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
Restaurant I-EST
at O
all O
but O
just O
leaving O
it O
on O
the O
slush O
pile, O
and O
that O
case O
can O
be O
found O
in O
court O
records O
involving O
Julian O
Niccolini. O
Mr. O
Niccolini O
has O
operated O
the O
restaurant O
with O
Alex O
von O
Bidder O
since O
the O
mid-1990s, O
first O
at O
its O
original O
home O
in O
the O
Seagram B-LOC
Building I-LOC
and O
now, O
after O
a O
two-year O
hiatus, O
in O
a O
smaller O
berth O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
Park B-LOC
Avenue. I-LOC
Over O
that O
time, O
he O
has O
frequently O
been O
celebrated O
for O
his O
charm. O
Less O
frequently, O
he O
has O
been O
a O
defendant O
in O
civil O
and O
criminal O
actions O
arising O
from O
things O
he O
was O
accused O
of O
having O
done O
to O
women O
inside O
the O
restaurant. O
In O
1991, O
one O
of O
his O
waitresses O
sued O
Mr. O
Niccolini O
and O
the O
Four O
Seasons O
, O
citing O
sexual O
harassment. O
She O
claimed O
that O
for O
more O
than O
three O
years O
he O
had O
repeatedly O
rubbed O
up O
against O
her, O
told O
her O
in O
vulgar O
terms O
about O
his O
sexual O
urges O
and O
called O
her O
"slut," O
"lesbian" O
and O
other O
things. O
Mr. O
Niccolini O
denied O
the O
charges. O
In O
2014, O
a O
former O
assistant O
manager O
filed O
suit O
against O
Mr. O
Niccolini O
, O
Mr. O
von O
Bidder O
and O
the O
Four O
Seasons, O
alleging O
discrimination. O
The O
ex-manager O
said O
that O
after O
she O
returned O
from O
a O
maternity O
leave, O
the O
restaurant O
made O
it O
difficult O
for O
her O
to O
pump O
breast B-FOOD
milk I-FOOD
during O
work O
hours O
and, O
about O
three O
months O
later, O
fired O
her O
and O
replaced O
her O
with O
a O
man. O
In O
a O
response O
filed O
with O
the O
court, O
the O
defendants O
denied O
the O
allegations. O
Both O
suits O
were O
settled O
under O
terms O
that O
have O
not O
been O
divulged. O
In O
2015, O
Mr. O
Niccolini O
was O
arrested O
on O
a O
felony O
charge O
of O
sexual O
abuse. O
According O
to O
a O
prosecutor, O
he O
had O
attacked O
a O
woman O
at O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
bar I-EST
"with O
such O
force O
that O
he O
ripped O
her O
bra O
open O
and O
caused O
significant O
scratch O
marks O
on O
her O
back O
and O
bruising O
on O
her O
hip." O
After O
pleading O
guilty O
the O
following O
year O
to O
a O
reduced O
charge O
of O
misdemeanor O
assault, O
Mr. O
Niccolini O
was O
given O
a O
"conditional O
discharge," O
avoiding O
jail. O
I O
know O
people O
who O
will O
never O
eat O
at O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
because O
they O
don't O
want O
to O
give O
Mr. O
Niccolini O
their O
money. O
I O
understand O
this. O
I O
also O
know O
people O
in O
the O
food O
media O
who O
think O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
should O
not O
get O
any O
coverage O
as O
long O
as O
Mr. O
Niccolini O
owns O
a O
piece O
of O
it. O
I O
understand O
this, O
too, O
but O
it's O
not O
my O
view. O
[Julian O
Niccolini O
has O
since O
been O
forced O
to O
resign O
from O
the O
restaurant.] O
Their O
stance O
rests, O
I O
think, O
on O
the O
idea O
that O
writing O
about O
powerful O
men O
who O
have O
been O
accused O
of O
abusing O
women O
amounts O
to O
condoning O
the O
abuse O
and O
helping O
the O
abusers O
stay O
in O
power. O
While O
it's O
true O
that O
media O
attention O
is O
often O
like O
oxygen O
to O
restaurants, O
critics O
have O
the O
power O
to O
tell O
a O
story O
other O
than O
the O
one O
the O
restaurant O
is O
pushing. O
Even O
when O
we're O
not O
writing O
a O
pan, O
a O
fair O
assessment O
often O
requires O
weaving O
shining O
threads O
with O
ugly O
ones. O
The O
ugliest O
threads O
at O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
happen O
to O
be O
ugly O
enough O
to O
make O
many O
people O
stay O
away. O
But O
there O
is O
beauty O
in O
the O
fabric, O
too. O
The O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
has O
been O
a O
significant O
force O
in O
dining: O
a O
pioneer O
in O
championing O
American B-CUISINE
ingredients O
and O
wine; B-FOOD
an O
innovator O
in O
bringing O
contemporary O
design O
into O
the O
restaurant O
world; O
a O
cultivator O
of O
an O
eclectic O
scene O
that O
treated O
political O
power, O
financial O
success O
and O
creative O
talent O
as O
coequal O
branches O
of O
a O
high O
society O
that O
was O
peculiar O
to O
New B-LOC
York. I-LOC
Most O
of O
this O
happened O
some O
time O
ago. O
In O
its O
last O
years O
in O
the O
Seagram B-LOC
Building, I-LOC
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
had O
become O
a O
shabby O
but O
lovely O
museum O
of O
midcentury O
architecture O
and O
design, O
with O
martinis O
that O
I O
didn't O
mind O
overpaying O
for O
and O
food O
that O
I O
did. O
I O
was O
curious O
about O
its O
new O
incarnation, O
which O
opened O
in O
August, O
and O
curiosity O
is O
as O
good O
a O
reason O
as O
any O
for O
a O
critic O
to O
swing O
into O
action. O
If O
I O
were O
writing O
the O
next O
chapter O
in O
a O
long O
history, O
I'd O
mention O
how O
gracefully O
Diego O
Garcia O
has O
grown O
into O
his O
new O
job O
as O
the O
restaurant's O
chef. O
I O
enjoyed O
Mr. O
Garcia's O
fish B-FOOD
cookery O
at O
his O
last O
restaurant, O
a O
small, O
bare-bones O
place O
in O
Hell's B-LOC
Kitchen I-LOC
called O
Gloria B-EST
, O
but O
he O
seemed O
limited O
by O
the O
kitchen's O
size. O
He O
works O
on O
a O
grander O
scale O
now, O
with O
more O
expensive O
ingredients O
and O
more O
delicate O
treatments O
that O
still O
betray O
his O
creative O
streak. O
He O
roasts O
duck B-FOOD
because O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
is O
famous O
for O
it, O
and O
makes O
fresh O
pasta B-FOOD
and O
risotto B-DISH
because O
the O
captains O
in O
their O
black O
jackets O
need O
some O
place O
to O
shave O
all O
those O
white B-FOOD
truffles. I-FOOD
For O
all O
intents O
and O
purposes, O
though, O
he O
has O
turned O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
into O
a O
seafood B-TYPE
restaurant, O
and O
a O
very O
good O
one. O
It's O
not O
hard O
to O
believe O
he O
was O
once O
a O
sous-chef O
at O
Le B-EST
Bernardin I-EST
when O
you O
taste, O
say, O
the O
raw B-FOOD
scallop I-FOOD
slivers O
in O
citrus B-FOOD
juices, I-FOOD
elegantly O
equipped O
with O
tart O
apple B-FOOD
and O
caviar, B-FOOD
or O
the O
intensely O
smooth O
chowder B-DISH
of O
tiny, O
just-cooked O
clams B-FOOD
in O
a O
New B-CUISINE
England-style I-CUISINE
cream B-FOOD
broth I-FOOD
that's O
pale O
yellow O
with O
butterfat. B-FOOD
He O
knows O
when O
to O
show O
restraint O
and O
when O
to O
go O
all O
in, O
taking O
sea-urchin B-DISH
ravioli I-DISH
that O
are O
already O
head-spinningly O
rich O
and O
draping O
lobes O
of O
sea B-FOOD
urchin I-FOOD
over O
them. O
Some O
of O
the O
cooking O
is O
boring O
in O
the O
right O
way. O
I O
don't O
want O
surprises O
in O
Dover B-DISH
sole I-DISH
à I-DISH
la I-DISH
meunière, I-DISH
and O
I O
didn't O
get O
any. O
It O
was O
flawless. O
The O
duck B-FOOD
will O
surprise O
only O
people O
who O
don't O
know O
that O
duck B-FOOD
meat I-FOOD
cooked O
to O
well-done O
bastes O
in O
its O
own O
fat O
until O
it O
is O
almost O
a O
warm O
confit. B-FOOD
Other O
dishes O
were O
boring O
in O
the O
usual O
sense. O
The O
mustard B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
poured O
around O
the O
golden O
crab B-DISH
cake I-DISH
tasted O
like O
cream B-FOOD
that O
was O
shown O
a O
picture O
of O
a O
mustard O
jar. O
The O
chapter O
would O
also O
depict O
the O
return O
of O
Bill O
Yosses. O
Anybody O
who O
ate O
his O
desserts O
before O
he O
disappeared O
into O
the O
White O
House O
won't O
be O
surprised O
by O
how O
good O
they O
are O
here. O
They O
do O
have O
a O
slight O
Rip O
Van O
Winkle O
quality, O
suggesting O
that O
Mr. O
Yosses O
allowed O
several O
new O
waves O
in O
pastry B-FOOD
to O
pass O
him O
by, O
but O
that's O
no O
criticism. O
He O
makes O
a O
better O
baba B-DISH
au I-DISH
rhum I-DISH
than O
almost O
anyone O
in O
town, O
his O
chocolate B-DISH
tart I-DISH
with I-DISH
a I-DISH
salted I-DISH
stripe I-DISH
of I-DISH
caramel I-DISH
is O
both O
powerful O
and O
precise, O
and O
his O
hazelnut B-DISH
financier I-DISH
balanced O
over O
roasted B-FOOD
pears I-FOOD
is O
more O
delicious O
than O
almost O
any O
almond B-DISH
financier I-DISH
you O
can O
find. O
He O
has O
even O
improved O
the O
restaurant's O
signature, O
the O
Kate O
Pierson O
beehive O
of O
cotton B-DISH
candy I-DISH
that O
sails O
out O
to O
the O
tables O
of O
valued O
guests. O
(Apparently O
I've O
joined O
that O
club.) O
This O
being O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons, I-EST
the O
history O
would O
have O
to O
mention O
the O
new O
restaurant's O
interior. O
It O
reminded O
me O
of O
the O
old O
Philip O
Johnson O
dining O
rooms O
without O
making O
me O
sad O
to O
be O
here O
instead O
of O
there, O
a O
trick O
I O
had O
thought O
was O
impossible. O
The O
bronze O
bead O
curtains O
have O
transformed O
into O
strings O
of O
gilded O
glass O
baubles; O
the O
flatware O
and O
glasses O
pay O
homage O
to O
the O
vintage O
designs O
used O
at O
the O
original O
restaurant; O
and O
the O
bar O
is O
once O
again O
a O
four-sided O
island O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
lounge. O
For O
the O
first O
time O
you O
can O
eat O
a O
real O
meal O
there, O
while O
you O
watch O
the O
Grand O
Central-bound O
commuters O
outside O
and O
the O
cotton O
candy-bound O
regulars O
inside, O
generally O
a O
mature O
group O
in O
tightly O
knotted O
ties O
or O
heels O
that O
echo O
down O
the O
corridor O
to O
the O
dining O
room O
like O
the O
ticking O
of O
a O
grandfather O
clock. O
All O
of O
this O
and O
a O
generous O
budget O
(the O
prices O
are O
as O
exclusionary O
as O
ever) O
could O
make O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
of O
celebratory O
sightseeing O
of O
a O
kind O
that O
is O
quickly O
disappearing O
from O
the O
city. O
The O
Four B-DISH
Seasons I-DISH
offers O
an O
escape O
from O
the O
outside O
world. O
Escaping O
from O
what's O
inside, O
however, O
takes O
a O
mental O
effort O
that O
is O
beyond O
me O
and O
will O
probably O
be O
beyond O
many O
others O
as O
well, O
whether O
Mr. O
Niccolini O
is O
in O
sight O
or O
not. O
During O
my O
three O
meals, O
I O
never O
saw O
him. O
Restaurants, O
even O
grand O
ones O
like O
the O
Four B-DISH
Seasons, I-DISH
are O
intimate O
places; O
eating O
is O
an O
act O
that O
requires O
trust O
and O
a O
sense O
of O
safety. O
We O
want O
to O
get O
up O
from O
the O
table O
feeling O
restored O
on O
all O
fronts O
except O
the O
financial O
one. O
Mr. O
Niccolini's O
actions O
have O
done O
serious O
damage O
to O
his O
power O
to O
provide O
that O
feeling, O
even O
as O
he O
and O
Mr. O
von O
Bidder O
have O
made O
the O
restaurant O
better O
than O
it O
has O
been O
in O
years. O
This O
review O
will O
not O
be O
tied O
up O
with O
a O
bow. O
All O
I O
have O
are O
threads. O

Something O
seems O
to O
be O
going O
wrong O
at O
Bluebird B-EST
London I-EST
, O
the O
busily O
programmed O
10,500-square-foot O
restaurant O
that O
the O
mall O
in O
the O
Time B-LOC
Warner I-LOC
Center I-LOC
imported O
from O
England B-LOC
in O
September. O
Maybe O
the O
people O
in O
charge O
have O
been O
taking O
management O
cues O
from O
Prime O
Minister O
Theresa O
May's O
government, O
which O
has O
approached O
its O
Brexit O
plan O
like O
a O
class O
of O
first O
graders O
trying O
to O
build O
a O
working O
jet O
airplane O
out O
of O
Lego O
pieces O
and O
a O
flying-squirrel O
sock O
puppet. O
Or O
maybe O
the O
mess O
back O

has O
just O
sapped O
the O

spirit. O
Whatever O
the O
cause, O
what O
was O
meant O
to O
be O
a O
cheerful O
gift O
from O

turned O
into O
the O
Bluebird B-EST
of O
Unhappiness. O
Sir O
Terence O

opened O
the O
original O

in O
1997 O
inside O
an O
Art O
Deco O
garage O
built O
on O
King's B-LOC
Road I-LOC
in O
Chelsea B-LOC
for O
the O
Bluebird O
Motor O

It O
was O
one O
of O
his O
"gastrodomes," B-TYPE
those O
soaring O
complexes O
like O
Quaglino's B-EST
and O
Bibendum B-EST
that O
embedded O
restaurants O
within O
a O
busy O
hive O
of O
shops, O
cafes B-TYPE

The O
gastrodomes' B-TYPE
designs O
were O
talked O
about O
more O
often O
and O
more O
enthusiastically O
than O
their O
menus, O
which O
aimed O
for O
unthreatening O
familiarity. O
The O
current O
owners, O
D O

D O
London O
, O
have O
managed O
to O
keep O
the O
London B-LOC
Bluebird B-EST
in O
circulation O
by O
changing O
upholstery O
and O
chefs, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
at O
all O
clear O
why O
they O
or O
the O
Time B-LOC
Warner I-LOC
Center I-LOC
believed O
that O
a O
Bluebird B-EST
clone O
would O
play O
in O
Manhattan B-LOC
in O
2018. O
True, O
the O
retail O
shop O
has O
been O
dropped. O
But O
up O
front, O
next O
to O
the O
desk O
where O
the O
hosts O
have O
mastered O
the O
art O
of O
checking O
reservations O
without O
making O
eye O
contact, O
is O
a O
cafe-slash-wine B-TYPE
bar. I-TYPE
A O
glass O
case O
there O
serves O
as O
a O
temporary O
prison O
for O
aging O
pastries B-FOOD
and O
tragic O
snacks. O
Beyond O
is O
a O
lounge O
followed O
by O
a O
bar, O
the O
centerpiece O
of O
which O
is O
an O
enormous O
plexiglass O
sculpture O
of O
a O
ponytailed O
woman's O
head O
that O
doubles O
as O
a O
shelf O
for O
weird O
liqueurs. B-FOOD
Just O
before O
the O
ramp O
that O
descends O
to O
the O
main O
dining O
room O
is O
a O
console O
with O
two O
turntables O
which, O
a O
note O
on O
the O
website O
says O
menacingly, O
are O
operated O
on O
weekends O
by O
"live O
DJs." O
At O
other O
times, O
the O
restaurant O
stages O
such O
events O
as O
a O
workshop O
in O
the O
art O
of O
making O
"a O
seriously O
chic O

The O
poster-size O
menus O
drawn O
up O
by O
Nicolas O
Houlbert, O
the O
chef, O
cram O
so O
much O
copy O
onto O
a O
single O
page, O
and O
are O
organized O
so O
randomly, O
that O
they O
are O
best O
approached O
as O
if O
you O
were O
doing O
a O
word O
search, O
by O
unfocusing O
the O
eyes O
and O
waiting O
until O
the O
letters O
organize O
themselves O
into O
recognizable O

Look, O
here's O

When O

please O
savor O
the O
warm O
feeling O
of O
accomplishment O
for O
a O
moment, O
because O
it O
goes O
away O
once O

Because O
you O
are O
in O
an O
English B-CUISINE

you O
will O
be O
curious O
about O
the O
English B-CUISINE
food. O
Because O
you O
are O

you O
will O

A O

half O

is O
golden O

crisp O

At O

the O

peas I-FOOD
that O

crunchy. O
This O
is O
more O

can O
be O
said O
for O
the O
potato B-FOOD

that O
come O
with O
an O
order O
of O
beef B-DISH

They O
are O
pale, O
cobweb-colored, O
not O
fresh, O

undercooked O

they O
sag O

fall O
apart O
beneath O
any O
amount O
of O
beef. B-FOOD
The O
tartare, B-FOOD
by O
the O
way, O
is O
seasoned O
with O
ketchup, B-FOOD
which O
is O
not O
as O
wrong O

you O

think. O
If O
something O

exercise O
caution. O

coated O

that O
is O
trying O
its O
best O
to O
be O
mistaken O
for O
sauce, B-FOOD
is O
a O
dome O
of O
puff B-FOOD
pastry; I-FOOD
it O
doesn't O
taste O
like O
butter B-FOOD

salt, B-FOOD
but O
it O
is O
cooked. O
The O
thicker O

around O
a O

served O
with O
a O

very O
thick O

encasing O

Wellington I-DISH
is O
cooked O
only O
on O
the O

deep O
inside, O
where O
it O
meets O
the O
tenderloin, B-FOOD
is O
a O
mass O
of O
wet, O
gluey O

This O
costs O
$95 O

will O
serve O
two O
people, O
both O
of O
whom O
had O
better O
like O
the O
taste O
of O
raw B-FOOD

All O
is O
not O
doom O
and O
gloom O
in O
the O

department, O
though. O
The O

Most O
of O

are O
likable, O

layer O
of O
orange B-FOOD
marmalade I-FOOD
between O
the O
frangipane B-FOOD
and O
the O
pastry B-FOOD
shell. I-FOOD
The O
only O
real O
hazard O
on O
the O
dessert O
menu O
is O
the O
barely O
congealed O
Pimm's B-DISH
jelly I-DISH
at O
which O
somebody O
has O
hurled O
fistfuls O
of O
chopped O
cucumbers B-FOOD
and O
strawberries. B-FOOD
It's O
like O
a O
stray O
plate O
of O
salad B-FOOD
that O
you O
might O
pick O
up O
at O
a O
party O
before O
you O
realized O
that O
somebody O
had O
dumped O
the O
warm O
dregs O
of O
a O
drink O
into O
it. O
The O
servers O
seemed O
eager O
to O
oblige, O
but O
gave O
the O
impression O
of O
struggling O
in O
the O
face O
of O
unseen O
enemies. O
One O
night, O
asked O
"Still O
or O
sparkling?," O
I O
chose O
the O
sparkling B-FOOD
water. I-FOOD
My O
server O
began O
to O
walk O
away, O
then O
turned O
on O
his O
heel O
and O
said, O
"I'm O
sorry, O
we're O
all O
out O
of O
sparkling." O
"That's O
fine," O
I O
said. O
"I'll O
just O
have O
the O
BrewDog B-DISH
I.P.A. I-DISH
instead." O
"I O
apologize," O
he O
said. O
"We O
don't O
have O
any O
draft O
beer." B-FOOD
After O
the O
main O
course O
was O
cleared, O
I O
asked O
him O
for O
the O
Chocolate B-DISH
Bluebird. I-DISH
"That O
is O
our O
signature O
dessert," O
he O
said. O
I O
nodded. O
I O
had O
read O
that O
this O
was O
a O
chocolate B-FOOD
mousse I-FOOD
inside O
a O
blue-chocolate B-FOOD
shell I-FOOD
in O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
vintage O
racecar O
once O
made O
by O
the O
Bluebird O
Motor O
Company. O
"Unfortunately, O
we O
do O
not O
have O
it O
tonight," O
he O
said. O
His O
courtesy O
went O
a O
long O
way. O
Ultimately, O
though, O
I O
preferred O
the O
blunt O
approach O
that O
one O
of O
the O
bartenders O
took O
with O
one O
of O
my O
guests. O
Looking O
over O
the O
long O
list O
of O
old O
and O
new O
cocktails, B-FOOD
she O
asked O
the O
bartender O
which O
he O
would O
recommend. O
"If O
you O
want O
to O
drink O
something O
that O
tastes O
good," O
he O
said, O
"I O
wouldn't O
order O
anything O
off O
our O
menu." O

Americans O
who O
weren't O
born O
into O
Korean B-CUISINE
cuisine O
have O
discovered O
it O
in O
many O
ways O
and O
many O
locales O
over O
the O
past O
decade O
or O
two. O
Bulgogi B-FOOD
folded O
into O
tortillas B-FOOD
has O
been O
handed O
out O
through O
the O
window O
of O
a O
roving O
truck O
. O
Smoked B-FOOD
kimchi I-FOOD
has O
been O
draped O
over O
pulled B-FOOD
pork I-FOOD
between O
halves O
of O
a O
cheese-glazed B-FOOD
doughnut I-FOOD
to I-FOOD
make O
an O
outdoor O
food-stall B-TYPE
sandwich B-FOOD
called O
the O
Chonut B-DISH
. O
Hwe, B-FOOD
raw O
fish B-FOOD
eaten O
with O
condiments O
that O
typically O
spread O
across O
an O
entire O
table, O
has O
been O
streamlined O
to O
one O
or O
two O
bites O
in O
a O
tasting O
menu O
administered O
by O
servers O
in O
sci-fi O
tunics. O
The O
pork B-DISH
belly I-DISH
dish I-DISH
bo I-DISH
ssam I-DISH
has O
been O
reimagined O
as O
a O
whole O
roasted B-FOOD
pork I-FOOD
shoulder I-FOOD
that O
a O
gang O
of O
hungry O
people O
could O
use O
in O
a O
bonding O
ritual O
involving O
heads O
of O
lettuce, B-FOOD
a O
platter O
of O
oysters B-FOOD
and O
a O
pair O
of O
tongs. O
More O
often O
than O
not, O
the O
audience O
for O
these O
items O
is O
young. O
Youth, O
in O
fact, O
has O
been O
a O
key O
part O
of O
the O
story O
of O
how O
kimchi B-FOOD
and O
other O
dishes O
spread O
from O
immigrants' O
kitchens O
to O
the O
Instagram O
feeds O
of O
diners O
without O
a O
single O
Korean O
ancestor. O
You O
might O
get O
a O
Chonut B-DISH
at O
Smorgasburg B-EST
with O
your O
roommate, O
take O
down O
a O
bo B-DISH
ssam I-DISH
at O
Momofuku B-EST
Ssam I-EST
Bar I-EST
with O
your O
friends O
from O
college O
and O
sit O
at O
Atomix's B-EST
U-shaped O
counter O
to O
celebrate O
your O
first O
anniversary. O
Hwaban B-EST
, O
which O
opened O
in O
Chelsea B-LOC
in O
August, O
is O
something O
different. O
It's O
the O
modern O
Korean B-CUISINE
restaurant O
where O
you'd O
take O
your O
mother. O
The O
dining O
room O
is O
spare, O
sleek O
and O
uncontroversial. O
The O
brick O
walls O
have O
a O
recent O
coat O
of O
white O
paint, O
and O
there O
is O
plenty O
of O
light O
by O
which O
to O
read O
the O
menus. O
The O
banquettes O
and O
benches O
have O
gentle O
curves O
and O
soothing O
neutral O
colors. O
The O
only O
vaguely O
menacing O
items O
in O
sight O
are O
the O
canteloupe-size O
eyeballs O
hanging O
on O
the O
walls, O
but O
they O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
high-tech O
speakers, O
and O
the O
cocktail O
jazz O
they O
play O
never O
rises O
above O
a O
murmur. O
Just O
inside O
the O
front O
door O
is O
a O
lattice O
of O
shelves O
holding O
simple, O
geometric O
bowls O
and O
teaware. O
These O
give O
Hwaban B-EST
the O
look O
of O
a O
cloistered O
Parisian O
salon B-TYPE
de I-TYPE
thé, I-TYPE
which O
it O
resembles O
in O
other O
ways O
as O
well. O
Exceptional O
green B-FOOD
tea I-FOOD
from O
South B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
is O
brewed O
along O
with O
tisanes B-FOOD
-- O
made O
from O
mulberry B-FOOD
leaves, I-FOOD
mistletoe B-FOOD
stems I-FOOD
or O
dried B-FOOD
wild I-FOOD
pears I-FOOD
-- O
that O
Korean O
mothers O
brew O
in O
winter O
for O
sneezing O
and O
sniffling O
children. O
And O
while O
some O
restaurants O
are O
saving O
money O
by O
doing O
without O
pastry O
chefs, O
Hwaban B-EST
needs O
two O
of O
them O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
its O
obsession O
with O
Western-style O
sweets. O
One, O
Ahram O
Song, O
is O
a O
buttercream B-FOOD
specialist O
who O
tints O
and O
shapes O
frosting B-FOOD
into O
botanically O
detailed O
flower O
arrangements O
decorating O
chocolate B-FOOD
or O
honey-pecan B-FOOD
cakes. I-FOOD
Another, O
Lauren O
Kim, O
makes O
the O
fleecy O
cheesecake B-DISH
that O
is O
carved O
into O
slivers O
the O
length O
of O
a O
dinner O
plate; O
pretty, O
well-tailored O
French B-CUISINE
numbers O
like O
a O
passion-fruit B-DISH
Pavlova I-DISH
or O
a O
drum O
of O
white B-DISH
cake I-DISH
filled I-DISH
with I-DISH
fresh I-DISH
strawberries I-DISH
and I-DISH
frosted I-DISH
with I-DISH
whipped I-DISH
cream; I-DISH
and O
the O
cookies B-DISH
and O
toffees B-DISH
that O
are O
sold O
by O
the O
box, O
for O
takeout. O
The O
illusion O
that O
you've O
wandered O
into O
a O
tearoom B-TYPE
somewhere O
on O
the O
Right B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
is O
extended O
by O
the O
drinks O

which O
has O
only O
two O
Korean B-CUISINE
sojus B-FOOD
and O
a O
handful O
of O
Japanese B-CUISINE
sakes B-FOOD
but O
several O
pages O
of O
wines B-FOOD
from O
France. B-LOC
The O
rest O
of O
the O
menu O
is O
unmistakably O
Korean, B-CUISINE
and O
very O
often O
it O
is O
based O
on O
Korean B-CUISINE
family O
cooking. O
"This O
is O
my O
mother's O
recipe," O
Mihyun O
Han, O
who O
owns O
the O
restaurant O
with O
her O
husband, O
Key O
Kim, O
will O
say O
on O
one O
of O
her O
frequent O
circuits O
around O
the O
tables. O
She O
said O
it O
one O
night O
about O
the O
shaggy O
white O
meatball B-FOOD
of O
chicken, B-FOOD
tofu B-FOOD
and O
mushrooms B-FOOD
-- O
the O
menu O
calls O
it O
a O
dumpling B-DISH
-- O
sitting O
in O
a O
warm O
and O
transfixing O
soy-milk B-FOOD
broth. I-FOOD
Another O
time, O
she O
was O
talking O
about O
what O
she O
calls O
"snowy B-DISH
bibimbap," I-DISH
a O
gentle, O
agreeable O
wintertime O
variation O
on O
the O
classic O
rice B-FOOD
dish O
made O
with O
strands O
of O
mung B-FOOD
bean I-FOOD
jelly I-FOOD
and O
shaved B-FOOD
burdock, I-FOOD
bellflower B-FOOD
root, I-FOOD
and O
other O
vegetables O
in O
shades O
of O
ivory, O
cream O
and O
bone. O
The O
chef, O
Woong O
Jang, O
does O
very O
fine O
work O
in O
white. O
One O
of O
Hwaban's O
most O
luxurious O
dishes O
is O
a O
length O
of O
king O
crab O
leg O
with O
spinach O
and O
a O
poached O
egg, O
all O
surrounded O
in O
a O
rich O
pine-nut O
sauce O
the O
color O
of O
hotel O
sheets. O
Like O
the O
Manhattan O
restaurants O
Atomix O
and O
Jungsik O
, O
Hwaban O
de-emphasizes O
the O
sweeter O
and O
spicier O
side O
of O
the O
Korean O
palate O
so O
other O
flavors O
can O
come O
through. O
Coins O
of O
poached O
pollock O
roe O
are O
sliced O
over O
a O
block O
of O
soft O
tofu O
in O
a O
clear, O
subtle O
dried-seafood O
broth. O
Soy-braised O
abalone O
is O
served O
in O
an O
anchovy O
broth O
that O
is, O
if O
not O
exactly O
subtle, O
at O
least O
soft-spoken. O
One O
of O
two O
pork O
belly O
dishes O
on O
the O
menu O
involves O
ssamjang, O
the O
potent O
soy-chile O
paste O
now O
sold O
in O
supermarkets O
throughout O
the O
land, O
but O
the O
other O
does O
not. O
In O
that O
one, O
you O
eat O
a O
slice O
of O
simmered O
pork O
belly O
together O
with O
a O
pickled O
mushroom O
and O
a O
square O
of O
cabbage O
kimchi. O
There O
is, O
of O
course, O
a O
sharp O
little O
kick O
to O
the O
spicy O
fish O
stew O
known O
as O
maeun-tang, O
and O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
chile O
paste O
in O
the O
daktori-tang O
, O
a O
spin O
on O
the O
classic O
braised O
chicken O

vegetable O
dish, O
both O
of O
which O
Mr. O
Jang O
makes O
very O
well. O
But O
there O
is O
also O
the O
surprise O
of O
tasting O
ginger O
and O
carrots O
along O
with O
the O
chiles O
in O
a O
bright O
orange O
sauce O
for O
seared O
salmon. O
Ms. O
Han O
and O
Mr. O
Kim O
also O
own O
Kosaka O
, O
a O
chiaroscuro O
lair O
for O
omakase O
sushi O
on O
West O
13th O
Street. O
I O
was O
a O
little O
put O
off O
by O
how O
active O
the O
servers O
were O
there; O
just O
as O
I O
was O
focusing O
on O
the O
piece O
of O
fish O
in O
front O
of O
me, O
somebody O
would O
dart O
in O
at O
one O
elbow O
or O
the O
other O
to O
ask O
how O
I O
was O
enjoying O
it O
all. O
The O
service O
style O
is O
similar O
at O
Hwaban, O
but O
it O
plays O
better O
there. O
A O
meal O
at O
Hwaban O
is O
also O
about O
three O
times O
less O
expensive, O
at O
$55 O
for O
an O
appetizer O
and O
two O
main O
courses. O
The O
mains O
are O
served O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
which O
Ms. O
Han O
says O
is O
her O
attempt O
to O
reproduce O
the O
abundance O
of O
Korean O
family O
tables O
like O
her O
mother's. O
Her O
mother O
also O
gets O
credit O
for O
the O
two-sided O
fritters O
of O
minced O
shrimp O
pressed O
against O
zucchini O
coins O
on O
the O
short O
à O
la O
carte O
menu. O
They're O
served O
with O
a O
crisp O
pair O
of O
fried O
shrimp O
and O
little O
cubes O
of O
jelly O
that O
melt O
into O
dipping O
sauce O
on O
contact O
with O
the O
warm O
fritters. O
The O
same O
soy O
jelly O
accompanies O
a O
kimchi-jeon O
that's O
topped O
with O
browned O
mozzarella O
-- O
in O
other O
words, O
a O
kimchi O
pizza. O
It O
would O
fit O
right O
in O
at O
Smorgasburg. O

The O
fancy O
mall O
in O
the O
Time B-LOC
Warner I-LOC
Center I-LOC
known O
as O
the O
Shops B-LOC
at I-LOC
Columbus I-LOC
Circle I-LOC
has O
a O
lot O
to O
answer O
for. O
Its O
opening, O
in O
2003, O
may O
have O
marked O
Manhattan's B-LOC
capitulation O
to O
a O
retail O
landscape O
ruled O
by O
chains O
rather O
than O
independent, O
homegrown O
businesses. O
For O
diners, O
the O
mall O
is O
best O
known O
for O
its O
eating-and-drinking O
zone O
named, O
with O
matchless O
pretentiousness, O
the O
Restaurant O
Collection. O
This O
brought O
us O
Per B-EST
Se I-EST
and O
Masa B-EST
, O
which O
overnight O
made O
the O
city's O
other O
high-end O
restaurants O
seem O
as O
affordable O
as O
Veselka B-EST
. O
It O
was O
the O
start O
of O
a O
new O
class O
of O
restaurants O
where O
dinner O
would O
be O
priced O
like O
a O
luxury O
good, O
with O
entry-level O
meals O
that O
today O
cost O
$300 O
or O
more. O
Much O
more, O
in O
Masa's B-EST
case. O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
exclusivity O
was O
to O
signal O
to O
people O
with O
money O
to O
spend O
that O
they O
would O
be O
comfortable O
spending O
it O
in O
the O
Shops B-LOC
at I-LOC
Columbus I-LOC
Circle. I-LOC
For O
the O
same O
reason, O
businesses O
that O
were O
too O
far O
down-market O
were O
not O
welcome O
as O
tenants. O
This O
is O
why O
there's O
a O
Whole B-EST
Foods I-EST
Market I-EST
but O
not O
a O
Family O
Dollar. O
So O
those O
of O
us O
who O
follow O
David O
Chang's O
mind O
along O
its O
switchbacks O
and O
cul-de-sacs O
have O
to O
wonder O
if O
he O
was O
being O
subversive O
when O
he O
decided O
to O
install O
Bang B-EST
Bar I-EST
, O
which O
is O
essentially O
a O
shawarma B-DIET
stand, I-DIET
on O
the O
mall's O
third O
floor. O
Mr. O
Chang O
is O
a O
close O
observer O
of O
the O
ways O
society O
assigns O
high O
status O
to O
the O
food O
of O
some O
cultures O
and O
devalues O
the O
cooking O
of O
others. O
One O
of O
his O
greatest O
hits O
is O
a O
riff O
about O
New O
Yorkers O
who O
complain O
about O
$17 O
bowls O
of O
ramen B-FOOD
while O
paying O
$30 O
for O
spaghetti. B-FOOD
If O
he O
has O
a O
routine O
about O
vertical O
rotisseries O
I've O
never O
heard O
it, O
but O
surely O
he O
is O
alive O
to O
the O
associations O
they O
conjure, O
from O
Greek B-CUISINE
diners B-TYPE
to O
taco B-TYPE
trucks I-TYPE
to O
the O
Halal B-EST
Guys I-EST
carts B-TYPE
parked O
near O
Columbus B-LOC
Circle. I-LOC
If O
anybody O
grasps O
the O
cultural O
implications O
of O
bringing O
$6 O
street-meat B-FOOD
sandwiches I-FOOD
indoors O
where O
they O
can O
perfume O
the O
air O
breathed O
by O
consumers O
of O
Pink O
shirts O
and O
Floga O
furs, O
it O
is O
Mr. O
Chang. O
Bang B-EST
Bar I-EST
might O
make O
more O
sense O
as O
a O
provocation O
than O
a O
business O
concern. O
It O
begins O
serving O
at O
8:30 O
a.m. O
and O
closes O
when O
the O
food O
is O
gone, O
usually O
by O
1 O
or O
2 O
p.m. O
In O
the O
weeks O
after O
its O
opening, O
on O
Halloween, O
the O
lines O
were O
worthy O
of O
the O
Department O
of O
Motor O
Vehicles. O
Employees O
tried O
to O
appease O
the O
horde O
by O
handing O
out O
off-the-menu O
snacks, O
like O
rice B-DISH
porridge I-DISH
with I-DISH
fermented I-DISH
shiitakes, I-DISH
and O
asking O
whimsical O
survey O
questions. O
("Do O
you O
keep O
peanut B-FOOD
butter I-FOOD
in O
the O
fridge?") O
After O
Mr. O
Chang O
opened O
a O
Momofuku B-EST
Noodle I-EST
Bar I-EST
in O
the O
space O
next O
door, O
Bang B-EST
Bar's I-EST
crowds O
grew O
somewhat O
more O
manageable, O
and O
when O
I O
showed O
up O
for O
breakfast O
at O
the O
end O
of O
December, O
there O
was O
no O
line O
at O
all. O
Maybe O
Deutsche O
Bank O
employees O
will O
keep O
Bang B-EST
Bar's I-EST
early O
shift O
afloat, O
but O
right O
now O
its O
success O
seems O
to O
hinge O
on O
the O
lunch O
rush. O
There O
are O
two O
rotisseries. O
After O
11 O
a.m., O
one O
spit O
is O
buried O
deep O
inside O
a O
missile O
of O
dark B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
marinated O
with O
a O
yakitori-style B-FOOD
glaze. I-FOOD
The O
other O
is O
at O
the O
center O
of O
a O
red, O
dripping, O
gochujang-rubbed B-FOOD
tower I-FOOD
of I-FOOD
pork. I-FOOD
Ideally, O
whichever O
meat B-FOOD
you O
choose O
will O
have O
built O
up O
a O
dark O
outer O
bark O
that O
can O
be O
lopped O
off O
with O
a O
few O
knife O
strokes O
and O
stacked O
on O
to O
a O
disc O
of O
griddled B-FOOD
flatbread. I-FOOD
The O
bread, B-FOOD
thicker O
than O
a O
tortilla B-FOOD
and O
less O
oily O
than O
a O
roti, B-FOOD
will O
be O
rolled O
tight, O
like O
a O
cigarette, O
then O
bent O
in O
half, O
with O
both O
open O
ends O
at O
the O
top. O
This O
is O
called, O
in O
Bang B-EST
Bar I-EST
parlance, O
a O
U. B-DISH
The O
chicken B-FOOD
or O
pork B-FOOD
can O
also O
be O
piled O
over O
a O
bowl O
of O
rice, B-FOOD
but O
the O
bread B-FOOD
is O
really O
very O
good. O
A O
close O
relative O
of O
the O
flatbread B-FOOD
Mr. O
Chang's O
crew O
originated O
at O
Majordomo B-EST
in O
Los B-LOC
Angeles, I-LOC
it O
is O
perceptibly O
tangy O
and O
salted, O
without O
being O
salty. O
A O
couple O
of O
condiments O
-- O
including O
habanero B-FOOD
salsa I-FOOD
and O
the O
brick-red O
Ssam B-FOOD
Sauce I-FOOD
used, O
in O
various O
iterations, O
to O
italicize O
Noodle B-EST
Bar's I-EST
pork B-FOOD
buns I-FOOD
and O
a O
hundred O
other O
creations O
in O
Mr. O
Chang's O
Momofuku B-EST
restaurant O
group O
-- O
are O
kept O
out O
on O
a O
counter O
alongside O
the O
moist O
towelettes. O
But O
they're O
hard O
to O
apply O
once O
a O
U B-DISH
has O
been O
rolled. O
What O
I O
did O
want O
was O
a O
spoonful O
or O
two O
of O
raw O
white B-FOOD
onions, I-FOOD
some O
chopped O
cucumber, B-FOOD
maybe O
parsley B-FOOD
or O
cilantro B-FOOD
-- O
the O
kind O
of O
simple O
salad B-FOOD
that O
is O
almost O
always O
lobbed O
into O
a O
shawarma B-FOOD
or O
a O
doner B-FOOD
kebab. I-FOOD
Both O
the O
chicken B-FOOD
and O
pork B-FOOD
are O
slightly O
sweet, O
and O
could O
use O
a O
lift. O
The O
lunch O
menu O
also O
has O
two O
dips O
-- O
a O
darkly O
fascinating, O
spicy B-FOOD
eggplant I-FOOD
spread, I-FOOD
or O
whipped B-FOOD
chickpeas I-FOOD
whose O
sharp, O
pecorino-like B-FOOD
flavor O
betrays O
the O
presence O
of O
Hozon, B-FOOD
the O
fermented B-FOOD
chickpea I-FOOD
paste I-FOOD
invented O
in O
a O
Momofuku B-EST
laboratory. O
They O
are O
alluring O
enough, O
but O
the O
real O
reason O
to O
order O
them O
is O
the O
bread, B-FOOD
puffier O
and O
softer O
than O
the O
one O
that O
wraps O
the O
U. B-EST
A O
smaller O
version O
of O
this, O
maybe O
five O
inches O
across, O
is O
folded O
in O
half O
like O
a O
taco B-FOOD
to O
make O
a O
"mini," B-DISH
which O
replaces O
the O
U B-DISH
at O
breakfast. O
It O
is O
no O
great O
shock O
that O
this O
bread B-FOOD
works O
nicely O
with O
smoked B-FOOD
salmon I-FOOD
and O
scallion B-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
blended O
with O
just O
enough O
soy B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
to O
make O
it O
arguably O
Asian. B-CUISINE
It O
is O
more O
flavorful O
than O
a O
bagel B-FOOD
and O
better O
at O
holding O
everything O
together. O
But O
it O
is O
somewhat O
surprising O
how O
delicious O
a O
freshly O
griddled O
mini B-DISH
is O
with O
caper-scallion B-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
cheese, I-FOOD
salted B-FOOD
cucumber, I-FOOD
tomato B-FOOD
and O
fresh B-FOOD
dill I-FOOD
inside. O
The O
whole O
thing O
tastes O
alive O
in O
a O
way O
that O
a O
bagel B-FOOD
with O
a O
schmear O
of O
veggie B-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
never O
will. O
I've O
saved O
the O
breakfast B-DISH
mini I-DISH
with I-DISH
mortadella I-DISH
for O
last, O
although O
it's O
been O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
most O
rapt O
online O
attention. O
Building O
logs O
of O
mortadella B-FOOD
layered O
with O
lardo B-FOOD
and O
roasting O
them O
on O
spits O
is O
exactly O
the O
sort O
of O
thing O
the O
Momofuku B-EST
group O
was O
put O
on O
this O
earth O
to O
do. O
I O
am O
glad O
this O
revolving O
meat O
torpedo O
exists. O
I O
respect O
Bang B-EST
Bar's I-EST
cooks O
-- O
this O
collaborative O
effort O
has O
no O
chef, O
Mr. O
Chang O
said O
in O
a O
phone O
interview O
-- O
for O
realizing O
that O
the O
proper O
garnish O
for O
caramelized B-FOOD
mortadella I-FOOD
shavings I-FOOD
is O
a O
slice O
of O
yellow B-FOOD
American I-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
and O
hot B-FOOD
mustard. I-FOOD
I O
appreciate O
the O
respect O
the O
sandwich B-FOOD
pays O
to O
both O
fried B-FOOD
baloney I-FOOD
and O
Taylor B-FOOD
Ham. I-FOOD
And O
if O
I O
were O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
turning O
up O
at O
Columbus B-LOC
Circle I-LOC
with O
a O
hangover O
in O
the O

I O
would O
probably O
become O
a O
regular O
consumer O
of O
mortadella B-DISH
minis I-DISH
with I-DISH
Ssam I-DISH
Sauce. I-DISH
With O
a O
clear O
head O
and O
stomach, O
though, O
the O
saltiness O
can O
be O
a O
little O
too O
bracing. O
At O
either O
meal, O
Bang B-EST
Bar I-EST
offers O
a O
cinnamon B-DISH
roll I-DISH
modeled O
on O
the O
kkwabaegi, B-DISH
the O
twisted O
Korean B-CUISINE
doughnut B-FOOD
stick. O
It O
is O
baked O
rather O
than O
fried, O
making O
it O
a O
rare O
example O
of O
a O
Momofuku B-EST
dish O
that O
contains O
less O
fat B-FOOD
than O
its O
inspiration. O
It O
is O
a O
fine O
pastry B-FOOD
to O
have O
with O
Bang B-EST
Bar's I-EST
Vietnamese B-DISH
coffee, I-DISH
even O
after O
you O
learn O
that O
the O
cream B-FOOD

icing I-FOOD
contains O
fermented B-FOOD
chickpeas. I-FOOD
By O
the O
way, O

or O
bbang B-FOOD
or O
ppang, B-FOOD
depending O
on O
how O
you O
like O
your O
Korean O
words O
transliterated, O
means O
bread. B-FOOD
So O
this O
shawarma B-TYPE
joint I-TYPE
inside O
a O

is O
officially O
a O
bread B-TYPE
bar, I-TYPE
which O
makes O
sense O
given O
how O
pleasant O
the O

is. O
Still, O
I O
can't O
help O
wondering O
how O
the O

Dated O
was O
the O
word O
one O
friend O
used O
after O
going O
to O
Benno B-EST
, O
and O
if O
you've O
eaten O
there, O
too, O
you'll O
know O
why. O
It's O
as O
if O
the O
past O
15 O
years O
in O
food O
never O
happened. O
The O
menu O
seems O
to O
be O
stuck O
in O
some O
time O
between O
1994, O
when O
Thomas O
Keller O
bought O
the O
French B-EST
Laundry, I-EST
and O
2004, O
when O
he O
opened O
Per B-EST
Se I-EST
with O
a O
young O
Jonathan O
Benno O
leading O
the O
kitchen. O
The O
restaurant O
will O
probably O
be O
a O
tough O
sell O
to O
those O
diners O
who O
expect O
all O
restaurants O
to O
fall O
on O
a O
continuum O
between O
Noma B-EST
and O
the O
Salt B-EST
Bae I-EST
place O
. O
But O
I O
prefer O
it O
to O
any O
number O
of O
newer, O
self-consciously O
modern O
restaurants, O
some O
of O
which O
are O
so O
determined O
to O
be O
of O
the O
moment O
that O
they O
might O
as O
well O
have O
a O
time O
stamp. O
Benno B-EST
is O
not O
trying O
to O
be O
contemporary. O
It's O
trying O
to O
be O
delicious. O
And O
it O
is, O
from O
start O
to O
finish, O
almost O
without O
exception. O
Benno B-EST
is O
the O
third O
of O
three O
dining O
operations O
that O
Mr. O
Benno O
opened O
last O
year O
in O
the O
Evelyn B-LOC
Hotel I-LOC
, O
on O
East B-LOC
27th I-LOC
Street. I-LOC
It O
is O
the O
one O
where O
the O
prices, O
and O
presumably O
the O
stakes, O
are O
highest. O
We O
know O
it O
is O
a O
statement O
restaurant O
because O
Mr. O
Benno O
has O
put O
his O
name O
on O
it, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
his O
career. O
Whatever O
the O
statement O
is, O
it O
is O
not O
forward-looking. O
Most O
of O
the O
statement O
is O
in O
French B-CUISINE
(barigoule, B-DISH
mousseline, B-DISH
tête B-DISH
de I-DISH
veau, I-DISH
béarnaise), B-DISH
a O
significant O
part O
is O
in O
Italian B-CUISINE
(carnaroli B-DISH
risotto, I-DISH
garganelli B-DISH
verde, I-DISH
pecorino B-DISH
ginepro) I-DISH
and O
not O
one O
word O
is O
in O
Danish B-CUISINE
or O
Mandarin. B-CUISINE
The O
statement O
has O
a O
lot O
to O
say O
on O
the O
topics O
of O
stocks B-FOOD
and O
purées B-FOOD
and O
accurate O
chopping O
and O
patient O
skimming; O
it O
is O
entirely O
silent O
on O
the O
subjects O
of O
fermented B-FOOD
vegetables, I-FOOD
or O
foraging, O
or O
immigration, O
or O
food O
deserts, O
or O
hashtags. O
The O
statement O
is O
delivered O
in O
a O
windowless O
hotel O
dining O
room O
to O
people O
sitting O
comfortably O
on O
black-leather O
chairs O
or O
velvet O
banquettes O
the O
color O
of O
a O
pinot B-FOOD

five, O
your O

be O
dessert O
and O
one O
a O
main O
course. O
None O
of O
them O
is O
a O
small O
plate O
meant O
for O
sharing. O
None O
is O
a O
large-format O
plate O
either, O
unless O
you O
count O
the O
veal B-DISH
sirloin I-DISH
chop I-DISH
that O
arrives O
on O
a O
silver O
platter O
in O
slices O
that O
are O
as O
pink O
and O
delicately O
shaded O
as O
the O
cheek O
on O
any O
blushing O
young O
aristocrat O
Fragonard O
ever O
painted. O
The O
presentations O
are O
not O
overly O
dramatic. O
They O
can O
be O
disarmingly O
modest, O
like O
the O
cold O
slice O
of O
fish B-DISH
terrine I-DISH
that O
appeared O
before O
the O
appetizers O
one O
night O
looking O
pale O
and O
somewhat O
lost. O
I O
barely O
noticed O
it. O
Then O
I O
tasted O
fennel B-FOOD
and O
other O
bouillabaisse B-FOOD
flavors O
and O
-- O
excuse O
me, O
what O
was O
your O
name O
again? O
-- O
I O
started O
to O
pay O
attention. O
It O
is O
not O
news O
that O
the O
liquid B-FOOD
yolk I-FOOD
of I-FOOD
an I-FOOD
egg I-FOOD
tastes O
good O
trickled O
over O
baby B-FOOD
leeks, I-FOOD
fingerlings, B-FOOD
black-truffle B-FOOD
froth I-FOOD
and O
pioppini B-FOOD
mushrooms I-FOOD
the O
size O
of O
shirt O
buttons. O
But O
just O
how O
good O
it O
is O
makes O
an O
interesting O
item. O
Lamb B-DISH
saddle, I-DISH
with O
grill O
marks O
that O
could O
come O
from O
a O
steakhouse, B-TYPE
is O
served O
with O
fairytale B-FOOD
eggplant I-FOOD
and O
Thumbelina O
carrots. O
Each O
vegetable O
in O
this O
miniature O
garden O
is O
planted O
in O
a O
purée O
or O
a O
reduced O
essence O
of O
itself. O
Each O
is O
very O
good, O
and O
the O
carrots O
are O
fantastic. O
Alongside O
them O
sits O
lamb O
breast O
that O
has O
been O
pressed O
into O
a O
rich O
little O
brick O
coated O
in O
bread O
crumbs. O
One O
corner O
of O
this O
brick O
sits O
in O
a O
dark-green O
spread O
that O
tastes O
like O
gremolata. O
Not O
one O
combination O
of O
flavors O
on O
this O
plate O
is O
original, O
and O
it O
doesn't O
matter O
at O
all. O
The O
Italian O
food O
that O
Mr. O
Benno O
made O
at O
his O
last O
restaurant, O
Lincoln O
Ristorante O
, O
could O
be O
impressive, O
but O
I O
sometimes O
had O
the O
sense O
that O
he O
was O
cooking O
from O
the O
outside O
in, O
trying O
to O
unlock O
the O
flavors O
of O
Italy O
through O
process O
and O
method. O
The O
results O
didn't O
always O
match O
the O
evident O
effort. O
I O
still O
got O
a O
bit O
of O
that O
feeling O
from O
his O
food O
at O
Leonelli O
Taberna O
, O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
Evelyn O
lobby. O
It's O
supposed O
to O
be O
the O
hotel's O
casual O
Italian O
restaurant, O
and O
it O
would O
be O
if O
you O
didn't O
sometimes O
catch O
the O
food O
trying O
to O
relax. O
Only O
a O
lasagna O
with O
green O
noodles O
below O
a O
dark O
field O
of O
browned O
béchamel O
seemed O
completely O
comfortable O
with O
itself. O
(On O
the O
streetside O
end O
of O
the O
hotel O
is O
a O
pastry O
shop O
and O
bakery O
selling O
two-foot-long O
flatbreads O
called O
focaccia O
that O
have O
more O
in O
common O
with O
Roman O
pizza O
al O
taglio.) O
The O
cooking O
at O
Benno, O
overseen O
by O
Justin O
Skribner, O
the O
chef O
de O
cuisine, O
doesn't O
appear O
to O
be O
plagued O
by O
a O
similar O
anxiety. O
The O
French O
ideas, O
like O
a O
drum O
of O
pig's O
trotter O
under O
a O
fried O
quail O
egg O
with O
flageolets O
and O
other O
beans, O
or O
the O
darkly O
seared O
duck O
breast O
with O
melting O
foie O
gras O
and O
a O
savory O
triangle O
of O
duck O
leg, O
dates O
and O
pistachios O
in O
brik O
pastry, O
have O
an O
easy O
inevitability. O
Pasta O
is O
unlikely O
to O
become O
the O
thing O
Benno O
is O
known O
for. O
Still, O
when O
the O
kitchen O
stretches O
to O
Italy, O
nice O
things O
happen. O
Lobster O
fra O
diavolo, O
with O
the O
bent O
shells O
called O
lumache, O
is O
a O
tribute O
to O
an O
American O
pop O
hit O
made O
over, O
in O
the O
Thomas O
Keller O
tradition, O
with O
maximum O
clarity O
and O
precision. O
Spaghetti O
made O
with O
grano O
arso, O
or O
burned-wheat O
flour, O
tasted O
pleasantly O
toasted O
rather O
than O
incinerated O
as O
it O
soaked O
up O
the O
liquor O
of O
tiny O
hard-shell O
clams O
and O
a O
soft O
mass O
of O
very O
fresh O
sea O
urchin O
roe. O
Technique O
never O
overplayed O
its O
hand O
in O
these O
dishes. O
The O
only O
time O
it O
came O
up O
short O
was O
when O
a O
drum O
of O
steelhead O
salmon O
poached O
in O
olive O
oil O
arrived O
slightly O
mushy O
and O
underdone. O
A O
week O
later, O
the O
fish O
was O
cooked O
more O
successfully. O
The O
scope O
of O
the O
Evelyn's O
dining O
operation O
is O
big O
enough O
to O
support O
a O
full-time O
baker O
(Lisa O
Kalemkiarian, O
responsible O
for O
Benno's O
needle-tipped O
mini-baguettes, O
among O
other O
items) O
and O
pastry O
chef O
(Lindsey O
Bittner, O
whose O
desserts O
include O
a O
rosemary O
flan O
with O
candied O
cranberries O
that O
I O
ordered O
every O
time O
I O
went, O
so O
I O
could O
watch O
other O
people O
try O
it O
for O
the O
first O
time). O
You O
couldn't O
call O
the O
wine O
list O
dated, O
with O
its O
unwashed, O
uncombed O
natural O
types O
among O
other O
groomed, O
sedate O
numbers, O
and O
some O
fine O
values O
between O
$50 O
and O
$75 O
tiptoeing O
among O
the O
super-Tuscans O
and O
2005 O
Bordeaux. O
All O
this O
should O
persuade O
some O
skeptics O
to O
give O
Benno O
a O
try. O
The O
restaurant's O
greatest O
challenge O
is O
that O
the O
food O
seems O
to O
come O
from O
an O
era O
that's O
too O
old O
to O
seem O
fresh O
but O
too O
recent O
to O
feel O
nostalgic O
about. O
When O
pop O
music O
is O
that O
age, O
we O
cringe. O
When O
buildings O
are O
that O
age, O
we O
knock O
them O
down O
before O
they O
can O
be O
landmarked. O
But O
sometimes O
one O
chef O
cooking O
what O
he O
believes O
is O
better O
than O
10 O
chefs O
cooking O
what O
somebody O
else O
believes. O

The O
nice O
man O
who O
brought O
samples O
of O
the O
banoffee B-DISH
macaron I-DISH
to O
me O
and O
other O
customers O
one O
recent O
morning O
began, O
a O
few O
moments O
later, O
to O
gently O
buff O
the O
doors O
and O
windows O
of O
a O
new, O
rose-gold O
prototype O
car O
with O
a O
soft O
cloth. O
I O
could O
see O
this O
because O
the O
car O
and O
I O
were O
sharing O
a O
room O
on O
West B-LOC
14th I-LOC
Street. I-LOC
The O
car O
was O
in O
the O
back O
and O
I O
was O
in O
the O
middle, O
sitting O
at O
one O
of O
the O
cafe O
tables O
near O
the O
stairs O
to O
the O
second O
floor, O
where O
there O
is O
a O
bar O
shaped O
like O
a O
wheel O
and O
a O
restaurant O
with O
a O
menu O
devised O
by O
Gregory O
Marchand, O
the O
chef O
of O
the O
Frenchie O
restaurants O
in O
Paris B-LOC
and O
London. B-LOC
The O
employees O
in O
all O
of O
these O
rooms O
work O
for O
the O
Union O
Square O
Hospitality O
Group O
, O
which O
I O
suppose O
means O
that O
Danny O
Meyer, O
the O
group's O
founder O
and O
one O
of O
the O
world's O
best-known O
restaurateurs, O
is O
now O
also O
in O
the O
business O
of O
polishing O
automobiles. O
The O
whole O
operation O
is O
called O
Intersect B-DISH
by I-DISH
Lexus I-DISH
, O
which O
gives O
you O
a O
good O
idea O
who O
made O
the O
car O
and O
was O
paying O
to O
keep O
it O
shiny O
and O
free O
of O
dust. O
Intersect O
by O
Lexus O
is O
one O
of O
those O
modern O
places O
where O
brands, O
instead O
of O
asking O
you O
to O
buy O
one O
of O
their O
products O
then O
and O
there, O
instead O
try O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
the O
kinds O
of O
emotions O
about O
the O
brand O
that O
may O
lead O
to O
a O
sale O
later O
on. O
This O
is O
a O
job O
formerly O
performed O
by O
advertisements. O
In O
fact, O
Lexus O
used O
to O
publish O
a O
print O
magazine O
and O
mail O
it O
to O
its O
customers, O
back O
when O
that O
seemed O
like O
a O
good O
way O
to O
persuade O
people O
to O
have O
emotions O
about O
a O
car. O
Now O
we O
live O
in O
the O
age O
of O
the O
"branded O
experience." O
A O
toilet-paper O
manufacturer O
will O
send O
you O
a O
wheeled O
toilet O
on O
demand O
. O
A O
mattress O
company O
will O
encourage O
you O
to O
sleep O
inside O
a O
roaming O
"napmobile." O
Makers O
of O
a O
crunchy O
orange O
snack O
open O
restaurants, O
lasting O
just O
a O
few O
days O
, O
where O
chefs O
put O
the O
crunchy O
orange O
snack O
into O
meatballs, B-FOOD
tacos, B-FOOD
cheesecakes B-FOOD
and O
everything O
else. O
You O
cannot O
get O
Anne O
Burrell O
to O
sprinkle O
a O
Lexus O
over O
the O
top O
of O
your O
mac B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
cheese, I-FOOD
however, O
and O
not O
just O
because O
the O
cheapest O
one O
costs O
$33,000 O
more O
than O
a O
bag O
of O
crunchy O
orange O
snacks. O
Intersect O
by O
Lexus O
takes O
a O
different O
approach, O
closer O
to O
that O
of O
A/D/O O
, O
a O
"creative O
hub" O
in O
Greenpoint, B-LOC
Brooklyn, I-LOC
owned O
by O
the O
car O
brand O
Mini. O
A/D/O O
offers O
temporary O
exhibitions, O
talks, O
performances, O
work O
spaces O
for O
designers O
and O
a O
sun-filled, O
roomy O
Scandinavian B-CUISINE
cafe B-TYPE
whose O
kitchen O
was, O
for O
a O
time, O
overseen O
by O
the O
chef O
Fredrik O
Berselius O
and O
the O
restaurateur O
Claus O
Meyer O
. O
(Mr. O
Berselius O
is O
no O
longer O
involved.) O
When O
I O
ate O
at O
the O
cafe, B-TYPE
shortly O
after O
A/D/O O
opened, O
the O
food O
barely O
dented O
my O
consciousness, O
although O
I O
remember O
thinking O
that O
if O
I O
worked O
nearby O
I O
probably O
would O
drop O
in O
for O
lunch O
or O
a O
cortado. O
In O
the O
same O
way, O
if O
I O
find O
myself O
in O
the O
meatpacking B-LOC
district I-LOC
by O
day, O
I O
might O
join O
the O
Wi-Fi O
philosophers O
who O
occupy O
the O
spindle-backed O
chairs O
downstairs O
at O
Intersect, B-EST
just O
so O
I O
could O
get O
a O
maple-bacon B-DISH
scone, I-DISH
a O
recipe O
imported O
from O
Frenchie B-EST
to I-EST
Go I-EST
on O
the O
Rue B-LOC
du I-LOC
Nil I-LOC
in O
Paris. B-LOC
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
I'd O
go O
well O
out O
of O
my O
way O
to O
eat O
upstairs O
at O
Intersect B-EST
again. O
It's O
not O
a O
restaurant O
in O
three O
dimensions O
-- O
the O
service, O
while O
skilled, O
is O
a O
bit O
anonymous, O
and O
the O
interior O
is O
a O
hodgepodge O
of O
expensive, O
subtle O
design O
and O
bric-a-brac O
that O
might O
have O
been O
ordered O
from O
a O
catalog. O
But O
the O
food O
is O
some O
of O
the O
most O
engaging O
I've O
come O
across O
in O
the O
past O
few O
months, O
and O
it O
will O
go O
away O
after O
the O
end O
of O
March, O
when O
Mr. O
Marchand's O
menu O
will O
be O
replaced O
by O
one O
devised O
by O
another O
chef O
from O
somewhere O
else O
in O
the O
world, O
chosen O
by O
representatives O
from O
Union O
Square O
Hospitality O
Group O
and O
Lexus. O
(A O
formal O
review, O
with O
stars, O
would O
be O
obsolete O
almost O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
was O
published.) O
I've O
never O
made O
it O
to O
Frenchie B-DISH
or O
its O
branch O
in O
London. B-LOC
Many O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
chefs O
have, O
however, O
and O
working O
my O
way O
through O
Mr. O
Marchand's O
dishes O
at O
Intersect B-EST
helped O
me O
understand O
what O
other O
restaurants O
around O
town O
have O
been O
trying O
to O
imitate: O
the O
charred B-FOOD
leaves, I-FOOD
the O
cooked B-FOOD
grains, I-FOOD
the O
gently O
swirling O
patterns O
that O
suggest O
the O
chef O
has O
been O
plating O
food O
on O
a O
turntable. O
Grilled B-FOOD
baby I-FOOD
leek I-FOOD
greens I-FOOD
angled O
out O
around O
a O
pile O
of O
barley B-FOOD
topped O
with O
what O
looked O
like O
a O
deviled B-FOOD
egg. I-FOOD
It O
was, O
in O
fact, O
a O
smoked B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
lemon-spiked I-FOOD
yolk I-FOOD
plopped O
in O
the O
center O
of O
some O
"whites" O
made O
of O
Parmesan B-FOOD
sabayon. I-FOOD
Spice O
and O
crunch O
came O
from O
puffed B-FOOD
barley I-FOOD
dusted O
with O
piment B-FOOD
d'Espelette. I-FOOD
It O
was O
just O
tricky O
enough, O
this O
dish. O
And O
I O
loved O
the O
way O
a O
caraway B-FOOD
brioche, I-FOOD
pickled B-FOOD
mustard I-FOOD
seeds I-FOOD
and O
cucumbers B-FOOD
completed O
the O

allusions O
begun O
by O
a O
foie B-DISH
gras I-DISH
terrine I-DISH
with O
layers O
of O
soft, O
smoky O
pastrami. B-FOOD
There O
was O
a O
very O
welcome O
spin O
on O
skate B-DISH
grenobloise I-DISH
in O
which O
the O
fish B-FOOD
was O
replaced O
by O
creamy O
white B-FOOD
halibut I-FOOD
under O
a O
golden O
bread-crumb B-FOOD
crust; I-FOOD
sea B-FOOD
beans I-FOOD
extended O
the O
briny O
flavor O
of O

in O
the O
brown B-FOOD

sauce. I-FOOD
And O
if O
this O
all O
sounds O
a O
bit O
cerebral, O
the O
big, O
pillowy, O
pan-seared B-DISH
gnocchi I-DISH
with I-DISH
fried I-DISH
sweetbreads I-DISH
and I-DISH
veal-glazed I-DISH
mushrooms I-DISH
proved O
that O
Mr. O
Marchand O
knows O
the O
appeal O
of O
animal O
instincts. O
What O
to O
make O
of O
those O
few O
dishes O
that O
did O
not O
come O
together O
-- O
the O
pebbles O
of O
cauliflower B-FOOD
under O
a O
layer O
of O
seeds B-FOOD
and O
nuts B-FOOD
that O
looked O
as O
if O
it O
had O
spilled O
from O
a O
bird O
feeder, O
or O
the O
lukewarm O
chocolate B-DISH
mousse I-DISH
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
a O
deep O
bowl? O
Was O
the O
problem O
Mr. O

The O
way O
the O
Union O

Hospitality O
kitchen O
crew, O
led O
by O

them O
out? O
The O
local O

Mr. O
Martinez O
and O
Dylan O
Shipsey, O
the O
general O

say O
they O
want O
customers O
to O
feel O
as O
if O

Frenchie B-EST

Intersect B-EST
does O
not O
have O
the O
premodern O
limestone O
wall O
and O
ceiling O
timbers O
of O
the O
Rue B-LOC
du I-LOC
Nil, I-LOC
but O
Mr. O

tried O
to O
sprinkle O
some O
Right B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
pixie O
dust O
on O
West B-LOC
14th I-LOC
Street I-LOC
by O
choosing O
the O
plates O
and O
bowls, O
consulting O
on O
flower O
arrangements O
and O
sharing O
his O
Spotify O

Maybe O
those O
things O
help. O
But O
the O
dining O
room, O
by O
the O
design O
firm O
Wonderwall O
, O
mostly O
looks O
like O
money O
to O
me, O
apart O
from O
the O
shelves O
half-filled O
with O
coffee-table O
books, O
black O
crow O

and O
other O
eerily O
generic O
knickknacks. O
At O
least O
somebody O
had O
the O
good O
sense O
to O
keep O
the O

downstairs, O

In O
what O

nobody O

somebody O
was O

marveling O
about O

at O
a O
time O
so O
they O
can O
test-drive O
their O
ideas O
before O

The O

and O

sometimes O
turn O
over O
the O
menu O
to O

The O

reproduces O
a O
dozen O
or O
so O
dishes O
that O
are O
strongly O
identified O
with O
other O
restaurants O
around O
the O
world. O
To O
understand O
the O
appeal O
for O
chefs O
of O
these O
pop-ups O
and O
residencies, O
think O
about O
the O
Instagram O
posts, O
the O
email-address O
caches, O
the O
preview O
news O
items, O
even O
the O
occasional O
reviews O
they O
generate. O
For O
a O
few O
months' O
or O
even O
a O
few O
nights' O
work, O
a O
restaurant O
can O
refresh O
its O
aura O
of O
newness O
and O
relevance. O
In O
an O
era O
that O
feeds O
on O
novelty, O
chefs O
who O
just O
keep O
plugging O
along O
can O
seem O
older O
than O
they O
really O
are. O
The O
events O
make O
the O
host O
restaurant O
look O
cooler, O
too. O
(It's O
been O
a O
while O
since O
Union O
Square O
Hospitality O
Group O
hired O
a O
chef O
who O
got O
menu O
analysts O
chattering O
the O
way O
Mr. O
Marchand O
does.) O
And O
of O
course, O
people O
who O
go O
to O
these O
dinners O
can O
boast O
about O
them O
on O
social O
media. O
It's O
a O
big, O
beautiful O
marketing O
ecosystem O
in O
which O
everybody O
from O
predators O
to O

gets O
to O
believe O
they're O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O

New B-LOC
York I-LOC
used O
to O
be O
a O
one-mole O
town, O
and O
that O
was O
mole B-DISH
poblano. I-DISH
A O
chocolate-colored, O
bittersweet O
agglomeration O
of O
two O
dozen O
or O
so O
ingredients, O
it O
comes, O
like O
most O
of O
the O
city's O
Mexican O
immigrants, O
from O
the O
state O
of O
Puebla. B-LOC
Typically O
simmered O
with O
chicken, B-FOOD
mole B-DISH
poblano I-DISH
was O
a O
staple O
of O
takeout B-TYPE
joints I-TYPE
and O
lunch B-TYPE
counters I-TYPE
and O
restaurants O
before O
anyone O
took O
Mexican B-CUISINE
food O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
seriously. O
All O
the O
other O
moles B-FOOD
-- O
Oaxaca's B-LOC
mole B-DISH
verde, I-DISH
say, O
which O
gets O
its O
green O
color O
from O
pumpkin B-FOOD
seeds, I-FOOD
tomatillos B-FOOD
and O
fresh B-FOOD
herbs I-FOOD
-- O
were O
about O
as O
rare O
as O
a O
mandarin O
duck O
in O
Central O
Park. O
In O
recent O
years, O
as O
these O
once-exotic O
species O
have O
become O
regular O
features O
of O
the O
menus O
at O
Cosme O
, O
Empellón O
, O
Claro O
and O
other O
restaurants, O
mole O
poblano O
has O
become O
something O
like O
the O
pigeon O
of O
Mexican O
sauces, O
too O
common O
and O
familiar O
to O
be O
worth O
noticing. O
If O
you O
share O
this O
low O
view O
of O
mole O
poblano, O
you O
owe O
it O
to O
yourself O
to O
have O
the O
one O
at O
Casa O
Enrique O
. O
The O
chef, O
Cosme O
Aguilar, O
calls O
it O
mole O
de O
Piaxtla, O
after O
the O
Pueblan O
town O
where O
his O
father O
grew O
up, O
and O
as O
a O
reminder O
that O
there O
is O
not O
just O
one O
mole O
poblano O
but O
many. O
Some O
have O
apple O
in O
addition O
to O
raisins. O
Some O
are O
thickened O
with O
animal O
crackers. O
Mr. O
Aguilar O
remembers O
that O
in O
his O
childhood O
home, O
plantains O
were O
allowed O
to O
hang O
until O
they O
were O
black O
before O
they O
could O
be O
pounded O
into O
mole. O
Maybe O
this O
explains O
the O
particular O
sweetness O
of O
Casa O
Enrique's O
version, O
which O
is O
not O
the O
candy-bar O
sweetness O
of O
some. O
It's O
deep O
and O
complicated. O
The O
character O
of O
this O
mole O
de O
Piaxtla O
unfurls O
as O
you O
eat, O
whether O
the O
sauce O
has O
been O
soaked O
into O
enchiladas O
filled O
with O
chicken O
or O
simply O
pooled O
on O
a O
plate O
over O
and O
under O
a O
quartered O
chicken O
and O
yellow O
rice O
cooked O
with O
peas. O
Mr. O
Aguilar O
has O
been O
frying, O
blending O
and O
stirring O
mole O
de O
Piaxtla O
since O
Casa O
Enrique O
opened O
in O
2012, O
just O
off O
Vernon O
Boulevard, O
in O
Long O
Island O
City, O
Queens. O
In O
fact, O
he O
has O
barely O
changed O
his O
menu O
since O
our O
Hungry O
City O
critic, O
Ligaya O
Mishan, O
reviewed O
it O
the O
next O
year. O
Mr. O
Aguilar O
says O
he O
is O
emulating O
the O
restaurants O
he O
likes O
best O
in O
Mexico, O
ones O
whose O
kitchens O
make O
the O
same O
dishes O
year O
in O
and O
year O
out. O
Whether O
despite O
this O
or O
because O
of O
it, O
the O
restaurant O
seems O
to O
have O
improved O
in O
subtle O
ways. O
Acoustic O
panels O
tacked O
to O
the O
ceiling O
make O
conversation O
easier. O
Servers, O
always O
welcoming, O
have O
become O
experts O
at O
anticipating O
the O
meal's O
ebb O
and O
flow. O
They'll O
step O
in O
just O
when O
you're O
ready O
for O
a O
fresh O
drink, O
maybe O
a O
margarita O
with O
some O
tamarind O
this O
time O
to O
offset O
the O
raw-sugar O
syrup. O
They'll O
gauge O
the O
precise O
moment O
when O
you're O
ready O
to O
have O
dinner O
plates O
cleared O
to O
make O
room O
for O
dessert. O
Or O
they'll O
break O
away O
from O
your O
table O
just O
long O
enough O
to O
join O
in O
a O
full-throated O
singing O
of O
"Happy O
Birthday" O
around O
a O
slice O
of O
tres O
leches O
cake O
with O
a O
candle O
stuck O
in O
it O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
room. O
This O
may O
happen O
three O
or O
four O
times O
a O
night, O
probably O
not O
because O
Casa O
Enrique O
looks O
particularly O
festive O
-- O
from O
floor O
to O
ceiling, O
it's O
done O
almost O
entirely O
in O
white O
-- O
but, O
I'd O
guess, O
because O
regulars O
know O
it O
regularly O
outperforms O
any O
number O
of O
other O
restaurants O
that O
might O
seem O
to O
be O
more O
special O
on O
the O
surface O
but O
aren't, O
really. O
Also, O
the O
tres O
leches O
cake, O
if O
not O
as O
soggy O
with O
condensed O
milk O
as O
it O
could O
be, O
is O
still O
pretty O
good, O
though O
I O
think O
the O
flan O
is O
almost O
mandatory, O
and O
it, O
too, O
is O
a O
perfectly O
credible O
birthday-candle O
holder. O
Although O
the O
guacamole O
is O
freshly O
mashed O
and O
pleasingly O
minimalist, O
I O
tend O
to O
skip O
it O
as O
long O
as O
the O
people O
I'm O
with O
don't O
mind. O
Instead O
I'll O
head O
straight O
for O
the O
two-bite O
sopecitos O
topped O
with O
refried O
beans O
and O
loose O
chorizo, O
or O
the O
albondigas O
in O
cumin-laced O
chipotle O
sauce, O
each O
of O
the O
three O
meatballs O
stuffed O
with O
hard-cooked O
eggs. O
The O
best O
Mexican O
seafood O
dishes O
often O
come O
from O
restaurants O
that O
specialize O
in O
them. O
Mr. O
Aguilar, O
though, O
seems O
equally O
at O
home O
with O
fish O
and O
meat. O
The O
market O
fish O
offered O
as O
a O
main O
course O
-- O
lately O
a O
black O
sea O
bass O
-- O
has O
always O
been O
seared O
to O
a O
crisp O
on O
the O
skin O
side. O
Still, O
in O
all O
these O
years O
I've O
never O
been O
convinced O
that O
the O
corn O
under O
it O
compares O
to O
the O
best O
street-corner O
esquites, O
or O
that O
it O
and O
the O
fish O
really O
add O
up O
to O
a O
whole O
dish. O
The O
seafood O
appetizers, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
are O
some O
of O
my O
favorite O
things O
at O
Casa O
Enrique: O
the O
delicately O
fried O
oysters O
sitting O
in O
a O
mayonnaise O
that O
gets O
its O
tangerine O
color O
from O
ground O
chiles; O
the O
ceviche, O
freshly O
tossed O
with O
lime O
and O
herbs; O
the O
crab O
tostadas, O
loaded O
with O
a O
thin O
slice O
or O
two O
of O
Serrano O
chile, O
chopped O
tomato, O
leaves O
of O
cilantro, O
smooth O
avocado O
salsa O
and O
a O
spoonful O
of O
crab O
meat, O
pure O
and O
clean; O
and O
the O
shrimp O
cocktail, O
which O
gets O
its O
roundness O
and O
slight O
richness, O
I O
think, O
from O
orange O
soda, O
just O
the O
way O
you'd O
hope. O
Mr. O
Aguilar O
is O
not O
one O
of O
those O
chefs O
who O
set O
up O
masa O
factories O
in O
their O
basements. O
Casa O
Enrique's O
corn O
tortillas O
do O
not O
have O
the O
pretty O
floral O
aromas O
of O
Cosme's, O
or O
the O
sweet, O
focused O
corn O
flavor O
you O
taste O
in O
Claro's. O
But O
they O
are O
better O
than O
you'd O
find O
almost O
anywhere O
else O
in O
New O
York. O
They O
give O
a O
boost O
to O
the O
tacos, O
made O
with O
braised O
tongue O
or O
brisket; O
crumbled O
chorizo; O
or O
fried, O
battered O
fish, O
and O
they O
are O
especially O
delicious O
soaked O
in O
salsa O
verde O
and O
wrapped O
around O
roasted O
poblanos O
in O
cream O
to O
make O
enchiladas O
Doña O
Blanca. O
And O
while O
Cosme's O
more O
modern O
approach O
has O
soaked O
up O
more O
media O
attention, O
I've O
encountered O
more O
bloops O
and O
wobbles O
eating O
there O
than O
I O
have O
exploring O
the O
far O
more O
traditional O
menu O
at O
Casa O
Enrique. O
It O
isn't O
necessarily O
the O
more O
interesting O
restaurant, O
but O
it's O
the O
one O
where O
I'm O
more O
confident O
that O
if O
I O
went O
there O
tonight, O
everything O
would O
taste O
exactly O
the O
way O
it O
was O
supposed O
to. O
The O
pozole O
will O
be O
dark O
and O
intense, O
though O
not O
especially O
spicy, O
with O
tender O
strands O
of O
pork O
in O
the O
broth O
and O
all O
the O
usual O
mix-ins O
waiting O
on O
the O
side. O
The O
pork O
ribs O
will O
be O
slowly O
braised, O
in O
the O
style O
of O
Chiapas, O
in O
a O
thick O
cooked O
salsa O
built O
on O
a O
foundation O
of O
guajillo O
chiles. O
These O
ribs O
are O
not O
to O
be O
confused O
with O
the O
baby O
back O
ribs, O
cooked O
in O
an O
even O
thicker, O
creamier O
pipian O
rojo, O
that O
sometimes O
turn O
up O
as O
a O
daily O
special. O
Best O
of O
all, O
perhaps, O
will O
be O
the O
chamorro O
de O
borrego, O
or O
lamb O
shank O
stewed O
with O
chickpeas; O
it O
will O
be O
very O
tender O
and O
very O
flavorful O
in O
its O
rough O
sauce O
of O
pulla O
chiles O
with O
crushed O
guaje O
seeds. O
The O
name O
of O
that O
sauce O
is O
huaxmole, O
or O
sometimes O
guaxmole, O
or O
even O
mole O
de O
guaje. O
Yes, O
it's O
a O
mole, O
and O
one O
that O
rarely O
flies O
as O
far O
north O
as O
New O
York O
City. O
At O
Casa O
Enrique, O
it O
has O
found O
a O
permanent O
perch. O

also O
from O

Google, O
those O
all-purpose O
giants. O
Everybody's O
a O
critic, O
right? O
I O
happen O
to O
get O
paid O
for O
criticism, O
and O
I O
would O
like O
to O
criticize O
that O
old O
platitude O
right O
out O
the O
window: O
No, O
everybody O
is O
not O
a O
critic. O
What O
most O
of O
you O
are O
doing O
out O
there, O
online O
and O
in O
three O
dimensions, O
is O
complaining. O
When O
we O
complain, O
we O
experience O
something O
that O
we O
don't O
like O
and O
we O
say O
something O
about O
it. O
A O
critic O
doesn't O
write O
about O
his O
own O
dissatisfaction, O
or O
doesn't O
just O
do O
that. O
A O
critic O
has O
to O
poke O
his O
head O
out O
of O
his O
turtle O
shell, O
look O
around O
and O
gesture, O
with O
stubby O
legs, O
toward O
the O
sources O
of O
dissatisfaction. O
Done O
perceptively, O
with O
analytic O
thinking O
and O
an O
effort O
to O
connect O
the O
dots O
between O
this O
experience O
and O
others, O
this O
can O
be O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
value O
system O
that O
readers O
might O
share, O
or O
reject, O
or O
at O
least O
attempt O
to O
understand. O
Complaining O
is O
as O
easy O
as O
breathing. O
Writing O
criticism O
is O
a O
real O
pain. O
That O
was O
a O
complaint, O
by O
the O
way. O
But O
criticism O
and O
complaint O
are O
closely O
related O
enough O
for O
me O
to O
know O
that O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
complaining O
going O
on, O
and O
that O
most O
of O
the O
complaints O
aren't O
having O
any O
effect O
at O
all. O
This O
may O
not O
be O
the O
point. O
People O
who O
study O
complaints O
divide O
them O
into O
two O
categories, O
instrumental O
and O
expressive. O
An O
instrumental O
complaint O
is O
"directed O
toward O
a O
specific O
target O
and O
intended O
to O
bring O
about O
a O
specific O
outcome," O
according O
to O
Robin O
Kowalski, O
a O
professor O
of O
psychology O
at O
Clemson O
University O
who O
has O
studied O
the O
social O
functions O
of O
complaining. O
Calling O
a O
restaurant's O
owner O
the O
next O
day O
to O
say O
that O
you O
waited O
an O
hour O
for O
dessert O
and O
don't O
intend O
to O
come O
back O
is O
an O
instrumental O
complaint. O
Texting O
a O
friend O
to O
say O
the O
polar O
vortex O
is O
making O
your O
skin O
peel O
off O
is O
an O
expressive O
complaint. O
We O
call O
expressive O
complaints O
venting, O
kvetching, O
griping O
or O
a O
number O
of O
other O
names. O
It's O
important O
to O
know O
which O
of O
the O
two O
types O
of O
complaint O
is O
right O
for O
you O
before O
opening O
the O
first O
can O
of O
invective. O
Venting O
has O
its O
uses. O
In O
one O
study, O
Dr. O
Kowalski O
and O
some O
colleagues O
showed O
that O
when O
we O
are O
asked O
to O
put O
our O
feelings O
of O
dissatisfaction O
with O
somebody O
into O
writing, O
our O
"positive O
affect" O
-- O
good O
feelings, O
basically O
-- O
will O
rise O
about O
15 O
minutes O
later, O
after O
an O
initial O
downswing. O
In O
the O
same O
way, O
if O
a O
meal O
lets O
you O
down, O
taking O
a O
pair O
of O
pliers O
and O
a O
blowtorch O
to O
the O
restaurant O
on O
Yelp O
might O
give O
you O
a O
brief O
lift. O
But O
once O
the O
rush O
of O
having O
gotten O
it O
off O
your O
chest O
is O
gone, O
you'd O
realize O
nothing O
has O
changed. O
You're O
still O
out O
the O
price O
of O
dinner, O
and O
you O
won't O
find O
out O
whether O
your O
grievance O
has O
reached O
the O
right O
ears O
unless O
somebody O
at O
the O
restaurant O
responds. O
Some O
owners O
make O
a O
point O
of O
scouring O
review O
sites O
so O
they O
can O
do O
just O
that. O
Others O
use O
the O
review's O
date O
and O
details O
to O
identify O
and O
get O
in O
touch O
with O
the O
kvetcher. O
But O
there O
are O
more O
direct O
ways O
to O
get O
your O
gripe O
acknowledged O
than O
scrawling O
it O
on O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
internet. O
"If O
there's O
something O
that's O
really O
bothering O
you, O
the O
ultimate O
benefits O
are O
going O
to O
come O
from O
targeted O
complaining O
," O
Dr. O
Kowalski O
said. O
"Telling O
the O
person O
or O
restaurant." O
I O
know, O
I O
know. O
This O
is O
the O
part O
I O
avoid, O
too, O
by O
saving O
all O
my O
criticisms O
for O
my O
reviews. O
I O
hate O
confrontations, O
I O
run O
from O
them, O
I'd O
rather O
pay O
the O
check, O
even O
with O
my O
own O
money, O
and O
walk O
out O
never O
to O
return. O
But O
let's O
say O
you O
want O
something O
out O
of O
your O
complaint. O
Maybe O
you O
just O
want O
a O
rib-eye B-FOOD
that's O
still O
rare O
instead O
of O
the O
overdone O
paving O
stone O
you O
were O
served. O
Or O
you O
have O
a O
reason O
for O
wanting O
an O
item O
taken O
off O
your O
bill. O
Or O
(and O
I O
think O
this O
is O
what O
most O
people O
are O
looking O
for O
when O
they O
complain) O
you O
just O
want O
somebody O
to O
look O
you O
in O
the O
eye O
and O
say: O
"So O
sorry O
about O
that. O
Is O
there O
anything O
we O
can O
do O
to O
make O
it O
right?" O
Whatever O
you O
want, O
you're O
more O
likely O
to O
get O
it O
if O
you O
have O
a O
word O
with O
a O
manager O
either O
before O
you O
leave O
or O
later O
on. O
As O
a O
side O
benefit, O
you'll O
be O
helping O
the O
restaurant, O
too; O
when O
somebody O
is O
un O
happy O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
meal, O
almost O
any O
manager O
or O
restaurateur O
wants O
to O
know. O
"We O
actually O
really O
welcome O
complaints," O
said O
Melinda O
Shopsin, O
a O
film O
producer O
who O
cooks O
and O
waits O
tables O
at O
Shopsin's, B-EST
her O
family's O
restaurant O
on O
the O
Lower B-LOC
East I-LOC
Side. I-LOC
This O
may O
come O
as O
a O
surprise O
to O
anyone O
who O
has O
heard O
the O
numerous O
accounts O
of O
customers' O
being O
tossed O
out O
of O
Shopsin's B-EST
for O
any O
number O
of O
arcane O
infractions. O
And O
yet, O
Ms. O
Shopsin O
says O
that O
when O
her O
mother O
was O
still O
alive, O
she O
would O
ask O
what O
was O
wrong O
when O
she O
saw O
an O
unfinished O
plate, O
and O
then O
take O
a O
bite O
to O
see O
for O
herself. O
At O
other O
restaurants, O
this O
exploratory O
bite O
may O
happen O
backstage, O
in O
the O
kitchen. O
If O
you're O
going O
to O
make O
an O
instrumental O
complaint, O
though, O
you O
still O
need O
to O
figure O
out O
whether O
the O
reasons O
you're O
unhappy O
are O
subjective O
or O
objective. O
Did O
Medieval B-EST
Times I-EST
undercook O
the O
chicken, B-FOOD
or O
do O
you O
just O
not O
like O
eating O
with O
your O
hands? O
Even O
if O
you're O
pretty O
sure O
the O
problem O
is O
objective, O
it O
can O
be O
useful O
to O
pretend O
it's O
subjective, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
diplomacy. O
The O
chef O
John O
Tesar O
recalls O
a O
night, O
soon O
after O
he'd O
opened O
his O
Knife B-EST
steakhouse B-TYPE
in O
Dallas, B-LOC
when O
he O
got O
into O
an O
argument O
with O
a O
customer O
about O
the O
weight O
of O
a O
steak O
-- O
an O
objective O
complaint O
if O
ever O
there O
was O
one. O
"We O
had O
a O
33-ounce O
rib-eye B-DISH
for I-DISH
two," I-DISH
Mr. O
Tesar O
said. O
One O
customer O
who O
ordered O
it O
wasn't O
convinced O
and O
began O
"screaming," O
according O
to O
Mr. O
Tesar: O
"‘This O
steak B-FOOD
is O
too O
small! O
This O
isn't O
enough O
to O
feed O
all O
of O
us!'" O
He O
went O
to O
the O
table, O
and O
the O
hostilities O
quickly O
escalated, O
he O
said, O
until O
"I O
went O
into O
the O
kitchen, O
got O
a O
scale, O
grabbed O
the O
steak, O
weighed O
it O
in O
front O
of O
her, O
and O
said, O
‘It's O
36 O
ounces!'" O
The O
story O
ends O
happily, O
with O
the O
two O
combatants O
meeting O
again O
at O
a O
dinner O
party O
some O
time O
later O
and O
getting O
along O
swimmingly. O
"We O
both O
realized O
how O
absurd O
and O
insecure O
we O
were O
being," O
he O
said. O
All O
this O
might O
have O
been O
avoided O
if O
the O
complaint O
had O
been O
cast O
subjectively: O
"That O
steak O
looks O
smaller O
than O
we O
expected. O
Are O
you O
sure O
it's O
the O
one O
we O
ordered?" O
Subjective O
complaints O
are O
still O
important O
data O
for O
restaurants. O
If O
one O
person O
doesn't O
like O
the O
new O
hot-dog O
lasagna, O
it's O
an O
aberration. O
If O
15 O
people O
don't O
like O
it, O
the O
recipe O
probably O
needs O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
workshop. O
The O
chef O
or O
owner O
needs O
to O
know O
this, O
but O
also O
needs O
to O
hear O
it O
in O
terms O
that O
won't O
lead O
to O
a O
screaming O
match O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
. O
Perhaps O
you O
have O
seen O
Gordon O
Ramsay O
critique O
another O
chef's O
cooking O
on O
television? O
Don't O
do O
it O
like O
that. O
In O
general, O
the O
more O
specific O
your O
complaint, O
the O
more O
likely O
it O
is O
to O
be O
understood. O
The O
worst, O
most O
useless O
and O
potentially O
dangerous O
complaints O
are O
broad, O
sweeping O
condemnations. O
"There O
is O
complaining O
that O
makes O
you O
think O
about O
what O
you're O
doing, O
and O
there O
is O
complaining O
where O
everybody O
thinks O
they're O
entitled O
to O
say O
anything," O
said O
Rita O
Sodi, O
the O
chef O
and O
owner O
of O
the O
Tuscan O
restaurant O
I O
Sodi O
in O
Manhattan. O
"Saying, O
‘This O
is O
terrible' O
is O
not O
complaining. O
That O
is O
being O
rude. O
It's O
like, O
‘You're O
ugly.' O
It's O
telling O
me O
that O
I'm O
ugly. O
It's O
personal. O
It's O
my O
food." O
Even O
when O
the O
person O
you're O
grousing O
to O
did O
not O
cook O
your O
pasta O
personally, O
you O
should O
proceed O
gently, O
in O
nonconfrontational O
terms. O
It O
may O
be O
helpful O
to O
imagine O
that O
you O
are O
speaking O
with O
an O
air O
traffic O
controller O
trying O
to O
land O
20 O
jets O
during O
a O
snowstorm; O
you O
would O
try O
very O
hard O
not O
to O
add O
to O
the O
overall O
stress O
level O
in O
the O
tower, O
even O
if O
your O
child O
was O
on O
one O
of O
those O
jets. O
"If O
you O
can O
be O
patient, O
open O
and O
polite, O
that's O
really O
helpful," O
Ms. O
Shopsin O
said. O
"The O
more O
collaborative O
and O
open O
you O
can O
be O
-- O
‘Excuse O
me, O
I'm O
sorry' O
-- O
even O
though O
it's O
not O
your O
fault O
that O
it O
got O
messed O
up. O
People O
have O
to O
understand O
that O
sometimes O
to O
fix O
a O
mistake O
is O
not O
easy." O
And O
sometimes, O
a O
restaurant O
can O
make O
customers O
happy O
by O
changing O
something O
that O
isn't O
a O
mistake O
at O
all. O
Occasionally, O
diners O
at O
Shopsin's O
who O
had O
ordered O
migas O
complained O
about O
finding O
cilantro O
in O
the O
dish. O
Initially, O
the O
response O
would O
be O
that O
migas O
are O
supposed O
to O
have O
cilantro. O
Which O
may O
be O
true, O
but O
perhaps O
wasn't O
the O
point. O
Now, O
Ms. O
Shopsin O
asks O
customers O
whether O
they O
like O
cilantro. O
If O
the O
answer O
is O
no, O
there O
won't O
be O
any O
in O
their O
food, O
even O
if, O
strictly O
speaking, O
it O
belongs O
there. O
"Complaints O
do O
help O
change O
things," O
she O
said. O

It O
is O
a O
safe O
guess O
that O
the O
Eastern O
European O
Jews O
who O
brought O
the O
bialy B-FOOD
from O
Bialystok B-LOC
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City, I-LOC
piecing O
back O
together O
the O
recipe O
for O
this O
plain O
but O
beguiling O
dimpled O
roll B-FOOD
in O
their O
new O
world O
after O
fleeing O
their O
old O
one, O
did O
not O
do O
it O
so O
that O
one O
day O
it O
could O
be O
sliced O
open O
and O
stuffed O
with O
a O
New B-LOC
Jersey I-LOC
pork B-FOOD
sausage I-FOOD
that O
comes O
in O
a O
cloth O
sack. O
To O
be O
fair, O
this O
was O
not O
the O
original O
plan O
at O
Shelsky's B-EST
Brooklyn I-EST
Bagels I-EST
, O
either. O
The O
idea O
was O
to O
serve O
pork B-DISH
roll, I-DISH
egg I-DISH
and I-DISH
cheese I-DISH
sandwiches I-DISH
on O
a O
kaiser B-FOOD
roll I-FOOD
or O
one O
of O
the O
bakery's O
palm-size, O
hand-rolled O
bagels. O
Peter O
Shelsky, O
the O
bakery's O
owner, O
grew O
up O
in O
Manhattan, O
but O
he O
knew O
that O
some O
good O
things O
come O
from O
New O
Jersey, O
particularly O
pork O
roll, O
which O
he O
wanted O
to O
sell O
in O
the O
mornings. O
Also O
known O
as O
Taylor O
ham, O
pork O
roll O
is O
a O
cured, O
smoked O
and O
cooked O
meat O
product O
that O
has O
the O
tightly O
pebbled O
appearance O
of O
engineered O
stone, O
like O
a O
Corian O
countertop O
made O
of O
flesh. O
Pressing O
sliced O
pork O
roll O
on O
a O
hot O
griddle O
intensifies O
its O
saltiness O
while O
giving O
it O
a O
hint O
of O
a O
crust O
that O
contrasts O
attractively O
with O
the O
slightly O
spongy O
interior. O
Griddled O
pork O
roll, O
combined O
with O
a O
cooked O
egg O
and O
a O
slice O
of O
American O
cheese, O
is O
eaten O
across O
New O
Jersey O
as O
a O
breakfast O
sandwich. O
Usually O
it O
is O
found O
on O
a O
kaiser O
roll. O
Sometimes O
it O
is O
seen O
on O
a O
bagel. O
But O
some O
Shelsky's O
customers O
requested O
it O
on O
a O
freshly O
baked O
bialy, O
and O
others O
followed, O
and O
now O
pork O
roll O
sandwiches O
made O
on O
bialys O
are O
nearly O
as O
popular O
as O
the O
ones O
made O
on O
rolls, O
with O
bagels O
a O
distant O
third. O
The O
bialy O
might O
have O
been O
custom-made O
for O
the O
job, O
particularly O
the O
ones O
at O
Shelsky's, O
which O
are O
baked O
to O
a O
darker O
brown, O
their O
thumbprint O
divots O
filled O
with O
a O
more O
robustly O
caramelized O
onion O
confit, O
than O
garden-variety O
bialys. O
Both O
traits O
are O
intensified O
if O
you O
have O
the O
bialy O
thoroughly O
toasted, O
as O
the O
person O
behind O
the O
counter O
will O
almost O
certainly O
recommend. O

Cherry B-EST
Point I-EST
sits O
on O
Manhattan B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
in O
Greenpoint, B-LOC
a O
few O
steps O
from O
the O
corner O
where O
Bedford B-LOC

having O
flowed O
all O
the O
way O
across O
Brooklyn B-LOC
from O
the O
shores O
of O
Sheepshead B-LOC
Bay, I-LOC
suddenly O
comes O
to O
an O
end. O
The O
area O
is O
marked O
by O
a O
cluster O
of O

Some O
have O
a O
washed-up O
feeling, O
as O
if O
they'd O
all O
been O
drifting O
along O
in O
Bedford's B-LOC
currents O
and O
had O
been O
stranded O
there. O
A O
few O
stand O
out O
in O
the O
landscape. O
In O
the O
fall, O
Cherry B-EST
Point I-EST
took O
a O
decisive O
turn O
into O
the O
second O
category O
when O
a O
new O
chef O
took O
over, O
but O
not O
everyone O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
seems O
to O
realize O
it O
yet. O
People O
still O
tumble O
in O
for O
happy O

when O

take O
a O

to O

and O
then O
after O
happy O
hour O
ends O
at O
7 O
p.m. O
most O
of O
the O
crowd O
generally O
drifts O
out O
to O
find O
somewhere O
else O
for O
dinner. O
The O
space, O
with O
its O
old-timey O
wainscoting O
and O
its O
central O
bar, O
is O
easy O
to O
mistake O
for O
a O
tavern. B-TYPE
Let's O
say O
you O
were O
among O
those O
who O
stayed O
put. O
Contemporaneously O
with O
your O
cocktail, B-FOOD
you O
worked O
on O
a O
few O
smoked B-FOOD
olives, I-FOOD
green O
and O
warm; O
swirled O
a O
few O
of O
the O
golden, O
bite-size O
pig's B-FOOD
head I-FOOD
croquettes I-FOOD
in O
a O
pale-pinkish O
ketchup B-FOOD
made O
from O
pears; B-FOOD
and O
became O
curious O
about O
what O
else O
this O
kitchen O
was O
up O
to. O
At O
one O
point O
you O
noticed O
that O
the O
dining O
room O
suddenly O
smelled O
like O
an O
herb B-FOOD
garden O
in O
August, O
and O
a O
minute O
later O
Belon B-FOOD
oysters I-FOOD
on O
a O
nest O
of O
smoking B-FOOD
rosemary I-FOOD
branches I-FOOD
sailed O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
opening O
that O
lights O
up O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant. O
You O
ordered O
a O
plate O
of O
your O
own O
because O
you O
wanted O
to O
know O
how O
the O
warm O
oysters B-FOOD
would O
taste O
under O
their O
yellow O
blankets O
of O
smoked B-FOOD
rosemary I-FOOD
hollandaise. I-FOOD
From O
a O
short O
list O
of O
charcuterie B-FOOD
you O
chose O
the O
squab B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
pork I-FOOD
terrine, I-FOOD
with O
a O
few O
prunes B-FOOD
embedded O
into O
the O
pink O
and O
pleasingly O
coarse-grained O
slab. O
You O
spread O
this O
on O
toast B-FOOD
with O
creamy O
whole-grain B-FOOD
mustard, I-FOOD
apricot-ginger B-FOOD
mostarda I-FOOD
or O
some O
of O
the O
pear B-FOOD
ketchup, I-FOOD
all O
of O
them O
made O
on O
the O
premises, O
like O
the O
pearl B-FOOD
onions I-FOOD
pickled O
in O
beer B-FOOD
and O
the O
terrine B-FOOD
itself. O
And O
you O
might O
have O
thought: O
If O
these O
are O
just O
the O
snacks, O
what O
is O
the O
food O
going O
to O
be O
like O
when O
this O
kitchen O
gets O
down O
to O
business? O
Whatever O
happens, O
odds O
are O
there O
will O
be O
meat B-FOOD
on O
the O
table. O
Cherry B-EST
Point I-EST
opened O
in O
2016, O
taking O
over O
what O
had O
been O
a O
Polish B-CUISINE
restaurant O
called O
Cinamoon. B-EST
The O
charcuterie B-FOOD
was O
made O
on O
site O
from O
the O
start, O
but O
the O
menu O
swerved O
in O
a O
more O
meat-focused B-FOOD
and O
English-leaning B-CUISINE
direction O
last O
fall O
when O
Ed O
Szymanski O
was O
hired O
as O
the O

This O
might O
have O
been O
predicted, O
if O
not O
from O
Mr. O
Szymanski's O
English O
upbringing O
and O
British O
citizenship, O
then O
from O
his O
work O
history. O
He O
has O
cooked O
at O
the O
Beatrice B-EST
Inn I-EST
, O
where O
various O
beasts O
of O
air O
and O
land O
are O
posed O
on O
silver O
platters O
for O
their O
roles O
in O
a O
fall-of-Rome O
spectacle; O
the O
Spotted B-EST
Pig I-EST
, O
in O
the O
days O
when O
it O
was O
still O
known O
for O
burgers B-FOOD
basted O
in O
Roquefort B-FOOD
and O
toasts B-FOOD
buried O
under O
chopped O
chicken B-FOOD
livers; I-FOOD
and O
Pitt B-EST
Cue I-EST
, O
a O
London B-LOC
outpost B-TYPE
of O
the O
modern, O
urbanized O
barbecue B-FOOD
genre. O
For O
a O
panoramic O
tour O
of O
Mr. O
Szymanski's O
accumulated O
meat B-FOOD
wisdom, O
you O
could O
call O
two O
days O
ahead O
and O
reserve O
a O
game-and-beef B-DISH
dinner, I-DISH
$65 O
for O
at O
least O
four O
courses O
along O
the O
lines O
of O
grilled B-FOOD
tongue I-FOOD
on O
watercress. B-FOOD
The O
everyday O
menu, O
though, O
is O
not O
exactly O
made O
up O
of O
grain B-FOOD
bowls. I-FOOD
On O
any O
given O
night, O
you O
can O
drop O
in O
and O
marvel O
at O
the O
fried B-DISH
lamb I-DISH
ribs, I-DISH
their O
apple B-FOOD
glaze I-FOOD
augmented O
by O
broken O
coriander B-FOOD
and O
fennel B-FOOD
seeds I-FOOD
and O
raw O
curls O
of O
shallot. B-FOOD
The O
quail B-FOOD
will O
be O
butterflied, O
grilled O
over O
charcoal O
and O
served O
on O
toast, B-FOOD
with O
pickled B-FOOD
prunes I-FOOD
above O
it O
and O
a O
reduction O
swirled O
with O
port B-FOOD
below. O
The O
duck B-FOOD
breast I-FOOD
will O
be O
seared O
down O
until O
the O
skin O
is O
a O
thin O
brown O
sheet O
next O
to O
pink O
and O
juicy O
meat. B-FOOD
This O
is O
served O
with O
roasted, B-FOOD
puréed I-FOOD
celery I-FOOD
root I-FOOD
and O
brûléed B-FOOD
pears. I-FOOD
The O
plates O
are O
marked O
by O
a O
refinement O
and O
moderation O
that O
is O
not O
always O
achieved O
by O
other O
chefs O
in O
the O
guts-and-fat O
school O
of O
cookery. O
A O
creamy O
pheasant, B-FOOD
leek I-FOOD
and I-FOOD
bacon I-FOOD
pie I-FOOD
is O
sealed O
inside O
a O
cast-iron O
pot O
by O
a O
beauty O
of O
a O
suet B-FOOD
crust I-FOOD
-- O
lacquered, O
scored O
in O
a O
starburst O
and O
very O
tender. O
Care O
is O
even O
lavished O
on O
the O
grilled B-DISH
rib-eye I-DISH
for I-DISH
two, I-DISH
which O
comes O
to O
the O
table O
with O
neatly O
sawed O
lengths O
of O
bone B-FOOD
marrow I-FOOD
under O
a O
tidy O
crust O
of O
parsley, B-FOOD
chives, B-FOOD
pickle B-FOOD
shallots I-FOOD
and O
buttered B-FOOD
bread I-FOOD
crumbs. I-FOOD
Mr. O
Szymanski O
does O
not O
gesture O
toward O
fish B-FOOD
and O
vegetables B-FOOD
very O
often, O
but O
when O
he O
does O
he O
generally O
musters O
some O
conviction. O
True, O
the O
roasted B-DISH
pumpkin I-DISH
mash I-DISH
with O
toasted B-FOOD
hazelnuts I-FOOD
and O
fresh O
cheese B-FOOD
has O
an O
obligatory O
air, O
as O
does O
the O
grilled B-DISH
bread I-DISH
with O
labneh B-FOOD
and O
honey. B-FOOD
But O
the O
smoked B-DISH
whitefish I-DISH
salad, I-DISH
with O
caramelized B-FOOD
shallots I-FOOD
and O
crème B-FOOD
fraîche I-FOOD
and O
a O
side O
of O
saltines, O
is O
more O
energetic O
than O
you O
might O
guess. O
Grilled B-DISH
flatbread I-DISH
looks O
out O
of O
place O
on O
this O
menu, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
fine O
canvas O
for O
roasted B-FOOD
hens-of-the-woods I-FOOD
and O
other O
wild O
mushrooms B-FOOD
that O
are O
fleshy O
and O
flavorful O
enough O
to O
get O
noticed O
on O
their O
own. O
Skate, B-DISH
a O
main O
course, O
comes O
with O
smoked B-FOOD
German I-FOOD
butterball I-FOOD
potatoes I-FOOD
and O
a O
soaring, O
fino B-FOOD
sherry-laced I-FOOD
beurre I-FOOD
blanc. I-FOOD
The O
salad B-DISH
of O
radicchio B-FOOD
and O
other O
bitter B-FOOD
lettuces I-FOOD
is O
as O
crisp O
and O
refreshing O
as O
any O
plate O
of O
leaves B-FOOD
can O
be O
in O
February. O
It O
is O
also O
a O
very O
good O
thing O
to O
eat O
with O
steak, B-FOOD
as O
it O
happens. O
Anyone O
who O
has O
not O
caught O
on O
to O
the O
English B-CUISINE
theme O
so O
far O
will O
get O
a O
last O
chance O
with O
the O
dessert O
menu, O
which O
offers O
treacle B-DISH
tart, I-DISH
sticky B-DISH
toffee I-DISH
pudding, I-DISH
a O
posset B-DISH
and O
three O
cheeses, B-DISH
all O
from O
England. B-LOC
The O
treacle B-DISH
tart I-DISH
was O
dry O
when O
I O
had O
it. O
The O
sticky B-DISH
toffee I-DISH
pudding I-DISH
was O
surprisingly O
but O
not O
unpleasantly O
cakelike. O
The O
posset, B-DISH
though, O
is O
a O
small O
miracle, O
an O
eggless B-FOOD
custard I-FOOD
of O
sugar, B-FOOD
lemon B-FOOD
juice I-FOOD
and O
cream B-FOOD
scented O
with O
Earl B-FOOD
Grey I-FOOD

dressed O
up O
with O
Cara B-FOOD
Cara I-FOOD
orange I-FOOD
wedges O
and O
a O
few O
Earl B-FOOD

meringues. I-FOOD
There O
should O
be O
more O
possets B-FOOD
around O
town. O
There O
should O
be O
possets B-FOOD
galore. O
And O
by O
the O
way, O
there O
should O
be O
more O
wine O
lists O
like O
Cherry B-EST
Point's. I-EST
Assembled O
by O
Garret O
Smith, O
who O
owns O
the O
restaurant O
with O
Vincent O
Mazeau, O
it O
consistently O
favors O
obscure O
and O
surprising O
over O
familiar O
and O
dull. O
By O
the O
bottle, O
there O
are O
oddities O
such O
as O
apple B-FOOD
wine I-FOOD
and O
mead, B-FOOD
but O
also O
a O
few O
things O
you O
might O
have O
heard O
of: O
a O
cremant B-DISH
d'Alsace I-DISH
from O
Dirler B-EST
Cadé, I-EST
a O
Sybille B-DISH
Kuntz I-DISH
riesling, I-DISH
an O
Olga B-DISH
Raffault I-DISH
chinon I-DISH
and O
a O
lean, O
exact O
pinot B-DISH
noir I-DISH
from B-EST
Enderle I-EST
& I-EST
Moll. I-EST
Only O
two O
bottles, O
both O
sparkling B-FOOD
wines, I-FOOD
are O
over O
$100, O
and O
most O
of O
the O
others O
are O
closer O
to O
$50. O
At O
these O
prices, O
you O
could O
just O
close O
your O
eyes O
and O
pick O
something, O
which O
is O
lucky O
because O
the O
servers, O
though O
charming O
and O
truly O
unpretentious, O
haven't O
fully O
internalized O
the O
list's O
ins O
and O
outs. O
It's O
one O
of O
the O
ways O
in O
which O
Cherry B-EST
Point I-EST
seems O
not O
to O
have O
caught O
up O
yet O
with O
how O
good O
it O
has O
become. O
If O
you O
treat O
it O
like O
a O
bar, B-TYPE
you O
might O
not O
notice. O
But O
if O
you O
eat O
the O
way O
I O
did, O
ordering O
half O
the O
menu O
at O
a O
time, O
you O
could O
be O
putting O
more O
stress O
on O
the O
infrastructure O
than O
it O
can O
handle. O
You O
might O
be O
in O
for O
a O
very O
slow O
meal. O
But O
it O
will O
also O
be O
a O
very O
good O
meal. O

The O
great O
Midtown B-LOC
shrines O
to O
French B-CUISINE
cuisine O
were O
mourned O
one O
by O
one O
as O
they O
went, O
often O
at O
length O
and O
in O
print. O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
another O
style O
of O
French B-CUISINE
restaurant O
was O
dying O
off, O
but O
generally O
without O
benefit O
of O
a O
full O
obituary. O
This O
was O
the O
small, O
discreet O
bistro B-TYPE
with O
forehead-height O
curtains O
in O
the O
windows, O
Piaf O
on O
the O
speakers, O
snails B-FOOD
on O
the O
menu, O
chips O
on O
the O
china. O
They O
could O
be O
found O
uptown O
or O
downtown, O
almost O
always O
on O
a O
side O
street. O
Unlike O
Le B-EST
Pavillon, I-EST
La B-EST
Côte I-EST
Basque I-EST
and O
their O
ilk, O
and O
unlike O
Keith O
McNally's O
immersive O
brasserie O
sets O
, O
which O
came O
later, O
these O
bistros B-TYPE
were O
rarely O
fashionable. O
They O
were O
filled O
with O
professors O
and O
psychotherapists, O
Paris O
Review O
readers O
and O
Film O
Society O
of O
Lincoln O
Center O
members. O
Occasionally O
a O
passer-by O
out O
walking O
the O
dog O
would O
stand O
on O
tiptoe O
to O
peer O
over O
the O
curtain, O
but O
paparazzi O
did O
not O
stake O
out O
the O
doors O
of O
these O
establishments. O
Individually, O
few O
were O
landmarks. O
Collectively, O
their O
quiet O
continental O
self-assurance, O
their O
indifference O
to O
the O
passage O
of O
time, O
not O
to O
mention O
their O
crèmes B-FOOD
brûlées I-FOOD
and O
blood B-FOOD
sausages I-FOOD
and O
Fleuries, O
helped O
form O
the O
backdrop O
of O
the O
city. O
You O
always O
thought O
you'd O
have O
one O
within O
walking O
distance. O
Then, O
one O
day, O
you O
didn't. O
Bistro B-EST
Pierre I-EST
Lapin I-EST
, O
which O
the O
chef O
and O
restaurateur O
Harold O
Moore O
opened O
last O
May O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
Village, I-LOC
is O
either O
a O
very O
late O
entry O
into O
the O
genre, O
or O
else O
a O
homage O
of O
impressive O
intensity. O
The O
dining O
room O
has O
the O
forehead-height O
curtains O
-- O
green O
gingham. O
It O
has O
Piaf O
on O
the O
playlist, O
and O
also O
Pink O
Martini's O
"Sympathique," O
which O
has O
become O
the O
"Vie O
en O
Rose" O
of O
the O
Spotify O
era, O
for O
better O
or O
worse. O
Pierre O
Lapin O
also O
throws O
in O
some O
frills O
that O
go O
beyond O
the O
basic O
formula. O
White O
tapers O
burn O
on O
every O
table, O
wall O
sconces O
throw O
off O
Cognac-colored O
light O
from O
behind O
lampshades O
the O
size O
of O
teacups, O
a O
collection O
of O
thin O
flowery O
china O
dishes O
supplements O
the O
chunky O
white O
bistro O
ware. O
Most O
of O
all, O
Pierre O
Lapin O
has O
that O
rich, O
creamy, O
antique O
cooking O
-- O
all O
the O
stuff O
nouvelle B-CUISINE
cuisine O
tried O
to O
kill. O
As O
soon O
as O
you O
order, O
you O
get O
a O
preview O
of O
what O
you're O
in O
for: O
A O
length O
of O
chewy, O
substantial O
baguette B-FOOD
arrives O
with O
a O
small O
mound O
of O
cultured B-FOOD
butter, I-FOOD
a O
pile O
of O
truffled B-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
spread I-FOOD
and O
a O
pink O
hunk O
of O
rustic O
pork B-FOOD
pâté. I-FOOD
On O
a O
quiet O
night O
at O
home, O
this O
could O
serve O
as O
a O
light O
dinner. O
At O
Pierre B-EST
Lapin, I-EST
it O
is O
a O
little O
snack O
to O
stave O
off O
hunger O
before O
the O
appetizers. O
Going O
back O
at O
least O
as O
far O
as O
his O
days O
at O
Commerce B-EST
, O
Mr. O
Moore O
has O
seemed O
at O
home O
with O
profuse O
helpings O
and O
sauces O
that O
settled O
over O
them O
like O
a O
goose-down O
duvet O
over O
a O
sleeping O
Saint O
Bernard. O
After O
closing O
that O
restaurant, O
he O
opened O
an O
ode O
to O
Southern B-CUISINE
immoderation B-TYPE
called O
Harold's B-EST
Meat I-EST
& I-EST
Three, I-EST
now O
just O
Harold's B-EST
; O
the O
most O
memorable O
thing O
I've O
eaten O
there O
was O
a O
Kentucky B-LOC
hot B-DISH
brown I-DISH
sandwich I-DISH
on O
which O
the O
Mornay B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
flowed O
freely. O
He O
also O
briefly O
ran O
a O
less O
focused O
study O
of O
Americana O
called O
the O
Greenwich B-EST
Grille, I-EST
where O
I O
ate O
a O
chicken B-DISH
potpie I-DISH
that O
I O
thought O
had O
potential. O
About O
a O
week O
later, O
I O
learned O
that O
the O
place O
had O
closed. O
None O
of O
Mr. O
Moore's O
previous O
kitchens O
went O
for O
the O
gut O
quite O
as O
gleefully O
as O
Pierre B-EST
Lapin's. I-EST
Your O
first O
course O
there O
could O
well O
be, O
and O
almost O
certainly O
will O
be O
if O
you O
leave O
the O
choice O
to O
me, O
an O
avalanche O
of O
mushrooms B-FOOD
in I-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
cascading O
over O
the O
edge O
of O
a O
tall O
slab O
of O
buttered B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
griddled I-FOOD
pain I-FOOD
de I-FOOD
mie. I-FOOD
But O
it O
would O
be O
a O
mistake O
to O
overlook O
the O
Brie B-DISH
au I-DISH
four, I-DISH
roughly O
half O
a O
pound O
of O
baked B-FOOD
Brie I-FOOD
melting O
among O
dried B-FOOD
figs I-FOOD
and O
walnuts, B-FOOD
all O
served O
with O
toasted B-FOOD
baguette. I-FOOD
I O
ended O
up O
ordering O
the O
Brie B-FOOD
for O
the O
table, O
which O
freed O
somebody O
else O
to O
get O
the O
very O
meaty O
frogs' B-FOOD
legs I-FOOD
in O
a O
small O
lake O
of O
parsley, B-FOOD
garlic, B-FOOD
butter B-FOOD
and O
lemon B-FOOD
juice, I-FOOD
while O
another O
guest O
tried O
the O
"balle B-DISH
de I-DISH
matzo I-DISH
en I-DISH
consommé." I-DISH
In O
English, O
that O
means O
a O
nice O
bowl O
of O
chicken B-FOOD
soup I-FOOD
with O
a O
single O
matzo B-FOOD
ball I-FOOD
so O
densely O
packed O
that O
if O
you O
tossed O
it O
out O
of O
a O
second-story O
window O
it O
would O
probably O
put O
a O
dent O
in O
a O
car O
hood. O
This O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
trait O
in O
a O
matzo B-FOOD
ball I-FOOD
unless O
you O
happen O
to O
own O
the O
car. O
The O
lusty O
tune O
begun O
by O
the O
appetizers O
is O
picked O
up O
by O
the O
main O
courses. O
There O
is O
a O
fairly O
classic O
coq B-DISH
au I-DISH
vin, I-DISH
not O
too O
winy-tasting; O
some O
hefty O
sea B-DISH
scallops I-DISH
under O
toasted B-FOOD
almonds, I-FOOD
sensibly O
outfitted O
with O
endive B-FOOD
and O
citrus B-FOOD
sections; O
and O
a O
grouping O
of O
gnocchi, B-FOOD
foie B-FOOD
gras, I-FOOD
sautéed B-FOOD
sweetbreads I-FOOD
and O
mushrooms, B-FOOD
black B-FOOD
truffle I-FOOD
shavings O
and O
puffy O
chicken B-FOOD
dumplings, I-FOOD
all O
milling O
around O
in O
a O
Cognac-flamed B-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
sauce. I-FOOD
It O
sounds O
insanely O
overcrowded, O
but O
is O
very O
rewarding O
to O
unpack. O
We O
have O
only O
scratched O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
menu. O
It O
goes O
on, O
perhaps O
longer O
than O
it O
should, O
because O
some O
dishes O
are O
more O
appealing O
than O
others. O
A O
black B-FOOD
sea I-FOOD
bass I-FOOD
"bonne B-DISH
femme" I-DISH
was O
simply O
dull O
instead O
of O
simple. O
The O
soupy, O
thin O
cassoulet B-DISH
could O
have O
used O
more O
meat B-FOOD
and O
a O
thicker O
crust O
of O
bread B-FOOD
crumbs. I-FOOD
The O
garlic B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
Mr. O
Moore O
made O
for O
snails B-FOOD
tasted O
less O
garlicky O
than O
run-of-the-mill O
snail B-FOOD
butter; I-FOOD
the O
snails B-FOOD
and O
I O
never O
figured O
out O
what O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
do O
with O
the O
sunny-side-up B-FOOD
egg I-FOOD
planted O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
plate. O
The O
menu O
could O
be O
trimmed O
by O
about O
a O
third. O
The O
same O
is O
most O
likely O
true O
for O
a O
few O
individual O
dishes, O
although O
Mr. O
Moore's O
shambolic, O
celebratory O
cooking O
style O
is O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
Pierre B-EST
Lapin I-EST
works O
as O
well O
as O
it O
does. O
If O
he O
tidied O
everything O
up O
he'd O
be O
going O
head-to-head O
with O
Le B-EST
Coucou I-EST
, O
a O
contest O
that O
would O
not O
play O
to O
his O
strengths. O
The O
excess, O
the O
untucked O
shirttails O
on O
the O
dishes, O
the O
incomplete O
thoughts O
on O
the O
menu O
are O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant's O
charm. O
That O
charm O
does O
not O
quite O
extend O
to O
the O
wine O
list, O
which O
looks O
like O
one O
from O
four O
decades O
ago. O
It's O
almost O
entirely O
drawn O
from O
Bordeaux, B-FOOD
Burgundy B-FOOD

the O

with O
very O
few O

under O
$75. O
This O
seems O
to O
be O
taking O
the O
joke O
a O
little O
too O
far O
-- O
in O
1971, O
you O
could O
still O
get O
cheap O
Bordeaux. B-FOOD
I O
drank O
well, O
but O
I O
always O
spent O
more O
on O
it O
than O
I O
meant O
to, O
which O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
thing O
that O
can O
keep O
diners O
from O
coming O
back. O
For O
dessert O
there O
is O
a O
coconut B-DISH
cake I-DISH
that O
has O
little O
to O
do O
with O
France. B-LOC
Dense O
and O
rich O
in O
a O
homespun O
American B-CUISINE
style O
that O
some O
people O
will O
love O
and O
others O
will O
find O
too O
leaden, O
it O
followed O
Mr. O
Moore O
here O
from O
Commerce, B-EST
where O
it O
was O
a O
big O
hit. O
Other O
members O

the O

The O
chocolate B-DISH
mousse I-DISH
is O
deliciously O
dark, O

not O
as O
airy O
as O
it O
could O
be. O
The O
sugar B-FOOD
crust I-FOOD
on O
the O
crème B-DISH

burned O

order. O
Both O
are O
overshadowed, O
though, O
by O
a O
peculiarly O
likable O
Pavlova. B-DISH
It O
is O
conceived O
as O
a O
tart, B-FOOD
with O
a O
meringue B-FOOD
crust I-FOOD

a O
whipped-cream B-FOOD

once O

Part O
of O
the O
fun O
of O
eating O
at O
a O
pop-up B-TYPE
is O
the O
thrill O
of O
invading O
a O
space O
after O
hours, O
like O
being O
locked O
in O
the O
museum O
at O
night O
with O
the O
whale O
and O
the O
diamonds. O
Another O
part O
is O
the O
sense O
of O
being O
in O
on O
a O
secret, O
eating O
at O
some O
place O
that O
doesn't O
have O
a O
Yelp O
entry O
and O
may O
not O
even O
have O
a O
name, O
while O
your O
friends O
are O
waiting O
in O
line O
at O
Roberta's B-EST
. O
The O
mismatch O
between O
the O
borrowed O
space O
and O
the O
borrowers O
can O
send O
off O
sparks, O
too. O
Three O
years O
ago, O
when O
the O
Danish O
chef O
Bo O
Bech O
staged O
a O
one-night O
pop-up B-TYPE
in O
the O
kitchen O
at O
Cosme B-EST
in O
Manhattan, B-LOC
using O
ingredients O
he'd O
bought O
from O
farmers O
and O
shellfishers O
in O
Virginia B-LOC
the O
day O
before, O
his O
Mid-Atlantic-Nordic B-CUISINE
cooking O
stood O
out O
against O
the O
aromas O
of O
griddled B-FOOD
masa I-FOOD
and O
roasted B-FOOD
chiles. I-FOOD
When O
a O
pop-up B-TYPE
settles O
down O
into O
a O
space O
of O
its O
own, O
it O
loses O
those O
things. O
In O
their O
place, O
it O
takes O
on O
the O
extra O
weight O
of O
proprietorship. O
The O
owners O
have O
to O
make O
decisions O
that O
were O
previously O
made O
for O
them, O
and O
those O
decisions O
will O
start O
to O
define O
them. O
It's O
their O
paint O
color O
on O
the O
wall, O
their O
scented O
candles O
in O
the O
bathroom, O
their O
name O
on O
the O
door. O
This O
is O
the O
position O
in O
which O
we O
find O
the O
former O
pop-up B-TYPE
Oxalis B-EST
and O
its O
chef, O
Nico O
Russell, O
a O
veteran O
of O
Daniel B-EST
, O
in O
New B-LOC
York, I-LOC
and O
Mirazur B-EST
, O
on O
the O
French B-LOC
Riviera. I-LOC
Beginning O
in O
2016, O
Mr. O
Russell O
slalomed O
through O
a O
series O
of O
restaurants O
that O
would O
hand O
him O
the O
keys O
on O
off O
nights O
so O
he O
could O
cook O
tasting O
menus O
of O
10 O
courses O
or O
so. O
First O
he O
inhabited O
Fitzcarraldo B-EST
, O
an O
Italian B-CUISINE
restaurant O
whose O
combination O
of O
industrial, O
nautical, O
cinematic O
and O
Mediterranean O
elements O
has O
made O
it O
a O
frequent O
wedding O
site. O
Later O
he O
moved O
on O
to O
Egg B-EST
, O
an O
austerely O
contemporary O
temple O
to O
breakfast O
which O
had O
begun O
its O
own O
life, O
more O
than O
a O
decade O
earlier, O
as O
a O
pop-up. B-TYPE
He O
sold O
tickets O
to O
his O
Oxalis B-EST
dinners, O
enough O
of O
them O
to O
get O
a O
few O
investors O
interested. O
With O
enough O
funding O
to O
take O
on O
a O
lease O
in O
Crown B-LOC
Heights, I-LOC
Oxalis B-EST
opened O
in O
November O
in O
a O
former O
wine B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
within O
sight O
of O
the O
Brooklyn B-LOC
Museum. I-LOC
Mr. O
Russell's O
vision O
for O
Oxalis B-EST
is O
the O
one O
behind O
the O
bistronomie O
movement O
in O
France B-LOC
and O
its O
disciples O
abroad: O
carefully O
considered O
food O
served O
without O
the O
hoopla O
that O
drives O
up O
tabs. O
He O
slings O
a O
lot O
of O
vegetables B-FOOD
in O
Oxalis's B-EST
four- O
to O
six-course O
set O
menus, O
and O
it's O
one O
sign O
of O
his O
skill O
that O
this O
doesn't O
come O
across O
as O
a O
cost-cutting O
measure O
even O
though O
it O
must O
be, O
at O
least O
in O
part O
-- O
dinner O
is O
an O
extremely O
reasonable O
$60. O
Both O
the O
price O
and O
the O
understated O
cooking O
style O
reminded O
me O
of O
Contra B-EST
, O
which O
opened O
with O
a O
five-course, O
$55 O
menu. O
The O
last O
time O
I O
went O
I O
ate O
a O
dish O
built O
around O
spaghetti-like B-FOOD
strands O
of O
rutabaga B-FOOD
under O
a O
warm O
snowdrift O
of O
whipped B-FOOD
Alpine I-FOOD
fontina. I-FOOD
These O
two O
mild-tasting O
ingredients O
were O
set O
in O
motion O
by O
the O
force O
of O
a O
third, O
a O
dark O
and O
focused O
coffee-and-chicory B-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
sauce. I-FOOD
This O
was O
a O
rutabaga B-FOOD
that O
made O
me O
smile. O
Granted, O
I O
probably O
like O
rutabaga B-FOOD
more O
than O
the O
average O
person, O
but O
I O
suspect O
that O
exposure O
to O
the O
rutabaga B-FOOD
at O
Oxalis B-EST
would O
make O
the O
average O
person O
realize O
that O
I'm O
right. O
Meals O
begin O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
bite-size O
snacks, O
one O
of O
which O
tends O
to O
be O
a O
crisp O
potato B-DISH
cake I-DISH
dusted O
with O
bay-leaf B-FOOD
powder I-FOOD
and O
topped O
with O
a O
chip O
of O
nori. B-FOOD
It O
looks O
harmless O
enough, O
but O
can O
produce O
powerful O
emotions, O
which O
are O
easier O
to O
understand O
once O
you O
know O
that O
the O
potatoes B-FOOD
are O
stewed O
in O
duck B-FOOD
fat I-FOOD
and O
then O
deep-fried. O
The O
other O
snack O
might O
be O
some O
lightly O
dehydrated B-DISH
beets I-DISH
brushed O
with O
marjoram-infused B-FOOD
cream, I-FOOD
or O
tiny O
grilled B-DISH
carrots I-DISH
that O
you O
dip O
in O
chamomile B-FOOD
sabayon. I-FOOD
(This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
dishes O
that O
suggests O
the O
long O
shadow O
of O
Noma B-EST
, O
which O
in O
its O
early O
days O
famously O
matched O
aged B-FOOD
carrots I-FOOD
with O
chamomile.) B-FOOD
The O
price O
seems O
meant O
to O
encourage O
frequent O
visits, O
but O
if O
you O
return O
often O
you O
may O
experience O
déjà O
vu. O
At O
meals O
in O
December, O
January O
and O
February, O
I O
was O
always O
served O
some O
variation O
on O
raw B-FOOD
sea I-FOOD
scallops I-FOOD
with O
daikon B-FOOD
and O
apple B-FOOD
and O
some O
version O
of O
duck B-FOOD
breast, I-FOOD
sweet B-FOOD
potato I-FOOD
and O
yogurt. B-FOOD
The O
portions O
in O
both O
cases O
were O
restrained O
but O
the O
flavors O
were O
outsize. O
The O
scallops B-FOOD
were O
cured O
in O
miso B-FOOD
and O
refrigerated O
for O
a O
few O
days O
and O
came O
out O
of O
it O
with O
something O
like O
the O
concentration O
of O
flavor O
that O
beef B-FOOD
gets O
from O
dry-aging, O
but O
none O
of O
the O
funk. O
The O
duck's B-FOOD
flavor O
was O
less O
surprising, O
but O
there O
was O
some O
energy O
in O
its O
collision O
with O
sweet B-FOOD
potato I-FOOD
purée I-FOOD
and O
fig-leaf B-FOOD
yogurt I-FOOD
tart O
enough O
to O
cause O
double-takes. O
Like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
menu, O
desserts O
are O
unshowy O
but O
can O
be O
highly O
impressive. O
One O
worked O
goat B-FOOD
milk I-FOOD
up O
into O
a O
thing O
of O
beauty: O
Some O
of O
it O
was O
made O
into O
a O
simple O
frozen B-FOOD
custard, I-FOOD
the O
rest O
cooked O
down O
into O
cajeta. B-FOOD
The O
cooking O
makes O
it O
clear O
why O
people O
chased O
Oxalis B-EST
around O
Brooklyn B-LOC
in O
its O
various O
borrowed O
spaces, O
but O
other O
aspects O
of O
the O
restaurant O
suggest O
that O
it O
hasn't O
quite O
figured O
out O
how O
to O
live O
in O
a O
space O
of O
its O
own. O
A O
meal O
there O
can O
be O
a O
somewhat O
solemn O
experience, O
which O
doesn't O
seem O
to O
be O
what O
Mr. O
Russell O
and O
his O
partners O
are O
aiming O
for. O
The O
layout O
seems O
to O
work O
against O
it. O
The O
kitchen O
is O
right O
up O
front, O
and O
the O
bar O
is O
all O
the O
way O
in O
the O
back, O
separated O
from O
the O
dining O
room O
by O
a O
glass O
door O
in O
a O
glass O
wall. O
I O
can't O
imagine O
what O
the O
wall O
is O
for, O
unless O
Oxalis B-EST
is O
planning O
to O
bring O
back O
the O
smoking O
section. O
Instead O
of O
serving O
as O
a O
street-side O
welcome O
and O
a O
source O
of O
energy O
for O
the O
dining O
room, O
the O
bar O
feels O
like O
a O
waiting O
room. O
And O
while O
it O
takes O
reservations, O
the O
tasting O
menu O
isn't O
served O
there. O
The O
bar O
menu O
is O
à O
la O
carte. O
The O
dining O
room O
could O
use O
a O
little O
lift. O
It's O
as O
plain O
as O
a O
Shaker O
church, O
with O
clamshell-colored O
wainscoting O
below O
white O
walls O
unbroken O
by O
pictures O
or O
anything O
else. O
(All O
the O
art O
is O
in O
the O
restroom.) O
The O
way O
the O
servers O
have O
been O
coached O
on O
their O
lines O
so O
far O
underlines O
the O
decorative O
stiffness. O
They O
say O
stuff O
like O
"Moving O
now O
into O
more O
sweet O
things O
…" O
rather O
than O
"Here's O
your O
dessert," O
and O
my O
neighbor O
one O
night O
was O
instructed O
to O
"sit O
back O
and O
relax," O
something O
that O
tends O
to O
go O
without O
saying O
in O
most O
restaurants. O
Things O
have O
loosened O
up O
since O
the O
liquor O
license O
came O
through. O
In O
the O
first O
few O
weeks, O
the O
servers O
were O
always O
trying O
to O
push O
a O
nonalcoholic O
beverage O
pairing O
for O
$20, O
and O
while O
the O
bar O
was O
mixing O
sodas B-FOOD
that O
were O
more O
interesting O
than O
many O
cocktails B-FOOD
around O
town, O
I'm O
not O
sure O
they O
were O
different O
enough O
from O
one O
another O
to O
justify O
drinking O
the O
whole O
slate. O
Now O
there O
are O
also O
wine B-FOOD
pairings, O
starting O
at O
$35. O
Sometimes O
I O
wondered O
whether O
it O
would O
get O
the O
air O
circulating O
if O
the O
bar O
popped O
up O
in O
the O
dining O
room, O
or O
vice O
versa. O
There's O
probably O
some O
simple O
fix, O
or O
a O
series O
of O
them, O
that O
would O
give O
Oxalis B-EST
some O
of O
its O
old O
sense O
of O
adventure. O
You O
can O
sense O
it O
lying O
there, O
waiting, O
when O
you O
taste O
that O
cajeta, B-FOOD
those O
scallops, B-FOOD
the O
fantastic O
little O
potato B-FOOD
cakes. I-FOOD

For O
an O
operation O
that O
essentially O
serves O
one O
dish, O
Maxi's B-EST
Noodle I-EST
has O
a O
dauntingly O
long O
menu. O
The O
dish O
is O
Hong B-CUISINE
Kong-style I-CUISINE
won-ton B-DISH
noodle I-DISH
soup, I-DISH
though, O
which O
requires O
Maxi O
Lau, O
the O
chef O
and O
proprietor, O
to O
keep O
a O
large O
number O
of O
items O
on O
hand O
to O
be O
added O
to O
or O
subtracted O
from O
the O
soup B-FOOD
at O
the O
customer's O
whim: O
the O
broth B-FOOD
of O
pork B-FOOD
bones I-FOOD
boiled O
with O
dried B-FOOD
shrimp; I-FOOD
the O
skinny O
yellow B-FOOD
noodles I-FOOD
with O
their O
firm, O
elastic O
snap; O
the O
stewed B-FOOD
beef I-FOOD
cooked O
with O
a O
sizable O
pinch O
of O
five-spice B-FOOD
powder; I-FOOD
the O
dense O
fish B-FOOD
balls I-FOOD
streaked O
with O
scallions; B-FOOD
the O
weightless, O
grease-free O
chips O
of O
fried B-FOOD
fish I-FOOD
skin; I-FOOD
and O
so O
on. O
But O
the O
one O
item O
that O
is O
absolutely O
essential O
is O
the O
won B-FOOD
ton. I-FOOD
Make O
that O
plural O
-- O
won B-FOOD
tons, I-FOOD
as O
many O
as O
Ms. O
Lau O
will O
put O
into O
your O
bowl O
($8). O
This O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
four O
if O
you O
also O
want O
noodles, B-FOOD
and O
six O
if O
you O
don't. O
Years O
ago O
Ms. O
Lau's O
mother O
dreamed O
of O
opening O
a O
won-ton B-TYPE
shop, I-TYPE
and O
had O
gone O
to O
Toronto B-LOC
to O
learn O
the O
art O
of O
won-ton B-FOOD
wrapping O
from O
a O
family O
friend. O
Those O
plans O
changed O
when O
she O
learned O
she O
had O
cancer. O
After O
she O
died, O
two O
years O
ago, O
Maxi O
Lau O
decided O
to O
rebuild O
her O
own O
life. O
Leaving O
her O
job O
in O
corporate O
management, O
she O
retraced O
her O
mother's O
steps, O
learning O
to O
make O
won B-FOOD
tons I-FOOD
with O
the O
same O
family O
friend. O
Three O
months O
ago, O
she O
started O
Maxi's B-EST
as O
a O
pop-up B-TYPE
every O
evening O
but O
Thursdays, O
taking O
over O
a O
Hong B-CUISINE
Kong-style I-CUISINE
breakfast B-TYPE
and I-TYPE
lunch I-TYPE
cafe I-TYPE
owned O
by O
an O
aunt O
in O
Flushing, B-LOC
Queens. I-LOC
Ms. O
Lau O
plans O
to O
set O
up O
a O
noodle B-TYPE
soup I-TYPE
shop I-TYPE
of O
her O
own O
in O
another O
part O
of O
Flushing B-LOC
later O
this O
year. O
Until O
then, O
she O
is O
making O
more O
won B-FOOD
tons I-FOOD
than O
she O
expected, O
because O
customers O
keep O
coming O
back O
to O
buy O
them O
by O
the O
dozen, O
frozen. O
Ms. O
Lau's O
won B-FOOD
tons I-FOOD
are O
filled O
with O
a O
mixture O
of O
shrimp B-FOOD
and O
pork, B-FOOD
with O
the O
emphasis O
very O
much O
on O
the O
shrimp. B-FOOD
Each O
bite O
-- O
it O
takes O
at O
least O
two O
to O
finish O
off O
a O
Maxi's B-EST
Noodle I-EST
won B-FOOD

-- O
confirms O
that O
the O
shrimp B-FOOD
are O
of O
very O
high O
quality O
and O
are O
cooked O
in O
a O
way O

can O

where O
it O
is O
known O
as O
bo B-FOOD
bay I-FOOD
mon, I-FOOD
as O
well O
as O
in O
San B-LOC
Jose, I-LOC
Calif., I-LOC
Houston B-LOC
and O
other O
areas O
with O
robust O
Vietnamese O
populations. O
In O
New B-LOC
York, I-LOC
where O
the O
Vietnamese B-CUISINE
restaurant O
scene O
is O
more O
anemic, O
bo B-FOOD
bay I-FOOD
mon I-FOOD
is O
still O
a O
rarity. O
The O
rough O
outlines O
of O
the O
setup O
at O
Madame B-EST
Vo, I-EST
though, O
will O
be O
familiar O
to O
any O
New O
Yorker O
who O
has O
gone O
out O
for O
Korean B-CUISINE
barbecue. B-EST
New B-EST
York I-EST
City I-EST
bureaucracy O
is O
unwelcoming O
to O
the O
tabletop O
charcoal O
grills O
seen O
in O
Hanoi, B-LOC
so O
an O
electric O
grill O
under O
a O
metal O
screen O
is O
embedded O
in O
each O
table. O
Once O
the O
grill O
is O
switched O
on O
and O
the O
metal O
rods O
down O
at O
kneecap O
level O
begin O
to O
warm O
up, O
an O
array O
of O
sauces, B-FOOD
condiments B-FOOD
and O
vegetables B-FOOD
will O
arrive. O
When O
the O
rods O
are O
red, O
a O
server O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
tongs O
will O
lay O
some O
meat B-FOOD
down O
on O
the O
screen, O
return O
periodically O
to O
fiddle O
with O
it O
and O
eventually O
decide O
when O
it O
is O
ready O
to O
be O
eaten. O
The O
similarities O
with, O
say, O
Han B-EST
Joo I-EST
Chik I-EST
Naeng I-EST
Myun I-EST
& I-EST
BBQ I-EST
in O
Queens B-LOC
end, O
of O
course, O
with O
the O
actual O
food. O
Yes, O
both O
offer O
lettuce B-FOOD
for O
wrapping, O
but O
at O
Madame B-EST
Vo I-EST
BBQ I-EST
it O
is O
part O
of O
a O
Vietnamese B-CUISINE
table B-EST
salad, I-EST
along O
with O
fresh O
herbs; B-FOOD
raw O
cucumbers, O
pineapple O
and O
apple; O
and O
pickled O
carrots O
and O
daikon. O
The O
restaurant O
also O
sets O
out O
a O
nifty O
caddy O
that O
holds O
circles O
of O
rice O
paper O
and O
warm O
water, O
in O
a O
miniature O
bathtub, O
for O
wetting O
the O
paper O
until O
it O
is O
soft O
enough O
to O
fashion O
into O
rolls. O
Rather O
than O
gochujang O
and O
sesame O
oil, O
there O
is O
a O
classic O
Vietnamese O
nuoc O
cham, O
an O
intoxicatingly O
good O
version O
of O
the O
pineapple-and-fermented O
anchovy O
sauce O
known O
as O
mam O
nem, O
and O
lastly O
a O
tamarind O
sauce, O
which O
suggests O
Madame O
Vo O
BBQ O
can O
follow O
or O
leap O
over O
Vietnamese O
tradition O
at O
will. O
This O
is O
about O
what O
you'd O
expect O
if O
you've O
eaten O
at O
another O
restaurant, O
a O
few O
blocks O
north, O
simply O
called O
Madame O
Vo O
. O
Jimmy O
Ly O
is O
the O
chef O
in O
both O
places; O
he O
and O
his O
wife, O
Yen O
Vo, O
are O
the O
proprietors. O
Each O
was O
raised O
in O
the O
United O
States O
by O
immigrants O
from O
Vietnam, O
and O
like O
many O
children O
of O
immigrants O
they O
seem O
to O
be O
fluent O
not O
just O
in O
two O
languages O
but O
in O
two O
cultures, O
enabling O
them O
to O
serve O
dishes O
their O
families O
might O
recognize O
in O
a O
setting O
that O
outsiders O
might O
embrace. O
The O
wings O
at O
Madame O
Vo, O
sticky O
with O
caramel O
and O
fried O
garlic, O
are O
drive-straight-from-the-airport O
good. O
The O
restaurant O
produces O
some O
of O
the O
only O
pho O
in O
Manhattan O
worth O
talking O
about. O
One O
of O
them, O
in O
a O
porcelain O
bowl O
the O
size O
of O
a O
baptismal O
font, O
is O
filled O
with O
a O
potent O
beef O
broth, O
a O
short O
rib O
on O
the O
bone O
and O
enough O
other O
cuts O
to O
make O
a O
butcher O
smile. O
At O
least O
one O
dish O
at O
the O
couple's O
new O
restaurant O
can O
stand O
alongside O
the O
wings O
and O
the O
pho O
at O
their O
first: O
the O
oxtail O
congee. O
Congee, O
or O
chao O
thit O
bo, O
is O
customarily O
the O
last O
course O
in O
bo O
bay O
mon. O
It O
frequently O
takes O
the O
form O
of O
a O
cloudy O
beef-and-rice O
soup. O
Mr. O
Ly O
cooks O
his O
congee O
with O
some O
chicken O
stock O
until O
it O
has O
the O
consistency O
of O
polenta, O
then O
spoons O
over O
it O
some O
sweet O
and O
savory O
braised O
oxtails O
in O
honey, O
fish O
sauce O
and O
brown O
butter. O
Everything O
about O
it O
is O
wonderful, O
even O
the O
scallion O
greens O
on O
top. O
The O
first O
of O
the O
seven O
beefs O
is O
typically O
boi O
tai O
chanh, O
a O
raw O
beef O
salad, O
and O
this O
is O
a O
high O
point, O
too. O
Lean O
eye O
of O
round O
cut O
into O
thin O
pink O
sheets O
is O
the O
canvas O
for O
an O
action-painting O
whirl O
of O
fried O
shallots, O
raw O
red O
onions, O
chopped O
peanuts O
and O
slivers O
of O
fresh O
mint. O
Pretty O
standard O
stuff O
so O
far, O
but O
then O
Mr. O
Ly O
bathes O
the O
salad O
in O
tangerine-lime O
vinaigrette, O
which O
has O
a O
positively O
buoyant O
effect, O
and O
splashes O
it O
with O
a O
bright-green, O
lemony O
pulp O
of O
fresh O
rau O
ram O
puréed O
in O
oil. O
In O
the O
middle O
of O
this O
$59 O
menu O
come O
the O
grilled O
meats, O
the O
courses O
for O
which O
the O
table O
salad O
and O
rice O
paper O
wrappers O
have O
been O
waiting. O
The O
finest O
of O
these O
might O
be O
the O
relatively O
straightforward O
five-spice O
tongue, O
although O
the O
betel-leaf-wrapped O
bundles O
of O
seasoned O
ground O
beef O
-- O
bo O
la O
lot O
-- O
are O
soothing O
and O
stimulating O
at O
once, O
and O
the O
New O
York O
strip O
with O
marrow O
butter O
is O
a O
clever O
way O
to O
acknowledge O
Manhattan's O
own O
beef-eating O
rituals, O
even O
if O
it O
would O
draw O
blank O
stares O
on O
the O
streets O
of O
Saigon. O
If O
you, O
like O
me, O
are O
naturally O
skeptical O
when O
servers O
persistently O
push O
a O
big-ticket O
item, O
you O
might O
be O
tempted O
to O
blaze O
your O
own O
path O
through O
Madame O
Vo O
BBQ's O
menu. O
But O
once O
you've O
tried O
the O
bo O
bay O
mon O
you O
have, O
by O
and O
large, O
seen O
the O
kitchen O
at O
its O
best. O
Yes, O
you O
could O
get O
the O
whole O
catfish, O
and O
if O
you O
are O
not O
into O
beef O
perhaps O
you O
should. O
Despite O
what O
the O
menu O
says, O
the O
catfish O
is O
not O
grilled, O
but O
fried O
and O
then O
baked. O
It O
was O
perfectly O
done O
the O
night O
I O
had O
it, O
and O
was O
filleted O
at O
the O
table O
by O
a O
server O
who O
knew O
his O
way O
around O
a O
fish O
skeleton. O
By O
that O
time, O
all O
that O
was O
left O
to O
do O
was O
to O
wrap O
a O
chunk O
of O
fish O
in O
lettuce O
and O
rice O
paper O
with O
a O
squeeze O
of O
grilled O
lemon O
and O
some O
of O
the O
sautéed O
shallots, O
lemongrass O
and O
bird O
chiles O
that O
the O
kitchen O
had O
ladled O
along O
the O
snaking O
curve O
of O
the O
spine. O
If O
you O
are O
thinking O
about O
a O
vegetable, O
the O
skewered O
and O
grilled O
okra O
pods O
in O
soy O
are O
crunchy O
and O
unslimy. O
The O
other O
appetizers, O
though, O
can O
be O
tricky. O
One O
night, O
the O
grilled O
scallop O
brushed O
with O
duck O
fat O
was O
transporting; O
on O
another, O
it O
tasted O
too O
much O
like O
the O
grill. O
Spring O
rolls O
filled O
with O
short O
rib O
and O
bone O
marrow O
seemed O
pointlessly O
indulgent, O
and O
so O
did O
their O
truffle O
hoisin O
dipping O
sauce O
in O
which O
I O
couldn't O
taste O
the O
truffles. O
A O
few O
dishes O
might O
have O
been O
improved O
if O
they'd O
arrived O
while O
hot, O
like O
the O
extra-large O
grilled O
oysters O
under O
caramelized O
sea O
urchin O
mayonnaise O
or O
the O
charred O
sea O
urchin, O
basted O
in O
its O
shell O
with O
butter, O
sake O
and O
fish O
sauce. O
Grilled O
prawns O
brushed O
with O
a O
lovely O
orange O
butter O
were O
slightly O
more O
mushy O
than O
two O
prawns O
sold O
for O
$38 O
should O
be. O
And O
while O
the O
44-ounce O
tomahawk O
steak O
was O
more O
than O
a O
fair O
deal O
at O
$90, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
helped O
by O
a O
more O
aggressive O
sear O
and O
more O
salt. O
On O
certain O
nights, O
the O
whole O
operation O
had O
a O
slack, O
inattentive O
feeling O
that's O
rare O
in O
new O
restaurants. O
The O
catfish O
sat O
on O
the O
table, O
getting O
cold, O
while O
we O
waited O
for O
the O
table O
salad O
to O
show O
up. O
The O
thick O
stems O
of O
stir-fried O
morning O
glory O
would O
have O
been O
better O
cut O
into O
shorter O
lengths. O
Madame O
Vo O
BBQ O
may O
eventually O
run O
as O
smoothly O
as O
its O
older O
sibling. O
While O
it O
works O
out O
the O
mechanics, O
the O
surest O
route O
to O
happiness O
is O
to O
eat O
the O
bo O
bay O
mon O
while O
sipping O
cold O
coconut O
water O
through O
a O
metal O
straw O
out O
of O
a O
whole O
green O
coconut O
that O
you O
hold O
in O
one O
hand, O
like O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee. O

to O
enter O
the O
Albanian B-TYPE
restaurant O
Cka B-EST

Qellu I-EST
, O
if O
not O
the O
most O
direct, O
starts O
on O
Arthur B-LOC

Arrive O
before O
the O
fish B-TYPE
shops I-TYPE
along O
this O
famous, O
not-quite-faded O
Italian O
strip O
in O
the O
Bronx B-LOC
take O
in O
the O
iced O
clams B-FOOD
and O
octopus B-FOOD
for O
the O
night. O
Across O
from O
Dominick's, B-EST
turn O
into O
the O
indoor O
market O
that O
Fiorello O

ordered O
up. O
Move O
on O
past O
the O
hand-rolled O

the O

various O

of O
Bronx B-LOC

Keep O
going O
beyond O
the O

the O

and O
the O
ready-to-go O

and O
walk O
out O
the O
door O
on O
to O
Hughes B-LOC

Just O
to O
the O
right O
is O
a O
spinning O

that O
looks O

been O
Rumpelstiltskin's O
and O
next O
to O
it, O
another O
door. O
Open O
it, O
walk O
inside. O
The O
short O
trip O
seems O
to O
have O
taken O
you O
back O
in O
time. O
The O
spinning O
wheel O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
just O
one O
piece O
in O
Cka B-EST

Qellu's I-EST
collection O
of O

instruments, O
yokes, O
brass O
coffee O
mills, O
manual O

dishes O
of O
hammered O
metal O

embroidered O
costumes O
that O
the O
owner, O
Ramiz O
Kukaj, O
brought O
over O
from O
the O
old O
country. O
Some, O
he O
says, O
go O
back O
to O
the O
18th O
century. O
The O
floors O
and O
walls O
seem O
to O
have O
been O
airlifted O
from O
an O
Albanian O
farmhouse, O
and O
the O
speakers O
play O
wistful O

not O
the O
modern, O

wake-up O

of O
the O
brass O
band O
Fanfara O
Tirana O
. O
The O
restaurant O
is O
soaked O
in O
nostalgia. O
The O
other O
reason O
for O
the O
walk O
from O
Arthur B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
is O
that O
it O
recapitulates O
a O
pattern O
that's O
repeated O
throughout O
this O
neighborhood, O
where O
the O
signs O
and O
menus O
facing O
the O
street O
are O
still O
written O
in O
Italian O
but O
many O
of O
the O
people O
in O
the O
back O
rooms, O
seasoning O
the O
sausages B-FOOD
and O
frying O
the O
veal B-FOOD
cutlets, I-FOOD
are O
Albanian. O
Here O
and O
there, O
those O
Albanians O
have O
brought O
a O
little O
of O
their O
cuisine O
into O
those O
Italian O
businesses. O
Cumin-laden B-FOOD
suxhuk I-FOOD
sausages I-FOOD
hang O
to O
dry O
in O
the O
salumerias. B-TYPE
In O
some O
pizzerias, B-TYPE
the O
burek B-FOOD
challenges O
the O
Jamaican B-CUISINE
beef B-FOOD
patty I-FOOD
for O
outsider O
meat-pie B-FOOD
supremacy. O
One O
such O
place, O
also O
owned O
by O
Mr. O
Kukaj, O
is O
in O
the O
Norwood B-LOC
neighborhood O
and O
is O
called O
Tradita. B-EST
( O
Ligaya O
Mishan O
reviewed O
it O
in O
2017.) O
But O
if O
you O
want O
a O
deep-end O
Albanian B-TYPE
experience, O
Cka B-EST
Ka I-EST
Qellu, I-EST
pronounced O
SHA O
ka O
chell-OO, O
is O
the O
place O
to O
go. O
The O
kitchen O
does O
not O
focus O
on O
the O
seafood B-FOOD
of O
Albania's B-LOC
Adriatic B-LOC
coast, I-LOC
or O
the O
more O
intensely O
Greek- O
and O
Turkish-leaning O
cuisine O
of O
its O
southern O
reaches. O
Instead, O
it O
heavily O
favors O
the O
north, O
which O
shares O
many O
dishes O
with O
the O
former O
components O
of O
Yugoslavia O
that O
are O
its O
neighbors. O
In O
particular O
there O
is O
a O
strong O
overlap O
with O
Kosovo, O
home O
to O
many O
ethnic O
Albanians O
including, O
at O
one O
time, O
Mr. O
Kukaj O
and O
his O
chef, O
Afrim O
Kaliqani. O
In O
their O
kitchen, O
yogurt O
and O
cream O
are O
everywhere, O
along O
with O
curds O
of O
soft O
fresh O
cheese O
and O
triangles O
of O
creamy, O
unsqueaky O
feta. O
A O
good O
portion O
of O
the O
menu O
could O
be O
described O
as O
things O
in O
a O
creamy O
white O
sauce. O
Another, O
entirely O
different O
portion O
could O
be O
described O
as O
creamy O
white O
sauce O
with O
things O
in O
it. O
Included O
in O
the O
second O
group O
are O
some O
of O
the O
dips O
that O
are O
almost O
obligatory O
at O
the O
start O
of O
your O
Cka O
Ka O
Qellu O
experience: O
tarator, O
tart O
yogurt O
with O
minced O
cucumbers, O
garlic O
and O
parsley, O
similar O
to O
tzatziki, O
but O
nearly O
as O
fluffy O
as O
whipped O
cream; O
cream O
stirred O
with O
bits O
of O
suxhuk O
to O
give O
it O
a O
pinkish O
tint O
and O
a O
suggestion O
of O
spice; O
and O
kajmak O
, O
which O
our O
server O
described O
as O
"like O
butter O
for O
bread" O
and O
I O
would O
say O
was O
like O
crème O
fraîche O
blended O
with O
cream O
cheese O
and O
butter. O
(In O
parts O
of O
Albania, O
it O
would O
be O
made O
by O
boiling O
unpasteurized O
milk O
from O
water O
buffalo.) O
I O
found O
myself O
dipping O
sausages, O
vegetables O
and O
just O
about O
everything O
else O
into O
the O
kajmak, O
but O
it O
is O
exceptionally O
good O
with O
a O
warm O
slice O
of O
the O
bread O
that O
Cka O
Ka O
Qellu O
bakes O
in O
the O
pizza O
oven O
that O
is O
the O
first O
thing O
you O
see O
when O
you O
walk O
in. O
When O
the O
menu O
defines O
kacamak O
as O
"cream O
with O
polenta," O
the O
cream O
in O
question O
is O
kajmak, O
stirred O
into O
a O
fine-grained, O
nearly O
white O
mass O
of O
cornmeal O
that O
takes O
on O
the O
lightly O
fluffed O
quality O
of O
really O
well-made O
mashed O
potatoes. O
Sometimes O
there O
is O
a O
creamy O
sauce O
where O
you O
don't O
expect O
one. O
Each O
slice O
of O
lecenik, O
a O
cornbread O
with O
spinach O
and O
cottage O
cheese O
that O
is O
so O
rich O
it O
is O
only O
a O
few O
rungs O
in O
the O
ladder O
from O
cheesecake, O
comes O
to O
the O
table O
under O
a O
spoonful O
of O
kajmak. O
Sometimes O
there O
is O
no O
creamy O
sauce O
where O
one O
would O
do O
some O
good. O
The O
restaurant's O
version O
of O
fli, O
the O
slow-baked, O
many-layered O
pancake, O
is O
served O
as O
a O
long, O
narrow O
wedge O
with O
no O
accompaniment, O
although O
it O
is O
somewhat O
less O
than O
fully O
tender O
and O
moist. O
Luckily O
it O
responds O
immediately O
to O
any O
spare O
yogurt O
you O
can O
forage O
from O
elsewhere O
on O
the O
table. O
The O
mantia, O
baked O
dumplings O
filled O
with O
ground O
veal O
and O
onions, O
will O
seem O
tough O
and O
dry, O
too, O
if O
you O
order O
them O
alone. O
The O
same O
mantia O
cooked O
with O
yogurt O
in O
a O
clay O
dish O
will O
seem O
perfect. O
Is O
there O
another O
restaurant O
in O
New O
York O
that O
makes O
as O
much O
use O
of O
veal, O
and O
as O
little O
of O
any O
other O
meat, O
as O
Cka O
Ka O
Qellu? O
It O
is O
the O
main O
ingredient O
in O
the O
restaurant's O
qofte, O
ground O
and O
mixed O
with O
onions O
and O
red O
pepper; O
and O
in O
its O
qebapa, O
mild O
skinless O
sausages O
cooked O
on O
the O
grill. O
(The O
sausages O
would O
be O
called O
cevapi O
in O
other O
corners O
of O
the O
Balkans, O
where O
they O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
made O
from O
lamb O
or O
beef.) O
Veal O
works O
its O
way O
into O
many O
of O
the O
clay-dish O
stews, O
including O
the O
veal O
tava, O
something O
like O
a O
Mediterranean O
ratatouille O
that O
got O
itself O
entangled O
with O
a O
meat-and-potato O
stew O
from O
another O
part O
of O
Europe. O
Rolled O
up O
with O
cheeses O
and O
smoked O
meat, O
breaded O
and O
fried, O
veal O
also O
serves O
as O
the O
filling O
for O
the O
alluring O
Skanderbeg. O
Named O
after O
a O
great O
patriotic O
hero O
of O
the O
15th O
century, O
Skanderbeg O
is O
generally O
called O
Albania's O
national O
dish, O
although O
its O
resemblance O
to O
a O
kayak O
made O
from O
chicken O
cordon O
bleu O
renders O
it O
something O
of O
an O
outlier O
in O
the O
cuisine. O
Ladled O
along O
its O
crunchy, O
golden O
length O
is O
-- O
please O
rise O
and O
face O
Hughes O
Avenue O
-- O
a O
creamy O
white O
sauce. O
Eating O
all O
of O
this O
without O
a O
salad O
is O
unimaginable O
and O
probably O
unadvisable. O
Each O
of O
Cka O
Ka O
Qellu's O
several O
salads O
seems O
to O
consist O
of O
cucumbers, O
tomatoes, O
red O
onions O
and O
cheese O
in O
slightly O
different O
arrangements. O
If O
the O
vegetables O
were O
any O
fresher, O
you'd O
be O
embarrassed O
to O
eat O
them O
in O
public. O
Surprise O
appearances O
by O
olives O
and O
their O
ilk O
provide O
extra O
variety. O
Like O
the O
breads, O
the O
desserts O
are O
baked O
on O
site: O
syrup-soaked O
baklava, O
a O
nut O
cake O
called O
haxhimak, O
a O
sugar O
cookie O
with O
nuts O
pressed O
into O
the O
top O
whose O
Albanian O
name O
is O
sheqerpare. O
I O
like O
them O
best O
with O
coffee O
boiled O
on O
the O
stove O
in O
a O
long-handled O
brass O
pitcher O
and O
served O
on O
a O
matching O
tray, O
both O
of O
them O
engraved O
with O
ancient, O
geometric O
designs O
that O
repeat O
and O
repeat. O

Before O
I O
tell O
you O
about O
the O
seasonally O
attuned O
courses O
the O
chef O
Hiroki O
Odo O
prepares O
at O
his O
new O
and O
virtuosic O
kaiseki B-TYPE
restaurant, I-TYPE
Odo, B-EST
I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
some O
that O
he O
does O
not O
prepare. O
At O
two O
points O
during O
the O
March O
menu, O
a O
person O
who O
is O
not O
Mr. O
Odo O
faces O
you O
across O
the O
thick O
plank O
of O
Lebanon O
cedar O
that O
forms O
the O
dining O
counter O
and O
makes O
something O
for O
you. O
The O
first O
time O
is O
about O
halfway O
through O
the O
meal, O
when O
Seong O
Cheol O
Byun O
shows O
up, O
shapes O
half O
a O
dozen O
pieces O
of O
sushi B-FOOD
and O
lays O
them O
down, O
one O
by O
one, O
in O
front O
of O
you. O
Some O
of O
his O
ingredients, O
kept O
on O
wooden O
trays O
that O
he O
carries O
from O
place O
to O
place, O
are O
typical, O
like O
the O
warm O
short-grain B-FOOD
rice I-FOOD
and O
the O
dark O
nikiri B-FOOD
that O
he O
will O
brush O
over O
certain O
fish. B-FOOD
Others O
are O
less O
typical. O
The O
ginger B-FOOD
he O
mounds O
on O
your O
plate O
is O
pickled O
together O
with O
sliced O
lotus B-FOOD
root I-FOOD
and O
daikon. B-FOOD
On O
March O
1, O
looking O
forward O
to O
spring, O
he O
added O
cherry O
leaves O
to O
the O
mix. O
Mr. O
Byun, O
a O
Korean-American, O
ferments O
daikon, O
cabbage O
and O
sesame O
seeds O
to O
make O
white O
kimchi, O
which O
he O
wraps O
inside O
nori O
for O
a O
tuna O
roll. O
You O
eat O
it O
like O
an O
ice O
cream O
cone, O
but O
faster. O
When O
Mr. O
Byun O
worked O
at O
Sushi O
Nakazawa, O
much O
of O
the O
seafood O
he O
used O
was O
flown O
in O
from O
Japan. O
At O
Odo, O
almost O
all O
the O
fish O
have O
been O
caught O
off O
the O
East O
Coast O
of O
North O
America: O
Long O
Island O
black O
sea O
bass, O
Florida O
mackerel O
and O
North O
Carolina O
bluefin O
tuna, O
which O
may O
be O
several O
weeks O
old O
before O
Mr. O
Byun O
is O
ready O
to O
serve O
it. O
This O
sushi O
reflects O
the O
American O
region O
where O
it O
is O
made, O
incorporates O
the O
Korean O
background O
of O
the O
chef O
making O
it O
and O
still O
has O
an O
unmistakably O
Japanese O
spirit. O
This O
one O
course, O
if O
tripled O
in O
length, O
could O
be O
spun O
off O
into O
a O
separate O
establishment O
that O
would O
probably O
be O
among O
the O
top O
two O
dozen O
sushi O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city. O
The O
second O
time O
an O
Odo O
course O
is O
prepared O
while O
you O
watch, O
it O
is O
made O
in O
a O
cocktail O
shaker O
and O
served O
in O
a O
cocktail O
glass. O
It O
is, O
as O
you O
may O
have O
guessed, O
a O
cocktail, O
though O
it O
is O
also O
the O
first O
of O
two O
desserts, O
sweetish O
and O
not O
especially O
boozy. O
Frank O
Cisneros, O
the O
sommelier, O
subordinates O
the O
alcohol O
to O
fresh O
fruit, O
in O
the O
style O
of O
the O
revered O
Tokyo O
bar O
Gen O
Yamamoto O
. O
Barrel-aged O
shochu O
is O
muddled O
with O
one O
or O
two O
sprightly O
segments O
of O
mikan O
orange, O
subjected O
to O
a O
calisthenic O
shake O
and O
strained O
into O
a O
delicately O
etched O
glass O
before O
a O
shimmer O
of O
sparkling O
wine O
is O
laid O
down O
on O
top. O
Orange O
juice O
in O
cocktails O
usually O
tastes O
diluted O
and O
weak; O
in O
this O
drink, O
it O
was O
radiant. O
I O
would O
say O
that O
the O
drinkable O
dessert O
course O
could O
be O
expanded O
into O
a O
separate O
cocktail O
bar, O
except O
that O
Odo O
already O
has O
one O
of O
those. O
Odo, O
which O
opened O
in O
December O
a O
few O
minutes' O
walk O
from O
the O
Flatiron O
Building, O
is O
entered O
through O
a O
door O
hidden O
in O
the O
back O
of O
a O
compact O
den O
-- O
cafe O
by O
day O
and O
bar O
by O
night O
-- O
called O
Hall. O
This O
arrangement O
seems O
to O
remind O
people O
of O
a O
speakeasy, O
although O
it O
would O
take O
an O
especially O
clueless O
bootlegger O
to O
open O
a O
speakeasy O
inside O
a O
bar. O
So O
far, O
Hall O
has O
not O
been O
fully O
discovered, O
but O
it O
still O
gets O
busy O
enough O
at O
dinner O
time O
that O
you O
can O
be O
stranded O
by O
the O
front O
door O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
before O
anyone O
on O
staff O
notices. O
Some O
diners O
on O
their O
way O
to O
Odo O
will O
find O
this O
an O
awkward O
start O
to O
a O
meal O
that O
costs O
$200 O
before O
tax, O
tip O
and O
drinks. O
But O
they O
may O
also O
discern O
that O
Hall, O
lined O
with O
carved O
oak O
panels O
salvaged O
from O
what O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
a O
library O
or O
church O
vestry O
from O
around O
1900, O
is O
one O
of O
the O
neighborhood's O
most O
entrancing O
rooms; O
that O
the O
corridor, O
which O
seems O
too O
narrow O
and O
definitely O
climbs O
on O
its O
way O
toward O
a O
too-short O
brass O
door O
with O
no O
handle, O
is O
perspective-altering O
in O
a O
way O
a O
Surrealist O
would O
enjoy; O
and O
that O
Odo, O
a O
shadowy O
and O
windowless O
space O
on O
the O
far O
side O
of O
that O
door O
is O
an O
unusually O
tranquil O
shelter O
from O
crowds, O
noise O
and O
anything O
else O
you O
might O
want O
to O
get O
away O
from O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours. O
The O
14 O
counter O
seats O
face O
the O
kitchen O
and, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
it, O
a O
charcoal-gray O
island. O
This O
is O
where O
Mr. O
Odo O
and O
his O
cooks O
assemble O
the O
other O
courses O
I O
promised O
to O
tell O
you O
about. O
Duck O
breast O
has O
been O
grilled O
over O
charcoal O
and O
positioned O
between O
two O
sauces. O
One O
is O
a O
black O
spill O
of O
concentrated O
soy O
spiced O
with O
sansho O
pepper; O
the O
other O
is O
an O
ivory O
pool O
of O
puréed O
apples O
and O
cream. O
These O
sauces O
contrast O
in O
every O
way O
you O
can O
think O
of, O
including O
East O
versus O
West, O
and O
they O
come O
together O
like O
opposing O
poles O
of O
a O
magnet. O
A O
springy O
chunk O
of O
truffle-flavored O
mochi O
is O
crisped O
on O
the O
grill O
and O
engulfed O
in O
a O
white-miso O
soup O
that O
has O
grated O
white O
truffles O
floating O
on O
the O
surface. O
You O
smell O
truffles O
in O
the O
air O
first, O
get O
them O
on O
the O
tip O
of O
your O
tongue O
next O
and O
finally O
taste O
them O
everywhere O
when O
they're O
released O
from O
the O
mochi. O
A O
croquette O
tastes O
something O
like O
an O
Italian O
rice O
ball O
made O
from O
New O
England O
clam O
chowder O
that O
has O
young O
bamboo O
shoots O
in O
it. O
This O
golden, O
breaded O
arancino O
is O
finished O
with O
dots O
of O
grated O
goat O
cheese. O
Shaved O
lamb O
shoulder, O
baby O
harukei O
turnip O
and O
two O
asparagus O
stalks O
as O
thin O
as O
licorice O
whip O
are O
served, O
still O
cooking, O
in O
a O
hot O
broth, O
a O
kaiseki O
version O
of O
shabu O
shabu. O
Odo O
-- O
incidentally, O
the O
name O
is O
pronounced O
as O
a O
set O
of O
initials, O
O.D.O. O
-- O
pursues O
local O
ingredients O
not O
just O
for O
its O
sushi O
course O
but O
throughout O
its O
menu. O
The O
simmered O
lamb O
used O
to O
gambol O
in O
the O
Hudson O
Valley, O
the O
croquetted O
topneck O
clams O
were O
raked O
in O
off O
Long O
Island O
and O
so O
on. O
Kaiseki's O
near-liturgical O
focus O
on O
timeliness O
almost O
seems O
to O
demand O
local O
ingredients, O
and O
they O
have O
been O
central O
to O
Niki O
Nakayama's O
strategy O
at O
n/naka O
in O
Los O
Angeles, O
but O
less O
so O
for O
New O
York's O
few O
kaiseki O
chefs. O
Chikara O
Sono O
at O
Kyo O
Ya O
, O
for O
instance, O
takes O
pains O
to O
import O
traditional O
ingredients O
from O
Japan O
the O
minute O
they're O
available. O
Mr. O
Odo O
came O
to O
New O
York O
as O
the O
chef O
of O
Kajitsu O
, O
the O
extraordinary O
restaurant O
on O
East O
39th O
Street O
that O
follows O
the O
vegetarian O
cooking O
tradition O
known O
as O
shojin O
ryori, O
born O
centuries O
ago O
in O
Zen O
Buddhist O
temples. O
One O
contribution O
he O
made O
in O
his O
five O
years O
there O
was O
to O
freshen O
up O
the O
menus O
with O
more O
food O
grown O
nearby. O
In O
the O
first O
and O
last O
tastes O
of O
his O
February O
and O
March O
menus, O
he O
anchors O
Odo O
firmly O
in O
the O
New O
York O
region. O
When O
you O
sit O
down, O
you O
are O
immediately O
poured O
a O
cup O
of O
cold O
sake. O
It O
is O
brewed O
in O
Brooklyn, O
and O
it O
is O
very O
good, O
swirling O
with O
fresh-fruit O
aromatics. O
Then O
at O
the O
end, O
after O
the O
fresh O
fruit, O
Mr. O
Odo O
serves O
ice O
cream O
made O
with O
kasu, O
the O
creamy O
solids O
left O
over O
at O
the O
end O
of O
sake O
distillation. O
The O
ice O
cream O
looks O
like O
vanilla O
and O
tastes, O
not O
surprisingly, O
like O
fermented O
rice. O
This O
particular O
kasu O
is O
supplied O
by O
the O
same O
brewery O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
makes O
the O
sake. O
Expanding O
his O
range O
to O
meat O
and O
fish O
at O
Odo, O
he O
has O
kept O
the O
resourcefulness O
that O
limitations O
encourage. O
Somewhere O
along O
the O
way O
Mr. O
Odo O
also O
picked O
up O
technical O
skills O
in O
traditions O
far O
outside O
kaiseki. O
Each O
night, O
in O
the O
gohan O
course, O
Odo O
offers O
a O
choice O
of O
three O
starchy O
dishes. O
This O
is O
where O
I O
encountered O
a O
very O
fine O
seafood O
curry O
over O
rice; O
an O
elegant O
bowl O
of O
short O
ramen O
noodles O
in O
king O
crab O
broth; O
and O
fresh O
soba O
served O
with O
little O
pieces O
of O
pickled O
vegetables O
and O
wasabi O
blossoms, O
looking O
a O
bit O
like O
broccoli O
florets O
but O
tasting O
like O
mustard. O
As O
with O
the O
cocktail O
and O
the O
sushi, O
each O
of O
these O
dishes O
could, O
if O
Mr. O
Odo O
wanted, O
be O
leveraged O
into O
separate O
specialized O
restaurants, O
or O
food-hall O
stands. O
You O
could O
tell O
yourself O
that O
$200 O
is O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
money O
for O
a O
single O
meal O
or O
you O
could O
say O
that O
for O
the O
chance O
to O
visit O
all O
these O
different O
establishments O
without O
leaving O
your O
seat, O
it's O
a O
pretty O
good O
deal. O
Either O
way, O
you'd O
be O
right. O

When O
I O
left O
my O
home O
state O
of O
Rhode B-LOC
Island I-LOC
at O
18, O
it O
didn't O
take O
long O
to O
discover O
that O
there O
was O
almost O
nothing O
about O
its O
local O
food O
customs O
that O
didn't O
make O
outsiders O
laugh. O
That O
small O
children O
routinely O
bought O
coffee-flavored B-FOOD
milk I-FOOD
in O
school O
cafeterias; O
that O
"beer" B-FOOD
was O
not O
pronounced O
with O
an O
"r" O
at O
the O
end, O
but O
pizza B-FOOD
was; O
that O
a O
hot B-FOOD
dog I-FOOD
shortened O
to O
about O
four O
inches O
and O
topped O
with O
meat B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
is O
called O
a O
hot B-FOOD
wiener I-FOOD
, O
and O
that O
a O
counterman O
preparing O
six O
of O
them O
at O
a O
time O
may O
deploy O
a O
maneuver O
known O
as O
"wieners O
up O
the O
arm" O
-- O
all O
of O
this O
apparently O
strikes O
people O
who O
grew O
up O
more O
than O
20 O
miles O
from O
Providence B-LOC
as O
very O
funny. O
When O
New O
Yorkers O
hear O
that O
Violet B-EST
, O
a O
new O
restaurant O
in O
the O
East B-LOC
Village, I-LOC
serves O
a O
style O
of O
pizza B-FOOD
that O
comes O
from O
Rhode B-LOC
Island, I-LOC
they O
start O
to O
smile, O
as O
if O
getting O
ready O
for O
the O
punch O
line. O
In O
fact, O
though, O
Violet's B-EST
pies B-FOOD
are O
a O
homage O
not O
to O
the O
whole O
state O
but O
to O
a O
specific O
restaurant, O
Al B-EST
Forno, I-EST
in O
Providence. B-LOC
If O
you O
know O
one O
thing O
about O
Al B-EST
Forno, I-EST
you O
know O
that O
its O
pizza B-FOOD
is O
not O
a O
joke. O
One O
of O
the O
restaurant's O
two O
founders, O
George O
Germon, O
originated O
the O
recipe O
in O
the O
early O
1980s, O
more O
or O
less O
out O
of O
desperation. O
After O
failing O
to O
get O
an O
oven O
hot O
enough O
to O
produce O
a O
crust B-FOOD
as O
thin O
and O
crunchy O
as O
the O
ones O
he O
remembered O
eating O
in O
Italy, B-LOC
he O
tossed O
dough B-FOOD
on O
a O
wood-burning O
grill O
and O
watched O
in O
awe O
as O
it O
stiffened O
to O
a O
crisp O
almost O
instantly. O
The O
pizza O
he O
and O
his O
wife, O
Johanne O
Killeen, O
would O
develop O
and O
elaborate O
from O
there O
was O
in O
a O
category O
of O
its O
own. O
The O
skills O
required O
to O
bake O
dough O
in O
a O
pizza O
oven, O
whether O
it O
runs O
on O
gas, O
coal O
or O
wood, O
don't O
apply O
to O
grilled O
pizza O
at O
all. O
This O
makes O
it O
an O
unending O
source O
of O
fascination O
to O
pizza O
technologists O
including O
Violet's O
chef, O
Matt O
Hyland. O
With O
his O
wife O
and O
business O
partner, O
Emily O
Hyland, O
Mr. O
Hyland O
paid O
tribute O
to O
wood-fired O
New O
Haven O
and O
New O
York O
pizza O
at O
his O
first O
place, O
Emily O
, O
then O
took O
on O
Detroit O
pan O
pizza O
at O
Emmy O
Squared O
. O
They O
have O
expanded O
both O
restaurants O
to O
new O
locations, O
including O
Citi O
Field, O
where O
Emmy O
Squared O
is O
now O
the O
"official O
pizza." O
But O
Mr. O
Hyland O
has O
been O
a O
student O
of O
the O
Al O
Forno O
school O
of O
pizza O
for O
years, O
since O
going O
to O
college O
in O
Rhode O
Island. O
Violet, O
which O
he O
opened O
at O
the O
start O
of O
the O
year, O
is O
dedicated O
to O
the O
style. O
He O
has O
worked O
allusions O
to O
other O
features O
of O
the O
state's O
cuisine O
into O
the O
menu, O
which O
makes O
forays O
into O
pasta O
and O
small O
seafood O
dishes, O
but O
the O
pizza O
grill O
is O
at O
the O
center O
of O
the O
action. O
Anyone O
who O
has O
eaten O
at O
Al O
Forno O
will O
recognize O
the O
lineage O
of O
Violet's O
pies. O
Both O
are O
as O
thin O
as O
a O
saltine O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
edge, O
with O
parallel O
lines O
of O
grill O
marks O
on O
their O
undersides. O
Al O
Forno O
puts O
fontina O
on O
its O
margheritas, O
as O
Violet O
did O
with O
all O
its O
pizzas O
until O
recently, O
when O
it O
began O
experimenting O
with O
havarti. O
In O
any O
case, O
the O
cheeses O
are O
on O
the O
dry O
side O
and O
grated O
for O
fast, O
thin O
distribution. O
Sauces O
are O
splashed O
down O
by O
the O
spoonful, O
quickly, O
before O
the O
crust O
burns. O
That's O
the O
template O
for O
a O
pie O
called O
the O
Atwells: O
a O
base O
coat O
of O
grated O
havarti O
and O
pecorino O
under O
big O
blots O
of O
a O
garlic-laden O
pesto O
made O
even O
greener O
than O
usual O
by O
the O
inclusion O
of O
broccoli O
and O
pistachios. O
While O
Al O
Forno O
tosses O
raw, O
slivered O
scallions O
on O
almost O
every O
pie, O
Violet O
may O
chop O
its O
scallions O
or O
grill O
them. O
One O
appealingly O
eccentric O
pie O
that O
combines O
a O
New O
Haven O
clam O
pizza O
with O
a O
Peking O
duck O
pancake O
is O
finished O
with O
fried O
julienned O
leeks. O
Olive O
oil O
does O
give O
Al O
Forno's O
crust O
extra O
crackle O
and O
flavor, O
but O
Violet's O
less O
lavishly O
oiled O
dough, O
made O
with O
a O
sourdough O
starter, O
has O
more O
flavor O
of O
its O
own. O
It's O
a O
little O
salty, O
crunchy O
but O
not O
brittle, O
more O
substantial O
than O
you O
expect, O
and O
highly O
chewable. O
Violet O
gives O
you O
a O
heavy O
pair O
of O
shears O
to O
snip O
the O
pie O
into O
wedges, O
or O
any O
shape O
you O
like. O
Wielding O
them O
supplies O
the O
palpable O
thrill O
of O
using O
exactly O
the O
right O
tool O
for O
the O
job, O
and O
it's O
even O
better O
than O
that O
because O
the O
job O
is O
eating O
pizza. O
A O
trip O
to O
Providence O
last O
weekend, O
though, O
turned O
up O
more O
than O
structural O
similarities O
between O
Violet O
and O
Al O
Forno. O
Three O
of O
the O
four O
pizzas O
on O
Al O
Forno's O
menu O
reminded O
me O
of O
pies O
I'd O
eaten O
at O
Violet. O
One O
resembled O
the O
Atwells, O
but O
its O
pesto O
was O
made O
with O
asparagus O
rather O
than O
broccoli. O
For O
Violet's O
Beech O
Vibes, O
a O
thin O
layer O
of O
duxelles O
is O
spread O
from O
rim O
to O
rim, O
then O
topped O
with O
tahini, O
caramelized O
onions O
and O
pickled O
beech O
mushrooms. O
It O
reminds O
me O
of O
a O
pissaladière O
in O
which O
the O
anchovies O
have O
been O
replaced O
by O
mushrooms. O
Al O
Forno O
makes O
a O
duxelles O
pizza, O
too, O
but O
tops O
it O
with O
unpickled O
white O
mushrooms, O
and O
doesn't O
use O
tahini. O
And, O
of O
course, O
both O
places O
do O
a O
variation O
on O
a O
Neapolitan O
margherita, O
called O
the O
margarita O
in O
Providence O
and O
the O
Classic O
in O
the O
East O
Village. O
The O
difference O
between O
their O
dough O
recipes O
doesn't O
quite O
put O
to O
rest O
the O
suspicion O
that O
Violet O
should O
be O
more O
conscientious O
about O
avoiding O
overlap O
even O
though O
Al O
Forno O
is O
180 O
miles O
away. O
Most O
diners, O
of O
course, O
will O
just O
be O
happy O
to O
have O
a O
new O
style O
of O
pizza O
in O
town. O
Any O
of O
Violet's O
pies, O
eaten O
before O
or O
after O
the O
iceberg-wedge O
salad O
with O
blue O
cheese O
and O
a O
jolt O
of O
ranch O
dressing, O
or O
the O
frisée O
salad O
tossed O
with O
fried O
artichokes, O
would O
make O
an O
ideal O
fast O
dinner. O
Beyond O
that, O
the O
going O
can O
get O
tricky. O
All O
the O
pastas O
I O
tried O
seemed O
like O
rough O
drafts, O
from O
the O
radiatore O
baked O
in O
a O
very O
salty O
vodka O
sauce O
to O
the O
spaghetti O
con O
vongole O
con O
dashi, O
a O
Japanese-Italian O
blind O
date O
that O
doesn't O
have O
the O
right O
chemistry. O
The O
two O
desserts O
I O
had O
were O
even O
stranger. O
Describing O
one O
of O
them, O
a O
cheesecake O
with O
banana O
pudding O
on O
it, O
the O
server O
said, O
"I'm O
just O
going O
to O
tell O
you O
what O
it O
is O
and O
if O
you O
guys O
want O
it, O
you O
can O
order O
it." O
If O
the O
warning O
had O
been O
any O
stronger O
it O
would O
have O
come O
with O
liability O
waivers. O
If O
you O
did O
want O
to O
build O
a O
longer O
meal, O
some O
of O
the O
seafood O
appetizers O
can O
help. O
Not O
the O
"stuffies," O
baked O
stuffed O
littlenecks O
or O
cherrystones O
that O
could O
use O
more O
clam. O
The O
smoked O
mackerel, O
though, O
is O
excellent O
and O
comes O
with O
some O
unusually O
good O
fresh-fried O
potato O
chips. O
There O
are O
also O
shrimp O
that O
have O
been O
grilled O
with O
their O
heads O
and O
shells O
on, O
placed O
over O
johnnycakes O
and O
splashed O
with O
spiced O
piri-piri O
sauce. O
Johnnycakes, O
which O
are O
made O
of O
fried O
cornmeal O
mush O
and O
taste O
like O
it, O
are O
probably O
more O
strongly O
identified O
with O
Rhode O
Island O
than O
any O
other O
food. O
I O
have O
never O
been O
sure O
why, O
because O
johnnycakes O
can O
be O
found, O
if O
you O
really O
want O
to O
look O
for O
them, O
all O
along O
the O
Atlantic O
Coast. O
The O
only O
time O
I've O
seen O
Rhode O
Islanders O
eating O
them O
was O
on O
a O
Boy O
Scout O
camping O
trip, O
and O
boy O
scouts O
will O
eat O
anything O
if O
you O
leave O
them O
in O
the O
woods O
for O
a O
few O
days. O
In O
any O
case, O
the O
johnnycakes O
that O
Violet O
places O
under O
the O
shrimp O
and O
the O
piri-piri O
sauce O
are O
kind O
of O
wonderful. O
The O
cornmeal O
has O
a O
lush, O
right-off-the-cob O
flavor. O
I'd O
have O
them O
for O
breakfast, O
lunch O
or O
dinner. O
Is O
it O
possible O
that O
the O
joke O
has O
been O
on O
me O
all O
along? O

Nothing O
about O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
Cornish B-DISH
game I-DISH
hen I-DISH
at O
Blue B-EST
Smoke I-EST
screams, O
"I O
am O
the O
best O
thing O
you O
will O
eat O
today!" O
It O
looks O
a O
bit O
like O
a O
deflated O
football O
that O
somebody O
punctured O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
sticks O
and O
dragged O
through O
the O
mud. O
In O
fact, O
in O
Blue B-EST
Smoke's I-EST
attempt O
to O
bring O
together O
the O
barbecued B-DISH
game I-DISH
hen I-DISH
of O
Cozy B-EST
Corner I-EST
, O
in O
Memphis, B-LOC
with O
the O
fried B-DISH
hot I-DISH
chicken I-DISH
of O
places O
like O
Prince's, B-EST
in O
Nashville, B-LOC
the O
bird O
has O
been O
through O
a O
good O
deal O
more O
than O
that. O
The O
process O
goes O
like O
this, O
approximately O
: O
spatchcocked, O
brined, O
rubbed O
with O
spices, O
smoked, O
chilled, O
dunked O
in O
a O
frothy O
batter, O
tossed O
in O
seasoned O
flour, O
deep O
fried, O
dipped O
in O
spicy B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
and O
sprinkled O
with O
four O
kinds O
of O
ground B-FOOD
pepper. I-FOOD
"Just O
a O
little O
pop-pop O
dust O
right O
on O
top" O
is O
how O
Jean-Paul O
Bourgeois, O
Blue B-EST
Smoke's I-EST
chef, O
describes O
the O
last O
step. O
"That O
introduction O
of O
fresh B-FOOD
chile I-FOOD
onto O
that O
fried B-FOOD
chicken, I-FOOD
it O
just O
brings O
the O
zing." O
Then O
came O
one O
final O
touch, O
he O
said: O
"a O
little O
swirlybird O
of O
Tabasco B-FOOD
hot I-FOOD
honey." I-FOOD
Handily, O
this O
can O
all O
be O
shortened O
to O
smoked, B-DISH
fried I-DISH
hen I-DISH
when O
you O
order O
($24 O
at O
the O
Battery B-LOC
Park I-LOC
City I-LOC

But O
you'll O
know O
there's O
more O
to O
it O
when O
your O
jaw O
smashes O
through O
the O
dark O
crust O
with O
a O

when O
the O

contributed O
by O
habanero, B-FOOD
black B-FOOD
pepper, I-FOOD
Sichuan B-FOOD
peppercorn, I-FOOD
Aleppo B-FOOD
pepper, I-FOOD
cayenne B-FOOD

Tabasco B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
all O
start O
to O
pile O
up O
and O
reverberate O
like O
My O
Bloody O
Valentine O
guitar O
chords O
; O
when O
the O

I'm O
starting O
to O
think O
the O
American O
cult O
of O
chef O
worship O
may O
really O
be O
on O
the O
way O
out. O
At O
the O
very O
least, O
it O
has O
paused O
to O
catch O
its O
breath. O
Since O
the O
seven-story O
food O
court O
in O
Hudson B-LOC
Yards I-LOC
was O
unveiled O
last O
month, O
the O
public O
reaction O
has O
been O
somewhere O
between O
shrug O
and O
ugh. O
Attitudes O
may O
improve O
as O
visitors O
eat O
their O
way O
to O
the O
top O
floor. O
So O
far, O
though, O
the O
response O
hasn't O
come O
close O
to O
matching O
the O
greeting O
bestowed O
on O
the O
restaurants O
at O
Time B-LOC
Warner I-LOC
Center I-LOC
in O
2004, O
even O
though O
the O
project O
represents O
the O
same O
basic O
idea O
executed O
by O
the O
same O
developer O
with O
at O
least O
one O
of O
the O
same O
chefs, O
Thomas O
Keller O
. O
Even O
more O
striking O
has O
been O
the O
low-key O
reception O
to O
Rocco O
DiSpirito's O
return. O
Late O
last O
year O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
took O
over O
the O
kitchen O
at O
Standard B-EST
Grill I-EST
in O
the O
meatpacking B-LOC
district. I-LOC
At O
one O
point, O
when O
he O
was O
the O
chef O
at O
both O
Union B-EST
Pacific I-EST
and O
Rocco's B-EST
on I-EST
22nd I-EST
while O
starring O
in O
a O
television O
show, O
he O
was O
arguably O
the O
most O
famous O
chef O
in O
the O
country. O
Then O
both O
places O
closed, O
and O
the O
show O
was O
canceled. O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
has O
not O
been O
in O
charge O
of O
a O
restaurant O
since O
George O
W. O
Bush O
was O
in O
the O
White O
House. O
For O
that O
matter, O
it O
has O
been O
some O
years O
since O
Standard B-EST
Grill I-EST
itself O
has O
done O
anything O
noteworthy. O
In O
2009, O
when O
it O
was O
new O
and O
Dan O
Silverman O
was O
the O
chef, O
I O
reviewed O
it, O
gave O
it O
one O
star O
and O
then O
lost O
track O
of O
it. O
In O
other O
words, O
the O
selection O
of O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
did O
not O
just O
come O
out O
of O
left O
field. O
It O
came O
from O
the O
weeds O
across O
the O
street O
from O
the O
parking O
lot O
behind O
left O
field. O
For O
surprise O
value O
alone, O
it O
should O
have O
been O
one O
of O
the O
year's O
most O
buzzed-about O
news O
items. O
But O
the O
trumpets O
have O
been O
muted, O
and O
the O
back O
handsprings O
seem O
to O
lack O
a O
certain O
bounce. O
This, O
at O
least, O
is O
the O
view O
from O
outside O
the O
restaurant. O
Once O
you're O
sitting O
at O
one O
of O
the O
tables O
-- O
newly O
topped O
with O
leather O
pads O
in O
a O
major O
retrofitting O
that O
has O
made O
the O
dining O
room O
look O
like O
an O
expensive O
cabaret, O
blue O
velvet O
and O
all O
-- O
you O
will O
hear O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
talk O
about O
Mr. O
DiSpirito, O
or O
as O
they O
call O
him O
here, O
Chef O
Rocco. O
Chef O
Rocco, O
you O
learn, O
conceived O
each O
dish O
on O
the O
menu O
so O
that O
it O
can O
be O
eaten O
by O
one O
person O
or O
shared O
with O
others. O
No, O
I O
didn't O
believe O
it O
at O
first, O
either, O
but O
apparently O
it's O
true: O
Rocco O
DiSpirito O
invented O
food. O
There O
is O
also O
something O
that O
servers O
call O
Chef B-DISH
Rocco's I-DISH
Game I-DISH
Changing I-DISH
Toast, I-DISH
although O
sometimes O
they O
shorten O
it O
to O
Rocco's B-DISH
Game I-DISH
Changing I-DISH
or O
simply O
Game B-DISH
Changing, I-DISH
as O
in O
"Here's O
a O
little O
more O
Game B-DISH
Changing I-DISH
for O
you." O
The O
item O
in O
question O
is O
a O
toasted, O
cracker-thin O
slice O
of O
bread B-FOOD
made O
of O
nuts, B-FOOD
oats, B-FOOD
seeds B-FOOD
and O
psyllium-seed B-FOOD
husks I-FOOD
held O
together O
without O
benefit O
of O
wheat O
flour. O
Like O
nearly O
everything O
on O
the O
menu, O
it O
is O
free O
of O
gluten. O
Being O
mostly O
made O
of O
browned B-FOOD
nuts, I-FOOD
it O
is O
also O
delicious. O
Whether O
it O
is O
truly O
Rocco's O
is O
up O
for O
debate. O
It O
seems O
to O
strongly O
resemble O
the O
Life-Changing B-DISH
Loaf I-DISH
of I-DISH
Bread I-DISH
recipe O
that O
Sarah O
Britton O
published O
on O
her O
blog, O
"My O
New O
Roots," O
in O
2013, O
and O
that O
appeared O
on O
another O
blog O
two O
years O
later, O
with O
minor O
changes, O
as O
Game B-DISH
Changing I-DISH
Nut I-DISH
& I-DISH
Seed I-DISH
Bread I-DISH
. O
It's O
one O
of O
the O
items O
that O
reflect O
Mr. O
DiSpirito's O
recent O
obsession O
with O
nutrient-dense O
dietary O
supplements O
, O
although O
the O
way O
it O
keeps O
coming O
up O
in O
the O
servers' O
patter O
makes O
you O
wonder O
if O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
spent O
too O
much O
time O
as O
a O
QVC O
pitchman. O
Anyway, O
somebody-or-other's O
toast O
sits O
under O
the O
smoked B-FOOD
gravlax, I-FOOD
red O
with O
beet O
juice O
and O
very O
silky O
on O
its O
bed O
of O
coconut B-FOOD
crème I-FOOD
fraîche, I-FOOD
that O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
sends O
out O
as O
an O
amuse. O
A O
plate O
of O
the O
toast B-FOOD
will O
also O
appear O
if O
you O
order O
the O
platter O
of O
acorn-fed, B-DISH
hand-sliced I-DISH
Ibérico I-DISH
ham I-DISH
or O
the O
chilled B-DISH
Maine I-DISH
sea I-DISH
urchins I-DISH
served O
on O
the O
spiky O
half-shell. O
Either O
one O
will O
convince O
you O
that O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
his O
hands O
on O
raw O
materials O
that O
can O
stun O
with O
almost O
no O
assistance. O
The O
best O
things O
at O
Standard B-EST
Grill, I-EST
and O
there O
are O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
them, O
depend O
on O
very O
good O
ingredients O
touched O
as O
little O
as O
possible. O
Back O
in O
the O
Union B-EST
Pacific I-EST
days, O
Mr. O
DiSpirito's O
interest O
in O
East B-CUISINE
Asian I-CUISINE
cuisines O
came O
out O
in O
the O
form O
of O
complex O
preparations, O
arcane O
ingredients O
and O
out-of-nowhere O
juxtapositions. O
Now O
he O
seems O
to O
have O
moved O
on O
to O
the O
luxury O
minimalism O
of O
an O
omakase O
sushi O
chef, O
a O
style O
that O
was O
foreshadowed O
by O
the O
only O
Union B-EST
Pacific I-EST
dish O
he's O
brought O
back, O
bay B-DISH
scallops I-DISH
and I-DISH
sea I-DISH
urchin I-DISH
with O
a O
few O
throat-searing O
drops O
of O
mustard B-FOOD
oil. I-FOOD
Standard B-EST
Grill's I-EST
ice-cold O
cubes O
of O
bluefin B-DISH
chu-toro I-DISH
stirred O
with O
golden B-FOOD
osetra I-FOOD
caviar, I-FOOD
meanwhile, O
could O
have O
come O
straight O
out O
of O
Masa B-EST
, O
while O
the O
yellowfin B-DISH
tartare, I-DISH
barely O
dressed O
with O
crushed O
macadamias B-FOOD
and O
freshly O
grated B-FOOD
wasabi, I-FOOD
is O
like O
one O
of O
the O
better O
items O
at O
Tetsu B-EST
. O
Each O
night O
there O
are O
half O
a O
dozen O
or O
so O
skewers O
cooked O
over O
Japanese B-CUISINE
charcoal O
and O
wheeled O
to O
the O
table O
on O
a O
mini-grill O
the O
size O
of O
a O
toaster O
oven. O
Speared O
on O
a O
stick O
might O
be O
fantastic O
small B-FOOD
scallops I-FOOD
out O
of O
Peconic O
Bay; O
a O
feathery O
mop O
of O
maitake B-FOOD
mushrooms; I-FOOD
buttery O
chicken B-FOOD
livers I-FOOD
with O
barely O
a O
hint O
of O
bitterness; O
or O
firefly B-FOOD
squid, I-FOOD
a O
little O
bigger O
than O
a O
fava B-FOOD
bean I-FOOD
and I-FOOD
grilled O
whole O
so O
they O
can O
be O
swallowed O
guts O
and O
all. O
Again, O
the O
ingredients O
are O
exceptional. O
The O
skewers O
look O
simple O
enough, O
but O
they O
are O
all, O
you O
learn, O
brushed O
with O
"a O
little O
sauce O
Chef O
Rocco O
came O
up O
with O
to O
complement O
the O
charcoal." O
The O
sauce O
for O
seafood O
involves O
coconut B-FOOD
nectar I-FOOD
and O
lemongrass, B-FOOD
and O
what O
it O
actually O
does O
is O
put O
you, O
vaguely O
and O
pleasantly, O
in O
mind O
of O
Thailand. B-LOC
While O
I O
am O
one O
of O
those O
increasingly O
stooped O
and O
wizened O
diners O
who O
remembers, O
in O
detail, O
Mr. O
DiSpirito's O
cooking O
at O
Union B-EST
Pacific, I-EST
far O
more O
people O
recall O
him O
as O
the O
meatball-pushing O
antihero O
of O
"The O
Restaurant," O
an O
NBC O
series O
about O
Rocco's B-EST
on I-EST
22nd, I-EST
an O
actual O
(and O
doomed, O
it O
turned O
out) O
Italian-American B-CUISINE
restaurant. O
The O
show, O
which O
debuted O
in O
2003, O
was O
a O
pioneer O
in O
the O
genre O
of O
cooking-focused O
reality O
television, O
although O
when O
everybody O
started O
suing O
everybody O
else, O
it O
became O
clear O
it O
was O
a O
pioneer O
in O
the O
way O
the O
members O
of O
the O
Donner O
Party O
were O
pioneers. O
The O
handful O
of O
Italian B-CUISINE
dishes O
at O
Standard B-EST
Grill I-EST
may I-EST
be O
meant O
for O
"Restaurant" O
fans. O
Neither O
of O
the O
two O
pastas O
showed O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
at O
his O
best, O
but O
a O
chewy O
risotto B-DISH
with I-DISH
red I-DISH
shrimp I-DISH
and O
what O
seemed O
like O
half O
a O
dozen O
forms O
of O
black B-FOOD
truffles I-FOOD
may O
make O
you O
understand O
why O
Ruth O
Reichl O
started O
her O
1998 O
Times O
review O
of O
Union B-EST
Pacific I-EST
with O
a O
woman O
moaning O
at O
the O
next O
table. O
Standard B-EST
Grill's I-EST
Norwegian B-DISH
salmon I-DISH
on O
an O
ivory O
puddle O
of O
vegan B-DIET
cashew B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
won't O
inspire O
the O
same O
reaction, O
but O
the O
steaks B-FOOD
might; O
they O
are O
dry-aged O
until O
ripe, O
and O
earn O
their O
deep-brown O
crust O
over O
extremely O
hot O
Japanese O
charcoal. O
Given O
what O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
is O
capable O
of O
doing O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
halibut B-FOOD
and O
some O
goose B-FOOD
fat, I-FOOD
I O
can't O
quite O
believe O
that O
I'm O
recommending O
the O
rib-eye B-DISH
over O
the O
seafood, B-FOOD
but O
I O
am. O
It O
may O
be O
that O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
knows O
exactly O
what O
he O
is O
doing. O
Simplicity O
is O
the O
whole O
point O
of O
a O
grill, B-TYPE
which O
is O
first O
cousin O
to O
the O
steakhouse. B-TYPE
He O
has O
also O
designed O
a O
menu O
so O
straightforward O
that O
if, O
after O
a O
respectable O
period O
of O
time, O
he O
is O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
kitchen, O
the O
food O
quality O
can O
stay O
roughly O
the O
same O
as O
long O
as O
the O
hotel O
doesn't O
argue O
about O
ingredient O
costs. O
The O
Standard B-EST
has O
not O
left O
the O
restaurant's O
fate O
entirely O
in O
his O
hands, O
either; O
besides O
redecorating, O
it O
hired O
a O
maître O
d'hôtel, O
Michael O
Cecchi-Azzolina, O
away O
from O
Le B-EST
Coucou I-EST
; O
he O
is O
hard O
at O
work O
building O
an O
audience O
every O
night, O
handing O
out O
old-school O
business O
cards O
to O
old-school O
producers, O
chefs O
and O
publishers, O
sitting O
down O
to O
chat O
with O
Brooke O
Shields O
and O
Ms. O
Reichl. O
Standard B-EST
Grill I-EST
is O
so O
much O
better O
than O
it O
used O
to O
be, O
and O
so O
much O
better O
than O
almost O
any O
restaurant O
serving O
a O
comparable O
menu O
of O
grilled B-FOOD
meats I-FOOD
and O
chilled B-FOOD
seafood, I-FOOD
that O
it's O
foolish O
to O
wish O
for O
the O
return O
of O
the O
same O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
who O
gave O
us O
Union B-EST
Pacific. I-EST
It's O
a O
little O
bit O
as O
if O
Barbra O
Streisand O
had O
returned O
to O
Broadway, O
and O
then O
sang O
all O
her O
songs O
in O
a O
whisper O
sitting O

It O
might O
not O

Looking O
around O
Haenyeo's B-EST
dining O
room O
one O
night O
in O
early O
March, O
I O
thought O
maybe O
Jenny O
Kwak's O
time O
has O
finally O
come. O
Her O
third O
restaurant, O
Haenyeo B-EST
was O
about O
three O
months O
old O
and O
already O
filled O
with O
people O
who O
looked O
as O
if O
they'd O
been O
going O
there O
for O
years. O
It O
sits O
on O
a O
prime O
corner O
lot, O
on O
a O
stretch O
of O
Fifth B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
in O
Park B-LOC
Slope, I-LOC
Brooklyn, I-LOC
that O
is O
rich O
in O
local O
minichains O
serving O
banh B-FOOD
mi, I-FOOD
burritos, B-FOOD
lobster B-FOOD
rolls I-FOOD
and O
so O
on, O
to O
take O
out O
or O
eat O
in. O
Intimidating O
restaurants O
don't O
tend O
to O
prosper O
here. O
Very O
few O
people O
inside O
Haenyeo O
look O
the O
least O
bit O
intimidated O
as O
they O
lift O
grilled O
oysters O
by O
the O
shell O
to O
pour O
the O
dregs O
of O
hot O
seaweed O
butter O
over O
toast; O
or O
carve O
wedges O
of O
zucchini-scallion O
pancakes O
fried O
to O
a O
dark O
and O
satisfyingly O
rich O
brown; O
or O
stir O
mushrooms, O
squid, O
bean O
sprouts, O
steamed O
spinach O
and O
cabbage O
kimchi O
with O
a O
just-cracked O
egg O
into O
a O
bibimbap O
whose O
bottom O
layer O
of O
rice O
is O
golden O
and O
crunchy O
where O
it O
meets O
the O
hot O
stone O
bowl. O
The O
customers O
at O
Haenyeo O
seem O
to O
have O
an O
easy O
familiarity O
with O
Korean O
food. O
Some O
of O
them, O
at O
least, O
can O
probably O
thank O
Ms. O
Kwak O
for O
that. O
In O
1992, O
when O
she O
began O
serving O
the O
cuisine O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
at O
her O
first O
restaurant, O
Dok O
Suni's, O
the O
words O
tteokbokki O
and O
seolleongtang O
and O
jajangmyeon O
did O
not O
roll O
off O
the O
tongues O
of O
most O
non-Koreans. O
But O
that's O
who O
she O
wanted O
to O
lure O
in O
with O
American O
music, O
date-night O
décor O
and O
Western-style O
service. O
Once O
she O
had O
them, O
she O
would O
tempt, O
teach, O
turn O
them O
on O
to O
the O
flavors O
she'd O
grown O
up O
with. O
Her O
mother, O
Myung O
Ja O
Kwak, O
shared O
cooking O
duties. O
Ms. O
Kwak's O
was O
not O
the O
take-it-or-leave-it O
approach O
of O
32nd O
Street, O
and O
she O
kept O
at O
it. O
She O
wrote O
"Dok O
Suni: O
Recipes O
From O
My O
Mother's O
Korean O
Kitchen," O
which O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
Korean O
cookbooks O
in O
English O
when O
it O
came O
out, O
in O
1998. O
At O
her O
second O
restaurant, O
Do O
Hwa, O
she O
and O
her O
mother O
led O
customers O
deeper O
into O
unfamiliar O
ground. O
Each O
of O
the O
restaurants O
stayed O
open O
for O
about O
two O
decades, O
which O
is O
a O
very O
long O
time O
in O
New O
York. O
If O
you O
want O
a O
metaphor O
for O
how O
effectively O
Ms. O
Kwak O
paved O
the O
way O
for O
restaurants O
like O
Atoboy O
, O
Soogil, O
Danji O
and O
others O
whose O
chefs O
weave O
Korean O
cuisine O
into O
new O
patterns, O
consider O
that O
one O
of O
them, O
Oiji, O
moved O
into O
its O
address O
on O
First O
Avenue O
right O
after O
Dok O
Suni's O
moved O
out. O
What O
Ms. O
Kwak O
is O
doing O
in O
Park O
Slope O
isn't O
all O
that O
different O
from O
what O
she O
has O
done O
all O
her O
career, O
except O
that O
by O
now O
South O
Korean O
comfort O
food O
has O
become O
comfort O
food O
for O
New O
York O
in O
general. O
Haenyeo O
does O
pay O
more O
attention O
to O
seafood O
than O
Dok O
Suni O
or O
Do O
Hwa O
did, O
though. O
Ms. O
Kwak O
hasn't O
gone O
pescatarian O
on O
us. O
She O
still O
serves O
impressive O
pork O
and O
beef O
bulgogis O
with O
ssamjang O
and O
lettuce, O
and O
the O
pan-fried O
dumplings O
are O
filled O
with O
high-fat O
ground O
beef O
seasoned O
with O
kimchi, O
garlic O
and O
soy. O
But O
her O
menu's O
orientation O
has O
shifted O
slightly O
toward O
the O
ocean. O
This O
is O
good O
news, O
because O
the O
seafood O
at O
Haenyeo O
has O
a O
sparkle O
and O
sweetness O
you O
don't O
always O
find O
in O
the O
smoke-filled O
rooms O
of O
32nd O
Street. O
A O
bibimbap O
variant O
may O
be O
the O
menu's O
sleeper O
dish, O
partly O
because O
it O
starts O
out O
looking O
like O
a O
lunch O
bowl O
from O
Sweetgreen. O
It O
is O
a O
version O
of O
hwe O
dup O
bap. O
At O
first O
you O
just O
see O
raw O
tuna, O
shredded O
romaine O
and O
perilla O
leaves, O
grated O
carrots O
and O
cucumber, O
and O
strips O
of O
seaweed. O
Hidden O
underneath O
is O
warm O
rice. O
But O
there O
is O
a O
pink O
mound O
of O
spicy O
cod O
roe O
in O
the O
bowl, O
too, O
with O
cured O
salmon O
eggs O
and O
a O
few O
lobes O
of O
sea O
urchin. O
Both O
of O
them O
will O
break O
apart O
as O
you O
stir, O
bringing O
their O
distinct O
saltwater O
intonations O
to O
the O
rice O
and O
vegetables. O
What O
the O
menu O
calls O
"white O
fish O
fillets" O
-- O
pan-fried O
cod O
with O
rings O
of O
scallion O
showing O
through O
their O
thin O
gold O
sheet O
of O
egg O
batter, O
otherwise O
known O
as O
saeng O
seon O
jeon O
-- O
is O
so O
modestly O
named O
it O
might O
get O
overlooked; O
it O
shouldn't. O
The O
menu O
plays O
Don't O
Mind O
Me O
again O
with O
"mackerel, O
grilled O
or O
braised." O
Just O
get O
the O
mackerel, O
because O
the O
kitchen O
knows O
how O
to O
cook O
it, O
whether O
over O
a O
flame O
or O
in O
a O
dark, O
smoky O
pan O
of O
garlic O
and O
gochujang. O
In O
truth, O
the O
kitchen O
seems O
to O
know O
how O
to O
cook O
every O
kind O
of O
seafood, O
although O
perhaps O
it O
could O
come O
with O
a O
better O
partner O
for O
the O
fried O
scallops O
than O
the O
sweet, O
yellowish O
tartar O
sauce O
with O
corn O
in O
it. O
The O
walls O
are O
hung O
with O
photographs O
of O
Korean O
women O
in O
wet O
suits. O
These O
are O
the O
haenyeo O
of O
Jeju O
island O
, O
who O
dive O
up O
to O
30 O
feet O
deep O
for O
conch, O
abalone O
and O
seaweed O
while O
holding O
their O
breath O
for O
several O
minutes O
at O
a O
time. O
The O
money O
they O
made O
diving O
is O
probably O
the O
reason O
parts O
of O
Jeju O
have O
a O
matriarchal O
family O
structure. O
Naming O
the O
restaurant O
after O
them, O
Ms. O
Kwak O
continues O
a O
theme O
started O
with O
Dok O
Suni's, O
which O
means O
"strong O
women's." O
One O
dish O
that O
seems O
out O
of O
place O
is O
a O
revival O
of O
Dok O
Suni's O
fried O
chicken. O
Was O
the O
batter O
always O
so O
pasty O
and O
airless? O
That's O
not O
how O
I O
remember O
it, O
but O
it's O
possible O
my O
standards O
have O
changed O
as O
Korean O
fried O
chicken O
has O
infiltrated O
nearly O
every O
part O
of O
town O
over O
the O
past O
decade. O
In O
any O
case, O
there O
is O
better O
chicken O
to O
seek O
out O
here, O
not O
just O
the O
home-style O
dokdoritang O
stewed O
in O
chile O
sauce O
but O
also O
the O
wings. O
Haenyeo O
double-fries O
wings O
that O
have O
been O
dipped O
in O
potato O
starch, O
then O
coats O
them O
with O
a O
fine O
version O
of O
a O
yangnyeom O
chile O
sauce, O
tangier O
and O
a O
little O
less O
sweet O
than O
some. O
When O
Ms. O
Kwak O
detours O
from O
the O
Korean O
straight O
and O
narrow, O
consider O
traipsing O
along O
behind O
her. O
You O
may O
wind O
up O
having O
beignets O

In O
2012 O
and O
2013, O
when O
people O
were O
lining O
up O
at O
Smorgasburg B-EST
and O
then O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
of O
the O
Houston B-LOC
Street I-LOC
Whole B-EST
Foods I-EST
Market I-EST
for O
biodegradable O
bowls O
of O
Yuji O
Haraguchi's O
mazemen B-DISH
-- O
noodles B-FOOD
that O
might O
be O
dressed O
with O
crisped O
twigs O
of O
bacon B-FOOD
and O
a O
jiggling O
onsen B-FOOD
egg, I-FOOD
say, O
or O
yuzu-cured B-FOOD
salmon I-FOOD
and O
some O
Camembert B-FOOD
soft O
enough O
to O
transform O
into O
a O
sauce O
-- O
I O
was O
sure O
the O
crowds O
would O
multiply O
and O
fan O
out, O
demanding O
more O
of O
this O
strange O
brothless O
ramen. B-FOOD
And O
they O
did, O
in O
a O
sense. O
Soon O
Mr. O
Haraguchi O
had O
established O
his O
own O
free-standing O
establishment, O
Yuji B-EST
Ramen I-EST
in O
Williamsburg, B-LOC
Brooklyn, I-LOC
where O
he O
serves O
that O
bacon-and-egg B-DISH
mazemen I-DISH
along O
with O
his O
possibly O
visionary O
"tunakotsu" B-DISH
ramen. I-DISH
In O
2014, O
when O
Ivan O
Orkin O
came O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
he O
brought O
along O
his O
own O
mazemen B-FOOD
recipes. O
Over O
the O
next O
few O
years O
mazemen B-FOOD
turned O
up O
in O
other O
restaurants, O
too, O
but O
all O
of O
them O
remained O
better O
known O
for B-FOOD
soup I-FOOD
ramen, I-FOOD
and O
sold O
more O
of O
it. O
It O
began O
to O
look O
as O
if O
mazemen B-FOOD
would O
never O
be O
more O
than O
a O
sideshow O
act, O
the O
one-armed O
ax-catcher O
of O
the O
ramen O
circus. O
Then O
at O
the O
start O
of O
the O
year, O
the O
chef O
Shigetoshi O
Nakamura, O
who O
operates O
an O
intimate O
ramen B-TYPE
shop I-TYPE
on O
the O
Lower B-LOC
East I-LOC
Side, I-LOC
opened O
an O
annex O
next O
door O
that O
is O
dedicated O
to O
mazemen. B-FOOD
All O
the O
seating O
at O
this O
new O
place, O
Niche B-EST
, O
is O
at O
a O
dozen O
or O
so O
stools O
arranged O
around O
one O
long, O
narrow O
table. O
When O
the O
dining O
room O
is O
fully O
occupied, O
the O
only O
way O
to O
get O
from O
one O
end O
to O
the O
other O
is O
to O
walk O
sideways O
while O
holding O
your O
breath O
and O
picking O
up O
all O
the O
coats O
that O
you O
are O
going O
to O
knock O
off O
their O
wall O
pegs O
as O
you O
go. O
Not O
that O
there O
is O
much O
reason O
to O
roam O
around. O
Orders O
are O
taken O
from O
and O
delivered O
to O
the O
table, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
public O
restroom O
on O
the O
premises. O
As O
is O
the O
case O
next O
door O
at O
Nakamura, B-EST
seats O
by O
the O
window O
offer O
a O
close-up O
view O
of O
the O
stone O
walls O
that O
support O
the O
last O
few O
yards O
of O
the O
Williamsburg B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
before O
it O
empties O
onto O
Delancey B-LOC
Street. I-LOC
Before O
he O
came O
to O
New B-LOC
York, I-LOC
Mr. O
Nakamura O
was O
already O
well O
known O
in O
Tokyo, B-LOC
where O
he O
proved O
to O
have O
a O
theatrical O
streak. O
Before O
filling O
a O
bowl O
with O
noodles, B-FOOD
he O
would O
yank O
them O
from O
the O
boiling O
water O
with O
his O
left O
hand O
and O
then O
hold O
them O
high O
in O
the O
air O
for O
a O
few O
seconds, O
letting O
them O
drain O
while O
standing O
completely O
motionless. O
Suddenly O
he O
would O
drop O
his O
arm O
and O
the O
basket O
would O
plunge O
toward O
the O
water O
again, O
before O
stopping O
just O
in O
time O
and O
getting O
one O
quick, O
emphatic O
shake. O
When O
Mr. O
Nakamura O
was O
immortalized O
as O
one O
of O
four O
"ramen O
gods" O
in O
a O
set O
of O
Hello O
Kitty O
notepads O
and O
phone O
straps, O
Kitty O
was O
posed O
with O
her O
left O
paw O
raised O
high O
in O
emulation O
of O
the O
Nakamura O
Shake. O
If O
Mr. O
Nakamura O
has O
been O
practicing O
his O
choreography O
on O
the O
spaghetti-like, O
crinkly O
noodles B-FOOD
at O
Niche, B-EST
I O
haven't O
seen O
it O
yet. O
The O
Nakamura O
Shake O
seems O
designed O
to O
extract O
cooking O
water O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
before O
the O
noodles O
cool, O
and O
temperature O
is O
not O
especially O
critical O
in O
mazemen. B-FOOD
The O
idea O
of O
noodle B-FOOD
soup I-FOOD
without O
the O
soup O
has O
been O
on O
the O
loose O
in O
Japan B-LOC
for O
decades. O
Broth B-FOOD
is O
the O
most O
expensive O
and O
labor-intensive O
part O
of O
a O
bowl O
of O
ramen; B-FOOD
in O
the O
1950s, O
a O
Tokyo B-LOC
noodle B-TYPE
shop, I-TYPE
in O
the O
pitiless O
logic O
of O
the O
restaurant O
business, O
began O
omitting O
the O
broth O
when O
ladling O
out O
noodles B-FOOD
at O
staff O
meals, O
or O
so O
the O
story O
goes. O
This O
"abura B-FOOD
soba" I-FOOD
-- O
oil B-FOOD
noodle, I-FOOD
because O
it O
was O
moistened O
with O
lard O
along O
with O
the O
seasoning O
sauce O
called O
tare B-FOOD
-- O
wasn't O
half O
bad, O
so O
it O
went O
on O
the O
menu O
at O
a O
discounted O
price. O
As O
an O
even O
cheaper O
version O
of O
an O
already O
cheap O
and O
filling O
meal, O
abura B-FOOD
soba I-FOOD
was O
quickly O
embraced, O
especially O
by O
students. O
As O
food O
ideas O
tend O
to O
do O
in O
Japan, B-LOC
it O
evolved O
rapidly. O
Today, O
abura B-FOOD
soba I-FOOD
tends O
to O
refer O
to O
dry B-FOOD
soups I-FOOD
that O
have O
more O
or O
less O
the O
same O
toppings O
you'd O
find O
in O
a O
bowl O
of O
normal O
ramen, B-FOOD
while O
mazemen B-FOOD
generally O
has O
toppings O
that O
are O
rarely O
seen O
in O
soup O
and O
often O
would O
not O
respond O
well O
to O
being O
submerged O
in O
hot O
liquid. O
There O
is O
Italian-style B-CUISINE
mazemen, B-FOOD
with O
anchovies, B-FOOD
salami, B-FOOD
olives B-FOOD
and O
tomatoes. B-FOOD
Some O
mazemen B-TYPE
shops I-TYPE
specialize O
in O
fried B-FOOD
beef I-FOOD
cutlets. I-FOOD
At O
a O
Tokyo B-LOC
restaurant O
called O
Beefst B-EST
, O
the O
centerpiece O
of O
each O
bowl O
is O
sliced O
roast B-FOOD
beef, I-FOOD
served O
rare. O
Mr. O
Nakamura O
has O
an O
answer O
to O
that: O
steak B-DISH
mazemen. I-DISH
The O
steak B-FOOD
is O
rib-eye, O
in O
cubes O
that O
have O
been O
browned O
with O
a O
kitchen O
torch. O
When O
you O
stir O
them O
with O
the O
noodles B-FOOD
and O
a O
smooth, O
creamy O
spoonful O
of O
something O
the O
menu O
simply O
calls O
"pork B-FOOD
sauce," I-FOOD
their O
juices O
and O
flecks O
of O
char O
flavor O
the O
whole O
bowl. O
Plain O
spinach B-FOOD
and O
fermented B-FOOD
bamboo, I-FOOD
meanwhile, O
keep O
the O
total O
effect O
from O
being O
queasy-making. O
Novel, O
straightforward, O
refined, O
unruly O
and O
impure O
of O
heart, O
steak B-DISH
mazemen I-DISH
has O
the O
makings O
of O
a O
classic O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
dish. O
So O
does O
the O
duck, B-DISH
a O
common O
special. O
A O
sliced O
breast O
of O
moulard B-FOOD
duck I-FOOD
cooked O
to O
a O
deep O
violet-pink, O
it O
is O
served O
with O
a O
bright, O
focused O
sauce O
built O
on O
soy O
and O
enough O
warm O
duck O
juices O
to O
lubricate O
the O
whole-wheat O
noodles. O
It O
is O
not O
an O
austere O
dish O
by O
any O
means, O
but O
it O
is O
balanced O
and O
restrained. O
The O
same O
cannot O
be O
said O
for O
another O
special O
that O
is O
always O
offered O
on O
the O
same O
nights: O
a O
bowl O
of O
liquefied O
foie O
gras O
topped O
with O
pistachios O
and O
truffle O
oil. O
It O
is O
not O
clear O
what O
will O
happen O
to O
anyone O
who O
tries O
to O
eat O
this O
with O
a O
spoon, O
but O
the O
prognosis O
does O
not O
seem O
good. O
Instead, O
everybody O
orders O
it O
with O
the O
duck O
mazemen O
and O
dips O
the O
noodles O
into O
the O
foie O
gras, O
after O
which O
conscious O
thought O
tends O
to O
stop O
for O
a O
minute O
or O
two. O
When O
cerebral O
activity O
resumes, O
you O
might O
wonder O
why O
the O
sauce O
doesn't O
come O
with O
its O
own O
noodles. O
No O
other O
mazemen O
is O
such O
a O
joy O
ride, O
but O
the O
vaguely O
Italian O
one O
with O
tomatoes, O
mushrooms, O
kombu O
and O
an O
angry O
red O
soak O
of O
chile O
oil O
is O
not O
the O
kind O
of O
thing O
you O
want O
to O
turn O
your O
back O
on. O
Even O
the O
tribute O
to O
Russ O
& O
Daughters O
, O
where O
the O
noodles O
are O
coated O
with O
spicy O
cod O
roe O
and O
the O
topping O
is O
sliced O
smoked O
salmon, O
can O
sneak O
up O
on O
you. O
Niche O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
ramen-yas O
in O
town O
where O
the O
appetizers O
are O
worth O
noticing. O
Sea O
urchin O
perched O
on O
tiny O
corners O
of O
toast O
is O
a O
strange O
and O
awkward O
affair, O
but O
the O
sardines O
on O
toast, O
dressed O
with O
chile O
flakes, O
are O
very O
good, O
as O
are O
the O
raw O
scallops O
with O
yuzu O
juice O
and O
the O
avocado O
salad O
showered O
with O
tempura O
flakes. O
Should O
fries O
be O
an O
appetizer? O
Maybe O
not, O
particularly O
Niche's O
"umami O
kombu O
fries," O
which O
have O
been O
sprinkled O
with O
powdered O
shio O
kombu O
until O
they O
are O
almost O
subliminally O
green. O
Apart O
from O
the O
color, O
they O
look O
like O
the O
fries O
at O
McDonald's. O
The O
difference O
is O
that O
the O
shio O
kombu O
makes O
them O
almost O
diabolically O
hard O
to O
stop O
eating. O
And O
if O
you O
don't O
eat O
them O
before O
the O
mazemen O
arrives, O
then O
when O
will O
you? O

If O
you O
ate O
at O
Spice B-EST
Market I-EST
before O
it O
closed O
two O
years O
ago, O
you O
may O
experience O
low-key O
but O
persistent O
flashbacks O
at O
Wayan B-EST
, O
which O
set O
up O
shop O
in O
February O
on O
the O
east O
end O
of O
Spring B-LOC
Street I-LOC
in O
NoLIta. B-LOC
Again O
the O
flavors O
come O
from O
Asia B-LOC
and O
the O
methods, O
generally, O
from O
France. B-LOC
Again O
the O
far-off O
tropics O
are O
evoked O
through O
the O
play O
of O
indirect, O
dappled O
light, O
as O
if O
filtered O
through O
jungle O
foliage O
or O
a O
carved O
wooden O
screen. O
Again O
the O
presiding O
culinary O
sensibility O
belongs O
to O
a O
Vongerichten. O
Jean-Georges O
Vongerichten O
put O
together O
Spice B-EST
Market I-EST
in O
2004, O
a O
confection O
of O
teak, O
silk, O
vodka, B-FOOD
peanut B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
and O
high O
heels O
that O
brought O
the O
Asian O
Party O
Temple O
restaurant O
genre O
to O
its O
apotheosis. O
All O
the O
earlier O
examples O
suddenly O
seemed O
fumbling O
and O
unsophisticated, O
and O
with O
the O
possible O
exception O
of O
the O
Spice B-EST
Market I-EST
spinoffs O
in O
Qatar B-LOC
and O
Mexico, B-LOC
the O
ones O
that O
would O
follow O
seemed O
increasingly O
mindless O
and O
out O
of O
touch. O
Interior O
design O
that O
rummages O
through O
the O
musty O
old O
trunks O
of O
Orientalism O
doesn't O
look O
as O
alluring O
as O
it O
did O
15 O
years O
ago, O
and O
cooking O
that O
filters O
Asian B-CUISINE
flavors O
through O
a O
Western B-CUISINE
sensibility O
isn't O
automatically O
met O
with O
gales O
of O
excitement. O
Wayan, O
where O
Mr. O
Vongerichten's O
son, O
Cédric, O
is O
the O
chef, O
avoids O
both O
traps, O
I O
think. O
The O
restaurant O
is O
a O
tribute O
to O
Indonesia, B-LOC
the O
home O
of O
his O
wife O
and O
business O
partner, O
Ochi O
Vongerichten, O
and O
the O
site O
of O
two O
restaurants O
that O
he O
opened O
recently. O
(He O
is O
also O
the O
chef O
of O
Perry B-EST
St. I-EST
in O
Manhattan, B-LOC
which O
his O
father O
owns.) O
The O
scale O
is O
more O
personal O
and O
the O
cultural O
references O
are O
more O
specific O
at O
Wayan B-EST
than O
at O
Spice B-EST
Market I-EST
and O
its O
kind. O
The O
menu O
is O
far O
from O
encyclopedic, O
but O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
Indonesia's B-LOC
cuisine O
has O
been O
given O
more O
than O
the O
quick O
glance O
that O
informs O
a O
lot O
of O
Asian B-CUISINE
fusion. O
Ms. O
Vongerichten O
works O
in O
the O
dining O
room, O
stopping O
by O
tables O
to O
offer O
explanations O
of O
the O
menu O
and O
how O
the O
cooking O
differs O
from O
that O
at O
some O
other O
Indonesian B-CUISINE
restaurants O
in O
New B-LOC
York, I-LOC
which O
she O
cheerfully O
calls O
"more O
authentic." O
More O
than O
any O
other O
factor, O
she O
helps O
keep O
Wayan B-EST
from O
turning O
into O
a O
junior O
version O
of O
one O
of O
her O
father-in-law's O
restaurants O
-- O
Young O
Vongerichtenstein. O
Servers O
will O
tell O
you O
to O
start O
with O
a O
stick O
or O
two O
of O
satay. B-FOOD
You O
can, O
although O
the O
skewers O
are O
cooked O
on O
a O
flattop O
instead O
of O
a O
grill, O
and O
inconsistency O
is O
an O
issue. O
The O
pork B-DISH
skewers I-DISH
that O
are O
so O
appealingly O
juicy O
and O
savory O
with O
sweet O
soy O
one O

be O
scorched O

bitter O
the O
next O
time O
you O
see O
them, O
and O
just O
ordinary O
the O
following O
week. O
(The O
pickled B-DISH
watermelon I-DISH
radishes I-DISH
on O
the O
side, O
though, O
are O

terrific; O
they're O
brined O

about O

it O
is O

not O

Wayan's B-EST

just O
until O
it O
crackles O
a O

It O
has O
a O
gentle O

genuine O
spice O
undercurrent O
that O
would O
be O
welcome O
in O
more O
of O

Of O

there O
is O
a O

gado, I-DISH

the O

This O
time O
the O

dressing I-FOOD
isn't O
cloying O

clumpy. O
As O
the O

get O

few O
dishes O
really O
come O
forward O
as O
the O
kind O
of O
knockout O
that O
everybody O

talk O
about O

The O
closest O
contender O
must O
be O
the O

in O
a O
sauce O
containing, O
among O
other O
things, O
sweet B-FOOD
soy I-FOOD
and O
melted B-FOOD
butter I-FOOD
-- O
a O
combination O
that O
the O
senior O
Mr. O

has O
used O
so O
successfully O
that O
it O
may O
be O
his O

Should O
the O
calamansi B-FOOD
vinaigrette I-FOOD
poured O
over O
the O
steamed B-DISH
black I-DISH
sea I-DISH
bass I-DISH
be O
more O
sour O
and O
spicy? O
Probably. O
But O
if O
there O
are O
few O
stars O
on O
the O
table, O
the O
contrast O
of O
flavors, O
colors, O
textures O
and O
techniques O
makes O
the O
meal O
into O
a O
memorable O
ensemble O
piece. O
The O
drumsticks B-FOOD
in O
yellow B-DISH
chicken I-DISH
are O
crunchy, O
and O
the O
thighs B-FOOD
are O
tender; O
both O
are O
mellow O
with O
a O
yellow B-FOOD
curry I-FOOD
seasoned O
by O
lemongrass B-FOOD
and O
ginger. B-FOOD
The O
tomato-chile B-FOOD
sambal I-FOOD
pressed O
into O
the O
surface O
of O
cod B-DISH
"bilindango" I-DISH
is O
potent O
enough O
to O
carry O
over O
to O
the O
spears O
of O
asparagus B-FOOD
and O
fiddlehead B-FOOD
ferns I-FOOD
sprawled O
alongside. O
All O
of O
this O
looks O
very O
come-hither O
in O
the O
dining O
room, O
where O
the O
Rockwell O
Group O
has O
abandoned O
stadium-size O
props, O
building O
atmospheric O
effects O
instead O
out O
of O
contrasting O
textures O
and O
light O
values O
and O
the O
movement O
of O
shadows. O
This O
is O
the O
visual O
language O
of O
expensive O
tropical O
resorts, O
and O
Wayan B-EST
seems O
to O
give O
people O
the O
feeling O
they're O
on O
vacation. O
It O
is O
not O
necessarily O
a O
loud O
restaurant, O
but O
New O
Yorkers O
are O
a O
loud O
people, O
and O
around O
10 O
the O
noise O
can O
start O
to O
press O
down. O
It O
is O
a O
good O
time O
to O
call O
for O
dessert. O
The O
purple-yam B-DISH
ice I-DISH
cream I-DISH
with O
banana B-FOOD
cake I-FOOD
and O
caramelized B-FOOD
bananas I-FOOD
is O
good O
if O
sundaes B-FOOD
are O
your O
thing. O
The O
pandan B-DISH
custard I-DISH
under O
passion-fruit B-FOOD
pulp I-FOOD
gets O
a O
lot O
of O
mileage O
from O
just O
a O
few O
flavors. O
But O
the O
one O
that O
sounds O
too O
boring O
to O
bother O
with O
("assorted B-DISH
exotic I-DISH
fruit?") I-DISH
is O
worth O
a O
second O
look. O
Lychee, B-FOOD
mango, B-FOOD
pineapple B-FOOD
and O
dragon B-FOOD
fruit I-FOOD
may O
not O
be O
particularly O
exotic, O
but O
a O
dip O
or O
a O
dunk O
into O
a O
dark, O
spicy O
syrup O
of O
tamarind B-FOOD
and O
palm B-FOOD
sugar I-FOOD
will O
wake O
them O
right O
up. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
the O
bacalaitos B-DISH
at O
the O
Freakin B-EST
Rican I-EST
in O
Astoria, B-LOC
Queens, I-LOC
are O
not O
quite O
as O
big O
around O
as O
the O
ones O
you O
will O
see O
browning O
in O
veritable O
caldrons O
of O
oil O
over O
wood O
fires O
at O
kiosks O
scattered O
along O
the O
beach O
road O
in O
Piñones, B-LOC
outside O
San B-LOC
Juan. I-LOC
These O
flattened O
cod B-FOOD
fritters I-FOOD
are O
the O
size O
of O
pie O
plates O
in O
Puerto B-LOC
Rico, I-LOC
while O
in O
Queens B-LOC
they O
are O
roughly O
the O
diameter O
of O
a O
coffee O
can. O
Dimensions O
aside, O
they O
give O
off O
all O
the O
right O
signals. O
They O
are O
the O
color O
of O
a O
corn B-FOOD
muffin, I-FOOD
with O
green O
specks O
of O
chopped O
cilantro B-FOOD
under O
the O
surface O
that O
let O
you O
know O
they O
are O
not O
made O
from O
Goya's O
mix. O
They O
don't O
leave O
your O
fingertips O
entirely O
free O
of O
grease, O
but O
they O
come O
close. O
They O
have O
an O
exterior O
crunch O
that O
surrenders O
quickly O
to O
the O
firm, O
chewy O
interior O
of O
mashed B-FOOD
salt I-FOOD
cod; I-FOOD
the O
texture O
is O
less O
fried B-FOOD
dough I-FOOD
than O
fish O
taffy. O
You O
could O
start O
to O
build O
a O
business O
around O
bacalaitos O
like O
these. O
That, O
in O
fact, O
has O
been O
Derick O
López's O
plan O
for O
some O
time O
now. O
Mr. O
López, O
who O
was O
born O
in O
Puerto O
Rico O
and O
raised O
in O
the O
South O
Bronx, O
is O
the O
Freakin O
Rican's O
chef O
and, O
with O
his O
husband, O
Victor O
Vargas, O
its O
owner. O
About O
four O
years O
ago, O
armed O
with O
picnic O
coolers O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
folding O
tables, O
the O
two O
men O
began O
selling O
a O
short O
menu O
of O
Puerto O
Rican O
staples O
at O
the O
street O
fairs O
that O
seem O
to O
infiltrate O
a O
different O
New O
York O
thoroughfare O
each O
weekend. O
As O
they O
promoted O
the O
Freakin O
Rican O
catering O
operation, O
the O
Freakin O
Rican O
product O
line, O
the O
Freakin O
Rican O
Facebook O
page O
and O
the O
Freakin O
Rican O
YouTube O
channel, O
they O
saved O
their O
earnings O
so O
they O
could O
found O
the O
Freakin O
Rican O
restaurant. O
After O
a O
false O
start O
in O
another O
part O
of O
Queens, O
it O
opened O
a O
short O
distance O
from O
the O
Museum O
of O
the O
Moving O
Image O
one O
year O
ago O
this O
month. O
The O
dining O
room O
has O
19 O
seats. O
The O
banana-plant O
wallpaper O
on O
the O
left O
wall O
is O
reflected O
in O
the O
mirrors O
on O
the O
right. O
In O
between O
are O
some O
metal O
chickens O
and O
bright-green O
figurines O
of O
coquís, O
the O
little O
frogs O
that O
chirp O
from O
every O
Puerto O
Rican O
tree. O
Diners O
sip O
on O
tropical-fruit O
shakes O
or O
bottles O
of O
Kola O
Champagne, O
Coco O
Rico O
and O
Malta O
India, O
the O
Harry, O
Ron O
and O
Hermione O
of O
Puerto O
Rican O
soft O
drinks. O
Héctor O
Lavoe O
may O
be O
playing O
over O
the O
speakers, O
or O
Víctor O
Manuelle, O
not O
so O
loudly O
that O
they O
can't O
be O
drowned O
out O
by O
the O
sounds O
of O
a O
small O
number O
of O
employees O
singing O
"Happy O
Birthday" O
while O
wielding O
a O
tambourine O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
maracas. O
If O
you O
have O
spent O
any O
time O
at O
all O
on O
the O
trail O
of O
chicharrones, O
mofongo, O
sancocho O
and O
other O
wonders O
of O
the O
Puerto O
Rican O
kitchen, O
you O
know O
that O
Astoria O
is O
not O
a O
primary O
hunting O
ground O
for O
any O
of O
them. O
You O
also O
know, O
though, O
that O
blinking-light O
cuchifritos O
parlors O
and O
family-run O
cocina O
criolla O
luncheonettes O
have O
been O
disappearing O
from O
the O
Bronx, O
East O
Harlem O
and O
the O
Lower O
East O
Side O
over O
the O
past O
few O
decades, O
along O
with O
many O
of O
their O
customers. O
The O
Puerto O
Rican O
population O
in O
New O
York O
peaked O
around O
1990, O
when O
residents O
of O
the O
old O
barrios O
began O
to O
flow O
to O
the O
suburbs O
in O
large O
numbers, O
according O
to O
Laird O
W. O
Bergad O
, O
the O
director O
of O
the O
Center O
for O
Latin O
American, O
Caribbean O
and O
Latino O
Studies O
at O
City O
University O
of O
New O
York O
Graduate O
Center. O
Beacons O
of O
Puerto O
Rican O
cuisine O
still O
survive; O
Casa O
Adela, O
for O
instance, O
is O
still O
busily O
dispensing O
chickens O
from O
its O
venerable O
lemon-yellow O
rotisserie O
on O
Avenue O
C, O
despite O
the O
death O
last O
year O
of O
its O
founder, O
Adela O
Fargas. O
But O
there O
are O
not O
so O
many O
of O
these O
places O
left O
that O
we O
can O
take O
an O
unlimited O
supply O
of O
tostones O
and O
mojo O
de O
ajo O
for O
granted, O
either. O
The O
Freakin O
Rican O
developed O
its O
act O
on O
the O
street-fair O
circuit, O
but O
it O
applied O
the O
same O
tactics O
that O
succeed O
at O
Smorgasburg O
and O
similar O
urban O
foraging O
grounds, O
where O
the O
ideal O
dish O
can O
be O
held O
in O
one O
hand, O
gets O
immediate O
attention, O
costs O
under O
$10 O
and O
can O
serve O
as O
a O
plank O
in O
a O
branding O
platform. O
This O
may O
explain O
why O
appetizers O
are O
the O
strong O
suit O
on O
the O
Freakin O
Rican O
menu. O
The O
sorullitos, O
Puerto O
Rico's O
answer O
to O
hush O
puppies, O
are O
an O
exception; O
they O
are O
dense O
and O
dry, O
as O
if O
the O
cornmeal O
hadn't O
absorbed O
enough O
water. O
Mr. O
López's O
alcapurrias, O
though, O
are O
very O
good, O
even O
if O
the O
picadillo O
that O
runs O
down O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
tube O
of O
mashed O
fried O
plantains O
like O
the O
graphite O
in O
a O
pencil O
could O
be O
seasoned O
a O
little O
more O
forcefully. O
And O
his O
pasteles O
are O
exceptional. O
Pasteles O
are O
structured O
like O
tamales. O
Where O
the O
masa O
would O
be, O
Mr. O
López O
makes O
a O
sweet, O
enjoyably O
gummy O
mash O
of O
green O
plantains, O
taro O
root O
and O
kabocha O
squash. O
The O
filling O
is O
a O
soft, O
rich O
vein O
of O
stewed O
pork O
shoulder O
with O
ham, O
bacon, O
red O
peppers O
and O
green O
olives. O
Rolled O
up O
in O
a O
banana O
leaf, O
these O
pasteles O
probably O
deserve O
their O
own O
float O
in O
the O
Puerto O
Rican O
Day O
Parade. O
Mr. O
López O
fries O
chicken O
in O
two O
styles. O
One, O
the O
chicharrones O
de O
pollo, O
is O
traditional. O
The O
other, O
the O
Freakin O
Crispy O
Wings, O
is O
not. O
Each O
has O
its O
rewards. O
The O
chicharrones, O
hacked O
into O
three-bite O
hunks, O
taste O
of O
cider O
vinegar O
and O
garlic O
powder O
and O
have O
a O
smooth, O
achiote-tinted O
buttermilk O
crust O
that O
breaks O
open O
with O
a O
pleasing O
crackle. O
The O
Freakin O
Crispy O
Wings O
are O
spicier, O
and O
the O
shell O
is O
thicker O
and O
more O
deeply O
crevassed. O
These O
wings O
may O
owe O
more O
to O
Atlanta O
than O
to O
Mayagüez, O
although O
you O
can O
get O
them O
with O
a O
guava O
barbecue O
sauce O
that's O
reasonably O
tropical. O
Leave O
behind O
these O
appetizers, O
the O
core O
of O
the O
street-fair O
business, O
and O
the O
menu O
can O
start O
to O
appear O
unsteady. O
At O
dinner, O
the O
main O
courses O
tend O
to O
be O
fairly O
plain O
fried O
or O
grilled O
meat. O
Grilled O
pork O
chops O
splashed O
with O
mojo O
can O
be O
dry O
and O
dull, O
and O
the O
grilled O
chicken O
breasts O
are O
not O
much O
more O
interesting. O
Baked O
pork O
ribs O
in O
a O
sweet O
barbecue O
sauce O
are O
tender O
enough, O
but O
they O
aren't O
very O
persuasive. O
On O
several O
nights, O
I O
found O
myself O
gazing O
longingly O
at O
the O
lunch O
specials O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
menu, O
wondering O
why O
I O
couldn't O
have O
a O
brick O
of O
pastelón O
for O
dinner. O
(I O
came O
back O
for O
it O
one O
Thursday O
afternoon, O
and O
was O
glad O
I O
did.) O
Until O
more O
long-cooked O
dishes O
like O
it O
appear O
at O
dinnertime, O
consider O
a O
bowl O
of O
sancocho. O
Listed O
as O
"vegetable O
root O
soup" O
for O
$7, O
it O
doesn't O
sound O
like O
much O
of O
a O
meal. O
But O
it O
is O
a O
grab O
bag O
of O
a O
stew O
with O
at O
least O
two O
kinds O
of O
meat, O
great O
hunks O
of O
taro O
and O
yuca, O
a O
couple O
of O
inches O
of O
corn O
on O
the O
cob O
and O
a O
magical O
squash O
broth O
that O
has O
the O
consistency O
of O
heavy O
cream O
and O
the O
color O
of O
very O
ripe O
mango. O
In O
the O
unlikely O
event O
that O
you O
finish O
it O
and O
the O
bowl O
of O
rice O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
and O
then O
cry O
out O
for O
more, O
the O
Freakin O
Rican O
has O
just O
the O
thing O
for O
you: O
mofongo. O
A O
dome O
of O
mashed O
plantains O
possessed O
by O
garlic, O
the O
mofongo O
is O
cooked O
to O
order O
to O
keep O
the O
crunchy O
bits O
crunchy O
and O
the O
whole O
thing O
from O
getting O
boggy. O
You O
can O
have O
it O
with O
chicharrones O
or O
sliced O
roast O
pork, O
which O
leaves O
behind O
a O
happy O
impression O
of O
garlic, O
oregano O
and O
salt. O
If O
you O
have O
come O
for O
a O
birthday, O
a O
candle O
stuck O
in O
the O
meringue O
icing O
of O
a O
tres O
leches O
cake O
is O
probably O
in O
your O
future. O
If O
not, O
flan O
and O
espresso O
will O
do, O
and O
a O
bag O
of O
pasteles O
for O
tomorrow. O

More O
than O
a O
year O
ago, O
I O
was O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
reviewing O
Del B-EST
Posto I-EST
when O
the O
news O
intervened. O
The O
restaurant O
had O
changed O
significantly O
since O
the O
last O
time O
it O
had O
been O
evaluated O
by O
a O
Times O
critic: O
Sam O
Sifton O
promoted O
it O
from O
three O
stars O
to O
four O
in O
2010, O
when O
Mark O
Ladner O
was O
the O
executive O
chef O
and O
Brooks O
Headley O
was O
running O
the O
pastry O
kitchen. O
First, O
Mr. O
Headley O
had O
quit O
this O
stately, O
expensive O
Italian B-CUISINE
restaurant O
in O
Chelsea B-LOC
so O
he O
could O
sell O
fast, O
cheap O
vegetarian B-DIET
burgers B-FOOD
. O
Next, O
Del B-EST
Posto I-EST
had O
spent O
about O
$1 O
million O
on O
crystal O
candle O
vases, O
white O
leather O
chairs O
and O
other O
luxurious O
fittings O
that O
made O
it O
even O
more O
stately O
and O
expensive. O
Finally, O
Mr. O
Ladner O
had O
left O
to O
sell O
fast, O
cheap O
pasta. B-FOOD
A O
fresh O
review O
was O
clearly O
in O
order. O
Before O
I O
could O
write O
it, O
though, O
a O
number O
of O
women O
who O
had O
worked O
for O
Mario O
Batali, O
one O
of O
the O
owners, O
started O
talking O
about O
the O
sexual O
harassment O
and O
abuse O
that O
they O
say O
he O
had O
doled O
out. O
Suddenly O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
more O
important O
questions O
than O
whether O
the O
braised-rabbit O
agnolotti O
were O
cooked O
al O
dente. O
Negotiations O
took O
more O
than O
a O
year, O
but O
Mr. O
Batali O
no O
longer O
profits O
from O
Del O
Posto, O
having O
sold O
his O
stake O
in O
March O
to O
a O
group O
led O
by O
his O
former O
partner, O
Joe O
Bastianich O
. O
Employees O
have O
said O
that O
Mr. O
Bastianich O
himself O
helped, O
at O
a O
minimum, O
to O
build O
the O
sexist O
and O
disrespectful O
environment O
in O
which O
Mr. O
Batali O
operated. O
Mr. O
Bastianich O
has O
apologized, O
saying O
that O
he O
had O
heard O
Mr. O
Batali O
speak O
inappropriately O
to O
employees, O
and O
that O
he O
should O
have O
done O
more O
to O
stop O
the O
sexual O
harassment. O
Some O
diners O
will O
stay O
away, O
feeling O
that O
Mr. O
Bastianich O
has O
not O
sufficiently O
atoned. O
I O
understand O
this, O
but O
I O
am O
also O
interested O
in O
the O
way O
employees O
may O
be O
treated O
at O
the O
restaurant O
now O
and O
in O
the O
future. O
Here, O
there O
is O
reason O
to O
hope. O
Among O
other O
human-resources O
reforms, O
employees O
can O
now O
report O
complaints O
about O
owners O
or O
corporate O
officers O
to O
an O
independent O
investigative O
firm O
with O
the O
power O
to O
refer O
cases O
to O
outside O
counsel. O
As O
part O
of O
the O
restructuring, O
Melissa O
Rodriguez, O
who O
has O
been O
the O
executive O
chef O
of O
Del O
Posto O
since O
2017, O
was O
made O
a O
partner O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
along O
with O
Jeff O
Katz, O
now O
the O
managing O
partner. O
A O
new O
pastry O
chef, O
Georgia O
Wodder, O
was O
appointed O
last O
spring. O
Del O
Posto O
is, O
with O
the O
possible O
exception O
of O
Aquavit O
, O
the O
grandest O
and O
most O
expensive O
restaurant O
in O
New O
York O
where O
women O
are O
in O
charge O
of O
everything O
you O
eat, O
starting O
with O
the O
miniature O
saffron O
waffle O
rolled O
like O
a O
cannoli O
and O
stuffed O
at O
one O
tiny O
end O
with O
taleggio O
and O
at O
the O
other O
with O
fennel O
pesto, O
and O
ending O
with O
the O
prosecco O
marshmallow O
tucked O
into O
the O
wooden O
drawer O
of O
a O
custom-made O
cheese O
grater. O
The O
cooking O
is O
more O
subdued O
now. O
The O
kitchen O
is O
not O
seen O
as O
a O
beacon O
of O
innovation O
the O
way O
it O
used O
to O
be, O
perhaps O
because O
Ms. O
Rodriguez O
is O
less O
interested O
than O
Mr. O
Ladner O
was O
in O
feats O
of O
technical O
derring-do O
like O
100-layer O
lasagnas O
. O
She O
gets O
her O
effects O
by O
following O
old O
Italian O
templates O
and O
putting O
them O
together O
so O
elegantly O
that O
they O
seem O
to O
light O
up O
from O
inside. O
There's O
an O
honesty O
to O
her O
approach O
-- O
she O
doesn't O
try O
to O
shoot O
out O
all O
the O
lights O
by O
supercharging O
dishes O
with O
fat O
-- O
but O
it's O
not O
the O
kind O
of O
peasant O
simplicity O
people O
usually O
mean O
when O
they O
talk O
about O
honesty O
in O
Italian O
food. O
It's O
a O
sophisticated O
honesty. O
You O
know O
chicken O
cacciatore, O
of O
course. O
Ms. O
Rodriguez's O
version O
is O
made O
from O
guinea O
hen O
breast, O
roasted O
until O
the O
skin O
crackles O
like O
parchment. O
What O
would O
be O
the O
body O
of O
the O
stew O
is O
now O
a O
sauce; O
the O
tomato, O
celery O
and O
onion O
in O
it O
come O
through O
distinctly. O
Occupying O
a O
little O
sidecar O
is O
a O
pressed O
puck O
of O
braised O
leg O
meat O
under O
a O
single, O
Roman-style O
gnocco, O
a O
small O
featherbed O
of O
semolina O
held O
together O
by O
eggs, O
milk O
and O
cheese. O
One O
side O
has O
been O
broiled O
so O
hard O
it O
is O
nearly O
burned, O
which O
seems O
like O
a O
mistake O
at O
first, O
but O
turns O
out O
to O
supply O
the O
bit O
of O
campfire O
that O
this O
hunter's O
stew O
needs. O
It O
has O
to O
be O
far O
more O
complicated O
to O
prepare O
than O
the O
cacciatore O
at O
your O
neighborhood O
Italian O
restaurant, O
but O
it O
seems O
simpler, O
pared O
to O
essentials, O
and O
wonderful O
in O
every O
bite. O
I've O
never O
seen O
anyone O
wring O
as O
much O
flavor O
out O
of O
salsify O
as O
Ms. O
Rodriguez O
does. O
Sliced O
transparently O
thin O
and O
fried, O
it O
makes O
crunchy O
brown O
chips O
about O
half O
the O
size O
of O
an O
M&M. O
These O
decorate O
the O
top O
of O
a O
grilled-salsify O
pudding O
that O
has O
the O
refreshing O
bittersweetness O
of O
one O
of O
those O
plant-based O
Italian O
aperitifs. O
If O
it O
were O
not O
garnished O
with O
streaky O
leaves O
of O
radicchio, O
it O
could O
pass O
for O
a O
dessert. O
The O
menu O
structure O
has O
not O
changed, O
although O
the O
prices O
have. O
Everything O
can O
be O
had O
à O
la O
carte. O
Lunch O
is O
still O
a O
relative O
bargain, O
though O
the O
price O
has O
shimmied O
up O
to O
$59 O
for O
three O
courses. O
For O
a O
blowout O
$194 O
dinner, O
the O
Captain's O
Menu O
yields O
eight O
courses O
or O
so. O
Most O
people, O
however, O
go O
with O
the O
$164, O
five-course O
Menu O
del O
Posto. O
The O
primary O
argument O
in O
favor O
of O
this O
strategy O
is, O
to O
me, O
an O
overwhelming O
one: O
Two O
of O
those O
five O
courses O
are O
pasta. O
Del O
Posto's O
pastas O
are O
worth O
doubling O
up O
on. O
They O
can O
come O
in O
many O
forms. O
Delicate O
conical O
tortellini O
have O
hidden O
pockets O
of O
nettles O
and O
spring O
peas; O
they O
are O
half-submerged O
in O
a O
light O
spring-vegetable O
brodo O
in O
which O
Parmigiano-Reggiano O
rinds O
once O
bobbed O
like O
bay O
leaves. O
This O
is O
the O
spring O
minestrone. O
A O
single, O
plate-spanning O
raviolo, O
called O
a O
fazzoletto, O
is O
topped O
with O
poached O
mussels O
and O
filled O
with O
spinach O
and O
fresh O
herbs O
-- O
not O
a O
lawnmower-mulch O
of O
greenery O
but O
a O
layer O
of O
emulsion O
as O
thin O
and O
velvety O
as O
the O
dough O
that O
envelops O
it. O
The O
sauce O
of O
mussel O
juices, O
white O
wine, O
butter O
and O
saffron O
makes O
this O
the O
only O
convincing O
mussel O
pasta O
I've O
ever O
had. O
The O
range O
of O
flavors O
Ms. O
Wodder O
commands O
in O
her O
pastry O
kitchen O
seems O
unnecessarily O
limited O
to O
me, O
although O
I O
may O
be O
unfairly O
comparing O
her O
desserts O
with O
Mr. O
Headley's, O
which O
roamed O
all O
over O
the O
place. O
Individually, O
her O
desserts O
are O
soothing, O
often O
showcasing O
the O
comforts O
of O
dairy. O
More O
emphasis, O
some O
extra O
acidity O
or O
bitterness, O
might O
have O
brought O
an O
assemblage O
of O
quince O
paste, O
brown-butter O
gelato O
and O
griddled O
brioche O
into O
relief. O
But O
I O
appreciated O
the O
way O
winter O
squash O
in O
the O
batter O
modified O
the O
sweetness O
of O
an O
olive O
oil-orange O
cake, O
and O
I O
enjoyed O
the O
moody O
sulkiness O
that O
amaro O
lent O
to O
a O
citrus O
salad O
served O
with O
the O
cake. O
Del O
Posto O
has O
in O
recent O
years O
picked O
up O
a O
reputation O
as O
a O
restaurant O
for O
one-percenters. O
It O
rarely O
gives O
that O
impression O
once O
you O
are O
inside, O
where O
servers O
solemnly O
accommodate O
just O
about O
anyone. O
There O
is O
a O
vegan O
menu O
at O
Del O
Posto. O
A O
vegetarian O
meal O
can O
be O
put O
together O
easily, O
and O
almost O
everything O
can O
be O
made O
without O
gluten, O
including O
the O
pasta. O
Yes, O
the O
stockpile O
of O
Champagnes O
includes O
some O
lock-and-key O
stuff, O
and O
should O
you O
require O
a O
Barolo O
costing O
between O
$2,000 O
and O
$4,000, O
one O
will O
quickly O
be O
added O
to O
your O
bill. O
But O
among O
the O
3,100 O
or O
so O
Italian O
labels O
superintended O
by O
Evan O
Clagnaz, O
the O
wine O
director, O
are O
more O
marked O
from O
$60 O
to O
$75 O
than O
I O
can O
count. O
Piemonte O
is O
a O
place O
to O
hunt, O
and O
Friuli, O
and O
the O
Valle O
d'Aosta, O
for O
starters. O
Though O
the O
restaurant O
is O
not O
exclusively O
for O
rich O
people, O
it O
is O
explicitly O
for O
occasions. O
Once, O
when O
a O
reservationist O
called O
to O
confirm O
and O
asked O
whether O
I O
was O
celebrating O
anything O
special, O
I O
said O
no, O
and O
was O
gently O
laughed O
at: O
"Just O
a O
normal O
Tuesday O
night O
at O
Del O
Posto?" O
There O
is O
little O
danger O
that O
anyone O
will O
mistake O
a O
night O
at O
Del O
Posto O
for O
normal. O
If O
nothing O
else, O
the O
napkins O
and O
towels O
are O
a O
tip-off. O
First, O
there O
is O
a O
small O
hot O
linen O
napkin O
scented O
with O
tomato-vine O
oil, O
to O
wipe O
the O
dust O
of O
the O
outside O
world O
from O
your O
hands. O
Then O
a O
large O
white O
linen O
napkin, O
followed O
just O
before O
dessert O
by O
a O
small O
yellow O
one. O
It O
is O
given O
to O
you, O
and O
the O
white O
one O
is O
taken O
away, O
by O
a O
server O
using O
a O
large O
fork O
and O
spoon O
as O
tongs. O
When O
you O
go O
to O
the O
restrooms, O
you O
may O
encounter O
an O
attendant O
who O
has O
just O
restocked O
the O
hand O
towels O
from O
a O
large O
basket O
she O
carries O
on O
one O
arm, O
like O
Heidi O
out O
gathering O
wildflowers O
for O
Grandfather. O
There O
are O
little O
ceremonies O
like O
this O
from O
start O
to O
finish; O
I O
don't O
know O
of O
any O
other O
restaurant O
that O
performs O
quite O
so O
many O
tasks O
whose O
only O
real O
purpose O
is O
to O
draw O
attention O
to O
themselves. O
And O
these O
things O
are O
rarely O
done O
with O
a O
smile; O
employees O
seem O
to O
have O
been O
directed O
to O
keep O
a O
respectful, O
formal O
distance O
as O
they O
carry O
out O
your O
requests O
and O
perform O
other O
services O
you'd O
never O
think O
of O
requesting. O
They O
rarely O
seem O
comfortable. O
Their O
solemnity O
is O
underlined O
by O
the O
sepulchral O
lighting O
at O
night, O
so O
gloomy O
it O
makes O
the O
crypt O
of O
Grant's O
tomb O
look O
like O
a O
tiki O
bar. O
A O
good O
deal O
of O
the O
service O
is O
the O
attentive, O
helpful O
kind O
that O
you O
really O
want, O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
it O
seems O
designed O
only O
to O
give O
customers O
the O
sensation O
of O
temporary O
power O
over O
other O
people. O
Some O
people O
may O
love O
this, O
but O
it O
reflects O
a O
serious O
lack O
of O
imagination O
when O
you O
think O
about O
the O
ways O
the O
service O
at O
Blue O
Hill O
at O
Stone O
Barns O
or O
Noma O
, O
for O
instance, O
is O
integrated O
into O
the O
experience. O
Is O
it O
stretching O
a O
point O
to O
ask O
if O
enshrining O
subservience, O
as O
Del O
Posto O
does, O
reflects O
the O
same O
twisted O
sense O
of O
priorities O
that O
allowed O
Mr. O
Batali O
to O
get O
away O
with O
abusing O
his O
own O
power O
for O
so O
long? O
(And O
is O
it O
a O
coincidence O
that O
far O
more O
men O
than O
women O
seem O
to O
work O
in O
the O
dining O
room, O
particularly O
in O
the O
upper O
ranks?) O
Now O
that O
Ms. O
Rodriguez O
owns O
a O
piece O
of O
the O
restaurant, O
perhaps O
she O
can O
lead O
a O
reconsideration O
of O
priorities O
in O
the O
front O
of O
the O
house, O
and O
find O
a O
tone O
that O
more O
closely O
matches O
her O
philosophy O
in O
the O
back. O
She O
shouldn't O
have O
to O
clean O
up O
the O
messes O
men O
made. O
But O
having O
worked O
her O
way O
to O
the O
top O
of O
a O
restaurant O
that O
has O
always O
aspired O
to O
provide O
luxury, O
she O
has O
a O
chance O
to O
decide O
what, O
in O
New O
York O
in O
2019, O
that O
word O
might O
mean. O

Hanon, B-EST
a O
new O
udon B-FOOD
shop I-FOOD
in O
Williamsburg, B-LOC
Brooklyn, I-LOC
was O
produced O
by O
the O
union O
of O
a O
Tokyo B-LOC
video-production O
company O
and O
a O
Japanese O
manufacturer O
of O
unusually O
thin O
condoms. O
The O
condoms O
became O
the O
subject O
of O
a O
series O
of O
advertisements O
on O
which O
the O
production O
company O
worked; O
in O
one O
of O
them, O
called O
"Acts O
of O
Love," O
dancers O
in O
London B-LOC
re-enact, O
with O
surprising O
grace O
and O
dignity, O
the O
mating O
rituals O
of O
blue-footed O
boobies, O
fiddler O
crabs O
and O
other O
animals. O
Well, O
kids, O
when O
two O
companies O
like O
each O
other O
very O
much, O
sometimes O
they O
decide O
to O
create O
a O
new O
company O
together. O
That O
is O
what O
happened O
with O
the O
production O
firm O
and O
the O
prophylactics O
people O
when, O
for O
reasons O
that O
are O
perhaps O
best O
not O
to O
question, O
they O
hit O
upon O
the O
idea O
of O
expanding O
their O
product O
line O
from O
condoms O
into O
noodles. B-FOOD
The O
restaurant O
lies O
across O
Union B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
from O
Kellogg's B-EST
Diner. I-EST
Its O
door O
is O
marked O
during O
business O
hours O
by O
the O
fluttering O
white O
noren O
curtains. O
It O
is O
the O
second O
Hanon B-EST
location. O
The O
first O
is O
about O
6,700 O
miles O
away, O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Kamakura, B-LOC
which O
lies O
south O
of O
Tokyo B-LOC
and O
is O
known O
for O
soba, B-FOOD
not O
udon. B-FOOD
This O
gave O
Hanon B-EST
the O
advantage O
of O
not O
competing O
against O
any O
of O
Japan's B-LOC
established O
udon B-FOOD
styles, O
leaving O
its O
chef, O
Takahiro O
Yanagisawa, O
free O
to O
come O
up O
with O
his O
own. O
Mr. O
Yanagisawa, O
who O
had O
spent O
25 O
years O
making O
sushi B-FOOD
before I-FOOD
turning O
to O
noodles, B-FOOD
focused O
his O
innovative O
urges O
on O
the O
dough. B-FOOD
He O
began O
by O
adding O
wheat O
germ O
and O
bran O
to O
the O
white O
flour O
that O
in O
udon B-FOOD
is O
typically O
used O
alone. O
The O
resulting O
noodle B-FOOD
is O
called O
zenryufun B-DISH
or O
whole O
wheat. O
The O
bran O
and O
germ O
are O
Mr. O
Yanagisawa's O
attempts O
to O
make O
a O
more O
healthful O
udon, B-FOOD
but O
they O
also O
add O
flavor, O
a O
mottled O
color O
and O
a O
slightly O
rough O
texture O
that O
holds O
on O
to O
the O
dashi-based B-FOOD
broth. I-FOOD
This O
dough O
is O
also O
made O
into O
a O
green O
noodle, B-FOOD
called O
sasauchi, O
by O
mixing O
in O
powdered O
barley O
shoots O
and O
leaves O
of O
kuma-zasa, O
a O
bamboo O
variety O
that O
pandas O
dote O
on O
. O
To O
the O
human O
palate, O
or O
at O
least O
this O
human's O
palate, O
sasa O
tastes O
something O
like O
green O
tea. O
Both O
the O
speckled O
zenryufun O
and O
the O
green O
sasauchi O
are O
flat O
noodles, O
resembling O
fettuccine O
that O
has O
been O
working O
out. O
Avoiding O
extremes, O
they O
are O
moderately O
chewy O
and O
reasonably O
springy. O
Either O
flavor, O
or O
both, O
can O
be O
ordered O
cold O
and O
spread O
on O
a O
bamboo O
mat O
for O
dunking O
into O
a O
sauce, O
either O
a O
peanut-buttery O
sesame O
sauce O
or O
the O
traditional O
dashi-based O
dipping O
sauce. O
For O
larger O
or O
more O
curious O
appetites, O
these O
dipping O
noodles, O
called O
seiro O
udon, O
can O
be O
dangled O
into O
a O
hot O
duck O
soup O
in O
which O
a O
few O
hunks O
of O
well-boiled O
duck O
meat O
swim. O
The O
cold O
noodles O
can O
also O
be O
accessorized O
with O
whipped O
mountain O
yam O
or O
tempura O
or O
both. O
If O
you O
had O
stumbled O
into O
Hanon O
under O
the O
impression O
that O
it O
was O
another O
generic O
Williamsburg O
noodle O
mill, O
the O
tempura O
would O
set O
you O
straight. O
The O
crust O
is O
engineered O
for O
udon, O
thick O
and O
substantial O
enough O
that O
it O
will O
not O
dissolve O
and O
float O
away O
in O
the O
soup, O
yet O
somehow O
not O
oily O
or O
clunky. O
The O
tempura O
is O
served O
with O
sea O
salt, O
which O
will O
not O
only O
season O
the O
fried O
blowfish O
tails, O
shrimp, O
mushroom O
and O
vegetables, O
but O
will O
also O
do O
very O
good O
things O
to O
any O
noodles O
it O
happens O
to O
meet. O
With O
the O
hot O
soups, O
there O
is O
no O
choice O
of O
noodles. O
All O
are O
made O
with O
zenryufun. O
The O
plain O
broth, O
a O
dashi O
augmented O
by O
white O
soy O
sauce, O
is O
not O
so O
salty O
or O
concentrated O
that O
I O
didn't O
want O
to O
drink O
it O
all. O
It O
also O
performs O
well O
made O
into O
a O
thick-but-not-sludgy O
curry O
soup O
with O
thin O
pink O
slices O
of O
washugyu O
beef; O
a O
shaggy, O
mossy, O
salty-sour O
mass O
of O
ume O
and O
kombu; O
and O
a O
soup O
of O
shaved O
beef O
and O
onions O
that O
tastes O
like O
a O
deeper, O
stronger O
version O
of O
French O
dip O
jus O
and O
is O
blitzed O
by O
a O
little O
grated O
yuzu O
peel O
at O
the O
end. O
A O
few O
near-relatives O
of O
udon O
make O
it O
to O
the O
menu O
as O
well. O
The O
beef-and-onion O
combination O
can O
also O
be O
had O
over O
rice. O
Creamy, O
slightly O
spicy O
cod O
roe O
is O
tossed O
with O
zenryufun O
for O
an O
excellent O
mentaiko O
pasta O
that, O
for O
once, O
relies O
on O
the O
roe O
rather O
than O
Kewpie O
mayonnaise O
to O
make O
an O
impression. O
The O
eventual O
plan O
is O
to O
sell O
both O
colors O
of O
noodle O
to O
grocery O
stores O
and O
other O
restaurants O
-- O
to O
become, O
in O
essence, O
the O
Sun O
Noodle O
of O
the O
udonisphere. O
This O
would O
be O
a O
gain O
for O
New O
York, O
but O
for O
the O
moment O
Hanon's O
udon O
is O
found O
only O
at O
Hanon, O
where O
the O
noodles O
are O
made O
fresh O
each O
day. O
Any O
plan O
for O
world O
domination O
is O
not O
hinted O
at O
on O
the O
restaurant's O
Facebook O
page O
, O
which O
seems O
to O
be O
its O
home O
base O
online, O
though O
nobody O
has O
bothered O
to O
post O
a O
menu O
there O
yet. O
Nor O
does O
the O
dining O
room O
suggest O
a O
budding O
global O
chain. O
Atmospheric O
and O
presumably O
expensive O
prints O
by O
the O
photographers O
Takashi O
Homma O
and O
Nobuyoshi O
Araki O
hang O
over O
the O
tables, O
and O
a O
signed O
Cy O
Twombly O
lithograph O
has O
been O
placed O
by O
the O
door O
to O
the O
backyard. O
The O
music O
-- O
torch O
songs, O
jazz O
piano O
-- O
seems O
to O
be O
coming O
from O
a O
radio O
tuned O
to O
another O
decade. O
A O
lot O
of O
this O
cocktail O
music O
will O
make O
more O
sense O
once O
the O
liquor O
license O
comes O
through. O
Hanon O
is O
getting O
set O
to O
offer O
sake, O
shochu O
and O
wines O
chosen O
by O
Jorge O
Riera, O
who O
built O
the O
list O
at O
Frenchette O
and O
has O
turned O
countless O
New O
Yorkers O
on O
to O
the O
fizzy, O
fuzzy O
and O
furry O
delights O
of O
natural O
wines. O
The O
idea O
of O
Hanon O
is O
not O
to O
slurp O
and O
slide O
out, O
but O
to O
stay O
for O
a O
meal: O
a O
chilled O
French O
red O
with O
the O
fried O
chicken O
and O
Japanese O
omelet, O
maybe, O
and O
something O
a O
bit O
brawnier O
with O
curry O
soup. O
Dessert O
could O
be O
a O
tofu O
blancmange, O
smooth O
and O
white O
and O
somewhat O
sweet, O
but O
there O
is O
more O
satisfaction O
in O
the O
grainy, O
earthy O
bricks O
of O
red O
bean O
paste. O
The O
meal O
might O
end O
with O
tea, O
to O
which O
the O
restaurant O
takes O
the O
same O
unhurried O
approach O
it O
applies O
to O
everything O
else. O
The O
iced O
oolong O
is O
slowly O
cold-brewed; O
a O
bamboo O
whisk O
and O
ceramic O
chawan O
are O
kept O
on O
the O
dining O
counter O
for O
painstakingly O
whipping O
up O
bowls O
of O
matcha; O
an O
appliance O
imported O
from O
Taiwan O
will O
transform O
freshly O
steeped O
hojicha O
and O
ice O
into O
a O
tan O
froth, O
a O
process O
that O
takes O
about O
five O
minutes. O
This O
foam O
tea O
is O
dairy-free, O
unlike O
Taiwan's O
infamous O
cheese O
tea. O
It O
is O
served O
in O
a O
wine O
glass, O
and O
the O
experience O
of O
drinking O
it O
is O
similar O
to O
tackling O
a O
pint O
of O
Guinness O
before O
the O
head O
has O
settled O
down. O

You O
will O

Kawi B-EST

the O
latest O
Momofuku B-EST
restaurant, O
on O
the O
fifth O
floor O
of O
20 B-LOC
Hudson I-LOC
Yards, I-LOC
assuming O
you O

determined O
and O
swallow O
back O
the O
urge O
to O
run O
for O
the O
exits O
that O
may O
grip O
you O
as O
you O
negotiate O
escalators O
that O
don't O
connect O
to O
one O
another, O
elevators O
that O
are O
hidden O
out O
of O
sight O
like O
somebody's O
crazy O

and O
shiny O
retail O

that O
seem O
to O
be O
trying O
to O
provoke O
a O
class O
war. O
By O
the O
time O
people O
reach O
Kawi B-EST
they O
tend O
to O
look O
rattled; O
New O

who O
will O
easily O
weave O
their O
way O
around O
broken O
sidewalks, O
potholes, O
garbage O
piles O
and O
al O
fresco O
rat O
conventions O
come O
undone O
when O
faced O
with O
the O
interior O
of O
a O
shopping O
mall. O
Kawi, B-EST
now O
two O
months O
old, O
can O
be O
disorienting O
in O
its O
own O
way, O
but O
at O
least O
you O
can O
have O
a O
seat O
and O
a O
drink O
while O
you O
get O
your O
bearings. O
Space O
there O
is O
used, O
or O
not O
used, O
the O
way O
it O
is O
in O
Las B-LOC
Vegas. I-LOC
There's O
a O
very O
long O
bar O
behind O
a O
line O
of O
black, O
geometric O
bar O
stools O
receding O
toward O
the O
vanishing O

low O

taller, O
square O
wood O

round O

a O
row O
of O
chairs O
facing O
a O
kitchen O
counter. O
Between O
all O
this O
furniture O
are O
aisles O
wide O
enough O
for O
a O
Zamboni. O
All O
those O
seats O
have O
backs, O
too. O
Kawi B-EST
is O
loaded O
with O
the O
comforts O
and O
accommodations O
that O
critics, O
including O
me, O
were O
begging O
Mr. O
Chang O
to O
pay O
more O
attention O
to O
as O
recently O
as O
the O
opening O
of O
Nishi B-EST
three O
years O
ago. O
Has O
anybody O
complained O
before O
that O
a O
David O
Chang O
restaurant O
was O
too O
quiet? O
They're O
saying O
it O
about O
Kawi. B-EST
If O
there O
is O
anybody O
left O
who O
still O
thinks O
of O
Mr. O
Chang O
as O
a O
downtown O
punk, O
Kawi B-EST
will O
clear O
up O
that O
misconception. O
The O
early O
Momofuku B-EST
restaurants O
were O
skateboards; O
Kawi B-EST
is I-EST
a O
minivan O
with O
sliding O
doors, O
armrests, O
cupholders O
and O
Don O
Henley O
on O
the O
stereo. O
The O
ride O
may O
not O
be O
as O
fast, O
but O
it's O
a O
lot O
smoother. O
Kawi B-EST
is O
also O
the O
first O
Momofuku B-EST
restaurant O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
to O
address O
Korean B-CUISINE
cuisine O
head O
on O
and O
at O
length. O
Majordomo B-EST
, O
which O
opened O
in O
Los B-LOC
Angeles I-LOC
last O
year, O
is O
at O
least O
half O
Korean, B-CUISINE
but O
the O
menu O
is O
loaded O
up O
with O
other O
stuff, O
a O
lot O
of O
which O
is O
big O
and O
showy O
and O
seemingly O
designed O
to O
dazzle O
the O
high O
rollers. O
It O
can O
be O
hard O
to O
remember O
you're O
eating O
galbi-jjim B-DISH
after O
a O
server O
buries O
it O
beneath O
a O
tableside O
avalanche O
of O
shaved O
raclette. O
Eunjo O
Park, O
Kawi's O
executive O
chef, O
avoids O
this O
type O
of O
distraction. O
This O
is O
lucky, O
because O
she O
makes O
food O
that O
you O
want O
to O
concentrate O
on. O
Before O
joining O
the O
Momofuku O
stable, O
she O
worked O
in O
the O
formal O
and O
highly O
fastidious O
kitchens O
of O
Daniel O
, O
Le O
Bec-Fin O
and O
Per O
Se O
. O
She O
later O
returned O
to O
South O
Korea, O
where O
she O
had O
lived O
until O
she O
was O
12, O
for O
advanced O
studies O
at O
the O
Seoul O
restaurant O
Gaon O
and O
at O
the O
kitchen O
of O
the O
Chunjinam O
hermitage, O
presided O
over O
by O
Jeong O
Kwan O
, O
certainly O
the O
most O
celebrated O
cooking O
Zen O
nun O
in O
her O
country. O
A O
strong O
interest O
in O
tradition O
marks O
Ms. O
Park's O
food O
at O
Kawi. O
Her O
dishes O
are O
set O
apart O
from O
versions O
you O
may O
have O
had O
before O
by O
the O
exactitude O
of O
the O
technique O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
ingredients. O
One O
section O
of O
her O
menu O
is O
turned O
over O
to O
kimbap, O
those O
wide, O
nori-wrapped O
sushi O
rolls O
often O
spotted O
at O
salad O
bars, O
languishing O
under O
plastic O
wrap. O
Most O
kimbap O
is O
designed O
to O
be O
portable, O
filling O
and O
inexpensive. O
Ms. O
Park's O
kimbap, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
is O
built O
for O
pleasure. O
She O
has O
a O
pickled O
vegetable O
kimbap O
on O
the O
lunch O
menu O
that O
is O
truly O
exciting; O
you O
are O
meant O
to O
dip O
it O
in O
a O
dark O
liquid O
that O
tastes O
a O
bit O
like O
soy O
sauce O
but O
is O
made O
with O
beets. O
The O
dinner O
menu O
brings O
kimbap O
filled O
with O
chives, O
pickled O
daikon, O
citrus O
jelly O
and O
a O
buttery O
pink O
vein O
of O
foie O
gras O
terrine. O
Has O
this O
really O
never O
been O
done O
before, O
you O
wonder O
as O
you O
eat O
it, O
and O
if O
not, O
why O
not? O
Among O
the O
other O
gussied-up O
raw O
fish O
that O
you O
expect O
in O
Momofukuland, O
like O
a O
refreshing O
if O
somewhat O
staid O
madai O
tartare, O
are O
some O
dime-size O
clams O
in O
chile O
sauce O
and O
an O
elegant, O
inspired O
interpretation O
of O
gejang. O
Blue O
crab O
legs O
and O
claw O
are O
cracked O
and O
given O
a O
three-day O
soak O
in O
soy O
sauce, O
among O
other O
things, O
which O
gives O
them O
an O
impressive O
amount O
of O
flavor. O
Then, O
in O
case O
you O
haven't O
noticed O
that O
you're O
dealing O
with O
a O
real O
chef, O
Ms. O
Park O
stirs O
the O
crab's O
roe O
with O
creamy O
rice O
and O
spoons O
this O
Korean O
risotto O
into O
the O
open O
belly O
of O
the O
shell. O
At O
moments O
like O
this, O
or O
in O
the O
hwedupbap O
filled O
with O
raw O
fish O
as O
strikingly O
good O
as O
any O
you'll O
find O
in O
a O
$200 O
omakase, O
or O
in O
the O
doenjang O
jjigae, O
a O
potful O
of O
braised O
fermented O
bean O
paste O
with O
pork O
belly O
that O
appears O
on O
the O
menu O
as O
"yesterday's O
stinky O
soybean O
stew" O
and O
manages O
to O
be O
homespun O
and O
polished O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
it's O
possible O
to O
see O
Kawi O
as O
Ms. O
Park's O
response O
to O
Atomix O
. O
It's O
as O
if O
she O
had O
looked O
at O
Junghyun O
Park's O
dazzlingly O
complex O
compositions O
at O
his O
year-old O
modern O
Korean O
restaurant O
and O
decided O
that O
she O
could O
cook O
in O
a O
style O
that O
was O
every O
bit O
as O
modern O
and O
painstaking, O
but O
that O
instead O
of O
turning O
traditional O
dishes O
into O
tasting-menu O
food O
she O
would O
keep O
the O
old O
forms O
and O
innovate O
inside O
them. O
With O
her O
tidy, O
refined, O
French-influenced O
neo-traditionalism, O
Ms. O
Park O
could O
become O
something O
like O
the O
Alain O
Ducasse O
of O
Korean O
cooking. O
It's O
not O
obvious, O
though, O
that O
Kawi O
needs O
an O
Alain O
Ducasse. O
Certain O
appetizers O
seem O
to O
belong O
on O
another O
planet, O
more O
beautiful O
and O
gentle O
than O
ours, O
such O
as O
the O
soft O
tofu O
with O
soy O
syrup O
that, O
sitting O
under O
a O
shattering O
thin O
crust O
of O
caramelized O
sugar, O
is O
like O
a O
savory O
crème O
brûlée O
by O
way O
of O
Seoul. O
And O
there O
are O
others, O
such O
as O
the O
sticks O
of O
fried O
cod O
that O
a O
server O
pointlessly O
snips O
in O
half O
with O
scissors O
and O
then O
spritzes O
with O
atomized O
yuzu O
juice, O
that O
are O
right O
at O
home O
at O
Hudson O
Yards. O
The O
presentation O
seemed O
forced. O
That O
could O
also O
describe O
the O
boiled O
chicken O
dish, O
one O
of O
the O
menu's O
showiest O
items O
and, O
at O
$64, O
one O
of O
its O
most O
expensive. O
The O
whole O
bird O
is O
steamed, O
then O
the O
breast O
is O
sliced O
and O
served O
plain O
while O
the O
dark O
meat O
is O
fried O
and O
coated O
with O
spices. O
Neither O
is O
spectacular O
on O
its O
own, O
and O
the O
combination O
is O
bizarre. O
More O
successful O
versions O
of O
elaborate, O
oversize, O
multicomponent O
dishes O
are O
proven O
moneymakers O
elsewhere O
in O
the O
Momofuku O
republic. O
But O
arm-waving O
platters O
like O
that O
seem O
out O
of O
place O
at O
Kawi, O
which O
is O
the O
least O
Momofukian O
of O
the O
Momofukus. O
The O
most O
uncharacteristic O
thing O
of O
all O
is O
that O
the O
dining O
room O
has O
never O
been O
operating O
at O
anything O
close O
to O
capacity, O
at O
least O
when O
I've O
been O
there. O
Maybe O
tables O
are O
being O
kept O
off O
the O
reservation O
books O
to O
give O
the O
cooks O
time O
to O
learn O
where O
the O
spice O
cabinet O
is. O
Or O
maybe O
the O
fans O
who O
are O
so O
devoted O
to O
Mr. O
Chang's O
downtown O
spots O
are O
still O
trying O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
escalators. O

One O
of O
the O
ways O
people O
pretend O
to O
be O
sophisticated O
about O
restaurants O
these O
days O
is O
by O
claiming O
that O
the O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
dining O
scene O
has O
lost O
its O
edge. O
The O
sheer O
number O
of O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
-- O
about O
27,000, O
according O
to O
the O
health O
inspectors O
-- O
makes O
the O
argument O
absurd. O
How O
many O
of O
them O
are O
slipping? O
All O
of O
them? O
Just O
the O
first O
20,000 O
or O
so? O
In O
reality, O
people O
who O
gripe O
about O
the O
state O
of O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
restaurants I-LOC
are O
usually O
talking O
about O
a O
sliver O
of O
a O
slice O
of O
a O
fraction, O
probably O
around O
50 O
places O
whose O
names O
are O
in O
steady O
circulation, O
with O
the O
newest O
weighing O
most O
heavily O
in O
the O
results. O
The O
number O
of O
really O
good O
ones O
is O
higher O
than O
anyone O
can O
count. O
Places O
that O
other O
cities O
would O
brag O
about O
get O
lost O
in O
the O
crowd O
here. O
The O
chef O
Günther O
Seeger, O
for O
instance, O
was O
a O
national O
star O
when O
he O
cooked O
in O
Atlanta. B-LOC
The O
tasting-menu O
restaurant O
he O
opened O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
Village I-LOC
three O
years O
ago O
should O
have O
been O
a O
major O
destination, O
especially O
after O
he O
dropped O
the O
prices. O
Mr. O
Seeger O
can O
make O
ingredients O
bend O
to O
his O
will O
almost O
without O
touching O
them. O
His O
cooking O
outshone O
that O
of O
some O
of O
the O
city's O
more O
famous O
chefs, O
who O
whip O
their O
ingredients O
harder O
with O
far O
less O
payoff. O
Yet O
he O
struggled O
to O
put O
Günther B-EST
Seeger I-EST
NY I-EST
on O
the O
map. O
I O
reviewed O
it, O
but O
some O
other O
critics O
didn't, O
and O
by O
the O
time O
it O
closed, O
last O
month, O
Chris O
Crowley O
of O
Grub B-EST
Street I-EST
wrote I-EST
, O
"it O
wasn't O
a O
restaurant O
you O
heard O
a O
lot O
of O
food O
geeks O
talk O
about." O
Mr. O
Seeger O
complained O
to O
one O
acquaintance O
that O
he O
couldn't O
even O
get O
on O
a O
list O
of O
New B-LOC
York's I-LOC
100 O
best O
restaurants. O
Of O
course, O
good O
restaurants O
fail O
everywhere, O
but O
it's O
hard O
to O
imagine O
Mr. O
Seeger O
vanishing O
into O
the O
crowd O
in O
San B-LOC
Francisco, I-LOC
Chicago B-LOC
or O
Los B-LOC
Angeles. I-LOC
Considered O
and O
rejected, O
maybe. O
But O
overlooked? O
Not O
likely. O
I'm O
not O
sure O
that O
any O
words O
of O
mine O
could O
have O
persuaded O
the O
city O
to O
cuddle O
up O
to O
Mr. O
Seeger, O
who O
isn't O
particularly O
cuddly. O
But O
I O
wish O
I'd O
found O
ways O
to O
remind O
New O
Yorkers O
that O
his O
breathtakingly O
pure O
cooking O
was O
there O
to O
be O
enjoyed O
while O
that O
was O
still O
true. O
Which O
brings O
us, O
by O
a O
circuitous O
and O
not O
particularly O
well-paved O
route, O
to O
Anthony O
Mangieri O
of O
Una B-EST
Pizza I-EST
Napoletana I-EST
. O
Using O
naturally O
leavened O
dough B-FOOD
and O
a O
short O
shopping O
list O
of O
ingredients, O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
makes O
what O
is O
unmistakably O
the O
finest O
sit-down O
pizza O
in O
the O
five O
boroughs. O
(I O
doubt O
he O
has O
any O
rivals O
in O
the O
stand-up O
joints, O
either, O
but O
slice O
pizza O
is O
a O
different O
game.) O
Two O
years O
ago, O
I O
posited O
that O
Razza, O
a O
pizzeria O
in O
Jersey O
City, O
made O
"the O
best O
pizza O
in O
New O
York." O
I O
don't O
regret O
writing O
that, O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
was O
not O
cooking O
in O
the O
city O
at O
the O
time O
and O
that O
Razza's O
chef, O
Dan O
Richer, O
has O
said O
that O
he O
began O
taking O
pizza O
seriously O
only O
after O
he O
met O
Mr. O
Mangieri. O
Una O
Pizza O
Napoletana O
saw O
a O
rush O
of O
curious O
pie-eaters O
after O
it O
opened O
on O
Orchard O
Street O
a O
little O
more O
than O
a O
year O
ago. O
But O
the O
last O
few O
times O
I've O
gone, O
there O
were O
too O
many O
unclaimed O
chairs O
and O
bar O
stools. O
When O
Anthony O
Mangieri O
is O
making O
pizza, O
the O
right O
number O
of O
empty O
seats O
is O
zero, O
as O
any O
New O
Yorker O
who O
waited O
in O
line O
at O
the O
old O
Una O
Pizza O
Napoletana, O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
from O
2004 O
to O
2009, O
could O
tell O
you. O
Press O
interest O
in O
the O
new O
place O
has O
died O
down, O
too. O
So O
when O
I O
heard O
a O
rumor O
that O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
was O
thinking O
of O
leaving O
the O
city O
and O
taking O
his O
pizza O
with O
him, O
I O
was O
unnerved, O
to O
put O
it O
mildly. O
Asked O
about O
it, O
he O
told O
me O
he O
was O
considering O
it O
but O
hadn't O
made O
up O
his O
mind. O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
has O
left O
New O
York O
before, O
and O
I O
didn't O
like O
it O
then, O
either. O
This O
time, O
I O
wasn't O
going O
to O
let O
him O
get O
away O
without O
a O
fight. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
my O
review O
of O
Una O
Pizza O
Napoletana O
last O
year O
was O
decidedly O
mixed. O
It O
is O
also O
true, O
though, O
that O
almost O
every O
criticism O
I O
made O
has O
been O
addressed. O
It O
has O
gone O
from O
one O
of O
the O
most O
confounding O
pizzerias O
in O
the O
city O
to O
one O
of O
the O
most O
enjoyable. O
The O
problem O
with O
Una O
Pizza O
a O
year O
ago O
was O
that O
it O
was O
trying O
to O
be O
two O
things O
at O
once. O
It O
was, O
of O
course, O
a O
Neapolitan O
pizzeria, O
serving O
classic, O
unadorned O
pies O
baked O
for O
about O
two O
minutes O
inside O
a O
wood-burning O
oven O
shaped O
like O
an O
igloo. O
But O
it O
was O
also O
a O
cutting-edge O
Lower O
East O
Side O
experiment. O
At O
the O
instigation O
of O
Mr. O
Mangieri's O
partners, O
the O
chefs O
Fabian O
von O
Hauske O
Valtierra O
and O
Jeremiah O
Stone, O
the O
kitchen O
brought O
forth O
appetizers O
that O
had O
rarely O
if O
ever O
been O
asked O
to O
live O
under O
one O
roof O
with O
a O
pizza. O
There O
was O
a O
jellylike O
mass O
of O
raw O
lobster O
inside O
a O
ring O
of O
chickpeas, O
and O
a O
rust-colored O
puddle O
of O
'nduja O
under O
raw O
turnips O
and O
nasturtium O
leaves. O
The O
wine O
list O
was O
virtually O
a O
treatise O
on O
natural O
wines, O
a O
long O
document O
full O
of O
the O
names O
of O
eccentric O
producers O
and O
obscure O
European O
villages. O
In O
another O
restaurant, O
all O
this O
would O
have O
been O
the O
departure O
point O
for O
some O
adventurous O
evenings. O
But O
in O
a O
pizzeria O
it O
led O
to O
some O
peculiar O
pairings, O
made O
the O
check O
a O
bit O
higher O
than O
you O
wanted O
and O
resulted O
in O
long O
waits O
before O
you O
were O
finally O
allowed O
to O
eat O
the O
delicious O
pizza O
you'd O
come O
for. O
Over O
the O
past O
year, O
Mr. O
von O
Hauske O
and O
Mr. O
Stone O
have O
stepped O
aside, O
letting O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
call O
the O
shots. O
The O
wines O
on O
offer O
now O
number O
about O
15. O
They O
are O
still O
a O
likably O
eccentric O
lot, O
but O
picking O
one O
doesn't O
feel O
like O
studying O
for O
a O
master O
sommelier O
exam. O
The O
appetizers O
are O
simpler O
and O
less O
expensive: O
a O
plate O
of O
marinated O
white O
anchovies, O
a O
dish O
of O
warm O
Italian O
olives O
or O
a O
bowl O
of O
Little O
Gem O
lettuce O
with O
sunflower O
seeds O
in O
a O
Caesarish O
dressing. O
I O
do O
miss O
the O
tiramisù O
from O
the O
opening O
menu, O
but O
the O
new O
cannoli O
filled O
with O
ricotta O
-- O
a O
blend O
of O
domestic O
cow's O
milk O
and O
Italian O
sheep's O
milk O
-- O
are O
nearly O
as O
good. O
It's O
common O
for O
a O
new O
restaurant O
to O
trim O
its O
sails, O
but O
this O
one O
has O
trimmed O
its O
prices, O
too. O
In O
the O
beginning O
the O
five O
regular O
pizzas O
were O
all O
$25; O
now O
they O
range O
from O
$19 O
to O
$25, O
and O
the O
two O
extra-complicated O
Friday O
and O
Saturday O
pizzas O
are O
priced O
at O
$26. O
I O
liked O
Mr. O
Mangieri's O
pies O
in O
the O
East O
Village, O
I O
liked O
them O
more O
when O
he O
came O
back O
to O
town, O
and O
it's O
possible, O
just O
possible, O
that O
they've O
improved O
over O
the O
past O
year. O
He O
is, O
like O
Mr. O
Seeger, O
a O
minimalist. O
He O
lets O
you O
notice O
each O
ingredient: O
the O
little O
ping O
of O
sourness O
in O
the O
Campanian O
buffalo O
mozzarella, O
for O
instance. O
Or O
the O
unruly, O
windswept-hillside O
aroma O
of O
dried O
Sicilian O
oregano. O
The O
precise O
crunch O
of O
each O
unrefined O
Trapani O
sea-salt O
crystal O
waiting O
to O
dissolve. O
The O
crust O
is O
so O
tender O
it O
barely O
fights O
fork, O
knife O
or O
teeth. O
Some O
diners O
will O
wish O
it O
put O
up O
more O
crackly O
resistance. O
You O
inhale O
it O
at O
least O
as O
much O
as O
you O
eat O
it. O
When O
you O
have O
finished, O
some O
of O
the O
most O
popular O
pizzas O
in O
town O
will O
seem O
tough, O
leathery, O
overworked. O
Even O
if O
this O
is O
not O
the O
style O
you O
crave, O
you'll O
know O
that O
it's O
the O
work O
of O
a O
baker O
who O
has O
spent O
years O
listening O
to O
the O
dough. O
There O
is O
a O
place O
for O
people O
who O
are O
as O
obsessed O
with O
pizza O
as O
Mr. O
Mangieri, O
and O
the O
place O
is O
New O
York O
City. O

Good O
restaurants O
don't O
rain O
down O
from O
nowhere, O
but O
Crown B-EST
Shy I-EST
came O
close. O
No O
doubt O
it O
went O
through O
the O
same O
birth O
pangs O
as O
all O
the O
others. O
As O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell, O
though, O
it O
simply O
materialized O
one O
morning O
this O
March O
at O
70 B-LOC
Pine I-LOC
Street, I-LOC
and O
was O
open O
for O
business O
that O
afternoon O
by O
the O
time O
the O
financial B-LOC
district's I-LOC
elevators O
began O
disgorging O
traders, O
bankers O
and O
analysts O
in O
search O
of O
5-o'clock O
refreshment. O
One O
reason O
it O
seems O
to O
have O
crept O
up O
on O
the O
city O
is O
that O
it's O
a O
large, O
well-capitalized, O
big-time O
restaurant O
of O
the O
kind O
that O
only O
established O
groups O
seem O
able O
to O
get O
off O
the O
ground O
these O
days. O
Yet O
Crown B-EST
Shy I-EST
doesn't O
come O
from O
Danny O
Meyer, O
Andrew O
Carmellini O
or O
any O
of O
the O
other O
usual O
suspects. O
Its O
two O
main O
players O
were O
recruited O
after O
talks O
among O
April O
Bloomfield, O
Ken O
Friedman O
and O
the O
building's O
developer O
fell O
apart O
in O
2016, O
before O
accusations O
of O
sexual O
harassment O
engulfed O
Mr. O

Crown B-EST
Shy's I-EST

hiring, O
the O
drumbeat O
of O
publicity O
was O
more O
muted O
than O
it O
might O
have O
been O
if O
marquee O
names O
had O
led O
the O
project. O
Then O
there O
is O
Crown B-EST
Shy's I-EST
location, O
a O
sprawling, O
soaring, O
street-level O
space O
that, O
as O
far O
as O
anyone O
recalls, O
has O
never O
held O
a O
restaurant O
before. O
Many O
New O
Yorkers O
have O
seen O
the O
1932 O
building's O
distinctive, O
hulking, O
pyramidal O
silhouette O
on O
the O
skyline, O
but O
until O
recently, O
when O
the O
offices O
on O
its O
67 O
stories O
were O
repurposed O
as O
expensive O
apartments O
and O
hotel O
rooms, O
not O
many O
had O
encountered O
the O
frenzied O
exuberance O
of O
the O
lobby, O
which O
makes O
use O
of O
polished O
marble O
in O
at O
least O
five O
contrasting O
colors. O
It O
looks O
like O
something O
Bernini O
would O
have O
designed O
if O
he'd O
lived O
to O
see O
the O
Jazz O
Age. O
Depending O
on O
which O
entrance O
you O
use O
-- O
the O
revolving O
doors O
are O
crowned O
with O
aluminum O
reliefs O
of O
Art O
Deco O
flowers O
being O
pollinated O
by O
elongated O
stylized O
butterflies O
-- O
you O
may O
want O
to O
allow O
an O
extra O
five O
or O
10 O
minutes O
to O
take O
it O
all O
in O
before O
you O
eat. O
Above O
all, O
it's O
the O
extent O
to O
which O
Crown B-EST
Shy I-EST
already O
has O
its O
act O
together O
that O
makes O
you O
ask: O
Where O
did O
this O
place O
come O
from? O
The O
whole O
operation O
radiates O
confidence O
from O
start O
to O
finish. O
The O
finish O
brings O
real O
desserts O
from O
a O
real O
pastry O
chef, O
Renata O
Ameni. O
She O
comes O
to O
Crown O
Shy O
fresh O
from O
Manresa, B-EST
in O
Los B-LOC
Gatos, I-LOC
Calif I-LOC
., I-LOC
and O
before O
that, O
she O
put O
in O
half O
a O
decade O
at O
Eleven B-EST
Madison I-EST
Park I-EST
. O
Her O
desserts O
at O
Crown B-EST
Shy I-EST
look O
uncomplicated, O
and O
you O
don't O
realize O
how O
intelligently O
they've O
been O
put O
together O
until O
you O
start O
to O
eat O
one. O
There's O
a O
milky-white O
yogurt B-DISH
cheesecake I-DISH
under O
tender O
spring O
strawberries, B-FOOD
with O
smooth O
strawberry B-FOOD
sorbet I-FOOD
in O
the O
center O
and O
a O
pistachio B-FOOD
crumble I-FOOD
sprinkled O
over O
that. O
Her O
chocolate B-DISH
tart I-DISH
gives O
her O
a O
chance O
to O
show O
off O
about O
half O
a O
dozen O
different O
effects O
she O
can O
work O
with O
chocolate, B-FOOD
starting O
with O
a O
crunchy, O
crumbly, O
almost O
salty O
chocolate B-FOOD
crust, I-FOOD
moving O
on O
to O
a O
soft, O
soufflé-like O
filling O
and O
ending O
with O
curls O
of O
dark B-FOOD
chocolate. I-FOOD
Ms. O
Ameni's O
side O
of O
the O
kitchen O
is O
also O
responsible O
for O
the O
savory B-DISH
churros I-DISH
filled I-DISH
with I-DISH
Gruyère I-DISH
sauce I-DISH
-- O
the O
menu O
calls O
them O
fritters, B-DISH
they O
taste O
like O
gougères B-FOOD
and O
the O
texture O
is O
something O
else O
entirely. O
Also O
her O
work: O
the O
miniature O
loaf O
of O
pull-apart B-DISH
bread I-DISH
that O
appears O
after O
you O
order. O
With O
dried B-FOOD
olives I-FOOD
on O
top O
and O
olive B-FOOD
tapenade I-FOOD
between O
every O
skinny O
slice, O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
memorable O
parts O
of O
the O
meal. O
Even O
the O
obligatory O
scoops O
of O
ice B-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
that O
restaurants O
seem O
required O
to O
offer O
aren't O
allowed O
to O
leave O
her O
pastry O
station O
until O
they've O
been O
turned O
into O
a O
composed O
dessert, O
and O
not O
some O
kind O
of O
slapdash O
sundae B-FOOD
, O
either. O
Satsuma B-DISH
ice I-DISH
cream I-DISH
gets O
to O
wear O
a O
toasted O
turban O
of O
marshmallowy B-FOOD
meringue I-FOOD
and O
some O
cracked O
honeycomb B-FOOD
candy I-FOOD
on O
the O
side. O
The O
effect O
is O
witty O
and O
delicious, O
progressing O
from O
purely O
sweet O
to O
bittersweet O
to O
tart O
and O
bittersweet. O
Mr. O
Kent's O
savory O
dishes O
pursue O
the O
same O
strategy. O
This O
is O
to O
say, O
they O
regularly O
over-deliver, O
starting O
with O
the O
iced B-DISH
Wellfleet I-DISH
oysters I-DISH
dressed O
with O
cucumber B-FOOD
jelly, I-FOOD
diced O
cucumbers, B-FOOD
grains O
of O
jalapeño B-FOOD
and O
microleaves B-FOOD
of I-FOOD
purple I-FOOD
shiso. I-FOOD
An O
almost O
absurdly O
creamy O
purée O
of O
white B-FOOD
bean I-FOOD
hummus I-FOOD
under O
a O
fiery O
red O
slick O
of O
melted B-FOOD
'nduja I-FOOD
is O
probably O
meant O
to O
be O
shared, O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
I'd O
tasted O
it O
I O
came O
up O
with O
other O
ideas, O
as O
my O
dinner O
guests O
will O
testify. O
Two O
tartares B-DISH
show O
Mr. O
Kent's O
talent O
for O
carrying O
bright O
new O
ideas O
with O
him O
into O
well-traveled O
territory. O
In O
the O
first, O
he O
laces O
hand-chopped B-FOOD
raw I-FOOD
beef I-FOOD
with O
toasted B-FOOD
walnuts I-FOOD
and O
earthy O
rye B-FOOD
croutons; I-FOOD
in O
the O
other, O
chopped B-FOOD
raw I-FOOD
snapper I-FOOD
is O
sprinkled O
with O
individual O
juice-filled O
vesicles O
of O
grapefruit, B-FOOD
lime, B-FOOD
lemon B-FOOD
and O
orange B-FOOD
that O
pop O
between O
your O
teeth, O
a O
kind O
of O
instant, O
interactive O
ceviche. B-FOOD
Maybe O
one O
or O
two O
ideas O
should O
have O
been O
left O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
road. O
The O
chicken B-DISH
liver I-DISH
ragù I-DISH
tossed O
with O
housemade O
cavatelli O
doesn't O
need O
to O
be O
so O
sweet O
with O
sherry; O
a O
rough O
pesto O
is O
a O
fine O
use O
for O
fresh O
chickpeas, O
but O
isn't O
there O
a O
better O
partner O
for O
it O
than O
shaved O
jicama? O
All O
is O
forgiven O
when O
Mr. O
Kent O
turns O
a O
mainstay O
like O
grilled O
chicken O
into O
a O
main O
course O
as O
exciting O
as O
the O
one O
at O
Crown O
Shy, O
which O
keeps O
the O
sunshine O
brightness O
of O
its O
citrus O
marinade, O
and O
is O
served O
with O
a O
purée-slash-hot O
sauce O
of O
fermented O
hot O
and O
sweet O
peppers. O
The O
vivid O
orange O
of O
that O
hot O
sauce O
almost O
matches O
the O
marble O
in O
the O
lobby. O
But O
Crown O
Shy's O
two O
big O
dining O
rooms O
and O
extended O
bar O
are O
a O
little O
more O
restrained, O
dominated O
by O
cream O
tones, O
blond O
wood O
tables, O
and O
chairs O
with O
saddle-brown O
leather O
seats O
and O
backs. O
The O
only O
echoes O
of O
grandeur O
are O
the O
enormous O
windows O
and O
the O
ceiling O
high O
up O
overhead. O
The O
wine O
list O
is O
one O
to O
get O
lost O
in. O
Finance O
wizards O
with O
bonuses O
to O
expunge O
can O
certainly O
do O
that, O
but O
it's O
great O
to O
see O
lots O
of O
bottles O
under O
$100 O
on O
almost O
every O
page. O
Anyone O
who O
knows O
what O
some O
of O
these O
wines O
cost O
wholesale O
will O
be O
able O
to O
locate O
any O
number O
of O
good O
deals, O
but O
even O
the O
unschooled O
will O
notice O
the O
value O
regions. O
They O
jump O
off O
the O
page: O
Portugal, O
Greece O
and O
New O
Zealand, O
for O
instance, O
along O
with O
vast O
stretches O
of O
Germany O
and O
pockets O
of O
Spain, O
France O
and O
Italy. O
With O
so O
many O
strengths, O
Crown O
Shy O
must O
have O
at O
least O
one O
thing O
wrong O
with O
it. O
And O
yes, O
it O
does. O
Obviously O
that O
name O
is O
ridiculous. O
Knowing O
that O
it O
refers O
to O
a O
tendency O
of O
very O
tall O
trees O
not O
to O
let O
their O
upper O
stories O
grow O
into O
their O
neighbors' O
branches O
doesn't O
help, O
either. O
But O
we O
should O
probably O
get O
used O
to O
it, O
because O
we're O
going O
to O
be O
hearing O
more O
about O
this O
restaurant. O

When O
a O
batch O
of O
banh B-DISH
beo I-DISH
comes O
to O
the O
table O
at O
Van B-EST
Da I-EST
, O
any O
confusion O
about O
how O
to O
eat O
them O
does O
not O
last O
long. O
Banh B-FOOD
beo, I-FOOD
a O
species O
of O
small O
rice B-FOOD
cake, I-FOOD
are O
a O
favorite O
afternoon O
snack O
in O
the O
central O
Vietnamese O
city O
of O
Hue. B-LOC
Each O
one O
is O
steamed O
in O
a O
ceramic O
dish O
just O
big O
enough O
to O
hold O
a O
few O
spare O
coins. O
Faced O
with O
a O
platter O
of O
banh B-DISH
beo, I-DISH
you O
realize O
fairly O
quickly O
that O
you O
have O
essentially O
two O
choices: O
You O
can O
use O
a O
spoon, O
or O
hold O
the O
dish O
to O
your O
mouth O
and O
tip O
it O
up O
while O
throwing O
your O
head O
back, O
as O
if O
doing O
a O
Jell-O B-DISH
shot. I-DISH
If O
you O
go O
the O
Jell-O B-DISH
shot I-DISH
route, O
it O
may O
help O
to O
bring O
a O
pair O
of O
chopsticks O
or O
a O
fingertip O
into O
play O
at O
the O
last O
minute O
to O
encourage O
the O
banh B-DISH
beo I-DISH
to O
leave O
the O
nest. O
You O
have O
now O
transferred O
to O
your O
mouth O
a O
warm O
divot O
of O
steamed B-FOOD
rice I-FOOD
and I-FOOD
tapioca I-FOOD
flours I-FOOD
that O
has O
a O
consistency O
like O
panna B-DISH
cotta's I-DISH
and O
a O
negligible O
flavor O
on O
its O
own. O
All O
the O
action O
is O
in O
the O
toppings. O
At O
Van B-EST
Da, I-EST
these O
include O
a O
spoonful O
of O
chopped O
scallions B-FOOD
and O
the O
green B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
in O
which O
they O
were O
sizzled, O
red O
rings O
of O
fresh O
Thai B-FOOD
chile, I-FOOD
some O
fish B-FOOD
sauce, I-FOOD
rehydrated B-FOOD
dried I-FOOD
shrimp I-FOOD
and O
a O
flap O
of O
fried B-FOOD
tofu I-FOOD
skin, I-FOOD
standing O
in O
for O
the O
pork B-FOOD
rinds I-FOOD
a O
banh B-FOOD
beo I-FOOD
vendor O
in O
Hue B-LOC
would O
use. O
The O
divot O
of O
rice B-FOOD
cake I-FOOD
is O
still O
warm, O
which O
helps O
the O
aromas O
drive O
their O
way O
into O
your O
head. O
It's O
over O
in O
a O
minute. O
If O
you're O
lucky, O
there O
will O
be O
another O
banh B-DISH
beo I-DISH
on O
the O
table O
so O
you O
can O
start O
over. O
Van B-EST
Da I-EST
joined O
the O
East B-LOC
Village's I-LOC
growing O
hub O
of O
interesting O
Vietnamese B-CUISINE
restaurants O
three O
months O
ago. O
Like O
Hanoi B-EST
House I-EST
, O
Madame B-EST
Vo I-EST
and O
Madame B-EST
Vo I-EST
BBQ I-EST
, O
it O
is O
semitraditional O
and O
semimodern. O
Those O
two O
strains O
are O
embodied O
at O
Van B-EST
Da I-EST
by, O
respectively, O
Yen O
Ngo O
and O
Hannah O
Wong. O
Ms. O
Ngo, O
who O
owns O
the O
place, O
was O
raised O
in O
Dalat, B-LOC
Vietnam, I-LOC
and O
while O
she O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
catering O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
for O
years, O
she O
has O
never O
had O
a O
chance O
before O
to O
show O
off O
the O
food O
of O
her O
childhood, O
like O
the O
banh B-FOOD
beo I-FOOD
steamed O
by O
her O
mother, O
who O
had O
grown O
up O
in O
Hue. B-LOC
Ms. O
Wong O
is O
the O
chef. O
Though O
she O
has O
cooked O
at O
Gramercy B-EST
Tavern I-EST
and O
Battersby B-EST
, O
her O
background O
in O
the O
food O
of O
Vietnam B-LOC
before O
Van B-EST
Da I-EST
was O
more O
or O
less O
confined O
to O
the O
roughly O
two O
weeks O
she O
spent O
traveling O
there O
while O
living O
in O
Hong B-LOC
Kong I-LOC
on O
a O
Fulbright O
grant O
a O
decade O
ago. O
Nevertheless, O
she O
has O
put O
together O
a O
trenchant, O
concise O
and O
pleasure-focused O
menu O
of O
Vietnamese B-CUISINE
dishes. O
Some O
she O
learned O
directly O
from O
her O
boss, O
and O
on O
those O
recipes O
she O
was O
apparently O
discouraged O
from O
drawing O
outside O
the O
lines. O
Others O
are O
more O
freely O
interpreted. O
It's O
a O
credit O
to O
Ms. O
Wong's O
sensitivity O
that O
if O
you O
don't O
already O
know O
the O
original O
templates, O
it O
can O
be O
hard O
to O
tell O
where O
they O
end O
and O
her O
imagination O
begins. O
Banh B-FOOD
beo I-FOOD
and O
the O
other O
snacks O
from O
Hue O
that O
Ms. O
Ngo O
taught O
Ms. O
Wong O
get O
their O
own O
berth O
on O
the O
menu. O
As O
you'd O
imagine, O
they O
tend O
to O
be O
very O
good. O
Banh B-DISH
it I-DISH
ram I-DISH

chewy, O
fried O

of O
mochi, B-FOOD
filled O
with O
a O
coconut-soaked B-FOOD
mash I-FOOD
of I-FOOD
mung I-FOOD
beans I-FOOD

shallots. I-FOOD
Banh B-DISH
khot I-DISH
are O
little O
rice-flour B-FOOD
pancakes I-FOOD
molded O
into O
edible O
cups O
about O
the O
size O
of O
a O
Ritz B-FOOD
cracker. I-FOOD
In O
Vietnam, B-LOC
the O
cups O
would O
be O
filled O
with O
shrimp. B-FOOD
Ms. O
Wong O
instead O
spoons O
sautéed B-FOOD
mushrooms I-FOOD
into O
hers, O
along O
with O
a O
crisscrossing O
of O
fresh B-FOOD
herbs I-FOOD
and O
a O
spill O
of O
coconut O
cream. O
Ms. O
Wong O
makes O
an O
effort O
to O
bring O
out O
regional O
differences O
in O
Vietnamese O
cuisine O
by O
devoting O
sections O
of O
the O
menu O
to O
Saigon O
and O
Hanoi, O
hundreds O
of O
miles O
apart, O
as O
well O
as O
Hue, O
somewhere O
in O
the O
middle. O
She O
doesn't O
have O
quite O
enough O
dishes O
from O
any O
one O
place O
to O
paint O
a O
full O
picture, O
but O
the O
project O
is O
intriguing. O
Like O
other O
New O
York O
chefs, O
she O
has O
been O
caught O
in O
the O
tractor O
beam O
of O
cha O
ca O
la O
Vong O
, O
the O
turmeric-and O
dill-scented O
fish O
dish O
that O
is O
a O
specialty O
of O
a O
100-year-old O
Hanoi O
restaurant O
of O
the O
same O
name. O
Her O
version, O
though, O
supplies O
less O
dill, O
less O
sauce O
and O
less O
satisfaction O
than O
some O
others. O
Her O
two O
improvisations O
on O
the O
theme O
of O
Hanoi's O
best-known O
contribution O
to O
gastronomy, O
pho, O
are O
more O
effective. O
One O
gives O
you O
the O
soup O
without O
the O
noodles; O
floating O
in O
a O
rich O
and O
cloudy O
broth O
are O
ghostly O
white, O
billowing O
won O
tons O
that O
contain O
chopped O
beef O
fillet O
freely O
seasoned O
with O
black O
pepper. O
The O
other O
dish O
is, O
humbly O
enough, O
a O
plate O
of O
soupless O
pho O
noodles O
stir-fried O
with O
springy O
mushrooms, O
bitter O
greens O
and O
chopped O
scallions. O
Its O
simplicity O
makes O
the O
impact O
of O
the O
dish O
hard O
to O
explain O
until O
you O
learn O
that O
it O
has O
been O
showered O
with O
Maggi O
Seasoning O
, O
a O
soylike O
sauce O
that O
is O
the O
invisible O
secret O
of O
many O
Vietnamese O
dishes. O
Nodding O
toward O
Saigon, O
Ms. O
Wong O
makes O
a O
rendition O
of O
shaking O
beef O
by O
stir-frying O
tender O
and O
chewy O
marinated O
hanger O
steak O
with O
potatoes O
and O
then O
throwing O
a O
fistful O
of O
watercress O
at O
it. O
If O
you O
think O
that O
sounds O
like O
a O
French O
bistro O
plate, O
then O
you O
are O
starting O
to O
understand O
how O
her O
mind O
works. O
Ms. O
Wong O
cooks O
skillfully, O
with O
an O
appreciation O
for O
nuance, O
and O
she O
doesn't O
abuse O
her O
freedom O
by O
innovating O
pointlessly. O
It's O
possible, O
though, O
that O
she O
could O
stand O
to O
be O
less O
shy O
with O
chiles O
and O
herbs. O
The O
table O
salad O
of O
greenery O
to O
be O
wrapped O
around O
grilled O
shrimp O
offers O
no O
herbs O
other O
than O
mint O
and O
basil, O
and O
you'll O
run O
out O
of O
lettuce O
before O
the O
fourth O
shrimp O
has O
been O
dressed. O
The O
green O
papaya O
salad O
is O
a O
little O
too O
innocuous, O
and O
while O
her O
version O
of O
the O
street O
snack O
of O
grilled O
corn O
in O
fish O
sauce O
is O
a O
real O
success, O
fresh O
chiles O
would O
have O
more O
impact O
than O
the O
chile O
threads O
Ms. O
Wong O
balances O
on O
top. O
(Incidentally, O
the O
kitchen O
at O
Van O
Da O
makes O
a O
fine O
hot O
sauce O
that O
is O
like O
a O
milder O
and O
less O
acidic O
Sriracha, O
but O
servers O
never O
seem O
to O
remember O
to O
mention O
it O
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal.) O
There O
are O
just O
three O
desserts. O
By O
the O
time O
you O
order, O
one O
or O
two O
may O
have O
been O
86ed. O
With O
luck, O
though, O
the O
che O
will O
have O
survived. O
In O
Vietnam, O
che O
is O
thought O
of O
as O
a O
drink O
even O
though O
it O
can O
take O
the O
form O
of O
a O
pudding, O
as O
it O
does O
here, O
where O
warm O
pearls O
and O
threads O
of O
tapioca O
are O
cooked O
in O
coconut O
milk O
with O
cubes O
of O
soft O
taro. O
It O
is O
just O
sweet O
enough O
to O
qualify O
as O
a O
dessert. O
A O
black O
dust O
darkens O
the O
surface: O
black-sesame O
brittle, O
ground O
to O
powder. O
Even O
a O
single O
dessert O
qualifies O
as O
an O
impressive O
feat O
inside O
Van O
Da's O
tight O
quarters. O
Through O
the O
miracle O
of O
careful O
design, O
the O
space O
almost O
never O
feels O
cramped, O
but O
this O
is O
still O
an O
intimate O
restaurant. O
In O
the O
basement O
is O
a O
small O
seating O
area O
laid O
out O
as O
efficiently O
as O
the O
cockpit O
of O
a O
fighter O
jet; O
above O
it, O
at O
the O
top O
of O
a O
staircase, O
is O
an O
even O
smaller O
seating O
area O
sharing O
a O
room O
with O
a O
window-facing O
dining O
counter, O
the O
kitchen O
and O
a O
bar. O
The O
cocktails O
that O
roll O
off O
that O
bar, O
like O
the O
gin-and-celery O
duet O
called O
the O
White O
Tiger, O
are O
much O
more O
sharply O
drawn O
than O
the O
drinks O
at O
restaurants O
with O
twice O
the O
space O
and O
four O
times O
the O
budget. O

Talking O
about O
how O
good O
the O
chef O
Thomas O
Keller's O
new O
restaurant O
is O
would O
be O
easier O
if O
it O
weren't O
also O
painfully O
out O
of O
step O
with O
the O
city's O
mood. O
TAK B-EST
Room I-EST
is O
so O
determined O
to O
be O
"timeless," O
as O
Mr. O
Keller O
has O
often O
called O
it, O
that O
it O
seems O
clueless. O
TAK B-EST
Room I-EST
opened O
in O
March, O
one O
of O
11 O
restaurants O
inside O
the O
720,000-square-foot O
mall O
at O
20 B-LOC
Hudson I-LOC
Yards. I-LOC
Parts O
of O
Hudson B-LOC
Yards I-LOC
are O
still O
under O
construction, O
but O
enough O
has O
been O
finished O
for O
most O
New O
Yorkers O
to O
figure O
out O
that O
this O
fistful O
of O
glass O
needles O
stabbed O
into O
the O
West B-LOC
Side I-LOC
wasn't O
built O
for O
them. O
Just O
as O
the O
helipad O
the O
city O
offered O
to O
build O
for O
Amazon O
crystallized O
anger O
about O
the O
cruddy O
state O
of O
our O
subways, O
the O
glittering O
new O
home O
on O
10th B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
for O
global O
luxury O
brands, O
investment O
funds, O
law O
firms, O
business O
travelers O
and O
hunters O
of O
seven- O
or O
eight-figure O
apartments O
spurred O
a O
lot O
of O
New O
Yorkers O
to O
ask, O
What's O
in O
it O
for O
us? O
Mr. O
Keller's O
answer O
is O
a O
restaurant O
that O
looks O
and O
acts O
like O
a O
millionaire's O
hangout O
in O
an O
old O
New O
Yorker O
cartoon. O
It O
charges O
like O
one, O
too, O
with O
adjustments O
for O
inflation. O
An O
eggplant B-DISH
Parmesan I-DISH
is O
the O
least O
expensive O
main O
course, O
at O
$30, O
followed O
by O
the O
New B-DISH
Zealand I-DISH
salmon I-DISH
for O
$42. O
After O
that, O
please O
turn O
off O
all O
electronic O
devices O
and O
place O
your O
tray O
tables O
in O
the O
upright, O
locked O
position, O
because O
we O
are O
going O
up O
to O
$66 O
and O
$75 O
before O
reaching O
a O
cruising O
altitude O
of O
$85. O
Look O
down O
there O
-- O
don't O
the O
people O
look O
just O
like O
ants? O
TAK B-EST
Room's I-EST
timing O
is O
off O
in O
other O
ways, O
too. O
Hudson B-LOC
Yards I-LOC
has O
stirred O
up O
New O
Yorkers' O
latent O
resentment O
of O
chain O
stores O
from O
beyond O
the O
Hudson, B-LOC
and O
what O
does O
Mr. O
Keller O
offer O
them O
but O
a O
clone O
of O
his O
restaurant O
in O
Florida, B-LOC
the O
Surf B-EST
Club I-EST
? O
The O
name O
has O
been O
changed, O
but O
the O
menus O
are O
nearly O
identical; O
they O
glorify O
the O
strait-laced, O
spice-free O
food O
that O
rich O
white O
Americans O
used O
to O
feed O
on O
when O
nobody O
was O
shaming O
them O
into O
being O
adventurous. O
It O
is O
the O
food O
of O
"21," O
of O
three-martini O
lunches, O
steakhouses B-DIET
and O
country O
clubs: O
prime B-DISH
rib I-DISH
and I-DISH
Dover I-DISH
sole, I-DISH
iceberg B-DISH
lettuce I-DISH
and I-DISH
oysters I-DISH
Rockefeller. I-DISH
Of O
course, O
being O
a O
Thomas O
Keller O
production, O
TAK B-EST
Room I-EST
serves O
the O
most O
refined, O
meticulous O
country O
club O
food O
you've O
ever O
seen. O
Most O
of O
it O
is O
very O
good, O
and O
a O
few O
things O
are O
so O
inexplicably O
delicious O
that O
you O
have O
the O
sensation O
of O
slipping O
the O
knots O
of O
gravity O
and O
floating O
an O
inch O
or O
so O
above O
your O
seat. O
The O
entrance O
is O
on O
the O
fifth O
floor, O
just O
past O
Neiman O
Marcus. O
But O
the O
action O
is O
on O
the O
sixth O
floor, O
up O
a O
Deco-cubist O
staircase O
so O
grand O
that O
you O
may O
feel O
a O
little O
underdressed O
unless O
you O
have O
Carole O
Lombard O
on O
one O
arm. O
(There O
is O
no O
dress O
code.) O
At O
the O
top, O
you O
find O
yourself O
in O
a O
lounge O
where O
a O
pianist O
and O
upright O
bassist O
glide O
through O
satiny O
jazz O
standards. O
Bartenders O
whip O
up O
streamlined, O
uncomplicated O
drinks O
that O
are O
either O
genuine O
classics, O
like O
the O
Pendennis B-DISH
Club, I-DISH
or O
modern O
drinks O
built O
along O
classic O
proportions, O
like O
the O
Tritter B-DISH
rickey, I-DISH
a O
tall, O
fizzy O
gin O
number O
that O
shimmies O
with O
absinthe. O
Around O
sunset, O
when O
pink O
light O
trickles O
through O
the O
western O
windows, O
it O
has O
to O
be O
the O
most O
pleasant O
room O
within O
a O
mile O
for O
fighting O
vainly O
the O
old O
ennui O
. O
They O
let O
people O
eat O
in O
this O
room, O
too, O
and O
it O
is O
tempting. O
But O
there O
is O
more O
to O
see, O
room O
after O
room, O
all O
laid O
out O
by O
the O
London O
interior-design O
firm O
David O
Collins O
Studio. O
There O
are O
leather O
banquettes O
deep O
enough O
to O
lose O
a O
small O
child O
in. O
Facing O
them O
are O
mohair-velvet O
chairs O
that O
swivel O
so O
you O
can O
quietly O
surveil O
the O
room O
without O
craning O
your O
neck. O
Each O
table O
gets O
a O
white O
linen O
cloth O
and O
a O
flickering O
oil O
lamp O
behind O
a O
white O
porcelain O
shade. O
The O
other O
colors O
are O
black O
walnut, O
midnight O
blue O
and O
law-firm O
green. O
At O
some O
point O
a O
captain O
in O
a O
crisply O
tailored O
suit O
will O
deposit O
the O
wine O
list. O
It O
mostly O
avoids O
the O
latest O
fashions, O
like O
a O
croquet O
party O
on O
Nantucket. O
Later O
there O
will O
be O
a O
preamble O
to O
the O
menu. O
Under O
the O
day-to-day O
care O
of O
Jarrod O
Huth, O
TAK O
Room's O
chef O
de O
cuisine, O
it O
has O
a O
continental O
theme O
and O
an O
à O
la O
carte O
format. O
Highlights O
will O
be O
pointed O
out, O
and O
the O
prime O
rib O
will O
certainly O
be O
mentioned, O
as O
will O
the O
restored O
1930s O
silver O
trolley O
on O
which O
it O
is O
ferried O
from O
table O
to O
table. O
Here O
comes O
a O
French O
onion O
dip O
surrounded O
by O
newly O
fried O
potato O
chips O
that O
are O
dark O
without O
a O
hint O
of O
charring. O
This O
is O
TAK O
Room O
in O
one O
extremely O
crunchy, O
lusciously O
creamy O
bite: O
an O
hors O
d'oeuvre O
from O
the O
age O
of O
Naugahyde O
and O
polyester, O
transformed O
into O
something O
so O
good O
and O
pure O
it's O
beyond O
reproach. O
The O
Parker O
House O
rolls O
are O
gravity-defying O
orbs O
served O
with O
soft O
cultured O
butter O
that, O
in O
the O
evening's O
best O
magic O
trick, O
rises O
from O
a O
custom-made O
dish O
in O
six O
identical O
ridged O
curls O
, O
like O
shrimp O
performing O
a O
Busby O
Berkeley O
routine. O
Bespoke O
flourishes O
like O
that O
are O
a O
TAK O
Room O
hallmark; O
see O
also O
the O
oyster O
crackers, O
like O
down O
pillows O
shrunk O
to O
the O
size O
of O
Chiclets, O
served O
with O
the O
silk-smooth O
New O
England O
clam O
chowder O
that O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
likable O
appetizers O
and, O
at O
$16, O
the O
best O
value. O
Another O
hallmark, O
though, O
is O
unevenness. O
Avocado O
Louie O
with O
a O
small O
bouquet O
of O
other O
vegetables O
is O
thrillingly O
right, O
thanks O
to O
a O
Thousand O
Island O
dressing O
that O
crackles O
with O
energy; O
the O
Caesar O
salad, O
made O
while O
you O
watch, O
has O
almost O
no O
personality. O
Grated O
Parmesan O
and O
anchovies O
vanish O
into O
it O
without O
a O
trace, O
along O
with O
dull O
croutons O
that O
could O
take O
some O
pointers O
from O
the O
oyster O
crackers. O
Something O
called O
"warm O
soft O
boiled O
egg" O
is O
a O
quietly O
joyous O
celebration O
of O
luxurious O
flavors O
and O
textures, O
the O
yolk O
running O
like O
lava O
over O
a O
buckwheat O
blin O
and O
a O
heap O
of O
warm O
osetra O
caviar O
in O
crème O
fraîche. O
(Yes, O
warm. O
It's O
wonderful.) O
And O
the O
chilled O
prawn O
cocktail O
is O
going O
to O
be O
my O
platonic O
ideal O
of O
the O
dish O
from O
now O
on. O
But O
the O
crab O
cake O
had O
very O
little O
crab O
flavor, O
on O
two O
different O
nights, O
although O
it O
contained O
almost O
nothing O
else. O
Lobster O
thermidor O
(now O
there's O
a O
name O
I've O
not O
heard O
in O
a O
long, O
long O
time) O
is O
so O
tender, O
its O
sauce O
so O
fluffy O
and O
rich, O
that O
eating O
it O
becomes O
an O
intimate O
act. O
Dover O
sole O
meunière, O
though, O
has O
neither O
the O
crisped O
skin O
nor O
the O
juicy O
flesh O
that O
can O
make O
this O
fish O
so O
alluring. O
Yes, O
life O
cannot O
be O
one O
giant O
plate O
of O
dancing O
butter-shrimp. O
Still, O
the O
gap O
between O
great O
and O
non-great O
items O
-- O
nothing O
comes O
close O
to O
bad O
-- O
is O
a O
bit O
too O
wide O
and O
comes O
into O
view O
a O
bit O
too O
often. O
Regulars O
will O
learn O
to O
work O
the O
menu O
the O
way O
golfers O
learn O
their O
way O
around O
the O
eighth O
hole O
at O
Pebble O
Beach. O
Some O
will O
love O
the O
prime O
rib, O
which O
could O
not O
be O
any O
more O
moist O
without O
breaking O
several O
laws O
of O
chemistry. O
Others O
will O
wish O
that O
it O
had O
more O
concentrated O
beef O
flavor O
and O
that O
the O
flaps O
and O
handles O
had O
not O
been O
trimmed O
off, O
perhaps O
in O
pursuit O
of O
some O
Kellerian O
quest O
for O
bovine O
symmetry. O
A O
large O
number O
will O
settle O
on O
the O
roast O
chicken O
for O
two. O
The O
meat O
is O
juicy O
but O
not O
gushy, O
the O
flavor O
full O
but O
not O
salty, O
the O
jus O
dark O
but O
not O
over-reduced. O
After O
the O
chicken, O
the O
pastry O
chef, O
Alex O
McClenaghan, O
can O
offer O
a O
highly O
refined O
coconut O
cake O
or O
an O
urbane O
lemon O
meringue O
tart, O
but O
you'd O
almost O
have O
to O
be O
insane O
not O
to O
get O
the O
chocolate O
cake. O
Certainly O
a O
close O
relative O
of O
devil's O
food O
cake, O
his O
version O
weaves O
dark-chocolate O
cremeux O
between O
its O
many, O
many O
layers, O
all O
of O
them O
wrapped O
in O
a O
dark-chocolate O
frosting. O
And O
there O
will O
be O
regulars, O
because O
the O
rewards O
of O
TAK O
Room, O
if O
you O
can O
find O
them O
and O
pay O
for O
them, O
are O
as O
intense O
as O
the O
chocolate O
in O
that O
cake. O
The O
core O
audience O
may O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
travelers O
on O
loan O
from O
the O
Surf O
Club O
and O
Mr. O
Keller's O
California O
strongholds, O
or O
they O
may O
just O
be O
people O
who O
like O
the O
feeling O
of O
crashing O
the O
country O
club. O
Anti-plutocrat O
fevers O
come O
and O
go, O
but O
the O
trappings O
of O
American O
aristocracy O
are O
always O
in O
style O
somewhere. O

"Does O
the O
sheep's B-DISH
head I-DISH
soup I-DISH
have O
a O
lot O
of O
stuff O
in O
it?" O
I O
asked O
my O
server. O
Realizing O
that O
this O
was O
somewhat O
ambiguous, O
especially O
applied O
to O
a O
dish O
as O
laden O
with O
stuff O
as O
the O
brew O
of O
lambs' B-FOOD
snouts, I-FOOD
ears, B-FOOD
tongues, B-FOOD
cheeks B-FOOD
and O
eyeballs B-FOOD
known O
in O
Turkey B-LOC
as O
kelle B-DISH
paca, I-DISH
I O
tried O
again. O
"Is O
it O
very O
filling, O
I O
mean?" O
My O
concern O
was O
a O
familiar O
one, O
to O
me O
at O
least. O
I O
was O
in O
Queens, B-LOC
at O
a O
new O
Turkish B-CUISINE
restaurant O
in O
Astoria B-LOC
called O
Lokanta B-EST
, O
and O
the O
menu O
was O
so O
appealing O
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
try O
it O
all. O
Already O
I O
was O
set O
on O
a O
few O
bourekas, B-DISH
some O
labneh, B-DISH
the O
fava B-DISH
dip I-DISH
and O
some O
form O
of O
braised B-FOOD
lamb I-FOOD
over O
eggplant. B-FOOD
I'd O
spotted O
another O
three O
or O
four O
dishes O
that O
I O
was O
probably O
going O
to O
tack O
on O
at O
the O
end O
of O
my O
order, O
as O
if O
by O
afterthought. O
I O
suspected O
that O
I O
could O
add O
a O
small O
bowl O
of O
kelle B-DISH
paca I-DISH
and O
still O
eat O
everything O
else. O
But O
a O
big O
bowl, O
one O
so O
thick O
with O
bits O
formerly O
affixed O
to O
a O
sheep's O
skull O
that O
a O
spoon O
would O
stand O
up O
in O
it, O
might O
tip O
the O
scale. O
The O
server O
pondered O
this O
for O
a O
while O
until O
a O
wiry O
man O
got O
up O
from O
his O
marble-topped O
table O
in O
the O
corner O
and O
conferred O
with O
her. O
Wearing O
baggy O
jeans, O
a O
white O
T-shirt O
and O
a O
baseball O
cap O
that O
kept O
his O
zinc-colored O
ponytail O
in O
place, O
he O
looked O
like O
a O
contractor, O
maybe O
a O
painter O
who'd O
come O
by O
to O
touch O
up O
the O
moldings O
and O
had O
been O
invited O
to O
stay O
for O
a O
Turkish B-FOOD
coffee. I-FOOD
Then O
he O
spoke O
to O
us O
about O
the O
sheep's B-DISH
head I-DISH
soup. I-DISH
"I O
am O
a O
genius," O
he O
began. O
"And O
even O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
to O
answer O
this O
question. O
I O
think O
that O
the O
question O
must O
be O
wrong." O
As O
those O
who O
chase O
the O
scent O
of O
lamb B-FOOD
and O
charred B-FOOD
eggplant I-FOOD
around O
the O
city O
have O
probably O
guessed, O
this O
was O
no O
contractor. O
This O
was O
Orhan O
Yegen, O
the O
Turkish-born O
chef O
and O
restaurateur O
who O
has O
opened O
close O
to O
20 O
Turkish O
restaurants O
over O
the O
past O
two O
decades O
or O
so O
while O
keeping O
up O
a O
running O
monologue O
that O
made O
him O
a O
favorite O
of O
food O
writers O
. O
In O
2004, O
Mr. O
Yegen O
opened O
Sip B-EST
Sak I-EST
in O
Turtle B-LOC
Bay, I-LOC
then O
proceeded O
to O
surprise O
those O
who O
had O
charted O
his O
career O
by O
embarking O
on O
a O
long, O
stable O
period O
. O
All O
was O
quiet, O
relatively O
speaking, O
until O
April, O
when O
Lokanta B-EST
arrived O
in O
Astoria B-LOC
to O
supplement O
the O
Greek B-CUISINE
and O
Cypriot B-CUISINE
menus O
along O
its O
stretch O
of O
Broadway, B-LOC
and O
Mr. O
Yegen O
arrived O
to O
tell O
customers O
that O
their O
questions O
were O
wrong. O
The O
kelle B-DISH
paca I-DISH
colloquy O
ended O
when O
I O
agreed O
to O
order O
it. O
After O
hours O
on O
the O
stove, O
the O
meat B-FOOD
on O
the O
head O
had O
fallen O
away O
into O
about O
eight O
different O
textures, O
from O
frilly O
to O
ropy O
to O
collagenously O
chewy O
to O
tender O
and O
lean. O
All O
of O
this O
suspended O
in O
a O
slippery, O
almost O
sticky O
broth B-FOOD
the O
color O
of O
cappuccino. B-FOOD
And O
no, O
it O
was O
not O
too O
filling. O
Soups, B-FOOD
braises, B-FOOD
stews B-FOOD
and O
other O
recipes O
requiring O
plenty O
of O
time O
and O
even O
more O
olive B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
are O
the O
basis O
of O
Mr. O
Yegen's O
reputation. O
They O
set O
his O
menus O
apart O
from O
those O
at O
other O
Turkish B-CUISINE
restaurants O
around O
town, O
which O
tend O
to O
revolve O
around O
the O
grill. O
Lokanta B-EST
makes O
very O
fine O
kofte, B-FOOD
but O
for O
a O
full O
medley O
of O
minced O
and O
skewered O
meats, B-FOOD
you O
are O
better O
off O
under O
the O
swaying O
chandeliers O
of O
Taci's B-EST
Beyti I-EST
on O
Coney B-LOC
Island I-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
in O
Brooklyn. B-LOC
Lokanta B-EST
will O
grill O
or O
roast O
a O
whole O
fish, B-FOOD
but O
it O
will O
not O
be O
all O
that O
different O
from O
what O
might O
be O
served O
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
at O
Liman B-EST
, O
where O
your O
bass B-FOOD
will O
be O
filleted O
within O
view O
of O
the O
fishing O
boats O
and O
swans O
of O
Sheepshead B-LOC
Bay. I-LOC
Diners O
in O
Lokanta's B-EST
custody O
have O
signed O
on O
for O
a O
more O
nuanced O
view O
of O
the O
Turkish B-CUISINE
kitchen. O
Take, O
for O
instance, O
the O
shadings O
that O
lamb B-FOOD
takes O
on. O
In O
hunkar B-DISH
begendi, I-DISH
chunks O
of O
it O
are O
stewed O
in O
tomatoes B-FOOD
and O
peppers B-FOOD
and O
ladled O
over O
an O
eggplant B-FOOD
mash I-FOOD
beaten O
to O
a O
memorable O
richness O
with O
cheese B-FOOD
and O
milk. B-FOOD
Ali B-DISH
nazik I-DISH
is, O
in O
schematic O
form, O
the O
same O
thing, O
built O
on O
the O
same O
foundation O
of O
milky O
eggplant, B-FOOD
but O
in O
Lokanta's B-EST
version O
the O
lamb B-FOOD
is O
ground O
and O
simmered O
with O
onions B-FOOD
and O
red B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
green I-FOOD
peppers; I-FOOD
somehow O
it O
achieves O
a O
rich, O
unctuous O
consistency O
that O
is O
amplified O
by O
the O
eggplant B-FOOD
and O
the O
scoop O
of O
strained O
yogurt O
dropped O
on O
top. O
Lokanta's O
"roasted O
lamb O
and O
rice" O
is O
in O
the O
pilaf O
family, O
which O
means O
that O
the O
rice O
is O
not O
just O
a O
side O
dish O
but O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
recipe, O
baked O
until O
alluringly O
sweet O
with O
currants, O
allspice O
and O
cinnamon, O
then O
sprinkled O
with O
fresh O
dill O
at O
the O
last O
minute. O
The O
lamb's O
job O
is O
to O
be O
obligingly O
tender, O
and O
it O
succeeds, O
one O
reason O
the O
dish O
is O
requested O
by O
so O
many O
tables. O
To O
fend O
off O
boredom, O
I O
imagine, O
Mr. O
Yegen O
fills O
his O
manti O
with O
both O
lamb O
and O
beef. O
Each O
little O
dumpling O
is O
rolled O
by O
fingertip O
and O
is O
roughly O
the O
size O
of O
one. O
The O
meat O
has O
been O
seasoned O
just O
forcefully O
enough O
that O
it O
will O
announce O
itself, O
politely O
but O
clearly, O
as O
it O
breaks O
through O
the O
dough. O
It O
would O
be O
possible O
to O
sit O
down O
in O
front O
of O
a O
bowl O
of O
these, O
spooning O
them O
up O
with O
their O
warm O
yogurt O
and O
chile O
oil O
and O
dried O
mint, O
and O
call O
for O
another O
bowl O
a O
minute O
later. O
Of O
course, O
the O
meal O
should O
begin O
with O
strips O
of O
nigella-dotted O
Turkish O
bread O
and O
a O
spread O
or O
two O
-- O
maybe O
memorably O
creamy O
purée O
of O
dried O
favas; O
or O
the O
roughly O
mashed O
eggplant, O
smoky O
without O
a O
trace O
of O
bitterness; O
and O
one O
of O
the O
strained-yogurt O
dips, O
either O
the O
tangy O
cacik, O
laced O
with O
minced O
cucumbers, O
or O
the O
labneh, O
as O
firm O
as O
a O
new O
mattress. O
Either O
will O
prove O
useful O
as O
the O
meal O
goes O
on. O
So O
will O
a O
simple O
salad, O
especially O
the O
one O
with O
white O
beans O
and O
purple O
onions. O
The O
tightly O
rolled, O
golden O
bourekas O
are O
like O
skinny O
Turkish O
spring O
rolls O
filled O
with O
dill O
and O
melting O
feta. O
Cold O
poached O
leeks, O
a O
frequent O
special, O
are O
more O
appealing O
than O
the O
cold O
poached O
artichokes O
that O
have O
a O
permanent O
spot O
on O
the O
menu. O
If O
Mr. O
Yegen O
tells O
you O
that O
the O
grilled O
octopus O
is O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city, O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
he O
rarely O
seems O
to O
leave O
his O
own O
restaurant. O
It's O
quite O
good, O
though, O
with O
a O
fugitive O
sweetness O
that O
may O
be O
supplied O
by O
the O
tomatoes O
and O
purple O
onions. O
Desserts O
run O
toward O
milky O
white O
puddings, O
nice O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
mild O
sedative. O
The O
baklava, O
imported O
from O
Turkey, O
is O
a O
treat O
for O
those O
of O
us O
who O
like O
pistachios O
and O
think O
sugar O
syrup O
makes O
a O
better O
baklava O
sweetener O
than O
honey. O
The O
unlikely O
champion, O
though, O
is O
the O
butternut O
squash O
that O
has O
been O
languorously O
baked O
in O
its O
own O
juices O
with O
nothing O
but O
sugar. O
The O
technique O
is O
one O
of O
those O
small O
tricks O
that O
helps O
Mr. O
Yegen's O
cooking O
stand O
out, O
like O
the O
perfume O
of O
lemon O
peel O
in O
the O
Turkish O
lemonade. O
Lokanta O
has O
no O
liquor O
license O
yet. O
Some O
customers O
smuggle O
wine O
through O
the O
door O
and O
keep O
the O
bottles O
on O
their O
tables, O
which O
are O
topped O
with O
radiant O
white O
marble O
from O
Turkey O
and O
surrounded O
by O
classic O
bentwood O
cafe O
chairs. O
But O
it O
is O
hard O
not O
to O
want O
the O
lemonade, O
which O
is O
cold O
and O
just O
tart O
enough O
and O
not O
very O
filling O
at O
all. O

-DOCSTART- O

The O
chef O
John O
Fraser's O
new O
restaurant O
has O
a O
blandly O
corporate O
name, O
701West B-EST
, O
that O
tells O
you O
less O
about O
the O
place O
than O
simply O
walking O
into O
the O
dining O
room. O
One O
of O
several O
operations O
he O
is O
running O
in O
the O
new O
Times B-LOC
Square I-LOC
Edition I-LOC
hotel, I-LOC
it O
is O
clad O
in O
paneling O
on O
the O
walls O
and O
ceilings. O
Velvet O
curtains O
and O
banquettes O
are O
the O
slightly O
alarming O
color O
of O
a O
blue O
macaw's O
tail O
feathers. O
Wooden O
blinds O
are O
usually O
snapped O
shut O
against O
the O
strobes O
of O
47th B-LOC
Street I-LOC
and O
Seventh B-LOC
Avenue. I-LOC
To O
get O
to O
your O
table, O
you O
must O
first O
pass O
between O
two O
identical O
Champagne O
trolleys. O
An O
iced O
reservoir O
in O
the O
center O
of O
each O
is O
loaded O
with O
about O
half O
a O
dozen O
bottles O
that O
range O
in O
price O
from O
a O
Blanquette B-DISH
de I-DISH
Limoux I-DISH
for O
$26 O
a O
glass O
to O
a O
2006 O
brut O
from O
Dom B-DISH
Pérignon I-DISH
for O
$66 O
a O
glass. O
Before O
you O
sit O
down, O
you've O
already O
learned O
that O
wine B-FOOD
is O
front O
and O
center, O
literally O
and O
figuratively; O
that O
it O
is O
more O
likely O
to O
come O
from O
classic, O
mannerly O
European O
estates O
than, O
say, O
Macedonian O
villages O
still O
using O
amphoras O
that O
Odysseus O
drank O
from; O
that O
the O
ideal O
customer O
is O
not O
likely O
to O
get O
up O
and O
walk O
out O
upon O
being O
offered O
a O
$66 O
aperitif; B-FOOD
and O
that O
the O
restaurant O
expects O
to O
attract O
so O
many O
of O
these O
customers O
that O
a O
single O
Champagne O
trolley O
is O
not O
enough. O
Which O
is O
to O
say O
that O
Marriott O
International O
and O
the O
hotelier O
Ian O
Schrager O
installed O
701West B-EST
on O
the O
11th O
floor O
of O
the O
Edition B-LOC
for O
people O
who O
still O
think O
a O
leisurely, O
three-course O
dinner O
with O
a O
few O
interesting O
bottles O
and O
some O
of O
the O
customary O
niceties O
is O
worth O
spending O
money O
on. O
It O
belongs O
to O
a O
species O
of O
restaurant O
that O
is O
no O
longer O
in O
great O
supply O
in O
Manhattan, B-LOC
let O
alone O
on O
the O
intersection O
where O
the O
green O
neon O
of O
the O
Olive B-DISH
Garden I-DISH
faces O
off O
across O
Seventh B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
against I-LOC
the O
giant O
candy B-FOOD
bars I-FOOD
of O
Hershey's B-LOC
Chocolate I-LOC
World. I-LOC
It O
also O
marks O
Mr. O
Fraser's O
first O
arabesques O
on O
the O
stage O
of O
formal O
dining O
since O
Dovetail B-EST
closed O
last O
year. O
These O
are O
early O
days O
for O
701West, B-EST
but O
so O
far O
I've O
found O
the O
cooking O
more O
original O
and O
appealing O
than O
Dovetail's B-EST
in O
its O
final O
phase. O
As O
you O
know O
if O
you've O
tried O
the O
fried-cauliflower B-DISH
buns I-DISH
at O
Nix, B-EST
or O
the O
ramen-style B-DISH
boiled I-DISH
eggs I-DISH
at O
the O
Loyal B-EST
whose O
yolks B-FOOD
are O
red O
with O
a O
film O
of O
jellied B-FOOD
chile I-FOOD
oil, I-FOOD
Mr. O
Fraser O
has O
a O
playful, O
imaginative O
streak. O
He O
needs O
it O
at O
701West, B-EST
where O
there O
is O
no O
real O
theme O
beyond O
wine B-FOOD
and O
style. O
But O
there O
is O
enough O
creativity O
across O
the O
menu, O
on O
which O
he O
collaborates O
with O
the O
chef O
de O
cuisine, O
Rob O
Lawson, O
and O
the O
pastry O
chef, O
Sébastien O
Rouxel, O
to O
make O
dinner O
the O
engaging, O
somewhat O
eccentric O
experience O
it O
is O
clearly O
meant O
to O
be. O
Before O
the O
first O
courses O
appear, O
for O
example, O
there O
may O
be O
a O
"cauliflower B-DISH
mille-feuille," I-DISH
the O
raw O
vegetable B-FOOD
shaved O
into O
white O
sheets O
that O
are O
softened O
by O
chilled O
mezcal B-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
and O
then O
topped O
with O
sturgeon B-FOOD
caviar. I-FOOD
It's O
enticingly O
off-kilter, O
and O
another O
frequent O
amuse O
manages O
to O
outdo O
it: O
a O
spoonful O
or O
so O
of O
white-asparagus B-DISH
foam I-DISH
above I-DISH
a I-DISH
warm I-DISH
custard I-DISH
of I-DISH
sunflower-seed I-DISH
butter, I-DISH
dense O
and O
nutty O
and O
sweet O
with O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
honey. B-FOOD
This O
is O
luxury O
dining O
in O
its O
way, O
which O
is O
not O
the O
predictable O
way. O
The O
menu O
proposes O
three O
courses O
for O
$98, O
but O
a O
server O
informed O
me O
that O
"we O
also O
have O
à O
la O
carte, O
if O
that's O
more O
your O
rhythm O
for O
the O
evening." O
Frequently O
the O
surprises O
come O
in O
the O
form O
of O
an O
unexpected O
tweak O
dealt O
to O
a O
vegetable. B-FOOD
Slowly O
cooked O
in O
beet B-FOOD
juice, I-FOOD
a O
whole O
beet B-FOOD
takes O
on O
the O
glistening O
ruby O
intensity O
of O
raw B-FOOD
bluefin I-FOOD
tuna. I-FOOD
There O
is O
an O
appetizer O
of O
actual O
bluefin B-FOOD
as O
well, O
and O
it O
has O
the O
precise, O
Japanese-informed O
minimalism O
of O
a O
dish O
you'd O
get O
at O
Jean-Georges, B-EST
with O
tiny O
spring B-FOOD
peas I-FOOD
and O
young B-FOOD
turnip I-FOOD
greens I-FOOD
and O
an O
electrifying O
white O
cloud O
of O
grated O
horseradish. B-FOOD
In O
a O
dish O
of O
fava B-DISH
agnolotti, I-DISH
the O
X O
factor O
is O
the O
bright, O
almost O
effervescent O
sparkle O
of O
vinegar-marinated O
tomatoes O
and O
their O
juices O
stirred O
into O
a O
Parmesan-rind O
broth. O
There O
is O
one O
mystifying O
appetizer O
in O
which O
the O
dueling O
tidal O
flavors O
of O
sea O
urchin O
and O
squid-ink O
risotto O
are O
allowed O
to O
cancel O
each O
other O
out. O
For O
the O
most O
part, O
though, O
the O
plates O
don't O
overreach, O
for O
all O
the O
inventiveness O
on O
display. O
Asparagus O
dipped O
in O
aioli O
is O
a O
good O
idea, O
of O
course, O
but O
what O
if O
the O
asparagus O
has O
been O
steamed O
inside O
a O
wrapper O
of O
thinly O
shaved O
cedar O
until O
it O
is O
nearly O
as O
smoky O
as O
country O
bacon? O
And O
what O
if O
the O
aioli O
is O
enhanced O
by O
truffles? O
It O
may O
sound O
overworked, O
but O
it O
is O
such O
a O
thrill O
that O
one O
of O
my O
guests O
asked O
for O
another O
plate O
before O
we O
could O
move O
on O
to O
the O
main O
courses, O
throwing O
the O
rhythm O
for O
the O
evening O
right O
out O
the O
window. O
The O
night O
will O
pause O
again O
if O
one O
of O
the O
main O
courses O
is O
the O
sweet O
potato, O
as O
everyone O
tries O
to O
figure O
out O
where O
it O
got O
its O
creaminess O
and O
savory O
depth. O
Even O
once O
you O
know O
it's O
been O
sealed O
up O
and O
baked O
inside O
a O
little O
coffin O
of O
sourdough O
that O
is O
streaked O
with O
green O
threads O
of O
wakame O
seaweed, O
you O
still O
can't O
quite O
believe O
that O
all O
this O
flavor O
has O
been O
achieved O
with O
an O
ordinary O
sweet O
potato. O
Some O
of O
the O
large O
pieces O
of O
fish O
and O
meat O
are O
showstoppers O
on O
their O
own, O
like O
the O
lobster O
that O
rests O
for O
four O
days O
in O
aged-beef O
fat O
before O
being O
broiled O
and O
set O
over O
some O
jammy O
ratatouille. O
When O
they O
are O
not, O
something O
else O
on O
the O

The O
long O
slab O
of O
roasted O
duck O
breast O
dredged O
in O
powdered O

would O
keep O
my O
attention O
even O
without O
its O
sidekick, O
a O
curiously O
likable O
risotto O
made O
from O

In O

Mr. O

a O
lighter-than-air O
quality O

Hovering O
over O
a O
crunchy O
buckwheat O
pastry O
crust O
is O
a O
wavy O
sea O
of O

cream O
infused O

It's O
earthy O
and O
ethereal O
at O
the O

time. O
He O
even O
knows O
what O
to O
do O
with O
white O
chocolate, O
aerating O
it O
into O
a O
mousse O
to O
frost O
an O
English-pea O
sponge O
cake, O
and O
giving O
it O
a O
piercing O
sour-cherry O
sorbet O
as O
a O
foil. O
All O
seven O
captains O
working O
at O
701West O
are O
sommeliers, O
listed O
by O
name O
on O
the O
menu; O
they O
are O
assisted O
by O
back O
servers O
who O
are O
sommeliers O
in O
training. O
This O
is O
one O
of O
those O
innovations O
in O
service O
that O
seems O
obvious O
now O
that O
somebody's O
actually O
doing O
it. O
The O
meal O
can O
become O
an O
evening-long O
conversation O
about O
wine; O
the O
sommeliers O
even O
invite O
you O
to O
play O
the O
wine-insiders' O
game O
of O
guessing O
the O
identity O
of O
a O
mystery O
pour O
in O
a O
black O
glass. O
It O
is O
slightly O
incredible O
that O
a O
restaurant O
that O
tries O
so O
hard O
to O
give O
wine O
equal O
status O
with O
the O
cooking O
does O
not O
have O
more O
bottles O
for O
under O
$80. O
That O
said, O
the O
ones O
it O
does O
have O
tend O
to O
be O
very O
good O
and O
fairly O
priced. O
Besides O
701West, O
Mr. O
Fraser O
is O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
deep-dish O
focaccia, O
carrot O
Bolognese O
and O
"billboard O
burger" O
at O
the O
Terrace O
and O
Outdoor O
Gardens, O
which O
is O
open O
all O
day O
on O
the O
ninth O
floor. O
He O
also O
oversees O
the O
dinner-theater O
menus O
at O
the O
Paradise O
Club O
on O
the O
seventh O
floor, O
which O
is O
currently O
staging O
"The O
Devouring," O
a O
neo-Burlesque O
extravaganza O
(juggling, O
sword O
swallowing, O
aerial O
acrobatics) O
purportedly O
inspired O
by O
William O
Blake. O
This O
was O
no O
doubt O
the O
destination O
of O
the O
stilt O
walker O
I O
nearly O
ran O
into O
in O
the O
lobby O
one O
night. O
Dressed O
in O
scarlet O
from O
head O
to O
heel, O
she O
got O
along O
faster O
on O
her O
stilts O
than O
I O
do O
on O
my O
own O
legs. O
She O
was O
the O
first O
thing O
I've O
seen O
in O
years O
that O
gave O
me O
hope O
for O
the O
future O
of O
Times O

The O
high O
cost O
of O
doing O
business O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
takes O
a O
toll O
on O
many O
restaurants O
in O
the O
long O
run, O
but O
it O
can O
also O
lead O
to O
compromises O
whose O
shortcomings O
become O
part O
of O
the O
fun O
-- O
for O
diners, O
at O
least. O
If O
Darryl O
and O
Melissa O
Burnette O
had O
been O
able O
to O
afford O
to O
rent O
a O
space O
bigger O
than O
275 O
square O
feet O
for O
their O
restaurant, O
Belle B-EST
Harlem I-EST
, O
Mr. O
Burnette O
might O
do O
the O
cooking O
behind O
a O
wall O
instead O
of O
behind O
a O
counter. O
Ms. O
Burnette, O
his O
wife O
and O
business O
partner, O
might O
spend O
all O
night O
going O
in O
and O
out O
a O
swinging O
kitchen O
door O
instead O
of O
paying O
attention O
to O
the O
customers O
sitting O
at O
the O
12 O
seats O
in O
the O
restaurant's O
single O
room. O
At O
this O
point, O
after O
three O
years O
in O
business, O
Belle B-EST
Harlem I-EST
might O
be O
run O
by O
employees, O
and O
the O
Burnettes O
might O
come O
in O
a O
few O
times O
a O
week O
to O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
things. O
Instead O
they O
have O
a O
paid O
staff O
of O
one. O
His O
name O
is O
Alex O
Geudelekian. O
He O
was O
eating O
dinner O
there O
one O
night, O
noticed O
that O
the O
weeds O
were O
growing O
up O
around O
Mr. O
Burnette's O
ankles, O
asked O
if O
he O
needed O
help, O
and O
has O
been O
the O
sous-chef O
ever O
since. O
The O

with I-DISH
duck I-DISH
breast I-DISH
being O
seared O
on O
one O

you O

you O
step O

on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
Adam B-LOC
Clayton I-LOC
Powell I-LOC
Jr. I-LOC
Boulevard I-LOC
from O
Striver's B-LOC
Row. I-LOC
You O
might O
not O
hear O
the O
hiss O
of O
chicken B-FOOD
being O
fried O
inside O
buttermilk B-FOOD
batter I-FOOD
before O
it O
is O
arranged O
between O
standing O
partitions O
of O

tied O

by O
an O
amber O
river O
of O
truffled B-FOOD
maple I-FOOD
syrup I-FOOD
warmed O
with O
jalapeños B-FOOD
and O
bananas. B-FOOD
If O
you O
didn't O
hear O
the O
low O
roar O
of O
a O
Searzall O
torch O
as O
it O
warms O
a O
plate O
and O
then O
melts O
and O
browns O
a O
patch O
of O
Cheddar, B-FOOD
you O
might O
not O
know O
that O
you're O
about O
to O
be O
served O
Mr. O
Burnette's O
cheese-steak B-DISH
crostini. I-DISH
(These O
are O
small O
toasts B-FOOD
stacked O
with O
seared B-FOOD
filet I-FOOD
and O
melted B-FOOD
cheese, I-FOOD

in O

onions B-FOOD

have O
been O
caramelized O
until O
they're O

The O
Cheddar B-FOOD
would O
cause O
every O
Philadelphian O
who O
lives O
within O
10 O
blocks O
of O
East B-LOC
Passyunk I-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
to O
pick O
up O
the O
nearest O
blunt O
object, O
but O
it O
makes O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
sense O
when O
you O
taste O
it.) O
Some O
of O
Belle B-EST
Harlem's I-EST
space O
limitations O
are, O
in O
fact, O
a O
little O
constricting. O
When O
the O
place O
is O
full, O
some O
customers O
have O
to O
ride O
sidesaddle, O
their O
knees O
angled O
away O
from O
the O
counter, O
because O
if O
they O
faced O
it O
head-on O
they'd O
cut O
off O
the O
narrow O
path O
to O
the O
restroom O
in O
the O
back. O
But O
275 O
square O
feet O
are O
what O
the O
Burnettes O
have O
to O
work O
with, O
and O
they O
have O
made O
this O
shallow O
sliver O
into O
something O
rare O
not O
just O
in O
Harlem B-LOC
but O
in O
all O
Manhattan. B-LOC
One O
of O
the O
peculiarities O
of O
dining O
in O
the O
city, O
circa O
2019, O
is O
that O
the O
more O
high-functioning O
a O
restaurant O
is, O
the O
less O
likely O
you O
are O
to O
encounter O
a O
proprietor. O
There O
are O
exceptions, O
of O
course, O
but O
often O
the O
most O
successful O
restaurateurs O
are O
very O
busy O
people, O
so O
they O
leave O
their O
dining O
rooms O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
professional O
managers. O
Proprietors O
aren't O
always O
as O
smooth O
as O
professionals, O
but O
they O
are O
as O
attuned O
to O
what O
goes O
on O
in O
their O
dining O
rooms O
as O
new O
parents O
are O
to O
the O
noises O
coming O
from O
a O
bassinet. O
I O
never O
quite O
felt O
as O
if O
I O
were O
attending O
a O
dinner O
party O
in O
the O
Burnettes' O
apartment, O
which O
is O
the O
feeling O
they O
say O
they're O
going O
for, O
but O
I O
always O
knew O
I O
was O
in O
a O
place O
that O
somebody O
cared O
about. O
Their O
original O
plan O
was O
to O
feed O
everyone O
the O
same O
meal O
-- O
a O
tasting O
menu. O
"We O
found O
out O
pretty O
quickly O
Harlem B-LOC
wasn't O
ready," O
Mr. O
Burnette O
said O
in O
an O
interview. O
How O
quickly? O
"We O
tried O
one O
night." O
Belle B-EST
Harlem I-EST
rolled O
out O
an O
à O
la O
carte O
menu O
the O
next O
day. O
It O
stuck. O
The O
first O
half O
is O
given O
to O
smaller O
plates, O
although O
one O
of O
the O
hallmarks O
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
that O
the O
Burnettes O
don't O
serve O
anything O
truly O
small. O
They O
want O
you O
to O
eat. O
Two O
people O
could O
get O
away O
with O
ordering O
one O
main O
course O
and O
two O
appetizers, O
though O
I'd O
urge O
anyone O
going O
to O
Belle B-EST
Harlem I-EST
not O
to O
overlook O
dessert. O
These O
introductory O
dishes O
are O
where O
Mr. O
Burnette O
takes O
casual O
American B-CUISINE
vernacular O
food O
like O
chicken B-DISH
and I-DISH
waffles I-DISH
out O
for O
a O
stroll. O
His O
fried B-DISH
chicken I-DISH
has O
a O
convoluted, O
frilly O
crust, B-FOOD
with O
plenty O
of O
golden O
surface O
area O
for O
the O
jalapeño-banana B-FOOD
syrup I-FOOD
to O
get O
lost O
in. O
The O
pizzelles B-DISH
are O
a O
new O
idea O
of O
his, O
replacing O
the O
regular O
waffles B-FOOD
he O
used O
to O
make, O
and O
they O
work O
best O
when O
he O
cooks O
them O
to O
a O
dark O
crisp. O
This O
is O
also O
where O
you'll O
find O
the O
cheese-steak B-DISH
crostini, I-DISH
as O
well O
as O
spring B-DISH
rolls I-DISH
stuffed I-DISH
with I-DISH
macaroni I-DISH
and I-DISH
cheese I-DISH
-- O
kid O
food O
in O
a O
fried B-FOOD
shell, I-FOOD
yes, O
but O
a O
bacon B-FOOD
marmalade I-FOOD
with O
fresh B-FOOD
dill I-FOOD
makes O
it O
unexpectedly O
complex, O
a O
chef's O
dish. O
The O
bottom O
of O
the O
menu O
is O
more O
substantial: O
The O
pan-seared, B-DISH
smoked I-DISH
pork I-DISH
tenderloin, I-DISH
for O
instance, O
is O
bigger O
than O
what O
usually O
crosses O
a O
12-seat O
tasting O
counter. O
This O
month, O
Mr. O
Burnette O
is O
laying O
the O
barrels O
of O
pork B-DISH
over O
a O
cherry B-DISH
compote I-DISH
with O
basil B-DISH
leaves, I-DISH
with O
a O
few O
snap O
peas O
for O
added O
sweetness. O
He O
brings O
a O
keen O
sense O
of O
what O
to O
do O
with O
ingredients O
as O
they O
come O
into O
season O
to O
the O
vegetables O
he O
grows O
on O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
Burnettes' O
apartment O
building, O
a O
block O
away. O
The O
tiny O
yields O
of O
an O
urban O
garden O
wouldn't O
satisfy O
a O
larger O
restaurant, O
but O
they O
can O
shuffle O
right O
onto O
the O
menu O
at O
Belle O
Harlem, O
and O
shuffle O
off O
again O
when O
they're O
all O
gone. O
This O
month, O
there O
are O
thin O
bands O
of O
zucchini O
under O
the O
beef O
tenderloin, O
and O
young, O
soft O
favas O
around O
the O
lobster O
salad. O
There O
are O
more O
favas O
over O
pan-seared O
dorade O
and O
garden O
chives, O
with O
the O
almost O
transparently O
thin O
noodles O
tossed O
with O
butter O
and O
cream O
and O
tucked O
under O
the O
fish O
fillet. O
Mr. O
Burnette, O
who O
is O
black O
and O
who O
grew O
up O
in O
rural O
southwestern O
Virginia, O
has O
said O
he O
worked O
up O
the O
nerve O
to O
move O
north O
for O
culinary O
school O
after O
seeing O
the O
chef O
Marcus O
Samuelsson O
on O
television O
. O
("I O
thought, O
hell, O
if O
he O
could O
do O
it, O
I O
could O
do O
it, O
too.") O
Sometimes O
today, O
in O
his O
restaurant O
less O
than O
a O
mile O
away O
from O
Mr. O
Samuelsson's O
Red O
Rooster O
Harlem O
, O
he O
reaches O
back O
to O
his O
childhood O
for O
ideas. O
A O
dessert O
in O
a O
glass O
called O
the O
Triflin' O
Ho-Ho O
is O
an O
acknowledged O
homage O
to O
Hostess O
cakes, O
although O
there O
is O
an O
English O
trifle O
in O
the O
mix, O
too, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
trace O
of O
Spice O
Market O
, O
where O
Mr. O
Burnette O
once O
worked. O
The O
chocolate O
in O
the O
broken O
shards O
of O
cake O
pulses, O
intriguingly, O
with O
Urfa O
pepper; O
its O
heat O
rubs O
up O
against O
the O
passion-fruit O
cream, O
brandied O
cherries O
and O
whipped O
cream O
that O
fill O
the O
glass. O
A O
year O
ago, O
Belle O
Harlem O
eliminated O
tips O
and O
raised O
prices. O
If O
you O
take O
that O
into O
account, O
check O
totals O
can O
still O
seem O
high, O
especially O
if O
you O
happen O
to O
be O
served O
pale, O
limp O
housemade O
potato O
chips O
or O
a O
$42 O
duck O
breast O
with O
a O
bitter O
arugula O
sauce O
and O
a O
poached O
pear O
that O
tastes O
like O
alcohol. O
The O
margins O
must O
be O
tight. O
At O
times O
you O
almost O
hear O
them O
squeak, O
as O
when O
Ms. O
Burnette O
anxiously O
reminds O
you O
that O
you O
were O
a O
few O
minutes O
late O
and O
suggests O
you O
order O
quickly O
so O
she O
can O
turn O
the O
seat O
in O
time O
for O
the O
next O
reservation. O
A O
professional O
manager O
might O
have O
brought O
a O
more O
soothing O
manner O
to O
the O
exchange. O
But O
a O
manager O
might O
not O
be O
as O
genuinely O
happy O
to O
see O
a O
party O
of O
three O
walk O
in O
without O
a O
reservation O
just O
when O
three O
seats O
had O
opened O
up, O
and O
might O
not O
smile O
as O
widely O
when O
told O
that O
the O
sparkling O
rosé O
is O
fantastic O
with O
the O
lobster O
salad, O
and O
would O
she O
mind O
pouring O
another O
glass? O
No, O
she O
doesn't O
mind O
at O
all. O

those O

With O
his O

Phil O

scores O
of O
new O

Nearly O
40 O
of O
them O
are O
still O
up O

running, O
15 O
in O
New B-LOC
York. I-LOC
Devising O
menus O
for O
each O
new O
place, O
he O
repeats O
himself O
occasionally, O
but O
more O
often O
he O
rearranges O
old O
patterns. O
Lime B-FOOD
juice I-FOOD
is O
traded O
for O
yuzu, B-FOOD
cherry B-FOOD
vinegar I-FOOD
comes O
in O

balsamic. B-FOOD
Almost O
always, O
the O
result O
is O
a O
dish O
that O
is O
similar O
enough O
to O
his O
past O
work O
to O
be O
recognizably O
Vongerichtenesque O

different O
enough O
to O

This O
service O
would O
come O
in O
handy O
in O
times O
like O
the O
present, O
when O
critics O
and O
superfans O
are O
trying O
to O
metabolize O
the O
two O
restaurants O
Mr. O
Vongerichten O
opened O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
during O
a O
single O
week O
in O
May. O
One O
is O
the O
Paris B-EST
Café I-EST
, O
a O
casual, O
all-day O
proposition O
inside O
Eero O
Saarinen's O
T.W.A. B-LOC
terminal I-LOC
at I-LOC
Kennedy I-LOC
International I-LOC
Airport, I-LOC
now O
gloriously O
resurrected O
as O
the O
TWA B-LOC
Hotel. I-LOC
The O
second O
is O
a O
polished O
seafood B-TYPE
house I-TYPE
that O
sits O
out O
in O
the O
East B-LOC
River I-LOC
on O
the O
end O
of O
Pier B-LOC
17, I-LOC
next O
to O
the O
wreck O
of O
the O
old O
Fulton B-EST
Fish I-EST
Market; I-EST
it's O
called O
the O
Fulton B-EST
. O
Because O
I've O
been O
to O
both O
so O
recently, O
I O
can O
report O
confidently O
that O
the O
Fulton B-EST
slices O
deep-red O
strawberries B-FOOD
over O
strawberry B-FOOD
ice I-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
and O
a O
sorbet B-FOOD
made O
from O
strawberries B-FOOD
and O
red B-FOOD
wine I-FOOD
to O
make O
its O
strawberry B-DISH
sundae, I-DISH
while O
the O
one O
at O
the O
Paris B-EST
Café I-EST
substitutes O
dried B-FOOD
strawberries. I-FOOD
That O
version O
isn't O
bad, O
but O
there O
is O
an O
undeniable O
difference O
between O
fresh B-FOOD
summer I-FOOD
berries I-FOOD
and O
dehydrated O
ones, O
and O
that O
difference O
suggests O
the O
quality O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
restaurants. O
The O
best O
reasons O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Paris B-EST
Café I-EST
are O
Saarinen's O
glass O
walls, O
gliding O
curves O
and O
suspended O
catwalk, O
although O
the O
dining O
areas O
are O
swell, O
too, O
smartly O
evoking O
Raymond O
Loewy's O
original O
design O
for O
the O
space, O
which O
looked O
like O
a O
coffee B-DIET
shop I-DIET
on O
the O
moon. O
The O
place O
has O
some O
likable O
pizzas B-FOOD
and O
salads, B-FOOD
and O
it O
vaults O
clear O
over O
the O
other O
restaurants O
at O
the O
airport. O
But O
the O
recipes O
seem O
designed O
not O
to O
push O
the O
kitchen O
too O
hard, O
the O
menu O
is O
even O
more O
Vongerichtenesque O
than O
usual, O
and O
any O
dishes O
involving O
fruits B-FOOD
or O
vegetables B-FOOD
will O
make O
you O
wonder O
whether O
the O
produce O
truck O
drove O
to O
La B-LOC
Guardia I-LOC
instead. O
The O
Fulton, B-EST
though, O
is O
a O
grown-up O
production. O
Under O
the O
day-to-day O
command O
of O
Noah O
Poses, O
the O
executive O
chef, O
it O
is O
easily O
the O
best O
seafood O
restaurant O
to O
open O
in O
Manhattan B-LOC
since O
the O
Pool B-EST
, O
and O
easier O
to O
afford. O
Yes, O
a O
handful O
of O
items O
on O
the O
menu O
have O
that O
glassy-eyed O
stare, O
but O
almost O
everything O
else O
comes O
through. O
To O
get O
to O
the O
Fulton, B-EST
you O
have O
to O
walk O
almost O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
pier, O
where O
some O
tall O
planters O
cordon O
off O
the O
Fulton's B-EST
outdoor O
tables. O
All O
the O
tables, O
indoors O
and O
out, O
have O
a O
view O
of O
the O
Brooklyn B-LOC
Bridge, I-LOC
but O
the O
best O
backdrops O
are O
inside O
and O
upstairs, O
where O
you O
can O
see O
that O
you're O
surrounded O
by O
water. O
Mentioning O
the O
view O
as O
a O
selling O
point O
will O
make O
some O
New O
Yorkers O
cringe. O
But O
Pier B-LOC
17's I-LOC
developer, O
clearly O
hoping O
to O
erase O
the O
stigma, O
has O
recruited O
David O
Chang, O
Andrew O
Carmellini O
and O
Mr. O
Vongerichten. O
Day O
trippers O
and O
tourists O
will O
love O
the O
Fulton, B-EST
in O
any O
case, O
and O
they O
will O
be O
right. O
True, O
the O
outdoor O
patio O
feels O
like O
the O
beachside O
bar O
of O
some O
island O
resort, O
with O
soft-core O
club O
music O
playing O
and O
servers O
carrying O
too-small O
trays O
slinking O
around O
in O
long O
skirts. O
Once O
you O
get O
inside, O
though, O
the O
tension O
in O
the O
open O
kitchen O
lets O
you O
know O
this O
is, O
in O
fact, O
New B-LOC
York. I-LOC
Running O
a O
seafood B-DIET
house I-DIET
gives O
Mr. O
Vongerichten O
an O
opening O
to O
lead O
with O
one O
of O
his O
strong O
suits, O
raw B-FOOD
fish. I-FOOD
The O
sea B-DISH
trout I-DISH
tartare I-DISH
is O
stirred O
with O
raw O
oysters O
and O
horseradish, O
which O
creates O
the O
uncanny O
momentary O
illusion O
that O
you're O
eating O
beef. O
White O
ponzu, O
made O
from O
white O
soy O
sauce, O
is O
the O
centerpiece O
of O
a O
platter O
of O
iced O
sashimi. O
Local O
fluke, O
taking O
a O
bath O
in O
habanero O
vinaigrette, O
is O
topped O
with O
mint O
and O
Sichuan O
buttons; O
even O
if O
you O
know O
what's O
coming O
-- O
Sichuan O
buttons O
are O
the O
flower O
buds O
of O
the O
toothache O
plant, O
which O
when O
chewed, O
produce O
a O
numbing O
and O
cooling O
sensation O
-- O
the O
dish O
is O
a O
surprise. O
The O
Fulton's O
Manhattan O
clam O
chowder O
is O
spicy, O
thick O
with O
potatoes O
and O
a O
healthy O
portion O
of O
clams. O
It's O
the O
rare O
version O
that O
tastes O
as O
good O
as O
it O
sounds, O
although O
purists O
will O
deduct O
one O
point O
for O
the O
absence O
of O
oyster O
crackers. O
There's O
a O
very O
intriguing O
sesame-poppy O
crust O
on O
the O
soft-shell O
crabs; O
you O
have O
just O
enough O
time O
to O
register O
the O
seeds O
before O
a O
potent O
green O
salsa O
of O
coriander O
and O
jalapeño O
kicks O
in. O
Few O
chefs O
are O
as O
skilled O
at O
using O
acidity, O
heat O
and O
salt O
to O
bring O
definition O
to O
a O
dish. O
So O
it's O
a O
surprise O
to O
realize O
how O
generic O
the O
Fulton's O
fish O
stew O
is, O
or O
to O
wonder O
what O
the O
ingredient O
is O
that O
throws O
the O
red O
snapper O
ceviche O
in O
watermelon O
juice O
out O
of O
whack. O
A O
separate O
menu O
card O
lets O
you O
know O
that O
most O
of O
the O
seafood O
in O
the O
main O
courses O
can O
be O
ordered O
"simply O
cooked." O
I O
was O
never O
curious O
enough O
to O
try O
it, O
being O
too O
distracted O
by O
the O
salmon O
in O
a O
cumin-coriander O
seed O
crust O
so O
fragrant O
it O
turns O
heads; O
the O
sea O
bass O
and O
carrots O
in O
a O
life-affirming O
pool O
of O
lemon-turmeric O
sauce; O
and O
the O
detailed-oriented O
fish O
and O
crisps, O
a O
brick O
of O
flounder O
kept O
at O
scalding O
temperature O
by O
a O
leakproof O
and O
supernaturally O
crunchy O
buckwheat O
batter. O
Served O
with O
mashed O
fresh O
peas, O
it O
could O
almost O
pass O
for O
English O
if O
it O
didn't O
come O
with O
saffron O
aioli. O
Most O
distracting O
of O
all O
is O
the O
whole O
black O
bass O
baked O
inside O
a O
fish-shaped O
pastry O
lavishly O
decorated O
with O
golden O
scales, O
fins, O
gills O
and O
other O
parts O
the O
bass O
itself O
won't O
be O
needing O
anymore. O
It O
takes O
a O
good O
10 O
minutes O
to O
unveil O
it, O
fillet O
it O
and O
then O
plate O
it O
together O
with O
slices O
of O
crust, O
some O
tomato O
concassé O
and O
a O
sauce O
choron, O
and O
I O
doubt O
many O
movies O
playing O
in O
theaters O
now O
can O
rival O
it O
for O
entertainment. O
Wonderful O
as O
it O
is O
to O
see O
one O
of O
the O
showpieces O
of O
pre-nouvelle O
cuisine O
given O
so O
much O
attention, O
you O
could O
ask O
whether O
whole O
fish O
en O
croute O
really O
makes O
sense O
after, O
say, O
kale O
salad. O
Mr. O
Vongerichten's O
technical O
approach O
may O
let O
him O
generate O
a O
menu O
full O
of O
smart, O
reliably O
pleasurable O
food, O
but O
it O
doesn't O
guarantee O
that O
it O
will O
all O
hang O
together. O
The O
pastry O
menu O
does, O
though, O
by O
sneakily O
staying O
true O
to O
classic O
American O
desserts. O
What's O
sold O
as O
Meyer O
lemon O
pudding O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
more O
like O
a O
lemon O
meringue O
tart O
with O
a O
quick, O
pulsing O
acidity; O
the O
apricot O
pie O
is O
more O
like O
a O
crisp, O
with O
oatmeal O
streusel O
on O
top; O
and O
the O
highlight O
of O
the O
strawberry O
sundae O
isn't O
the O
fresh O
fruit O
but O
the O
strawberry O
ice O
cream, O
its O
flavor O
straight O
out O
of O
the O
summertime O
ice O
cream O
shacks O
in O
a O
thousand O
vacation O
towns. O

Some O
restaurants O
push O
their O
tasting O
menus. O
Rezdôra B-DIET
doesn't. O
A O
few O
steps O
down O
from O
the O
sidewalk, O
on O
the O
same O
block O
of O
East B-LOC
20th I-LOC
Street I-LOC
as O
Gramercy B-EST
Tavern I-EST
and O
the O
brownstone O
where O
Teddy O
Roosevelt O
was O
born, O
Rezdôra B-EST
lists O
a O
"regional B-DISH
pasta I-DISH
tasting" I-DISH
for O
$90 O
on O
its O
menu. O
The O
region O
in O
question O
is O
Emilia-Romagna, B-LOC
whose O
refinements O
in O
the O
art O
of O
rolling O
and O
saucing O
noodles B-FOOD
are O
admired O
even O
by O
Italians O
from O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
country. O
Chances O
are O
that O
most O
of O
the O
five O
pastas B-FOOD
in O
the O
tasting O
are O
exactly O
the O
ones O
you O
picture O
when O
you O
think O
about O
Emilia-Romagna, B-DISH
starting O
with O
tortellini B-DISH
in I-DISH
brodo. I-DISH
This O
would O
seem O
to O
make O
it O
an O
easy O
sell, O
and O
yet O
servers O
at O
Rezdôra B-EST
never O
tried O
to O
sell O
me O
on O
the O
tasting. O
Until O
I O
asked O
about O
it O
one O
night, O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
the O
separate O
menu O
card O
that O
describes O
each O
course. O
With O
some O
hesitation, O
I O
ordered O
it. O
Every O
one O
of O
the O
pastas B-FOOD
was O
excellent, O
and O
one O
or O
two O
would O
be O
worth O
walking O
a O
long O
distance O
for. O
After O
the O
fifth O
course O
was O
gone, O
it O
slowly O
dawned O
on O
me O
that O
Stefano O
Secchi, O
Rezdôra's B-FOOD
chef O
and O
one O
of O
its O
owners, O
had O
just O
laid O
down O
a O
straight O
flush. O
The O
tortellini B-FOOD
were O
penny-size O
hoops O
rolled O
around O
minced B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
blended I-FOOD
pork I-FOOD
in O
a O
parcel O
just O
big O
enough O
to O
suggest O
the O
idea O
of O
meat. B-FOOD
"This O
is O
a O
special O
broth B-FOOD
made O
from O
older O
chickens," B-FOOD
a O
server O
said O
as O
he O
poured O
a O
steaming O
liquid O
from O
a O
kettle O
over O
the O
tortellini. B-FOOD
It O
was O
the O
color O
of O
turkey B-FOOD
gravy. I-FOOD
The O
broth B-FOOD
spent O
about O
half O
a O
day O
on O
the O
burner; O
drew O
some O
of O
its O
power O
from O
melted B-FOOD
Parmigiano-Reggiano; I-FOOD
and O
was O
more O
intense O
than O
canned B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
broth I-FOOD
in O
roughly O
the O
same O
way O
that O
a O
dry-aged B-FOOD
rib-eye I-FOOD
is O
more O
intense O
than O
a O
McDonald's B-EST
all-beef B-FOOD
patty. I-FOOD
This O
was O
followed O
by O
a O
smooth, O
almost O
fluffy O
tomato-basil B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
over O
maccheroni B-FOOD
al I-FOOD
pettine, I-FOOD
delicate O
tubes O
with O
ridges O
they O
get O
from O
being O
rolled O
by O
hand O
along O
a O
comb O
made O
for O
the O
job. O
Three O
straw-colored O
blobs O
that O
looked O
like O
melted B-FOOD
Brie I-FOOD
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
glossy O
and O
wonderful O
fonduta B-DISH
made O
from O
Parmigiano-Reggiano. B-FOOD
From O
there O
it O
was O
on O
to O
tortelloni, O
each O
about O
three O
bites O
big, O
filled O
with O
plush O
fresh O
ricotta B-FOOD
and O
shiny O
with O
melted B-FOOD
brown I-FOOD
butter I-FOOD
in O
which O
a O
few O
sage B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
had O
been O
bubbled. O
If O
we O
are O
talking O
about O
Emilia-Romagna B-LOC
we O
have O
to O
talk O
about O
ragù, B-DISH
and O
that O
was O
the O
next O
course, O
tossed O
with O
slim O
ribbons O
of O
tagliolini. B-FOOD
Some O
people O
will O
find O
the O
ragù B-DISH
saltier O
than O
they O
like. O
Almost O
everyone O
will O
find O
it O
more O
tender O
and O
smooth O
than O
the O
last O
20 O
or O
30 O
ragús B-FOOD
they O
ate. O
The O
tour O
winds O
down O
with O
round, O
meat-filled B-DISH
anolini, I-DISH
a O
branch O
of O
the O
ravioli B-FOOD
family O
that O
resides O
in O
Parma. B-LOC
They O
are O
served O
in O
something O
called O
crema B-FOOD
di I-FOOD
Parmigiano; I-FOOD
you O
will O
not O
be O
far O
off O
if O
you O
imagine O
an O
Alfredo B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
cooked O
for O
one O
of O
the O
more O
sybaritic O
Roman O
emperors. O
This O
is O
not O
Rome, B-LOC
though, O
and O
the O
sauce O
gets O
the O
tart O
counterpoint O
it O
needs O
from O
an O
inky, O
25-year-old O
balsamic B-FOOD
vinegar I-FOOD
poured O
straight O
from O
the O
bottle. O
Mr. O
Secchi O
blew O
into O
town O
in O
May O
on O
a O
small O
gust O
of O
publicity O
whipped O
up O
over O
his O
time O
at O
Osteria B-EST
Francescana I-EST
, O
the O
Modena B-EST
workshop O
where O
Massimo O
Bottura O
reconfigures O
the O
touchstone O
flavors O
of O
the O
region O
in O
dishes O
with O
names O
like O
"memories B-DISH
of I-DISH
a I-DISH
mortadella I-DISH
sandwich." I-DISH
Mr. O
Bottura's O
approach O
to O
menu O
writing O
seems O
to O
have O
rubbed O
off O
on O
Mr. O
Secchi O
more O
than O
his O
experimental O
urges O
did. O
At O
Rezdôra, B-EST
you O
are O
unlikely O
to O
catch O
the O
kitchen O
using O
any O
overtly O
modernist O
techniques, O
but O
you O
may O
well O
encounter O
"cherry B-DISH
season I-DISH
in I-DISH
Vignola," I-DISH
a O
pleasant O
if O
somewhat O
too O
soupy O
plate O
of O
stracciatella B-FOOD
with O
toasted B-FOOD
almonds, I-FOOD
almond B-FOOD
milk I-FOOD
and O
cherries B-FOOD
both O
sweet O

sour; O
or O
"cow B-DISH

a O
sirloin B-FOOD
basted O
with O
butter B-FOOD
whose O
richness O
is O
modulated O
by O
a O

of O
sweet B-FOOD
red I-FOOD
peppers; I-FOOD
or O
"Grandma B-DISH
walking I-DISH

a O

plate O

snap-pea B-FOOD
pods I-FOOD

little O

of O
spinach B-FOOD
pasta I-FOOD
filled O
with O
braised B-FOOD

If O
we O
are O
tracing O
influences, O
though, O
Mr. O
Secchi's O
cooking O
at O
Rezdôra B-EST
seems O
to O
have O
been O
molded O
at O
least O
as O
deeply O
by O
his O
time O
working O
at O
the O
pasta B-FOOD
station O
of O
another O
restaurant O
in O
Modena, B-LOC
Hosteria B-EST
Giusti I-EST

Laura O

Mr. O

channels O
in O
his O

should O
start O
with O
prosciutto B-FOOD
and O
other O
manifestations O
of O
salted B-FOOD
pork I-FOOD
draped O
over O
warm O
pillows O
of O
fried B-FOOD
dough I-FOOD
called O
gnocchi O
fritti. O
Before O
leaving O
Italy, O
Mr. O
Secchi O
also O
cooked O
at O
Antica O
Moka O
in O
Modena O
and O
All'Enoteca O
in O
the O
Piedmont; O
after O
coming O
back O
home O
to O
Dallas, O
where O
he O
grew O
up, O
he O
ran O
the O
kitchens O
of O
two O
restaurants O
his O
parents O
own O
there. O
Still, O
I O
suspect O
the O
Bottura O
connection O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
speed O
with O
which O
the O
bar O
stools O
fill O
up O
when O
the O
restaurant O
opens O
at O
5:30 O
each O
night, O
for O
the O
difficulty O
of O
reserving O
one O
of O
the O
other O
48 O
seats, O
and O
for O
the O
way O
would-be O
customers O
collect O
in O
eddies O
outside O
the O
door O
to O
strategize. O
Not O
much O
about O
the O
interior O
is O
likely O
to O
lure O
crowds; O
with O
its O
brick O
walls, O
timbered O
ceiling O
and O
bare O
wood O
tables, O
it O
looks O
like O
any O
number O
of O
Manhattan O
restaurants O
that O
emulate O
the O
trattorias, O
enotecas O
and O
osterias O
of O
Italy. O
And O
of O
course, O
people O
who O
eat O
at O
Rezdôra O
have O
a O
way O
of O
becoming O
repeat O
customers. O
They O
come O
back O
even O
though O
it O
is O
still O
a O
young O
restaurant O
and O
occasionally O
makes O
a O
young O
restaurant's O
mistakes. O
One O
night, O
the O
stewed O
cannellini O
beans O
placed O
alongside O
black O
sea O
bass O
and O
black O
garlic O
zabaglione O
were O
still O
crunchy; O
the O
rock O
shrimp O
served O
with O
strozzapreti O
could O
have O
been O
a O
little O
less O
tough O
and O
tasted O
a O
little O
shrimpier. O
And O
some O
of O
the O
original O
pastas O
aren't O
quite O
as O
stunning O
as O
the O
classics, O
but O
then O
every O
grandmother O
in O
Emilia-Romagna O
could O
have O
told O
you O
that. O
Mr. O
Secchi O
is O
still O
one O
of O
the O
most O
appealing O
new O
talents O
in O
years O
to O
enter O
the O
city's O
Italian O
restaurant O
scene, O
the O
kind O
of O
cook O
who O
can O
unite O
ordinary O
people O
who O
just O
like O
to O
eat O
pasta O
and O
the O
fanatics O
who O
collect O
menus O
from O
Osteria O
Francescana. O
(The O
date-stamped O
copy O
of O
the O
regional O
tasting O
menu O
that's O
given O
out O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
night, O
signed O
by O
Mr. O
Secchi O
and O
his O
kitchen O
crew, O
must O
be O
for O
this O
crowd.) O
He O
also O
has O
the O
good O
luck O
to O
come O
along O
when O
some O
of O
the O
figures O
who O
dominated O
New O
York's O
Italian O
landscape O
for O
the O
past O
two O
decades O
or O
so O
have O
either O
disappeared O
or O
gone O
into O
hibernation. O
There O
is O
one O
more O
workplace O
that O
I O
hope O
has O
left O
a O
mark O
on O
Mr. O
Secchi: O
his O
parents' O
restaurants O
in O
Texas, O
both O
of O
which O
are O
called O
Ferrari's O
Italian O
Villa O
& O
Chop O
House O
. O
The O
first O
has O
been O
in O
business O
since O
1983, O
a O
life O
span O
that O
any O
restaurateur O
would O
envy. O
The O
odds O
are O
against O
Rezdôra's O
being O
around O
36 O
years O
from O
now, O
but O
Mr. O
Secchi O
and O
his O
business O
partner O
have O
made O
one O
move O
that O
tends O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
longevity O
in O
New O
York O
restaurants. O
They O
bought O
the O
building. O

In O
the O
fall O
of O
1980, O
Patrick O
Clark, O
the O
first O
chef O
at O
Keith O
McNally's O
first O
restaurant, O
the O
Odeon B-EST
, O
helped O
introduce O
nouvelle O
cuisine O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
when O
it O
was O
all O
the O
rage O
in O
Europe. B-LOC
Nearly O
every O
place O
Mr. O
McNally O
has O
built O
since O
then O
has O
been O
a O
firm O
rejection O
of O
all O
that O
is O
fashionable O
in O
food, O
and O
each O
one O
has O
been, O
at O
least O
in O
its O
first O
few O
months, O
the O
most O
fashionable O
restaurant O
in O
town. O
The O
one O
he O
opened O
in O
early O
June O
in O
the O
meatpacking B-LOC
district, I-LOC
Pastis B-EST
, O
was O
assembled O
partly O
from O
the O
salvaged O
bones O
of O
a O
nearby O
restaurant O
he O
closed O
five O
years O
ago, O
Pastis. B-EST
(He O
salvaged O
the O
name, O
too.) O
The O
onion B-DISH
soup, I-DISH
the O
meaty B-DISH
snails I-DISH
sloshing O
around O
in O
the O
divots O
of O
a O
black O
iron O
snail O
pan O
with O
what O
must O
be O
half O
a O
pint O
of O
garlic B-FOOD
butter, I-FOOD
and O
a O
few O
other O
old O
war O
horses O
from O
the O
original O
menu O
have O
been O
summoned O
for O
one O
more O
joust O
on O
the O
battlefield. O
In O
short, O
the O
new O
Pastis B-EST
takes O
almost O
everything O
straight O
from O
the O
old O
Pastis B-EST
, O
which O
in O
turn O
took O
almost O
everything O
from O
the O
stodgiest, O
least O
trend-conscious O
sort O
of O
French B-CUISINE
cafes B-TYPE
and O
brasseries. B-TYPE
Needless O
to O
say, O
reservations O
are O
harder O
to O
come O
by O
than O
at O
any O
other O
New B-EST
York I-EST
restaurant O
that's O
opened O
this O
year. O
The O
paradox O
of O
this O
is O
that O
Pastis B-EST
is O
really O
meant O
for O
those O
nights O
when O
you O
decide O
to O
cancel O
your O
reservations O
at O
the O
little O
nine-seat O
tasting O
counter O
where O
the O
menu O
is O
inspired O
by O
Kieslowski's O
"Decalogue." B-EST
It O
is O
for O
those O
times O
when O
you O
get O
an O
urge O
to O
eat O
a O
Gruyère B-DISH
omelet I-DISH
after O
10 O
p.m., O
cooked O
medium-rare, O
flecked O
with O
herbs, B-FOOD
skillfully O
rolled O
and O
staunchly O
backed O
up O
by O
a O
cold O
white O
from O
the O
Savoie. O
Urges O
like O
that O
do O
not O
typically O
announce O
themselves O
three O
weeks O
in O
advance, O
and O
they O
don't O
tend O
to O
survive O
exposure O
to O
rooms O
filled O
with O
people O
who O
have O
read O
about O
Pastis O
on O
the O
blogs O
but O
haven't O
yet O
figured O
out O
what O
it O
is O
for. O
For O
much O
of O
his O
life, O
Mr. O
McNally O
has O
been O
chipping, O
cracking, O
distressing O
and O
weathering O
interiors O
that O
are O
the O
architectural O
equivalent O
of O
rumpled O
sweaters O
two O
sizes O
too O
large. O
Perhaps O
the O
largest O
and O
certainly O
the O
most O
rumpled O
of O
all O
is O
Pastis. O
It O
doesn't O
have O
the O
corner O
entrance O
it O
had O
at O
its O
former O
address, O
or O
the O
long O
communal O
table O
that O
sliced O
through O
the O
front O
room O
like O
a O
surfboard. O
And O
the O
shelves O
of O
cigarette O
packs O
are O
definitely O
gone. O
( O
You O
could O
still O
smoke O
in O
restaurants O
in O
1999, O
when O
Pastis O
opened.) O
But O
the O
magazine O
racks O
are O
back, O
along O
with O
the O
overhead O
fans O
turning O
steadily O
below O
a O
stamped O
tin O
ceiling. O
Once O
again O
the O
walls O
are O
covered O
with O
chipped O
subway O
tiles, O
white, O
framed O
by O
black O
grout. O
The O
chairs O
still O
don't O
match. O
The O
ambient O
light O
is O
the O
color O
of O
a O
Scotch O
and O
soda O
and O
makes O
everybody O
look O
the O
way O
they O
do O
after O
you've O
drunk O
one. O
On O
an O
antique O
mirror, O
or O
one O
that O
looks O
like O
an O
antique, O
someone O
has O
scrawled O
a O
menu O
of O
desserts, O
almost O
none O
of O
which O
Pastis O
actually O
serves. O
You O
can, O
however, O
get O
an O
energetically O
whisked O
dark-chocolate O
mousse O
under O
shaved O
curls O
of O
chocolate, O
or O
a O
baba O
au O
rhum O
so O
drenched O
in O
booze O
that O
it O
might O
spontaneously O
combust O
if O
it O
weren't O
being O
restrained O
by O
a O
white O
dune O
of O
whipped O
Chantilly O
cream. O
The O
most O
significant O
change O
from O
the O
first O
Pastis O
to O
the O
second O
happened O
offstage. O
Mr. O
McNally, O
who O
had O
a O
stroke O
two O
years O
ago, O
has O
brought O
on O
the O
restaurateur O
Stephen O
Starr O
as O
a O
partner O
who, O
essentially, O
manages O
everything O
except O
the O
design. O
Familiar O
faces O
from O
La O
Mercerie O
and O
other O
Starr O
enterprises O
work O
alongside O
loyal O
retainers O
from O
the O
McNally O
empire. O
The O
McNally O
troops O
are O
exquisitely O
poised, O
self-assured, O
able O
to O
spot O
a O
misplaced O
butter O
knife O
from O
across O
the O
street. O
The O
Starr O
cadre O
is O
more O
casual, O
and O
occasionally O
a O
server O
will O
ask O
your O
opinion O
of O
"the O
flavors O
so O
far," O
a O
question O
that O
has O
surely O
never O
been O
uttered O
at O
Minetta O
Tavern O
. O
Mr. O
Starr O
has O
oversight O
of O
the O
wine O
list, O
which O
is O
less O
conservative O
than O
a O
typical O
McNally O
lineup, O
and O
of O
the O
food, O
which O
has O
not O
been O
a O
strong O
suit O
of O
the O
McNally O
organization O
since O
the O
chefs O
Lee O
Hanson O
and O
Riad O
Nasr O
went O
out O
on O
their O
own. O
Pastis's O
chef, O
Michael O
Abt, O
was O
until O
recently O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
kitchen O
at O
the O
Washington O
restaurant O
Le O
Diplomate O
, O
which O
Mr. O
Starr O
owns. O
Better O
qualifications O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
conjure, O
given O
that O
Le O
Diplomate O
is O
essentially O
an O
imitation O
McNally O
restaurant. O
Taking O
his O
cues O
from O
the O
old O
days, O
Mr. O
Abt O
is O
putting O
out O
simple, O
unadorned, O
hunger-obliterating O
French O
cuisine O
drawn O
from O
the O
era O
before O
supermarkets O
and O
fast O
food. O
The O
salad O
of O
pickled O
herring O
and O
carrots O
with O
boiled O
potatoes O
might O
come O
straight O
from O
Brasserie O
Lipp O
. O
The O
country O
pâté O
is O
laden O
with O
chicken O
livers O
and O
riddled O
with O
soft O
white O
pork O
fat O
in O
gobs O
the O
size O
of O
gumdrops, O
although O
it O
could O
stand O
more O
salt, O
and O
I'd O
be O
happy O
to O
trade O
the O
slab O
of O
butter O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
for O
a O
pot O
of O
mustard. O
The O
pâté O
is O
made O
in O
house, O
as O
is O
the O
gorgeously O
smooth O
boudin O
blanc. O
With O
the O
boudin, O
you O
want O
puréed O
potatoes O
that O
are O
almost O
liquid. O
That O
is O
what O
you O
get. O
You O
might O
argue O
that, O
when O
it O
offers O
chilled O
king O
crab O
legs O
to O
be O
dipped O
in O
aioli, O
this O
unextravagant O
cafe O
breaks O
character. O
Does O
the O
same O
apply O
to O
garnishing O
sardines O
served O
in O
the O
can O
with O
an O
ingot O
of O
prized, O
costly O
butter O
made O
by O
Jean-Yves O
Bordier? O
Maybe. O
I O
thought, O
in O
any O
case, O
that O
the O
sardines O
and O
the O
olive O
oil O
they O
are O
packed O
in O
tended O
to O
talk O
over O
the O
butter. O
The O
half O
roast O
chicken O
is O
not O
in O
the O
same O
class O
as O
the O
birds O
that O
Antoine O
Westermann O
cooked O
when O
he O
was O
still O
at O
Le O
Coq O
Rico O
, O
but O
it O
is O
probably O
as O
good O
a O
roast O
chicken O
as O
any O
normal O
restaurant O
can O
produce. O
The O
duck O
in O
olives, O
though, O
is O
misconceived; O
the O
sauce O
is O
thin, O
acrid O
and O
one-dimensional O
instead O
of O
head-spinningly O
rich, O
the O
way O
it O
is O
at O
Allard O
in O
Paris O
. O
The O
seafood O
-- O
the O
trout O
amandine O
with O
its O
sautéed O
skin O
taut O
beneath O
its O
armor O
of O
toasted O
almonds; O
steamed O
mussels O
in O
a O
lemon O
broth O
that's O
satiny O
with O
melted O
butter; O
an O
entire O
steamed O
branzino O
with O
enough O
crisp O
summer O
vegetables O
to O
make O
a O
salad O
-- O
is O
very O
appealing, O
though O
that O
won't O
stop O
the O
people O
who O
are O
going O
to O
get O
steak O
frites O
without O
even O
a O
glance O
at O
the O
menu. O
Those O
people O
may O
get O
fries O
that O
are O
crunchy O
and O
golden, O
or O
they O
might O
end O
up O
with O
a O
limp, O
oily O
batch, O
or O
they O
may O
get O
both O
in O
the O
same O
night, O
as O
I O
did. O
At O
the O
length O
of O
20 O
years, O
memories O
are O
untrustworthy, O
but O
I'm O
reasonably O
sure O
the O
food O
at O
Pastis O
is O
better O
than O
it O
used O
to O
be. O
The O
wine O
is O
certainly O
more O
interesting. O
What's O
gone, O
and O
won't O
be O
back O
now O
that O
the O
surrounding O
addresses O
have O
been O
taken O
over O
by O
shops O
like O
Loro O
Piana, O
Sephora, O
Hermès O
and O
RH, O
is O
the O
pure O
downtown O
electricity O
Pastis O
once O
generated. O
Sharing O
real O
estate O
with O
meat O
cutters O
in O
blood-smeared O
aprons O
and O
prostitutes O
in O
dresses O
as O
tight O
as O
the O
skins O
on O
a O
boudin O
blanc, O
Pastis O
did O
a O
drop-dead O
perfect O
imitation O
of O
the O
coolest O
restaurant O
in O
France. O
The O
French O
part O
was O
fake, O
but O
the O
cool O
was O
real. O

Lately O
I O
have O
fallen O
under O
the O
spell O
of O
an O
East B-LOC
Village I-LOC
restaurant O
called O
Foxface B-EST
. O
The O
cooking O
there O
is O
hard O
to O
pin O
down, O
geographically. O
Stopping O
in O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago, O
I O
ate O
Low B-DISH
Countryish I-DISH
wild I-DISH
red I-DISH
shrimp I-DISH
on I-DISH
grits, I-DISH
with O
sweet B-FOOD
corn I-FOOD
off I-FOOD
the I-FOOD
cob I-FOOD
and O
a O
potent O
saffron-lobster B-FOOD
sauce. I-FOOD
More O
recently, O
I O
had O
skinless B-DISH
pork I-DISH
sausage I-DISH
inspired O
by O
sai B-DISH
ua, I-DISH
the O
spicy O
and O
tangy O
specialty O
identified O
with O
the O
northern O
Thai O
city O
of O
Chiang B-LOC
Mai. I-LOC
The O
soft B-DISH
tripe I-DISH
I O
enjoyed O
the O
other O
weekend O
had O
been O
simmered O
with O
'nduja, O
the O
fiery O
and O
malleable O
Calabrian O
sausage, O
and O
then O
covered O
with O
a O
few O
thin O
shingles O
of O
shaved O
pecorino. O
If O
I O
had O
started O
hanging O
around O
at O
Foxface O
sooner, O
especially O
during O
the O
cold O
months O
after O
its O
opening, O
in O
February, O
I O
might O
have O
run O
into O
a O
wider O
variety O
of O
cuisines O
and O
main O
ingredients. O
I O
did O
manage O
to O
get O
some O
of O
the O
elk O
osso O
buco O
while O
that O
was O
still O
on O
the O
menu. O
I O
never O
got O
to O
try O
the O
wild O
hare, O
though, O
stewed O
in O
red O
wine O
with O
a O
bit O
of O
chocolate O
and O
thickened O
with O
its O
own O
blood, O
a O
formula O
that O
students O
of O
very O
old-guard O
French O
cooking O
will O
recognize O
as O
lièvre O
à O
la O
royale. O
Nor O
did O
I O
make O
it O
in O
time O
for O
the O
venison, O
left O
to O
bubble O
for O
hours O
in O
white O
wine O
with O
mushrooms O
and O
dark O
juniper O
berries. O
The O
Foxface O
dish O
I O
may O
never O
forgive O
myself O
for O
missing, O
though, O
is O
the O
kebabs O
served O
with O
preserved O
lemons O
and O
tahini, O
because O
the O
kebabs O
were O
made O
from O
ground O
lamb O
and O
camel. O
Although O
these O
foods O
may O
lack O
any O
unifying O
cultural O
background, O
they O
did O
have O
one O
thing O
in O
common: O
They O
were O
all O
served O
on O
rolls. O
Apart O
from O
an O
occasional O
salad O
or O
soup, O
everything O
cooked O
at O
Foxface O
arrives O
in O
sandwich O
form. O
And O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
a O
muffuletta O
that O
briefly O
manifested O
a O
few O
months O
back, O
every O
sandwich O
at O
Foxface O
is O
filled O
with O
hot, O
cooked O
meat O
or O
seafood O
or O
vegetables. O
In O
Mexico, O
certain O
taco O
stands O
specialize O
in O
tacos O
de O
guisado, O
tortillas O
filled O
with O
one O
kind O
of O
stew O
or O
another. O
Most O
of O
Foxface's O
offerings O
are, O
in O
effect, O
sandwiches O
de O
guisado. O
Which O
reminds O
me O
of O
another O
impressive O
Foxface O
sandwich, O
a O
magenta O
and O
green O
tangle O
of O
cilantro O
stems O
and O
pickled O
onions O
pressed O
into O
an O
engagingly O
tart O
pile O
of O
pork, O
marinated O
in O
sour O
orange O
juice O
and O
roasted O
very O
slowly O
under O
a O
banana O
leaf O
in O
emulation O
of O
cochinita O
pibil O
from O
the O
Yucatán. O
There O
is O
no O
guarantee O
that O
any O
of O
these O
items O
will O
be O
available O
when O
you O
go O
to O
Foxface. O
The O
menu O
is O
printed O
daily O
and O
taped O
up O
next O
to O
the O
window O
on O
St. O
Marks O
Place O
where O
most O
of O
the O
business O
is O
transacted. O
Sometimes O
a O
new O
sandwich O
appears O
after O
the O
printed O
menu O
has O
already O
been O
posted, O
so O
it O
will O
be O
written O
out O
by O
hand O
on O
a O
card O
that O
has O
in O
its O
upper O
left O
corner O
the O
restaurant's O
logo, O
a O
drawing O
of O
an O
elegant O
fox O
in O
cat's-eye O
glasses O
with O
a O
cigarette O
holder O
in O
one O
gloved O
hand. O
The O
sandwiches O
have O
names O
like O
It's O
What's O
'Nside O
(for O
the O
tripe O
with O
'nduja) O
or O
120 O
BPM O
(bison O
heart O
with O
tahini O
and O
"many O
spices"). O
The O
Smoking O
Fox O
is O
sold O
every O
day. O
It O
is O
filled O
with O
smoked O
pork O
rib O
the O
color O
of O
a O
dry O
rosé, O
separated O
from O
the O
bones O
and O
covered O
with O
coleslaw, O
pickles O
and O
a O
few O
splashes O
of O
habanero-orange O
vinegar. O
Your O
mind, O
of O
course, O
goes O
either O
to O
Memphis O
or O
to O
the O
McRib O
, O
and O
neither O
is O
exactly O
wrong, O
but O
the O
meat O
is O
of O
a O
superior O
grade O
and O
is O
smoked O
with O
the O
attention O
to O
timing O
and O
nuance O
that O
characterizes O
Foxface's O
cooking. O
It's O
a O
great O
sandwich. O
To O
place O
an O
order, O
you O
lean O
in O
to O
the O
window O
and O
speak O
with O
Sivan O
Lahat, O
who O
owns O
and O
runs O
Foxface O
with O
Ori O
Kushnir, O
her O
partner O
in O
life O
and O
in O
sandwiches. O
They O
immigrated O
to O
New O
York O
from O
Israel O
almost O
20 O
years O
ago O
and O
have O
lived O
here O
ever O
since, O
apart O
from O
a O
brief O
flirtation O
with O
the O
Midwest O
and O
a O
longer O
experimental O
period O
in O
Tokyo. O
While O
they O
were O
in O
Japan, O
they O
operated O
a O
pop-up O
restaurant, O
which O
is O
the O
closest O
either O
of O
them O
came O
to O
running O
a O
food O
business O
before O
opening O
Foxface. O
Like O
the O
fox O
in O
the O
logo, O
Ms. O
Lahat O
has O
coppery O
hair O
and O
wears O
cat's-eye O
glasses. O
She O
prepares O
the O
orders O
in O
the O
room O
behind O
the O
window, O
which O
measures O
48 O
square O
feet. O
Inside O
the O
building, O
under O
the O
stairs, O
Foxface O
has O
a O
second O
room. O
Mr. O
Kushnir O
thinks O
it O
could O
be O
as O
large O
as O
14 O
square O
feet. O
A O
variety O
of O
equipment O
is O
stowed O
in O
the O
two O
rooms, O
including O
three O
induction O
burners, O
a O
roaster, O
a O
smoker O
and O
a O
dishwasher. O
After O
business O
hours, O
some O
of O
it O
comes O
out O
as O
Mr. O
Kushnir O
supervises O
the O
more O
time-consuming O
roasts O
and O
stews. O
He O
describes O
the O
food O
that O
he O
and O
Ms. O
Lahat O
cook O
as O
"dishes O
we O
like O
to O
eat, O
reimagined O
as O
sandwiches." O
I O
like O
to O
eat O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
same O
dishes, O
as O
it O
happens, O
but O
they O
have O
been O
hard O
to O
come O
by O
lately, O
especially O
those O
shapeless O
brown O
stews O
that O
are O
so O
out O
of O
style. O
Following O
some O
of O
the O
world's O
most O
influential O
chefs O
and O
shamed, O
perhaps, O
by O
the O
unflattering O
lenses O
of O
a O
million O
amateur O
photographers, O
restaurants O
have O
shifted O
away O
from O
plain O
and O
plain-looking O
cooking. O
The O
subtlety O
and O
the O
thrill O
of O
plain O
cooking O
comes O
from O
searing, O
simmering, O
reducing, O
skimming O
and O
so O
on. O
All O
the O
people O
who O
own O
Instant O
Pots O
know O
this, O
but O
the O
segment O
of O
the O
restaurant O
scene O
with O
artistic O
leanings O
has O
forgotten O
it, O
focusing O
instead O
on O
plating, O
arranging O
six O
or O
seven O
things O
in O
some O
photogenic O
design O
and O
hoping O
they O
will O
cohere. O
Slapping O
a O
roll O
on O
it O
is O
one O
way O
to O
get O
a O
shapeless O
brown O
stew O
ready O
for O
its O
close-up, O
although O
it O
has O
to O
be O
said O
that O
on O
the O
mean O
streets O
of O
Instagram, O
an O
elk O
osso O
buco O
sandwich O
is O
no O
match O
for O
a O
rainbow O
unicorn O
ice O
cream O
sundae. O
Because O
space O
is O
at O
a O
premium, O
there O
is O
no O
room O
to O
sit O
and O
eat O
your O
Smoking O
Fox O
at O
Foxface O
itself. O
You O
can, O
however, O
take O
it O
to O
a O
table O
a O
few O
steps O
away O
inside O
an O
adjoining O
business O
called O
the O
William O
Barnacle O
Tavern O
. O
This O
is O
a O
reassuringly O
gloomy O
bar O
that O
is O
said O
to O
have O
originated O
as O
a O
speakeasy. O
Model O
ships O
and O
other O
nautical O
paraphernalia O
are O
strewn O
about, O
references O
to O
the O
rumrunning O
operation O
a O
former O
owner O
of O
the O
building O
presided O
over O
during O
Prohibition. O
(The O
stairs O
that O
Foxface's O
dishwasher O
is O
housed O
below O
lead O
to O
an O
exhibition O
space O
called O
the O
Museum O
of O
the O
American O
Gangster O
.) O
The O
bar's O
current O
owner O
has O
resisted O
some O
modern O
conveniences. O
Most O
of O
the O
lighting O
at O
night O
comes O
from O
small O
candles, O
and O
all O
of O
the O
music O
is O
provided O
by O
old O
films O
-- O
of O
Irish O
folk O
recitals, O
Cab O
Calloway O
concerts O
-- O
that O
run O
in O
looping, O
watery O
projections O
on O
the O
back O
wall. O
All O
Foxface O
sandwiches O
are O
presented O
in O
a O
trim O
little O
white O
box O
that O
can O
be O
unfolded O
into O
a O
place O
mat. O
You O
can O
purchase O
an O
Italian O
fruit O
soda O
for O
$3 O
from O
Foxface, O
or O
buy O
alcohol O
from O
the O
tavern. O
The O
beer O
is O
not O
expensive, O
but O
the O
specialty O
of O
the O
house O
is O
absinthe. O
Most O
patrons O
drink O
theirs O
diluted O
with O
ice O
water O
poured O
from O
a O
four-spigot O
absinthe O
fountain O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
bar. O
The O
bartender O
will O
make O
absinthe O
cocktails, O
too, O
including O
the O
one O
Ernest O
Hemingway O
supposedly O
invented O
that O
is O
just O
absinthe O
and O
Champagne O
in O
a O
big O
glass O
. O
He O
called O
it O
Death O
in O
the O
Afternoon, O
and O
it O
is O
what O
I O
intend O
to O
drink O
if O
I O
ever O
get O
my O
hands O
on O
that O
camel O
sandwich. O

a O

can O
survive O
a O
trip O
through O
the O
deepest O
patch O
of O
chile B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
without O
any O
appreciable O
damage. O
You O
can, O
if O
you O
like, O
follow O
the O
custom O
of O
Chengdu B-LOC
or O
Chongqing B-LOC
by O
focusing O
on O
ingredients O
that O
are O
prized O
more O
for O
feel O
than O
flavor. O
The O
duck B-FOOD
intestines, I-FOOD
for O
instance, O
which O
quickly O
contract O
in O
the O
hot O
broth B-FOOD
and O
come O
out O
about O
30 O
seconds O
later O
with O
the O
texture O
of O
barely O
cooked O
squid. B-FOOD
Or O
the O
pale O
ivory O
sheets O
of O
flattened B-FOOD
artery, I-FOOD
which O
after O
cooking O
about O
twice O
as O
long O
have O
a O
long-lasting O
chew O
that O
reminds O
me O
of O
geoduck. B-FOOD
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
more O
flavorful O
ingredients, O
once O
they've O
cooked O
for O
a O
few O
minutes, O
can O
help O
punch O
up O
the O
broths, B-FOOD
which O
aren't O
quite O
as O
deep O
or O
complex O
as O
they O
are O
at O
some O
other O
hot B-FOOD
pot I-FOOD
providers. O
This O
does O
not O
apply O
to O
the O
lengths O
of O
corn B-FOOD
on I-FOOD
the I-FOOD
cob, I-FOOD
which O
don't O
taste O
like O
anything O
to O
begin O
with. O
And O
I O
would O
avoid O
the O
"vegetable B-DISH
platter," I-DISH
which O
was O
more O
like O
a O
lettuce B-FOOD
platter. O
But O
it O
is O
useful O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
if O
you O
toss O
sliced O
king B-FOOD
oyster I-FOOD
mushrooms, I-FOOD
or O
crown B-FOOD
daisy I-FOOD
greens, I-FOOD
or O
bands O
of O
kelp B-FOOD
tied O
into O
knots, O
or O
even O
the O
Hershey's B-FOOD
Kiss-shaped I-FOOD
fish B-FOOD
balls I-FOOD
with O
gooey O
orange B-FOOD
roe I-FOOD
inside, O
into O
the O
soup B-FOOD
and O
forget O
about O
them O
for O
a O
while, O
both O
the O
ingredients O
and O
the O
soup B-FOOD
will O
rise O
to O
the O
occasion. O
Some O
ingredients, O
though, O
you O
hold O
in O
your O
chopsticks, O
watching O
for O
30 O
seconds O
or O
a O
minute O
until O
you O
can O
see O
they're O
ready. O
The O
marble O
tiles O
of O
Wagyu B-FOOD
rib I-FOOD
are O
in O
this O
category, O
and O
the O
New B-FOOD
Zealand I-FOOD
lamb I-FOOD
shaved O
as O
thin O
as O
prosciutto, B-FOOD
and O
the O
Kurobuta B-FOOD
pork I-FOOD
belly I-FOOD
from O
Japan. B-LOC
The O
whole O
prawns B-FOOD
on O
wooden O
skewers O
will O
be O
tender O
and O
running O
with O
juices O
in O
just O
over O
a O
minute. O
The O
sweet, O
small O
flounder B-FOOD
fillets I-FOOD
might O
need O
twice O
that. O
Even O
if O
you O
are O
careful O
to O
pull O
these O
bites O
out O
in O
the O
bubbling O
center O
of O
the O
pot, O
away O
from O
the O
oil, B-FOOD
the O
chiles B-FOOD
and O
Sichuan B-FOOD
peppercorns I-FOOD
will O
catch O
up O
with O
you O
sooner O
or O
later. O
They O
build O
up O
on O
your O
tongue, O
they O
slowly O
infiltrate O
your O
dipping B-FOOD
sauce, I-FOOD
and O
the O
mala B-FOOD
tingle O
will O
take O
over. O
There O
is O
no O
fighting O
it O
at O
that O
point, O
of O
course, O
though O
a O
bowl O
of O
white B-FOOD
rice I-FOOD
is O
a O
good O
investment O
in O
the O
future. O
And O
when O
conversation O
at O
the O
table O
has O
stopped O
completely, O
when O
the O
water B-FOOD
you O
keep O
pouring O
into O
sadistically O
small O
cups O
won't O
help O
any O
more, O
there O
is O
one O
thing O
that O
will: O
fresh B-FOOD
watermelon I-FOOD
juice, I-FOOD
sold O
by O
the O

-DOCSTART- O

Four O
summers O
ago, O
a O
young O
chef O
named O
José O
Luis O
Chávez O
began O
leveraging O
the O
poke B-FOOD
craze O
and O
the O
salad-bowl B-FOOD
trend O
into O
a O
string O
of O
fast-casual B-TYPE
ceviche O
bars. O
He O
began O
with O
a O
counter O
in O
the O
Gansevoort O
Market O
food O
hall O
called O
Mission O
Ceviche O
; O
there O
is O
now O
another O
in O
Canal O
Street O
Market O
and O
a O
third O
is O
supposed O
to O
open O
in O
Norwalk, O
Conn., O
later O
this O
year. O
At O
all O
locations, O
the O
stock-in-trade O
is O
citrus-marinated O
raw O
fish O
with O
sweet O
potatoes O
and O
kernels O
of O
chubby O
Andean O
corn, O
in O
both O
its O
soft O
and O
crunchy O
forms. O
This O
is O
of O
course O
the O
standard O
Peruvian O
formula, O
but O
Mr. O
Chávez O
had O
the O
inspiration O
of O
serving O
his O
ceviche O
in O
a O
clear O
plastic O
bowl O
over O
a O
base O
of O
salad, O
rice O
or, O
for O
a O
dollar O
more, O
quinoa. O
The O
supplemental O
ingredients O
make O
a O
plausible O
desk O
lunch O
out O
of O
a O
dish O
that O
some O
New O
Yorkers O
still O
aren't O
quite O
sure O
what O
to O
do O
with. O
The O
surprising O
thing O
about O
Mission O
Ceviche's O
salad O
bowls O
is O
that O
they O
taste O
like O
real O
Peruvian O
food. O
The O
raw O
fish O
is O
firm O
and O
cold O
and O
neatly O
cut O
up O
into O
solid O
pieces O
that O
hold O
their O
shape. O
The O
leche O
de O
tigre O
marinade O
in O
Mr. O
Chávez's O
"ceviche O
clásico" O
is O
a O
bright O
and O
precise O
cocktail O
of O
lime O
and O
rocoto O
chiles, O
although O
you O
might O
wish O
that O
the O
rocotos O
had O
been O
applied O
with O
a O
little O
less O
restraint. O
You O
get O
a O
higher-caliber O
shot O
of O
spice, O
this O
time O
from O
ají O
amarillo O
chiles, O
in O
the O
ceviche O
mixto, O
a O
combination O
of O
octopus, O
shrimp O
and O
fluke O
enveloped O
in O
a O
creamy, O
goldenrod-colored O
leche O
de O
tigre. O
The O
clásico O
is O
accessorized O
with O
sweet O
potato O
purée; O
the O
mixto O
gets O
avocado O
purée, O
too. O
The O
purées O
are O
piped O
out O
of O
pastry O
bags O
like O
buttercream O
roses O
on O
a O
wedding O
cake, O
and O
they O
are O
delicious. O
When O
I O
wandered O
into O
the O
Gansevoort O
Market O
location O
in O
February, O
it O
seemed O
clear O
that O
Mr. O
Chávez O
could O
run O
an O
interesting O
restaurant O
if O
he O
ever O
decided O
to O
put O
his O
food O
into O
something O
other O
than O
recyclable O
salad O
bowls. O
Then, O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
summer, O
he O
did O
just O
that, O
opening O
a O
sit-down O
restaurant O
on O
the O
Upper O
East O
Side O
with O
real O
plates O
and O
bowls. O
The O
new O
space O
is O
not O
particularly O
large O
or O
lavish, O
but O
compared O
with O
the O
earlier O
efforts, O
Mission O
Ceviche O
Restaurant O
& O
Bar O
is O
a O
palace. O
There O
is O
seating O
for O
65 O
or O
so O
people O
beneath O
a O
wall O
sculpture O
of O
a O
fish O
that O
glows O
from O
behind O
and O
a O
pink O
neon O
sign O
that O
reads O
"tiger O
milk O
effect," O
probably O
a O
reference O
to O
the O
belief O
that O
drinking O
leftover O
leche O
de O
tigre O
can O
put O
extra O
topspin O
on O
sexual O
performance. O
The O
menu O
now O
paints O
a O
slightly O
fuller O
picture O
of O
Peruvian O
cuisine, O
extending O
into O
new O
foods O
including O
the O
grilled O
skewers O
known O
as O
anticuchos. O
Mr. O
Chávez O
dresses O
up O
the O
country's O
most O
popular O
anticucho, O
grilled O
beef O
heart, O
brushing O
it O
with O
a O
creamy O
rocoto O
sauce O
and O
serving O
it O
with O
newly O
fried O
blue O
potato O
chips O
and O
kernels O
of O
choclo O
corn. O
The O
trio O
of O
rocoto, O
blue O
potatoes O
and O
choclo O
is O
so O
solidly O
Peruvian O
that O
it O
can O
withstand O
the O
chimichurri O
that O
Mr. O
Chávez O
brings O
in, O
by O
way O
of O
Argentina, O
as O
a O
final O
touch. O
He O
clearly O
has O
a O
soft O
spot O
for O
chimichurri O
because O
he O
deploys O
it O
again O
with O
the O
shrimp O
anticuchos O
(the O
shrimp O
are O
very O
big O
and O
look O
even O
bigger O
because O
they're O
grilled O
with O
their O
heads O
on), O
served O
with O
a O
squirt O
of O
huancaína, O
the O
spicy O
yellow O
cheese O
sauce O
that O
is O
something O
like O
Peru's O
version O
of O
queso O
dip. O
My O
favorite O
anticucho O
is O
a O
more O
straightforward O
situation, O
grilled O
scallops O
under O
arugula, O
lime O
zest O
and O
a O
smooth O
Parmesan O
fondue. O
But O
Mr. O
Chávez O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
put O
several O
flavors O
in O
motion O
at O
once O
and O
keep O
his O
balance, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
the O
beef-heart O
skewer O
and O
his O
octopus O
causa. O
This O
is, O
reduced O
to O
bare O
bones, O
a O
tendril O
of O
octopus O
curled O
around O
a O
disc O
of O
mashed O
potatoes. O
But O
the O
potatoes, O
seasoned O
with O
lime O
and O
yellow O
chiles, O
are O
coated O
in O
a O
smooth O
lavender-colored O
sauce O
made O
from O
Peruvian O
black O
olives; O
the O
octopus O
has O
been O
rubbed O
with O
cumin, O
oregano O
and O
ají O
panca O
paste O
and O
grilled O
to O
a O
crackle; O
the O
plate O
is O
decorated O
with O
a O
few O
wobbly O
curls O
of O
paper O
made O
with O
purple O
Peruvian O
potatoes. O
Mission O
Ceviche's O
servers, O
while O
eager O
to O
be O
helpful, O
have O
a O
habit O
of O
singling O
out O
the O
most O
obvious O
dishes O
-- O
the O
classic O
ceviche, O
the O
octopus O
leg O
-- O
and O
pushing O
them O
so O
hard O
you O
might O
suspect O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
menu O
is O
a O
minefield. O
It O
isn't. O
There O
is O
nothing O
to O
avoid O
unless O
the O
kitchen O
brings O
back O
the O
bizarre O
strawberry-kiwi O
ceviche O
that O
showed O
up O
as O
a O
special O
one O
night. O
If O
you O
are O
being O
herded O
into O
getting O
the O
"Peruvian O
paella," O
you O
should O
know O
that O
the O
other O
three O
main O
courses O
are O
also O
worth O
looking O
into, O
like O
the O
ají O
de O
gallina, O
shredded O
chicken O
breast O
in O
a O
creamy O
ají O
amarillo O
sauce O
that O
is O
both O
soothing O
and O
spicy; O
or O
the O
seco O
norteño, O
a O
slowly O
braised O
short O
rib O
in O
cilantro O
sauce. O
All O
are O
larger O
than O
average, O
too. O
Still, O
nothing O
on O
the O
menu O
quite O
rivals O
the O
ceviches. O
They O
are O
served, O
yes, O
without O
lettuce O
or O
rice, O
and O
they O
are O
better O
for O
it. O
Mr. O
Chávez's O
creative O
engine O
seems O
to O
have O
a O
high O
idle, O
and O
he O
has O
come O
up O
with O
different O
ways O
to O
present O
dishes O
that O
are O
also O
on O
the O
menu O
at O
the O
fast-casual O
counters. O
The O
"Nikkei" O
ceviche, O
for O
instance O
-- O
tuna O
in O
a O
kind O
of O
modified O
ponzu O
sauce O
seasoned O
with O
ají O
amarilllo O
and O
togarashi O
-- O
now O
comes O
with O
watermelon O
and O
a O
bloop O
of O
ginger O
foam O
that O
would O
never O
survive O
a O
trip O
from O
the O
food O
court O
back O
to O
the O
office. O
Neither O
would O
the O
odd O
but O
intriguing O
attempt O
at O
a O
vegetarian O
ceviche O
where O
the O
fish O
is O
replaced O
by O
shiitakes O
and O
the O
leche O
de O
tigre O
takes O
the O
form O
of O
snow, O
frozen O
by O
liquid O
nitrogen. O
The O
art O
of O
ceviche-making O
has O
at O
least O
as O
much O
in O
common O
with O
mixology O
as O
with O
cooking, O
so O
it O
is O
no O
surprise O
that O
the O
cocktails O
are O
well O
calibrated O
and O
sing O
out O
with O
fresh O
lime. O
There O
is O
a O
twist O
on O
the O
pisco O
sour O
made O
with O
passion-fruit O
juice O
and O
another O
with O
the O
purple-corn O
drink O
chicha O
morada, O
although O
neither O
quite O
achieves O
the O
bracing O
elegance O
of O
the O
original. O
And O
it's O
nice O
to O
see O
the O
less O
well-known O
chilcano, O
a O
pisco O
highball O
made O
with O
lime O
juice O
and O
ginger O
ale. O
(Would O
ginger O
beer O
be O
better?) O
Chicha O
morada O
appears O
again O
in O
the O
raspadilla O
dessert. O
This O
time O
it O
is O
a O
syrup O
poured O
over O
shaved O
ice O
and O
sprinkled O
with O
lucuma O
foam. O
When O
I O
had O
the O
raspadilla, O
it O
was O
sprinkled O
with O
candied O
pecan O
crumbs O
but O
in O
a O
phone O
interview O
on O
Monday O
Mr. O
Chávez O
said O
he O
had O
replaced O
the O
nuts O
with O
crumbled O
Oreos. O
This, O
it O
hardly O
needs O
pointing O
out, O
was O
not O
exactly O
a O
staple O
in O
the O
diet O
of O
the O
Incas. O
"What O
can O
I O
say?" O
he O
asked. O
"I O
just O
really O
like O
Oreos." O

But O
you O
would O
do O
well O
to O
make O
it O
a O
large O

Where O

will O
you O

Who O

much O

that O

in O
this O

to O
the O

of O

Chinese B-CUISINE
food O
is O
capable O
of. O
"While O

the O

Ruth O

wrote O
in O
The O

She O
gave O
reasons O
for O
the O
poor O
showing, O
including O

being O
paid O
more O
in O
Hong O

true O
as O
it O
was O
21 O
years O
ago, O
but O
what O
has O
changed O
is O
the O
rise O
of O
global O
Chinese O
restaurant O
groups, O
from O
the O
disappointing O
duck O
specialist O
DaDong O
to O
the O
surprisingly O
solid O
Hao O
Noodle O
outposts O
and, O
now, O
to O
Hutong. O
The O
original O
Hutong O
opened O
in O
2003 O
on O
the O
28th O
floor O
of O
a O
glass O
tower O
overlooking O
the O
Hong O
Kong O
harbor, O
but O
the O
dining O
room O
tries O
to O
conjure O
the O
atmosphere O
of O
Beijing's O
vanishing O
premodern O
alleys, O
or O
hutongs, O
by O
means O
of O
red O
paper O
lanterns, O
carved O
wooden O
doors O
and O
birdcages. O
The O
Manhattan O
branch O
makes O
a O
different O
impression. O
The O
entrance O
is O
on O
the O
east O
side O
of O
the O
circular O
driveway O
below O
the O
Bloomberg O
Building O
between O
East O
58th O
and O
59th O
Streets. O
Turn O
right O
and O
you O
are O
in O
a O
narrow O
hallway O
between O
two O
soaring O
glass O
stacks O
of O
wine O
bottles, O
every O
one O
of O
them O
for O
decorative O
purposes O
only. O
Turn O
left O
and O
you O
are O
in O
a O
glittering, O
soaring, O
hard-edge O
dining O
room. O
The O
inspiration O
seems O
to O
be O
Art O
Deco O
with O
a O
pinch O
of O
cocaine; O
the O
blue O
leather O
banquettes, O
beveled O
mirrors O
and O
chandeliers O
of O
mirror-polished O
steel O
could O
come O
from O
the O
set O
of O
a O
nightclub O
in O
some O
cross O
between O
" O
Scarface O
" O
and O
"Gentlemen O
Prefer O
Blondes." O
A O
guest O
who O
has O
lived O
in O
China O
allowed O
his O
eyes O
to O
adjust O
to O
the O
glinting O
light O
as O
he O
looked O
toward O
the O
ceiling, O
which O
seemed O
to O
be O
far O
away. O
"It's O
very O
… O
yin," O
he O
said. O
Hutong O
is O
ostensibly O
a O
Northern O
Chinese O
restaurant. O
This O
is O
more O
apparent O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
than O
in O
Manhattan, O
where O
the O
menu O
has O
been O
pruned O
to O
about O
half O
the O
size. O
Lamb, O
a O
mainstay O
in O
the O
northern O
provinces, O
was O
represented O
in O
August O
by O
a O
single O
dish, O
cumin-speckled O
ribs O
roasted O
languorously O
to O
a O
mind-altering O
tenderness. O
By O
the O
time O
of O
my O
last O
visit, O
lamb O
had O
ambled O
off O
the O
menu O
entirely. O
The O
most O
famous O
preparation O
from O
northern O
China, O
Peking O
duck, O
arrived O
at O
my O
table O
worse O
for O
wear O
and O
tear, O
carved O
haphazardly, O
with O
blobs O
of O
unmelted O
fat O
clinging O
to O
limp O
skin. O
The O
second O
course, O
a O
dark-meat O
stir-fry O
to O
be O
folded O
in O
iceberg O
lettuce, O
was O
more O
skillfully O
done, O
but O
the O
sting O
of O
paying O
$84 O
for O
a O
whole O
duck O
with O
uncrisp O
skin O
lingered. O
Much O
of O
what O
hasn't O
been O
trimmed O
from O
the O
Hong O
Kong O
menu O
comes O
from O
Sichuan. O
So O
does O
Fei O
Wang, O
the O
executive O
chef O
of O
the O
New O
York O
branch, O
and O
a O
native O
of O
Chengdu. O
Most O
recently O
seen O
running O
the O
kitchen O
of O
the O
Hutong O
in O
London, O
Mr. O
Wang O
weaves O
chiles O
-- O
fresh, O
dried, O
roasted, O
pickled, O
name O
it O
-- O
into O
nearly O
everything. O
In O
the O
dish O
known O
as O
Red O
Lantern, O
the O
whole O
dried O
peppers O
the O
size O
of O
cherries O
are O
mostly O
decorative; O
fried O
soft-shell O
crabs O
are O
buried O
under O
the O
chiles O
in O
a O
pan O
with O
an O
arcing O
bamboo O
handle, O
like O
jelly O
beans O
in O
the O
plastic O
grass O
of O
an O
Easter O
basket. O
The O
ground O
spices O
on O
the O
crabs' O
shatteringly O
brittle O
crust O
-- O
lightly O
sweet O
and O
more O
aromatic O
than O
searingly O
hot O
-- O
may O
remind O
you O
of O
a O
Chinese O
rice-cracker O
snack O
you O
grew O
up O
on, O
or O
it O
may O
make O
you O
think O
of O
Old O
Bay. O
Fermented O
chiles O
provide O
an O
electric O
buzz, O
and O
a O
modicum O
of O
heat, O
to O
the O
steamed O
halibut O
that O
arrives O
boxed O
up O
inside O
a O
red O
bell O
pepper O
and O
sitting O
on O
a O
nest O
of O
rice O
noodles. O
(The O
pepper O
opens O
into O
a O
six-pointed O
star O
that O
gives O
the O
dish O
its O
name, O
halibut O
red O
star O
noodles.) O
Kou O
shui O
chicken O
is O
nearly O
submerged O
in O
an O
orange O
lake O
of O
excellent O
chile O
oil, O
although O
the O
adroit O
way O
the O
oil O
is O
balanced O
by O
rice O
vinegar, O
sesame O
oil, O
soy O
sauce, O
ginger O
and O
other O
flavors O
is O
what O
gives O
Hutong O
one O
of O
the O
city's O
most O
impressive O
versions O
of O
this O
traditional O
cold O
dish. O
If O
Hutong O
has O
another O
appetizer O
that O
equals O
it, O
I O
haven't O
found O
it O
yet. O
I O
did, O
however, O
have O
a O
cryptic O
encounter O
with O
a O
log-cabin O
stack O
of O
okra O
doused O
in O
a O
sweet O
wasabi O
sauce, O
and O
an O
inconclusive O
rendezvous O
with O
some O
steamed O
asparagus O
stalks O
whose O
tips O
were O
enrobed O
in O
white O
sesame O
sauce; O
it O
was O
as O
if O
somebody O
had O
tried O
to O
replicate O
strawberries O
dipped O
in O
white O
chocolate O
without O
access O
to O
strawberries O
or O
white O
chocolate. O
You O
could O
attempt O
to O
unknot O
these O
mysteries. O
Then O
again, O
you O
could O
simply O
begin O
your O
meal O
with O
dim O
sum. O
And O
then, O
after O
picking O
your O
way O
through O
the O
chile-besotted O
main O
courses, O
you O
could O
end O
it O
that O
way, O
too. O
There O
is O
a O
dessert O
that O
mimics O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
steamed O
bun, O
pleated O
and O
twisted O
into O
a O
pucker O
at O
the O
top. O
It O
is O
made O
of O
white O
chocolate, O
the O
wrapper O
on O
this O
trompe O
l'oeil O
bao, O
and O
filled O
with O
white O
sesame O
cream O
and O
a O
core O
of O
bittersweet O
salted O
caramel. O
Alongside O
it O
is O
a O
single O
scoop O
of O
ice O
cream O
made O
from O
lightly O
sweetened O
soy O
milk. O
The O
soy O
milk O
is O
extremely O
fresh. O
I O
don't O
mean O
that O
the O
carton O
won't O
expire O
for O
another O
three O
weeks; O
I O
mean O
that O
somebody O
in O
the O
kitchen O
was O
squeezing O
the O
soybeans O
shortly O
before O
the O
ice O
cream O
was O
frozen. O
This O
is O
a O
snack O
from O
a O
Chinese O
childhood, O
bread O
and O
a O
glass O
of O
milk, O
and O
it O
would O
be O
hard, O
after O
several O
courses O
of O
spice, O
to O
think O
of O
anything O
more O
welcome. O

Last O
month O
I O
had O
dinner O
with O
a O
friend O
who O
lives O
a O
thousand O
miles O
away O
and O
doesn't O
get O
to O
Manhattan B-LOC
as O
often O
as O
he O
once O
did. O
When O
I O
asked O
where O
he O
wanted O
to O
eat, O
he O
answered, O
a O
bit O
wistfully, O
"Somewhere O
that O
speaks O
of O
New B-LOC
York, I-LOC
a O
city O
I O
have O
lost O
touch O
with." O
At O
first, O
I O
looked O
for O
a O
place O
where O
we O
could O
be O
in O
the O
thick O
of O
it O
all. O
I O
thought O
of O
Bar B-EST
Pisellino I-EST
, O
that O
narrow O
glass O
sarcophagus O
run O
by O
Rita O
Sodi O
and O
Jody O
Williams, O
where O
you O
drink O
your O
sgroppino B-FOOD
standing O
up O
between O
the O
window O
along O
Grove B-LOC
Street I-LOC
and O
the O
one O
along O
Seventh B-LOC
Avenue. I-LOC
People O
trickle O
in, O
eat O
some O
olives B-FOOD
and O
a O
tuna B-DISH
tramezzino, I-DISH
and O
head O
out O
again. O
Although O
it's O
about O
the O
size O
of O
a O
subway O
car, O
you O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
if O
you O
stayed O
long O
enough, O
you'd O
eventually O
see O
everybody O
you O
know. O
But O
a O
restaurant O
that O
truly O
speaks O
of O
the O
place O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
has O
become O
over O
the O
past O
decade O
or O
so O
would O
be O
nearly O
the O
opposite O
of O
Bar B-EST
Pisellino. I-EST
This O
restaurant O
would O
not O
be O
in O
the O
thick O
of O
it O
all. O
It O
would O
be O
hushed, O
sheltered, O
exclusive, O
admitting O
no O
more O
than O
a O
handful O
of O
people O
at O
a O
time. O
It O
would O
protect O
those O
people, O
once O
they O
were O
inside, O
from O
crowds O
spilling O
in O
from O
the O
street, O
even O
from O
the O
street O
itself. O
It O
would O
join O
the O
steady O
march O
of O
new O
tasting B-TYPE
counters I-TYPE
and O
omakase B-TYPE
hideaways. I-TYPE
And O
it O
would O
illustrate O
the O
growing O
ease O
with O
which O
New O
Yorkers O
of O
means O
can O
glide O
through O
and O
above O
the O
fray, O
slipping O
from O
one O
cloistered O
room O
to O
another O
in O
black O
cars O
without O
touching O
down. O
That O
restaurant O
would O
be O
a O
lot O
like O
Frevo B-EST
, O
which O
has O
been O
serving O
suave, O
$124 O
tasting O
menus O
with O
a O
modern-French B-CUISINE
sensibility O
in O
Greenwich B-LOC
Village I-LOC
for O
the O
past O
four O
months. O
Frevo B-EST
is O
the O
work O
of O
Franco O
Sampogna, O
who O
is O
the O
chef, O
and O
Bernardo O
Silva, O
the O
manager. O
Mr. O
Sampogna O
is O
from O
Brazil B-LOC
and O
Mr. O
Silva O
comes O
from O
Portugal; B-LOC
they O
met O
10 O
years O
ago O
while O
working O
in O
restaurants O
in O
France, B-LOC
and O
quickly O
decided O
that O
one O
day O
they O
would O
open O
a O
restaurant O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
that O
would O
give O
diners O
"that O
feeling O
of O
being O
in O
your O
own O
secluded O
safe O
haven," O
as O
Mr. O
Sampogna O
put O
it. O
To O
get O
into O
Frevo, B-EST
you O
first O
need O
to O
know O
that O
Frevo B-EST
exists. O
There's O
no O
sign. O
When O
you O
arrive O
at O
the O
correct O
address, O
what O
you O
see O
is O
an O
art O
gallery O
with O
just O
enough O
room O
on O
its O
white O
walls O
for O
the O
six O
abstract O
paintings O
that O
hang O
there O
fairly O
close O
together. O
The O
paintings O
are O
real O
paintings O
made O
by O
a O
real O
artist, O
Thomas O
Labarthe, O
who O
goes O
by O
Toma-L O
, O
but O
the O
gallery O
is O
not O
entirely O
a O
real O
gallery. O
If O
it O
were, O
the O
young O
woman O
who O
sits O
there O
keeping O
an O
eye O
on O
things O
would O
stare O
blankly O
ahead O
when O
you O
entered, O
instead O
of O
walking O
up O
to O
you O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
reassuring O
you O
that, O
yes, O
you've O
come O
to O
the O
right O
place. O
Then O
she O
reaches O
behind O
one O
of O
the O
canvases O
and O
it O
swings O
out O
on O
invisible O
hinges, O
leaving O
in O
its O
place O
a O
doorway O
through O
which O
you O
can O
see, O
illuminated O
in O
a O
large, O
dark O
room, O
a O
stainless-steel O
kitchen O
and O
a O
long, O
curving O
counter O
of O
polished O
quartzite. O
You O
hop O
up O
on O
one O
of O
the O
18 O
padded O
seats, O
and O
the O
door O
clicks O
closed. O
You O
are O
in. O
When O
the O
door O
opens O
again, O
typically O
not O
for O
another O
half O
an O
hour, O
in O
will O
walk O
another O
set O
of O
people O
who, O
like O
you, O
knew O
that O
the O
gallery O
was O
not O
a O
normal O
gallery. O
Let's O
say O
that O
the O
misdirection O
of O
the O
gallery O
and O
the O
secret O
door O
do O
not O
make O
these O
newcomers O
feel O
sufficiently O
insulated O
from O
the O
outside O
world. O
Frevo B-EST
gives O
them O
the O
opportunity O
to O
sit O
at O
a O
round O
chef's O
table O
in O
a O
back O
corner O
around O
which O
a O
curtain O
can O
be O
drawn, O
as O
in O
a O
hospital O
room. O
Much O
of O
this O
comes O
right O
out O
of O
the O
neo-speakeasy B-TYPE
handbook, O
although O
Frevo B-EST
does O
throw O
itself O
into O
the O
act O
with O
an O
unusual O
level O
of O
commitment. O
The O
gallery, O
for O
instance, O
installed O
a O
new O
batch O
of O
Mr. O
Labarthe's O
canvases O
around O
Labor O
Day. O
But O
each O
time O
I O
went O
to O
Frevo, B-EST
I O
stared O
at O
that O
curtain. O
Nobody O
ever O
closed O
it O
while O
I O
was O
there, O
but O
it O
still O
reminded O
me O
how O
easy O
it O
is O
now O
for O
some O
New O
Yorkers O
to O
climb O
into O
the O
treehouse O
and O
pull O
the O
ladder O
up O
behind O
them. O
I O
have O
to O
admit, O
though, O
that O
I O
like O
Frevo B-EST
more O
than O
I O
like O
the O
version O
of O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
that O
it O
brings O
to O
mind. O
The O
pleasures O
of O
this O
secluded O
safe O
haven O
are O
real, O
and O
Mr. O
Sampogna's O
cooking O
is O
focused O
and O
refined. O
I O
haven't O
been O
able O
to O
get O
his O
halibut B-DISH
dish O
out O
of O
my O
mind, O
for O
instance. O
The O
fish B-FOOD
rests O
on O
a O
thin, O
crisp O
platform O
of O
fried B-FOOD
bread I-FOOD
shellacked O
with O
a O
dark O
mushroom B-FOOD
marmalade; I-FOOD
this O
miniature O
mushroom O
tart O
drinks O
up O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
halibut O
as O
it O
goes, O
in O
the O
oven, O
from O
raw O
to O
that O
just-cooked O
state O
where O
its O
flesh O
slides O
apart O
into O
thick O
and O
almost O
fluffy O
white O
flakes. O
Alongside O
the O
fish O
are O
bulbs O
of O
melted O
fennel, O
their O
spiced O
cooking O
juices O
boiled O
down O
to O
a O
bittersweet O
syrup. O
Mr. O
Sampogna's O
opening O
salvo O
often O
involves O
quinoa O
doing O
something O
quinoa O
doesn't O
usually O
do, O
and O
doing O
it O
quite O
nicely. O
I O
liked O
its O
freshness O
when O
it O
was O
used O
in O
a O
salad O
spooned O
over O
a O
demitasse O
of O
creamy O
hummus; O
I O
liked O
its O
crunch O
when O
it O
was O
dehydrated O
and O
sprinkled O
over O
a O
few O
mouthfuls O
of O
black O
lentils O
topped O
with O
glistening O
orbs O
of O
smoked O
trout O
roe. O
A O
dish O
from O
early O
July O
brought O
peas, O
at O
the O
tail O
end O
of O
their O
season, O
together O
with O
a O
rich O
pistachio-tarragon O
cream O
and O
white O
puffs O
of O
coconut O
mousse: O
light O
and O
charming. O
I O
wished O
Mr. O
Sampogna O
had O
exploited O
summer O
produce O
as O
sensitively O
when O
I O
went O
back O
in O
August O
and O
September. O
His O
kitchen O
is O
small O
enough O
that O
he O
could O
respond O
to O
the O
market O
day O
by O
day, O
but O
so O
far O
this O
doesn't O
seem O
to O
interest O
him. O
Frevo, O
at O
$124 O
for O
five O
courses, O
is O
not O
a O
huge O
splurge O
by O
New O
York O
standards, O
but O
servers O
try O
to O
inflate O
the O
total O
by O
pushing O
supplements. O
For O
$30 O
you O
can O
get O
Kaluga O
caviar O
troweled O
on O
to O
your O
first O
course; O
$20 O
gets O
you O
upgraded O
to O
a O
foie O
gras O
torchon O
instead O
of O
the O
less-thrilling O
mushrooms O
with O
gnocchi; O
it's O
$18 O
for O
a O
serving O
of O
aged O
Comté O
before O
dessert, O
and O
another O
$30 O
to O
have O
white O
truffles O
with O
the O
cheese. O
This O
tactic O
is O
not O
as O
grating O
as O
it O
is O
at O
Per O
Se O
, O
where O
the O
supplements O
are O
piled O
onto O
a O
base O
charge O
of O
$355, O
but O
it O
is O
still O
a O
snag O
in O
the O
otherwise O
smooth O
hospitality O
provided O
by O
Frevo's O
small O
crew O
of O
servers O
and O
cooks. O
Everyone O
I've O
brought O
to O
Frevo O
has O
fallen O
under O
its O
spell, O
which O
is O
hard O
to O
resist. O
The O
music O
is O
slinky O
and O
sinuous. O
The O
room O
has O
a O
nocturnal O
theatricality; O
sitting O
at O
the O
counter O
with O
darkness O
behind O
you O
facing O
the O
spotlighted O
kitchen O
can O
feel O
like O
attending O
an O
extremely O
elegant O
campfire. O
I O
still O
think O
Frevo O
is O
a O
perfect O
spot O
to O
familiarize O
yourself O
with O
the O
frictionless O
New O
York O
of O
2019. O
Still, O
when O
my O
out-of-town O
friend O
arrived, O
we O
had O
our O
dinner O
at O
Bar O
Pisellino. O
We O
were O
hungry O
for O
a O
taste O
of O
the O
old O
chaos. O

Billy O
Durney, O
the O
Brooklyn B-LOC
restaurateur O
and O
pitmaster, O
has O
been O
talking O
for O
several O
years O
about O
the O
fried B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
that O
he O
planned O
to O
bring O
to O
Red B-EST
Hook. I-EST
At O
first, O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
to O
doubt O
him. O
That O
the O
man O
is O
comfortable O
with O
long O
time O
horizons O
was O
clear O
to O
anyone O
who O
watched O
how O
patiently O
he O
studied O
the O
science O
of O
indirect O
heat O
at O
his O
first O
establishment O
in O
the O
neighborhood, O
Hometown B-EST
Bar-B-Que I-EST
. O
After O
Hurricane O
Sandy O
flooded O
streets O
and O
knocked O
out O
power O
in O
the O
area O
shortly O
before O
the O
scheduled O
opening O
in O
2012, O
he O
gave O
away O
smoked B-FOOD
briskets, I-FOOD
ribs B-FOOD
and O
shoulders B-FOOD
to O
local O
residents O
until O
electricity O
was O
restored O
almost O
three O
weeks O
later, O
honing O
his O
technique O
all O
the O
while. O
The O
years O
rolled O
by O
without O
a O
drumstick B-FOOD
in O
sight. O
But O
as O
recently O
as O
March, O
it O
was O
still O
possible O
to O
take O
Mr. O
Durney O
at O
his O
word O
when O
he O
talked O
about O
the O
star O
attraction O
of O
his O
nearly O
completed O
fried-chicken B-FOOD
emporium B-TYPE
, O
to O
be O
called O
Red B-EST
Hook I-EST
Tavern. I-EST
The O
doors O
were O
finally O
unlocked O
in O
July, O
revealing O
a O
row O
of O
tables O
under O
electrified O
gas O
lamps O
and O
a O
row O
of O
stools O
in O
front O
of O
a O
white-oak O
bar O
that O
looks O
as O
if O
it O
was O
built O
to O
last O
at O
least O
until O
Van B-LOC
Brunt I-LOC
Street I-LOC
sinks O
into O
the O
sea. O
Wearing O
wallpaper O
and O
wainscoting O
and O
pressed O
tin, O
Red B-EST
Hook I-EST
Tavern I-EST
does O
a O
straight-faced O
impression O
of O
a O
whiskey-simmered O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
corner B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
of O
a O
certain O
age. O
The O
attention O
to O
detail O
was O
to O
be O
expected, O
given O
how O
convincingly O
Hometown B-EST
conjures O
a O
Texas B-LOC
Hill I-LOC
Country I-LOC
barbecue B-FOOD
palace. O
What O
was O
something O
of O
a O
surprise, O
though, O
was O
that O
chickens O
were O
not O
being O
fried O
anywhere O
on O
the O
premises. O
In O
fact, O
Red B-EST
Hook I-EST
Tavern's I-EST
star O
attraction O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
cheeseburger. B-DISH
To O
be O
fair, O
Mr. O
Durney O
probably O
would O
not O
have O
drummed O
up O
much O
enthusiasm O
had O
he O
gone O
around O
telling O
people O
he O
was O
going O
to O
open O
a O
bar B-TYPE
that O
served O
hamburgers. B-FOOD
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
has O
so O
many O
of O
those O
already O
that O
the O
style O
they O
typically O
serve O
is O
a O
recognized O
subgenre O
that O
George O
Motz O
calls O
"the B-DISH
New I-DISH
York I-DISH
City I-DISH
pub I-DISH
burger." I-DISH
According O
to O
Mr. O
Motz, O
a O
filmmaker O
and O
author O
whose O
work O
explores O
all O
things O
ground-beef-and-bun-related, O
the O
hallmarks O
of O
a O
pub O
burger O
are O
a O
thicker-than-average O
patty O
and O
a O
relative O
lack O
of O
adornment. O
It O
is O
the O
plain, O
sturdy O
and O
hunger-calming O
burger O
you O
get O
at O
P.J. O
Clarke's O
, O
JG O
Melon O
and O
Fanelli O
Cafe O
in O
Manhattan O
and O
at O
Donovan's O
Pub O
in O
Queens. O
Mr. O
Durney O
has O
said O
that O
he O
intends O
the O
Red O
Hook O
Tavern O
burger O
as O
a O
homage O
to O
the O
one O
at O
Peter O
Luger O
Steak O
House O
. O
(You O
might O
think O
that O
Luger O
traffics O
in O
the O
style O
known O
as O
the O
steakhouse O
burger, O
but O
most O
burger O
taxonomists O
agree O
that O
what O
it O
serves, O
only O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
only O
at O
lunch, O
is O
a O
pub O
burger.) O
Like O
Peter O
Luger, O
Red O
Hook O
Tavern O
employs O
a O
toasted O
and O
buttered O
hard O
roll O
with O
a O
smattering O
of O
sesame O
seeds O
-- O
about O
as O
many O
as O
the O
stars O
you O
can O
see O
in O
the O
sky O
over O
Manhattan O
on O
a O
very O
clear O
night. O
In O
both O
places, O
the O
patties O
are O
made O
with O
some O
portion O
of O
dry-aged O
prime O
beef, O
stand O
about O
an O
inch O
and O
a O
half O
tall, O
and O
possess O
a O
dark O
crust O
that O
fills O
your O
head O
with O
the O
instinct-triggering O
aromas O
and O
flavors O
whose O
creation O
in O
browned O
meat O
was O
described O
by O
Louis O
Camille O
Maillard O
. O
There O
are O
some O
minor O
divergences. O
At O
Peter O
Luger, O
cheese O
is O
optional, O
while O
the O
top O
and O
sides O
of O
the O
burger O
at O
Red O
Hook O
Tavern O
are O
tightly O
wrapped O
in O
glossy O
yellow O
American O
cheese O
by O
default. O
A O
thick O
cross-section O
of O
white O
onion O
is O
laid O
below O
the O
top O
bun O
at O
Luger. O
At O
Red O
Hook O
Tavern, O
the O
onion O
is O
stationed O
below O
the O
patty, O
where O
it O
helps O
keep O
the O
bottom O
bun O
dry, O
like O
a O
coaster. O
They O
give O
you O
a O
half-sour O
pickle O
spear O
and O
fries, O
too, O
which O
are O
about O
the O
same O
dimensions. O
The O
important O
difference O
between O
the O
burgers, O
though, O
is O
that O
lately O
Peter O
Luger's O
have O
tended O
to O
be O
better O
in O
memory O
than O
in O
reality, O
while O
the O
Red O
Hook O
Tavern's O
is, O
right O
now, O
one O
of O
the O
few O
absolutely O
mandatory O
burgers O
in O
New O
York O
City. O
The O
kitchen O
is O
overseen O
by O
Allison O
Plumer, O
a O
chef O
who O
has O
done O
most O
of O
her O
cooking O
in O
Brooklyn. O
She O
has O
an O
excellent O
dry-aged O
steak O
-- O
New O
York O
strip, O
naturally O
-- O
impressively O
browned O
and O
served O
with O
a O
small O
cast-iron O
skillet O
full O
of O
creamed O
spinach, O
a O
touch O
so O
right O
it O
may O
qualify O
as O
art. O
It O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
detail O
that O
makes O
Red O
Hook O
Tavern O
something O
more O
than O
a O
place O
for O
the O
locals O
to O
get O
beer O
and O
burgers. O
Another O
is O
the O
golden O
chicken O
gravy O
with O
a O
hint O
of O
butterscotch O
that O
is O
ladled O
into O
a O
well O
in O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
that O
come O
with O
the O
half-chicken, O
which O
is O
advertised O
as O
simply O
pan-roasted, O
although O
it O
has O
the O
wonderfully O
stiff O
shards O
of O
skin O
you O
get O
from O
weighting O
down O
the O
bird O
as O
it O
cooks. O
Everybody O
who O
has O
eaten O
at O
Red O
Hook O
Tavern O
will O
tell O
you O
to O
get O
the O
country-ham-and-Cheddar O
croquettes O
on O
a O
creamy O
pool O
of O
whole-grain O
Dijonnaise. O
Everybody O
is O
right, O
too. O
Consensus O
has O
also O
formed O
around O
the O
wedge O
salad, O
which O
is O
clearly O
not O
a O
wedge, O
but O
is O
still O
a O
very O
fine O
salad, O
with O
blue O
cheese O
and O
a O
thick, O
Lugeresque O
bacon O
slice O
flopped O
over O
individual O
leaves O
of O
romaine. O
There O
is O
considerably O
less O
unanimity O
about O
the O
roasted O
corn, O
kernels O
of O
which O
you O
are O
supposed O
to O
wrap O
in O
radicchio O
that O
you've O
first O
smeared O
with O
'nduja; O
I'm O
in O
the O
camp O
that O
thinks O
it O
would O
be O
a O
fine O
dish O
for O
another O
restaurant. O
There O
is O
no O
restaurant O
where O
I'd O
be O
glad O
to O
see O
littlenecks O
steamed O
with O
way O
too O
much O
stale, O
acrid O
garlic. O
Of O
course, O
there's O
no O
correct O
amount O
of O
stale, O
acrid O
garlic, O
but O
the O
kitchen O
really O
goes O
all O
in. O
There O
are O
two O
desserts. O
Both O
are O
sundaes O
. O
They O
do O
not O
have O
the O
thematic O
inevitability O
of O
the O
creamed O
spinach, O
but O
they're O
put O
together O
with O
more O
sophistication O
than O
average. O
The O
truth O
is, O
though, O
that O
nothing O
on O
the O
menu O
gives O
the O
burger O
a O
real O
run O
for O
its O
money. O
What O
does, O
or O
at O
least O
equals O
it O
as O
a O
reason O
to O
reserve O
a O
table O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
in O
advance, O
is O
the O
list O
of O
drinks O
Mr. O
Durney O
has O
put O
together O
with O
Jeff O
Porter O
and O
Kenneth O
Crum. O
Mr. O
Durney's O
enthusiasm O
for O
wines O
made O
by O
small, O
eccentric O
producers O
is O
on O
view O
at O
Hometown, O
surely O
the O
only O
place O
on O
earth O
where O
you O
can O
drink O
Milan O
Nasterec's O
skin-fermented O
Moravian O
pinot O
noir O
alongside O
a O
taco O
filled O
with O
a O
slice O
of O
barbecued O
brisket O
and, O
in O
lieu O
of O
salsa, O
a O
glowing O
yellow O
stripe O
of O
queso. O
Mr. O
Durney O
indulges O
his O
curiosity O
more O
deeply O
at O
the O
tavern. O
Ten O
grower O
Champagnes O
can O
be O
had O
for O
under O
$100 O
a O
bottle, O
and O
there's O
a O
$40 O
sparkling O
red O
from O
Maryland. O
Darlings O
of O
the O
nonconformist O
wine O
movement O
such O
as O
Radikon O
, O
Marcel O
Lapierre O
and O
Frank O
Cornelissen O
are O
all O
given O
the O
space O
you'd O
expect, O
but O
there O
are O
also O
less O
familiar O
names O
like O
Subject O
to O
Change O
, O
a O
Forestville, O
Calif., O
outfit O
that O
has O
the O
peculiar O
idea O
of O
making O
a O
bright-toned, O
low-alcohol O
zinfandel-syrah O
blend O
and O
calling O
it O
Moon O
Juice. O
A O
small O
number O
of O
brews O
from O
Other O
Half, O
Folksbier O
and O
Threes O
Brewing, O
leading O
lights O
of O
the O
Brooklyn O
suds O
scene, O
are O
on O
tap, O
along O
with O
uncredited O
light O
and O
dark O
ales O
billed O
as O
"A O
Tribute O
To O
McSorleys O
Ale O
House." O
McSorley's, O
famously, O
has O
you O
buy O
two O
mugs O
at O
once, O
which O
Red O
Hook O
Tavern O
doesn't O
do. O
It's O
less O
well O
known O
that O
McSorley's O
serves O
a O
burger. O
Like O
the O
one O
at O
Luger, O
it's O
only O
available O
at O
lunch. O
It O
is, O
of O
course, O
a O
pub O
burger. O

For O
a O
long O
time, O
the O
seriousness O
of O
a O
pizzeria B-TYPE
could O
be O
gauged O
by O
a O
simple O
yes-or-no O
question: O
Did O
it O
sell O
pizza B-FOOD
by O
the O
slice? O
The O
ones O
that O
cared O
the O
most O
about O
upholding O
traditions, O
maintaining O
quality O
and O
so O
on O
-- O
like O
Totonno's B-EST
, O
John's B-EST
of I-EST
Bleecker I-EST
Street I-EST
, O
Kesté B-EST
, O
Lucali B-EST
, O
Una B-EST
Pizza I-EST
Napoletana I-EST
-- O
emphatically O
did O
not. O
Today, O
we O
live O
in O
the O
era O
of O
the O
elevated O
slice B-TYPE
joint. I-TYPE
Some O
of O
them, O
like O
Scarr's B-EST
, O
grind O
wheat B-FOOD
berries I-FOOD
into O
new O
flour B-FOOD
every O
day. O
Many O
use O
minuscule O
quantities O
of O
yeast; B-FOOD
others O
abandon O
commercial O
yeast B-FOOD
altogether O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
natural O
leavening O
in O
sourdough B-FOOD
starters. I-FOOD
There O
are O
slice B-TYPE
joints I-TYPE
that O
ferment O
their O
dough B-FOOD
for O
a O
day, O
some O
that O
let O
it O
bubble O
away O
for O
two O
days O
and O
a O
few O
that O
go O
in O
for O
three O
days. O
A O
new O
example O
of O
the O
breed, O
F&F B-EST
Pizzeria I-EST
, O
opened O
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
last O
week O
with O
the O
help O
of O
a O
baker O
whose O
starter B-FOOD
dough I-FOOD
has O
traveled O
internationally O
and O
another O
baker O
who O
has O
decades O
of O
experience O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
pizza O
paddle. O
Among O
themselves, O
these O
new-school O
pizza B-FOOD
makers O
speak O
of O
hydration O
levels, O
fermentation O
periods O
and O
digestibility. O
Many O
of O
these O
slice O
masters O
are O
chasing O
an O
ideal O
version O
of O
the O
foldable, O
portable O
triangle O
sold O
across O
linoleum O
counters O
in O
all O
five O
boroughs, O
a O
search O
suffused O
with O
nostalgia O
for O
an O
era O
before O
processed O
cheese, B-FOOD
sweetened O
sauce B-FOOD
and O
wholesale O
dough. B-FOOD
Others O
are O
celebrated O
for O
achievements O
in O
the O
square O
slice, O
a O
descendant O
of O
the O
Sicilian, B-CUISINE
with O
an O
airier, O
less O
doughy O
crust; B-FOOD
leaders O
in O
this O
style O
include O
Corner B-EST
Slice I-EST
and O
Mama's B-EST
Too I-EST
. O
Perhaps O
the O
smallest O
group O
of O
all O
are O
the O
bakers O
who O
turn O
their O
eyes O
toward O
Rome, B-LOC
where O
the O
slices O
are O
rectangular O
and O
are O
known O
as O
pizza B-DISH
al I-DISH
taglio. I-DISH
They O
resemble O
focaccia B-FOOD
more O
than O
a O
$3 O
slice O
from O
Ray's B-EST
, O
and O
it's O
doubtful O
that O
the O
practitioners O
of O
this O
style O
even O
think O
of O
themselves O
as O
belonging O
to O
the O
elevated-slice O
movement. O
But O
I'd O
argue O
that O
they O
do O
belong O
to O
it, O
and O
that O
some O
of O
the O
most O
elevated O
slices O
in O
the O
area O
at O
the O
moment O
are O
the O
Roman-style B-CUISINE
ones O
that O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
sells O
inside O
its O
bakery B-TYPE
and O
restaurant O
on O
Palisade B-LOC
Avenue, I-LOC
up O
in O
the O
Jersey B-LOC
City I-LOC
Heights. I-LOC
At O
any O
given O
time, O
three O
to O
six O
pizzas B-FOOD
sit O
on O
the O
counter. O
They O
are O
oblong O
and, O
because O
they O
are O
baked O
without O
a O
pan O
to O
shape O
the O
dough, B-FOOD
they O
have O
rounded O
corners, O
like O
a O
horse O
track. O
The O
crust B-FOOD
is O
noticeably O
lightweight O
when O
you O
pick O
it O
up, O
an O
impression O
that O
is O
confirmed O
by O
the O
mouth O
and, O
later, O
the O
stomach. O
The O
interior O
is O
honeycombed O
with O
air O
pockets. O
The O
underside O
of O
each O
slice O
is O
strong O
enough O
to O
carry O
a O
relatively O
heavy O
load O
of O
toppings O
without O
bending O
or O
collapsing. O
This O
structural O
soundness O
is O
key O
to O
the O
pleasure. O
The O
toppings O
on O
a O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
slice O
are O
not O
decorations O
or O
seasonings, O
as O
they O
often O
are O
on O
round O
pizza. B-FOOD
Each O
one O
is O
the O
point O
of O
its O
slice: O
a O
mix O
of O
fresh O
mushrooms B-FOOD
with O
pepper, B-FOOD
parsley B-FOOD
and O
flecks O
of O
grated O
Parmigiano-Reggiano; B-FOOD
zucchini B-FOOD
shaved O
into O
fine O
threads O
and O
showered O
at O
the O
last O
minute O
with O
mint B-FOOD
leaves; I-FOOD
slices O
of O
late-summer O
red B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
yellow I-FOOD
peppers I-FOOD
picked O
while O
they O
still O
had O
few O
faintly O
bitter O
streaks O
of O
green O
reaching O
up O
their O
sides; O
a O
rough, O
dark O
pesto B-FOOD
spooned O
around O
cherry B-FOOD
tomatoes I-FOOD
that O
were O
roasted O
until O
their O
skins O
turned O
black O
and O
pulled O
away O
from O
the O
globes O
of O
pulp O
inside; O
Concord B-FOOD
grapes I-FOOD
that O
blotch O
the O
dough B-FOOD
with O
purple O
like O
exploded O
jelly B-FOOD
grenades. O
A O
chef's O
hand O
is O
at O
work O
here, O
tossing O
black B-FOOD
pepper I-FOOD
and O
rosemary B-FOOD
over O
the O
grape B-DISH
pizza, I-DISH
adding O
salt B-FOOD
and O
excellent O
Sicilian B-FOOD
olive I-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
to O
the O
tomato B-FOOD
pulp, O
and O
hammering O
basil B-FOOD
and O
hazelnuts B-FOOD
for O
the O
pesto B-FOOD
in O
a O

The O
hand O
belongs O
to O
Rick O
Easton, O
who O
oversees O
the O
pizzas B-FOOD
and O
the O
nonpizzas O
and O
owns O
the O
restaurant. O
He O
also O
owned O
its O
predecessor, O
the O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
that O
operated O
in O
Pittsburgh B-LOC
for O
all O
of O
2015 O
plus O
a O
few O
weeks O
on O
either O
side. O
For O
a O
short-lived O
place, O
it O
got O
a O
lot O
of O
media O
attention, O
luring O
restaurant O
hunters O
and O
recipe O
gatherers O
from O
across O
the O
country. O
By O
the O
start O
of O
2016, O
he O
had O
decided O
to O
move O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City. I-LOC
When O
his O
first O
job O
fell O
through, O
he O
began O
shopping O
for O
a O
location O
for O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt. I-EST
The O
real O
estate O
market O
had O
ideas O
of O
its O
own, O
as O
it O
often O
does, O
which O
is O
how O
the O
incarnation O
of O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
that O
Mr. O
Easton O
opened O
early O
this O
summer O
wound O
up O
in O
New B-LOC
Jersey. I-LOC
In O
addition O
to O
cheaper O
rents, O
Jersey B-LOC
City I-LOC
has O
ordinances O
that O
allow O
customers O
to O
show O
up O
with O
bottles O
of O
wine B-FOOD
or O
beer B-FOOD
and O
drink O
them, O
a O
handy O
policy O
because O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt's I-EST
beverage O
list O
has O
nothing O
more O
potent O
than O
Italian B-FOOD
sodas I-FOOD
and O
sparkling B-FOOD
water. I-FOOD
Each O
night's O
menu, O
written O
in O
chalk O
on O
a O
blackboard O
next O
to O
the O
counter O
where O
you O
order, O
contains O
at O
least O
as O
many O
things O
that O
are O
not O
pizza B-FOOD
as O
things O
that O
are. O
Generally O
these O
other O
items O
are O
modest O
in O
size O
and O
trattoria-ish B-TYPE
in O
spirit; O
prepared O
ahead O
of O
time, O
they O
need O
at O
most O
five O
minutes O
in O
the O
oven O
before O
a O
cook O
will O
arrange O
them O
on O
a O
board O
and O
carry O
them O
to O
one O
of O
the O
25 O
or O
so O
seats. O
I O
wish O
the O
tripe B-DISH
stewed I-DISH
in I-DISH
spicy I-DISH
tomato I-DISH
sauce, I-DISH
the O
way O
Romans O
do O
it, O
were O
available O
all O
the O
time. O
It O
is O
not, O
but O
the O
meatballs B-DISH
almost O
always O
are, O
and O
they O
are O
wonderful, O
made O
with O
enough O
bread B-FOOD
that O
they O
are O
extremely O
tender O
in O
a O
bright O
marinara. B-FOOD
Another O
reliable O
find O
is O
a O
sandwich B-FOOD
of O
some O
kind, O
made O
with O
plain, O
untopped O
pizza. B-FOOD
Twice O
I've O
had O
a O
warm O
mortadella B-DISH
sandwich I-DISH
there, O
and O
both O
times O
I O
was O
convinced O
there O
was O
no O
way O
to O
improve O
on O
it. O
One O
dish O
was O
denoted O
on O
the O
menu O
by O
a O
single O
word: O
beans. B-DISH
I've O
thought O
of O
it O
nearly O
every O
day O
since, O
partly O
because O
the O
beans B-FOOD
-- O
scarlet B-FOOD
runners I-FOOD
-- O
were O
perfectly O
intact O
but O
perfectly O
tender; O
partly O
because O
of O
the O
brooding O
depth O
they O
took O
on O
from O
being O
finished O
with O
sweet B-FOOD
red I-FOOD
peppers I-FOOD
that O
the O
kitchen O
dried O
and O
fried, O
an O
ingredient O
the O
Italians O
call O
peperoni B-FOOD
cruschi; I-FOOD
and O
partly O
because O
their O
broth B-FOOD
tasted O
so O
good O
when O
given O
a O
chance O
to O
soak O
into O
the O
slice O
of O
thick-crusted O
sourdough B-FOOD
bread I-FOOD
that O
came O
on O
top. O
That O
bread B-FOOD
is O
Mr. O
Easton's, O
too. O
It O
comes O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
things, O
and O
it O
is O
excellent. O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
is O
still O
settling O
into O
New B-LOC
Jersey. I-LOC
Some O
ingredients O
may O
be O
better O
when O
Mr. O
Easton O
has O
had O
time O
to O
infiltrate O
the O
local O
farm O
scene. O
In O
August, O
when O
the O
state O
was O
rolling O
in O
juicy O
peaches, B-FOOD
he O
was O
serving O
crunchy O
unripe O
ones O
in O
red B-FOOD
wine I-FOOD
for O
dessert. O
There O
was O
also O
a O
very O
strange O
cantaloupe B-DISH
pudding. I-DISH
By O
September O
things O
were O
looking O
up; O
one O
day O
there O
was O
a O
scoop O
of O
Tristar B-DISH
strawberry I-DISH
sorbet I-DISH
served O
with O
anise-seed-flecked B-FOOD
polenta I-FOOD
gelato, I-FOOD
both O
made O
by O
Superiority B-EST
Burger. I-EST
(Mr. O
Easton O
is O
friendly O
with O
that O
restaurant's O
owner, O
Brooks O
Headley O
, O
and O
helped O
devise O
the O
recipe O
for O
the O
focaccia B-FOOD
Superiority B-EST
Burger I-EST
serves O
on O
Fridays.) O
Although O
Mr. O
Easton O
has O
a O
handful O
of O
employees, O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
has O
some O
of O
the O
blind O
spots O
of O
a O
one-person O
operation. O
It O
is O
not O
the O
easiest O
restaurant O
to O
communicate O
with, O
having O
an O
Instagram O
account O
but O
no O
website O
or O
phone. O
On O
a O
recent O
Sunday, O
when O
the O
restaurant O
was O
supposed O
to O
open O
at O
1 O
p.m., O
a O
sign O
on O
the O
front O
door O
announced O
that O
it O
would O
be O
delayed O
until O
1:30. O
That O
was O
the O
last O
communiqué; O
the O
doors O
were O
not O
unlocked O
until O
2. O
But O
Mr. O
Easton O
has O
a O
singular O
vision, O
and O
it O
is O
the O
reason O
the O
food O
is O
so O
compelling. O
Looking O
around O
at O
the O
place, O
you're O
not O
sure O
how O
it O
can O
keep O
going O
like O
this. O
But O
then O
the O
plates O
start O
to O
come O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
and O
you O
don't O
want O
them O
ever O
to O
stop. O

-DOCSTART- O

Over O
the O
years, O
I O
have O
eaten O
many O
bowls O
of O
pasta B-DISH
with I-DISH
clams I-DISH
that O
have O
been O
rewired O
by O
a O
chef O
who O
was O
trying O
to O
stand O
out. O
But O
I O
had O
not O
come O
across O
one O
that O
made O
as O
much O
sense O
to O
me O
as O
the O
big, O
sloshing O
platters O
you O
get O
at O
old-line O
Italian-American B-CUISINE
clam B-TYPE
bars I-TYPE
like O
Randazzo's B-EST
until O
tripping O
into O
a O
new O
Greenwich B-LOC
Village I-LOC
restaurant O
called O
Babs B-EST
this O
summer. O
Mind O
you, O
virtually O
the O
only O
Italian B-CUISINE
thing O
about O
the O
tagliatelle B-DISH
with I-DISH
clams I-DISH
at O
Babs B-EST
was O
the O
tagliatelle. B-FOOD
The O
sauce B-FOOD
was O
a O
mustard B-FOOD
beurre I-FOOD
blanc, I-FOOD
one O
of O
those O
French B-CUISINE
sauces B-FOOD
that O
all O
culinary-school O
students O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
able O
to O
make O
in O
their O
sleep. O
Mustard B-FOOD
beurre I-FOOD
blanc I-FOOD
is O
often O
found O
providing O
a O
decorous O
yellow O
veil O
over O
a O
chicken B-FOOD
breast I-FOOD
or O
salmon B-FOOD
fillet. I-FOOD
It O
is O
not O
normally O
poured O
over O
noodles. B-FOOD
But, O
tossed O
with O
salty O
French B-FOOD
ham I-FOOD
and O
Manila O
clams O
smaller O
than O
a O
thumbprint, O
it O
made O
a O
strangely O
exciting O
bowl O
of O
pasta O
that O
was O
much O
more O
coherent O
than O
it O
sounds. O
Once O
I O
got O
to O
know O
Babs O
better, O
I O
understood O
that O
strange O
excitement O
is O
what O
it O
does O
best. O
Its O
chef, O
Efrén O
Hernández, O
has O
talked O
about O
Babs O
as O
a O
European O
grill, O
and O
many O
of O
the O
dishes O
are O
seared O
over O
hot O
charcoal, O
but O
he O
has O
a O
wider O
frame O
of O
reference O
than O
that. O
He O
was O
raised O
in O
Southern O
California O
by O
immigrants O
from O
Mexico, O
and O
Mexican O
cuisine O
runs O
through O
his O
menu O
like O
an O
underground O
stream O
that O
sometimes O
gurgles O
up O
to O
the O
surface. O
Mr. O
Hernández O
is O
not O
particularly O
interested O
in O
fusion, O
though; O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell, O
he O
likes O
rubbing O
cultures O
together O
to O
see O
what O
color O
the O
sparks O
will O
be. O
See, O
for O
example, O
what O
the O
menu O
calls O
divorced O
sea O
bream, O
a O
handsome O
dish O
that O
would O
be O
splashed O
around O
Instagram O
even O
more O
frequently O
than O
it O
already O
is O
if O
the O
dining O
tables O
were O
lighted O
by O
ceiling O
pinspots O
rather O
than O
disco-era O
chrome O
globes O
that O
look O
as O
if O
they O
were O
salvaged O
from O
Regine's O
. O
The O
bream O
is O
split, O
and O
one O
side O
brushed O
with O
a O
red O
sauce O
and O
the O
other O
with O
a O
green O
sauce, O
before O
it O
is O
grilled O
over O
charcoal. O
The O
dish O
is O
an O
allusion O
to O
the O
two-tone O
pescado O
a O
la O
talla O
served O
at O
Contramar O
in O
Mexico O
City, O
itself O
derived O
from O
huevos O
divorciados, O
a O
breakfast O
of O
two O
fried O
eggs O
beneath O
two O
contrasting O
salsas. O
In O
Mr. O
Hernández's O
kitchen, O
though, O
the O
red O
adobo O
at O
Contramar O
is O
replaced O
by O
a O
Catalan O
romesco, O
and O
the O
parsley O
salsa O
becomes O
a O
French O
pistou. O
But O
surely O
the O
tortilla O
on O
its O
own O
plate O
off O
to O
one O
side O
brings O
it O
back O
to O
Mexico? O
Not O
so O
fast. O
According O
to O
the O
menu, O
it O
is O
a O
taloa, O
a O
Basque O
cornmeal O
cake O
that O
cooks O
from O
Bayonne O
to O
Bilbao O
have O
been O
griddling O
for O
centuries. O
The O
taloa O
at O
Babs O
is O
tender, O
smooth O
and O
floral. O
Mr. O
Hernández O
has O
been O
cooking O
at O
Babs O
since O
it O
opened O
in O
July. O
He O
is O
also O
the O
chef O
at O
Mimi O
, O
a O
French O
restaurant O
a O
block O
away O
that O
is O
owned O
by O
the O
same O
people O
(Daniel O
Bennett, O
his O
brother O
Evan, O
and O
Louis O
Levy; O
they O
named O
Babs O
and O
Mimi O
after O
their O
grandmothers.) O
I O
haven't O
been O
back O
to O
Mimi O
since O
Liz O
Johnson O
was O
the O
chef O
. O
She O
was O
aiming O
for O
a O
style O
that O
was O
at O
once O
brawny O
and O
lavish, O
and O
since O
taking O
over O
last O
year O
Mr. O
Hernández O
has O
seemed O
to O
continue O
in O
that O
vein O
while O
bringing O
his O
far-ranging O
curiosity O
to O
bear. O
As O
they O
did O
at O
Mimi, O
the O
owners O
have O
planted O
a O
small O
curved O
bar O
right O
by O
the O
door O
at O
Babs. O
The O
cocktails O
stirred O
and O
shaken O
there O
are O
mostly O
recognizable O
relatives O
of O
classics, O
like O
a O
martini O
made O
with O
two O
brands O
of O
gin. O
There's O
something O
charmingly O
self-deprecating O
about O
a O
cocktail O
list O
that O
includes O
Mount O
Gay O
and O
tonic, O
which O
seasoned O
barflies O
know O
as O
one O
of O
the O
drinks O
you O
can O
safely O
order O
in O
dives O
that O
don't O
do O
anything O
else O
right. O
The O
wine O
list, O
meanwhile, O
is O
mostly O
French O
and O
sticks O
to O
the O
old O
guard; O
you O
can O
tell O
it's O
not O
trying O
especially O
hard O
to O
be O
cool O
by O
the O
way O
it O
has O
just O
one O
orange O
wine, O
lumped O
in O
with O
the O
sparkling O
wines. O
Only O
the O
wine O
geeks O
will O
wish O
for O
more, O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
might O
wish O
there O
were O
as O
many O
bottles O
costing O
around O
$50 O
as O
there O
are O
in O
the O
$90 O
range. O
The O
numbers O
on O
the O
menu O
can O
sneak O
up O
on O
you, O
too. O
My O
$48 O
lobster O
was O
a O
small O
creature O
that O
couldn't O
have O
weighed O
much O
more O
than O
a O
pound. O
The O
server O
brightly O
suggested O
dunking O
its O
tomalley O
into O
the O
smoked O
potato O
purée, O
and O
I O
would O
have O
tried O
it O
if O
I O
had O
found O
any O
tomalley. O
And O
while O
I O
can O
imagine O
happily O
paying O
$36 O
for O
Babs's O
lamb O
chops, O
I'd O
want O
them O
to O
be O
served O
with O
something O
more O
compelling O
than O
the O
cold, O
underseasoned O
"Basque O
potato O
salad" O
into O
which O
some O
baby O
sardines O
had O
apparently O
disappeared O
without O
a O
trace. O
But O
there O
is O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
the O
charcoal-grilled O
swordfish O
with O
mint O
salsa O
verde, O
fennel O
and O
green O
olives, O
and O
if O
you O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
andouille O
this O
summer O
you O
found O
Mr. O
Hernández O
knocking O
cuisines O
together O
again, O
this O
time O
with O
a O
corn-and-chanterelles O
risotto O
under O
a O
slow-burning O
splash O
of O
Calabrian O
chile O
oil. O
He O
shows O
how O
well O
he O
can O
work O
in O
small O
strokes O
with O
a O
layered O
appetizer O
of O
raw O
sea O
scallops, O
sweet O
potato O
purée O
and O
trout O
roe, O
seasoned O
with O
a O
briny O
and O
fascinating O
salsa O
of O
chopped O
cucumbers, O
seaweed O
and O
fermented O
serrano O
chiles; O
or O
the O
fried O
cod O
cheeks, O
tender O
and O
crunchy O
over O
an O
orange O
slick O
of O
romesco O
aioli. O
Mr. O
Hernández's O
imagination O
fights O
against O
predictability. O
A O
crab O
salad, O
for O
instance, O
doesn't O
need O
to O
be O
interesting O
if O
it O
is O
fresh, O
but O
the O
one O
at O
Babs O
is O
both. O
It's O
seasoned O
with O
a O
gribiche O
that's O
full O
of O
chopped O
fresh O
dill, O
and O
then O
it's O
piled O
up O
in O
a O
big O
beehive O
on O
top O
of O
a O
smoked O
potato O
pancake. O
Like O
many O
small O
restaurants O
these O
days, O
Babs O
doesn't O
offer O
many O
desserts, O
but O
the O
ones O
it O
does O
are O
far O
more O
intriguing O
than O
average. O
A O
fine O
apple O
galette O
is O
improved O
by O
a O
grating O
of O
Swiss-style O
cheese O
from O
Edelweiss O
Creamery O
in O
Wisconsin O
and O
by O
a O
drizzle O
of O
20-year-old O
Pedro O
Ximénez O
sherry, O
thick O
as O
syrup O
and O
tasting O
like O
chocolate O
and O
coffee. O
Why O
sherry O
with O
Swiss O
cheese? O
I O
don't O
know, O
but O
Mr. O

Tsismis B-EST
is O
the O
opposite O
of O
a O
speakeasy. B-TYPE
It O
isn't O
hiding O
anything; O
its O
glass O
facade O
on O
Orchard B-LOC
Street I-LOC
wants O
to O
strike O
up O
a O
conversation O
so O
badly O
that O
it O
almost O
follows O
you O
home. O
The O
windows O
are O
stenciled O
with O
cartoon O
characters O
and O
with O
text-message O
bubbles O
that O
call O
out O
in O
English O
("Hello! O
New O
York"), O
Spanish O
("que O
rico!"), O
French O
("bon O
appétit") O
and O
Tagalog O
("masarap," O
for O
delicious). O
The O
language O
lessons O
continue O
on O
the O
front O
door, O
which O
gives O
translations O
for O
"tuloy O
po O
kayo" O
(welcome) O
and O
the O
restaurant's O
name O
(gossip), O
pronounced O
chiss-miss. O
In O
case O
you O
miss O
all O
of O
this, O
a O
sandwich O
board O
straddles O
the O
sidewalk, O
advertising O
discounted O
beer, B-FOOD
wine B-FOOD
and O
wings B-FOOD
at O
the O
bar O
during O
happy O
hour O
("5:thirsty"). O
If O
you O
accept O
the O
facade's O
invitation O
to O
benaquitodits O
(come O
here O
here, O
a O
repetitive O
bit O
of O
Tagalog O
slang), O
the O
conversation O
will O
continue O
inside. O
Tsismis, B-EST
which O
opened O
in O
June, O
is O
a O
chatty O
restaurant. O
At O
times, O
when O
one O
of O
the O
owners O
pulls O
up O
alongside O
your O
table O
and O
expounds O
on O
how O
the O
chef's O
interpretation O
of O
the O
dish O
you're O
trying O
to O
eat O
differs O
from O
what O
you O
might O
find O
in O
the O
Philippines, B-LOC
you O
may O
find O
yourself O
eyeing O
the O
exit. O
If O
you've O
found O
your O
way O
to O
the O
menu's O
strengths, O
though, O
odds O
are O
you O
won't O
want O
to O
go O
anywhere. O
Kinilaw, B-DISH
a O
Filipino B-CUISINE
ceviche B-FOOD
in O
a O
piercingly O
sour O
calamansi B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
cane I-FOOD
vinegar I-FOOD
marinade I-FOOD
with O
a O
jab O
of O
bird's-eye B-FOOD
chile, I-FOOD
is O
worth O
sticking O
around O
for, O
especially O
on O
those O
nights O
when O
it's O
made O
with O
bay B-FOOD
scallops I-FOOD
instead O
of O
fish. B-FOOD
After O
that, O
you O
might O
look O
into O
the O
fried O
pork-and-carrot O
won O
tons O
called O
pinsec O
frito O
(or, O
as O
the O
menu O
has O
them, O
pinsit O
frito). O
They O
are O
typically O
folded O
into O
triangles, O
but O
the O
ones O
at O
Tsismis O
are O
twisted O
into O
little O
cones O
that O
look O
like O
Hershey's O
kisses, O
though O
slightly O
bigger O
and O
golden-brown. O
Once O
they O
stop O
steaming, O
you O
can O
hold O
them O
by O
the O
cowlick O
of O
fried O
wrapper O
at O
the O
top O
and O
swish O
them O
around O
in O
the O
sweet O
chile O
sauce. O
Won O
tons O
with O
the O
same O
filling O
flop O
around O
in O
the O
soup O
called O
pancit O
molo, O
although O
these O
are O
boiled. O
There O
is O
almost O
as O
much O
ground O
pork O
inside O
them O
as O
outside O
in O
the O
broth, O
which O
is O
thick O
with O
garlic O
and O
chopped O
scallions. O
Even O
if O
it's O
well O
after O
5:thirsty O
and O
you're O
not O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar, O
Jappy's O
wings O
are O
worth O
considering. O
Jappy O
is O
the O
chef, O
Jappy O
Afzelius, O
and O
he O
fries O
those O
wings O
with O
thinly O
sliced O
garlic O
and O
sends O
them O
out O
to O
the O
dining O
room O
with O
a O
salsa O
of O
raw O
mangoes, O
charred O
onions O
and O
chiles. O
The O
heat O
of O
the O
salsa O
will O
not O
cause O
your O
shirt O
to O
burst O
into O
flames, O
but O
it O
is O
hot O
enough O
to O
make O
your O
memory O
of O
Jappy's O
wings O
a O
lasting O
one. O
Mr. O
Afzelius O
is O
a O
native O
of O
the O
Philippines O
and O
a O
graduate O
of O
a O
cooking O
academy O
in O
Manila, O
which O
shipped O
him O
off O
to O
Paris O
to O
intern O
in O
one O
of O
Alain O
Ducasse's O
bistros. O
The O
Ducasse O
masterminds O
then O
sent O
him O
to O
work O
at O
Benoit O
in O
New O
York, O
after O
which O
he O
turned O
up O
as O
the O
sous-chef O
at O
a O
Filipino O
restaurant O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
was O
best O
known O
for O
its O
$100 O
doughnut O
-- O
ube-filled, O
Cristal-frosted O
and O
gold-leafed. O
Happily, O
nothing O
at O
Tsismis O
approaches O
that O
level O
of O
look-at-me O
desperation. O
Mr. O
Afzelius's O
cooking O
is O
loose, O
unfussy O
and O
liberated. O
He O
tosses O
tradition O
under O
the O
bus O
when O
it O
suits O
him. O
The O
result O
is O
Filipino-American O
drinking O
food O
that O
tends O
to O
be O
charmingly O
offhand. O
From O
time O
to O
time, O
it O
can O
lean O
toward O
sloppiness. O
One O
night O
the O
fried O
milkfish O
in O
pritong O
isda O
was O
so O
overdone O
that O
even O
topping O
it O
with O
calamansi O
juice, O
fish O
sauce O
and O
a O
crisp, O
juicy O
spoonful O
of O
marinated O
chayote O
on O
top O
didn't O
revive O
it. O
A O
version O
of O
adobong O
manok, O
which O
Mr. O
Afzelius O
makes O
as O
a O
roasted O
chicken O
plus O
a O
soy-turmeric O
sauce O
rather O
than O
an O
all-in-one O
stew, O
would O
have O
been O
more O
successful O
if O
the O
smoked O
eggplant O
hadn't O
been O
so O
undercooked O
it O
squeaked. O
But O
the O
grilled O
eggplant O
on O
top O
of O
the O
kare-kare O
was O
as O
soft O
as O
warm O
marrow, O
and O
the O
other O
vegetables O
-- O
crisp O
green O
beans, O
bok O
choy, O
enoki O
mushrooms O
-- O
made O
a O
refreshing O
counterpoint O
to O
the O
stewed O
oxtails O
in O
thick O
peanut O
sauce. O
Already O
pungent O
with O
shrimp O
paste, O
the O
kare-kare O
comes O
with O
extra O
on O
the O
side O
that O
you O
can O
add O
to O
your O
heart's O
content. O
As O
they O
do O
at O
Bad O
Saint O
in O
Washington, O
probably O
the O
country's O
most O
talked-about O
Filipino O
restaurant, O
Tsismis O
makes O
its O
laing O
by O
simmering O
local O
kale, O
rather O
than O
the O
more O
traditional O
taro O
leaves, O
in O
coconut O
milk. O
And O
if O
this O
version O
doesn't O
have O
the O
perspective-altering O
funk O
of O
Bad O
Saint's, O
it O
still O
draws O
plenty O
of O
depth O
from O
the O
shrimp O
paste O
and O
smoked O
fish O
in O
the O
milk O
and O
the O
big O
handful O
of O
dried O
baby O
shrimp O
dropped O
on O
top. O
By O
this O
point, O
you O
will O
probably O
want O
to O
have O
a O
glass O
in O
your O
hand. O
Housemade O
calamansi O
soda O
sounds O
lovely, O
but O
mine O
was O
a O
little O
flat O
and O
weak. O
In O
lieu O
of O
hard O
spirits, O
sake O
is O
the O
backbone O
of O
most O
of O
the O
cocktails. O
They O
are O
typically O
fleshed O
out O
with O
half O
a O
dozen O
other O
ingredients O
-- O
vermouth, O
Aperol, O
artichoke O
liqueur O
and O
bitters, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
A O
La O
Bira O
-- O
which O
sound O
at O
first O
as O
if O
they O
had O
been O
assembled O
by O
walking O
through O
a O
liquor O
store O
blindfolded, O
but O
which O
after O
a O
closer O
look O
reveal O
a O
degree O
of O
inner O
logic. O
If O
this O
does O
not O
pique O
your O
curiosity, O
the O
list O
of O
wines O
by O
the O
glass O
is O
almost O
long O
enough O
to O
qualify O
Tsismis O
as O
a O
wine O
bar, O
although O
the O
choices O
are O
not O
as O
outré O
as O
they O
are O
across O
the O
street O
at O
Wildair O
. O
In O
a O
city O
crazy O
for O
kakigori O
, O
patbingsu O
and O
other O
varieties O
of O
flavored O
snow, O
Tsismis's O
halo-halo O
will O
probably O
be O
an O
instant O
hit. O
Mr. O
Afzelius O
has O
the O
very O
good O
idea O
of O
putting O
coconut O
sorbet O
where O
the O
shaved O
ice O
would O
usually O
go; O
from O
there O
he O
goes O
to O
town O
with O
coconut O
jellies O
and O
what O
seems O
like O
every O
fresh O
fruit O
he O
can O
put O
his O
hands O
on. O
But O
discerning O
collectors O
of O
Filipino O
sweets O
should O
note O
that O
Tsismis O
serves O
excellent O
silvanas. O
A O
silvana O
is O
either O
a O
shrunken O
cake O
or O
a O
cookie O
with O
big O
ideas, O
depending O
on O
your O
perspective. O
It O
is O
made O
of O
two O
cashew O
meringues O
that O
are O
sandwiched O
together O
with O
buttercream O
and O
then O
painted O
with O
more O
buttercream, O
which O
holds O
cashew O
crumbs O
to O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
whole O
package. O
Once O
frosted O
and O
crumbed, O
it O
has O
to O
be O
refrigerated O
or O
the O
buttercream O
will O
melt O
before O
it O
gets O
inside O
your O
mouth. O
No O
gold O
leaf O
adorns O
the O
silvanas. O
It O
would O
only O
get O
in O
the O
way. O

I O
can O
count O
on O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
Steak I-EST
House I-EST
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
to O
produce O
certain O
sensations O
at O
every O
meal. O
There O
is O
the O
insistent O
smell O
of O
broiled B-DISH
dry-aged I-DISH
steak I-DISH
that O
hits O
me O
the O
minute O
I O
open O
the O
door O
and O
sometimes O
sooner, O
while O
I'm O
still O
outside O
on O
the O
South B-LOC
Williamsburg I-LOC
sidewalk, O
producing O
a O
raised O
pulse, O
a O
quickening O
of O
the O
senses O
and O
a O
restlessness O
familiar O
to O
anyone O
who O
has O
seen O
a O
tiger O
that O
has O
just O
heard O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
lunch O
bucket. O
There O
is O
the O
hiss O
of O
butter B-FOOD
and O
melted O
tallow B-FOOD
as O
they O
slide O
down O
the O
hot O
platter, O
past O
the O
sliced B-DISH
porterhouse I-DISH
or O
rib B-DISH
steak I-DISH
and O
their O
charred O
bones, O
to O
make O
a O
pool O
at O
one O
end. O
The O
server O
will O
spoon O
some O
of O
this O
sizzling O
fat O
over O
the O
meat B-FOOD
he O
has O
just O
plated, O
generally O
with O
some O
line O
like O
"Here O
are O
your O
vitamins." O
There O
is O
the O
thunk O
of O
a O
bowl O
filled O
with O
schlag B-FOOD
landing O
on O
a O
bare O
wood O
table O
when O
dessert O
is O
served, O
and O
soon O
after, O
the O
softer O
tap-tap-tap O
of O
waxy O
chocolate B-FOOD
coins O
in O
gold O
foil O
dropped O
one O
at O
a O
time O
on O
top O
of O
the O
check. O
And O
after O
I've O
paid, O
there O
is O
the O
unshakable O
sense O
that O
I've O
been O
scammed. O
The O
last O
sensation O
was O
not O
part O
of O
the O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
experience O
when O
I O
started O
eating O
there, O
in O
the O
1990s. O
I O
was O
acutely O
aware O
of O
the O
cost O
back O
then O
because O
I O
would O
settle O
the O
tab O
by O
counting O
out O
$20 O
bills; O
cash O
was O
the O
only O
way O
to O
pay O
unless O
you O
had O
a O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
credit O
card. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
night O
my O
wallet O
would O
be O
empty. O
Because O
a O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
steak B-DISH
made O
me O
feel O
alive O
in O
a O
way O
that O
few O
other O
things O
did, O
I O
considered O
this O
a O
fair O
trade, O
although O
I O
could O
afford O
it O
only O
once O
a O
year O
or O
so. O
I O
don't O
remember O
when O
the O
doubts O
began, O
but O
they O
grew O
over O
time. O
Diners O
who O
walk O
in O
the O
door O
eager O
to O
hand O
over O
literal O
piles O
of O
money O
aren't O
greeted; O
they're O
processed. O
A O
host O
with O
a O
clipboard O
looks O
for O
the O
name, O
or O
writes O
it O
down O
and O
quotes O
a O
waiting O
time. O
There O
is O
almost O
always O
a O
wait, O
with O
or O
without O
a O
reservation, O
and O
there O
is O
almost O
always O
a O
long O
line O
of O
supplicants O
against O
the O
wall. O
A O
kind O
word O
or O
reassuring O
smile O
from O
somebody O
on O
staff O
would O
help O
the O
time O
pass. O
The O
smile O
never O
comes. O
The O
Department O
of O
Motor O
Vehicles O
is O
a O
block O
party O
compared O
with O
the O
line O

The O
management O
seems O
to O
go O
out O
of O
its O
way O
to O
make O
things O
inconvenient. O
Customers O
at O
the O

food O
from O

then O
pay O
two O

checks O

leave O
two O

tips. O
And O
they O
can't O
order O
lunch O
after O
2:30 O

its O

two-star O
review O
in O

Times O
, O
written O
by O
Frank O
Bruni O
in O
2007, O
the O
restaurant O
has O
started O
taking O
online O
reservations. O
It O
accepts O
debit O
cards, O
too, O
which O
is O
nice. O

the O

you O
use O
to O
buy O
a O

at O

a O

The O
servers, O
who O
once O
were O
charmingly O
brusque, O
now O
give O
the O
strong O
impression O
that O
these O
endless O
demands O
for O
food O
and O
drink O
are O
all O
that's O
standing O
between O
them O
and O
a O
hard-earned O
nap. O
Signals O
that O
a O
customer O
has O
a O
question O
or O
request O
don't O
get O
picked O
up O
as O
quickly; O
the O
canned O
jokes O
about O
spinach B-FOOD
and O
schlag B-FOOD
don't O
flow O
as O
freely. O
Some O
things O
are O
the O
same O
as O
ever. O
The O
shrimp B-DISH
cocktail I-DISH
has O
always O
tasted O
like O
cold O
latex O
dipped O
in O
ketchup B-FOOD
and O
horseradish. B-FOOD
The O
steak B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
has O
always O
tasted O
like O
the O
same O
ketchup B-FOOD
and O
horseradish B-FOOD
fortified O
by O
corn B-FOOD
syrup. I-FOOD
Although O
the O
fries B-DISH
are O
reasonably O
crisp, O
their O
insides O
are O
mealy O
and O
bland O
in O
a O
way O
that O
fresh-cut O
potatoes B-FOOD
almost O
certainly O
would O
not O
be. O
The O
sole B-DISH
-- O
yes, O
I'm O
the O
person O
who O
ordered O
the O
sole B-DISH
at O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
-- O
was O
strangely O
similar: O
The O
bread B-FOOD
crumbs I-FOOD
on O
top O
were O
gold O
and O
crunchy, O
but O
the O
fish B-FOOD
underneath O
was O
dry O
and O
almost O
powdery. O
Was O
the O
Caesar B-DISH
salad I-DISH
always O
so O
drippy, O
the O
croutons B-FOOD
always O
straight O
out O
of O
a O
bag, O
the O
grated O
cheese B-FOOD
always O
so O
white O
and O
rubbery? O
I O
know O
there O
was O
a O
time O
the O
German B-DISH
fried I-DISH
potatoes I-DISH
were O
brown O
and O
crunchy, O
because O
I O
eagerly O
ate O
them O
each O
time O
I O
went. O
Now O
they O
are O
mushy, O
dingy, O
gray O
and O
sometimes O
cold. O
I O
look O
forward O
to O
them O
the O
way O
I O
look O
forward O
to O
finding O
a O
new, O
irregularly O
shaped O
mole. O

Pete O

review O

Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
.] O
Lunch O
one O
afternoon O
vividly O
demonstrated O
the O
kitchen's O
inconsistency: O
I O
ordered O
a O
burger, B-DISH
medium-rare, O
at O
the O
bar. O
So O
had O
the O
two O
people O
sitting O
to O
my O
right, O
it O
turned O
out. O
One O
of O
them O
got O
what O
we'd O
all O
asked O
for, O
a O
midnight-dark O
crust O
giving O
way O
to O
an O
evenly O
rosy O
interior O
so O
full O
of O
juices O
it O
looked O
like O
it O
was O
ready O
to O
cry. O
The O
other O
one O
got O
a O
patty B-FOOD
that O
was O
almost O
completely O
brown O
inside. O
I O
got O
a O
weird O
hybrid, O
a O
burger B-FOOD
whose O
interior O
shaded O
from O
nearly O
perfect O
on O
one O
side O
to O
gray O
and O
hard O
on O
the O
other. O
The O
same O
issue O
afflicted O
a O
medium-rare B-DISH
porterhouse I-DISH
I O
was O
served O
one O
night: O
The O
fillet B-FOOD
was O
ideal O
but O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
T-bone, B-FOOD
the O
strip, B-FOOD
ranged O
from O
medium-rare O
to O
medium-well. O
I O
could O
live O
with O
this; O
big O
cuts O
of O
meat O
don't O
always O
cook O
evenly. O
What O
gnaws O
at O
me O
every O
time O
I O
eat O
a O
Luger B-EST
porterhouse B-DISH
is O
the O
realization O
that O
it's O
just O
another O
steak, B-FOOD
and O
far O
from O
the O
best O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
has O
to O
offer. O
[ O
Melissa O
Clark O
shows O
you O
how O
to O
cook O
a O
steak B-FOOD
at O
home O
. O
] O
Other O
restaurants, O
and O
not O
just O
steakhouses, B-TYPE
can O
put O
a O
formidable O
crust O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
cut; O
Luger B-EST
caramelizes O
the O
top O
side O
only, O
while O
the O
underside O
is O
barely O
past O
raw, O
as O
if O
it O
had O
done O
all O
its O
cooking O
on O
the O
hot O
platter. O
Other O
restaurants, O
and O
not O
just O
steakhouses, B-TYPE
buy O
beef B-FOOD
that O
is O
tender, O
richly O
marbled O
and O
deeply O
flavorful; O
at O
Luger, B-EST
you O
get O
the O
first O
two O
but O
not O
the O
third. O
Other O
restaurants, O
and O
not O
just O
steakhouses, B-TYPE
age O
that O
beef B-FOOD
to O
make O
flavor O
grow O
and O
intensify O
and O
double O
back O
on O
itself; O
dry-aging O
at O
Luger B-EST
still O
results O
in O
a O
tender O
steak, B-FOOD
but O
it O
rarely O
achieves O
a O
hypnotic O
or O
compelling O
or O
even O
very O
interesting O
one. O
But O
those O
other O
restaurants O
are O
not O
Peter B-EST
Luger, I-EST
as O
Friedrich O
Nietzsche O
might O
have O
said. O
"When O
in O
this O
essay O
I O
declare O
war O
upon O
Wagner," O
Nietzsche O
wrote O
in O
" O
The O
Case O
of O
Wagner O
," O
"the O
last O
thing O
I O
want O
to O
do O
is O
start O
a O
celebration O
for O
any O
other O
musicians. O
Other O
musicians O
don't O
count O
compared O
to O
Wagner." O
I O
could O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
about O
other O
steakhouses B-TYPE
-- O
compared O
to O
Peter B-EST
Luger, I-EST
they O
don't O
count. O
Luger B-EST
is O
not O
the O
city's O
oldest, O
but O
it's O
the O
one O
in O
which O
age, O
tradition, O
superb O
beef, B-FOOD
blistering O
heat, O
an O
instinctive O
avoidance O
of O
anything O
fancy O
and O
an O
immensely O
attractive O
self-assurance O
came O
together O
to O
produce O
something O
that O
felt O
less O
like O
a O
restaurant O
than O
an O
affirmation O
of O
life, O
or O
at O
least O
life O
as O
it O
is O
lived O
in O
New O
York O
City. O
This O
sounds O
ridiculously O
grand. O
Years O
ago O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
true, O
though, O
and O
so O
did O
other O
people. O
The O
restaurant O
will O
always O
have O
its O
loyalists. O
They O
will O
laugh O
away O
the O
prices, O
the O
$16.95 O
sliced O
tomatoes O
that O
taste O
like O
1979, O
the O
$229.80 O
porterhouse O
for O
four. O
They O
will O
say O
that O
nobody O
goes O
to O
Luger O
for O
the O
sole, O
nobody O
goes O
to O
Luger O
for O
the O
wine, O
nobody O
goes O
to O
Luger O
for O
the O
salad, O
nobody O
goes O
to O
Luger O
for O
the O
service. O
The O
list O
goes O
on, O
and O
gets O
harder O
to O
swallow, O
until O
you O
start O
to O
wonder O
who O
really O
needs O
to O
go O
to O
Peter O
Luger, O
and O
start O
to O
think O
the O
answer O
is O
nobody. O

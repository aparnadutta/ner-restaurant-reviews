{"id": 43, "data": " Hanon, a new udon shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was produced by the union of a Tokyo video-production company and a Japanese manufacturer of unusually thin condoms. The condoms became the subject of a series of advertisements on which the production company worked; in one of them, called \"Acts of Love,\" dancers in London re-enact, with surprising grace and dignity, the mating rituals of blue-footed boobies, fiddler crabs and other animals. Well, kids, when two companies like each other very much, sometimes they decide to create a new company together. That is what happened with the production firm and the prophylactics people when, for reasons that are perhaps best not to question, they hit upon the idea of expanding their product line from condoms into noodles. The restaurant lies across Union Avenue from Kellogg's Diner. Its door is marked during business hours by the fluttering white noren curtains. It is the second Hanon location. The first is about 6,700 miles away, in the city of Kamakura, which lies south of Tokyo and is known for soba, not udon. This gave Hanon the advantage of not competing against any of Japan's established udon styles, leaving its chef, Takahiro Yanagisawa, free to come up with his own. Mr. Yanagisawa, who had spent 25 years making sushi before turning to noodles, focused his innovative urges on the dough. He began by adding wheat germ and bran to the white flour that in udon is typically used alone. The resulting noodle is called zenryufun or whole wheat. The bran and germ are Mr. Yanagisawa's attempts to make a more healthful udon, but they also add flavor, a mottled color and a slightly rough texture that holds on to the dashi-based broth. This dough is also made into a green noodle, called sasauchi, by mixing in powdered barley shoots and leaves of kuma-zasa, a bamboo variety that pandas dote on . To the human palate, or at least this human's palate, sasa tastes something like green tea. Both the speckled zenryufun and the green sasauchi are flat noodles, resembling fettuccine that has been working out. Avoiding extremes, they are moderately chewy and reasonably springy. Either flavor, or both, can be ordered cold and spread on a bamboo mat for dunking into a sauce, either a peanut-buttery sesame sauce or the traditional dashi-based dipping sauce. For larger or more curious appetites, these dipping noodles, called seiro udon, can be dangled into a hot duck soup in which a few hunks of well-boiled duck meat swim. The cold noodles can also be accessorized with whipped mountain yam or tempura or both. If you had stumbled into Hanon under the impression that it was another generic Williamsburg noodle mill, the tempura would set you straight. The crust is engineered for udon, thick and substantial enough that it will not dissolve and float away in the soup, yet somehow not oily or clunky. The tempura is served with sea salt, which will not only season the fried blowfish tails, shrimp, mushroom and vegetables, but will also do very good things to any noodles it happens to meet. With the hot soups, there is no choice of noodles. All are made with zenryufun. The plain broth, a dashi augmented by white soy sauce, is not so salty or concentrated that I didn't want to drink it all. It also performs well made into a thick-but-not-sludgy curry soup with thin pink slices of washugyu beef; a shaggy, mossy, salty-sour mass of ume and kombu; and a soup of shaved beef and onions that tastes like a deeper, stronger version of French dip jus and is blitzed by a little grated yuzu peel at the end. A few near-relatives of udon make it to the menu as well. The beef-and-onion combination can also be had over rice. Creamy, slightly spicy cod roe is tossed with zenryufun for an excellent mentaiko pasta that, for once, relies on the roe rather than Kewpie mayonnaise to make an impression. The eventual plan is to sell both colors of noodle to grocery stores and other restaurants -- to become, in essence, the Sun Noodle of the udonisphere. This would be a gain for New York, but for the moment Hanon's udon is found only at Hanon, where the noodles are made fresh each day. Any plan for world domination is not hinted at on the restaurant's Facebook page , which seems to be its home base online, though nobody has bothered to post a menu there yet. Nor does the dining room suggest a budding global chain. Atmospheric and presumably expensive prints by the photographers Takashi Homma and Nobuyoshi Araki hang over the tables, and a signed Cy Twombly lithograph has been placed by the door to the backyard. The music -- torch songs, jazz piano -- seems to be coming from a radio tuned to another decade. A lot of this cocktail music will make more sense once the liquor license comes through. Hanon is getting set to offer sake, shochu and wines chosen by Jorge Riera, who built the list at Frenchette and has turned countless New Yorkers on to the fizzy, fuzzy and furry delights of natural wines. The idea of Hanon is not to slurp and slide out, but to stay for a meal: a chilled French red with the fried chicken and Japanese omelet, maybe, and something a bit brawnier with curry soup. Dessert could be a tofu blancmange, smooth and white and somewhat sweet, but there is more satisfaction in the grainy, earthy bricks of red bean paste. The meal might end with tea, to which the restaurant takes the same unhurried approach it applies to everything else. The iced oolong is slowly cold-brewed; a bamboo whisk and ceramic chawan are kept on the dining counter for painstakingly whipping up bowls of matcha; an appliance imported from Taiwan will transform freshly steeped hojicha and ice into a tan froth, a process that takes about five minutes. This foam tea is dairy-free, unlike Taiwan's infamous cheese tea. It is served in a wine glass, and the experience of drinking it is similar to tackling a pint of Guinness before the head has settled down.

{"id": 44, "data": " You will find Kawi , the latest Momofuku restaurant, on the fifth floor of 20 Hudson Yards, assuming you stay determined and swallow back the urge to run for the exits that may grip you as you negotiate escalators that don't connect to one another, elevators that are hidden out of sight like somebody's crazy grandfather and shiny retail windows that seem to be trying to provoke a class war. By the time people reach Kawi they tend to look rattled; New Yorkers who will easily weave their way around broken sidewalks, potholes, garbage piles and al fresco rat conventions come undone when faced with the interior of a shopping mall. Kawi, now two months old, can be disorienting in its own way, but at least you can have a seat and a drink while you get your bearings. Space there is used, or not used, the way it is in Las Vegas. There's a very long bar behind a line of black, geometric bar stools receding toward the vanishing point; low lounge tables; taller, square wood tables; round wood tables; black-leather booths; red-leather booths; red-leather banquettes; and a row of chairs facing a kitchen counter. Between all this furniture are aisles wide enough for a Zamboni. All those seats have backs, too. Kawi is loaded with the comforts and accommodations that critics, including me, were begging Mr. Chang to pay more attention to as recently as the opening of Nishi three years ago. Has anybody complained before that a David Chang restaurant was too quiet? They're saying it about Kawi. If there is anybody left who still thinks of Mr. Chang as a downtown punk, Kawi will clear up that misconception. The early Momofuku restaurants were skateboards; Kawi is a minivan with sliding doors, armrests, cupholders and Don Henley on the stereo. The ride may not be as fast, but it's a lot smoother. Kawi is also the first Momofuku restaurant in New York to address Korean cuisine head on and at length. Majordomo , which opened in Los Angeles last year, is at least half Korean, but the menu is loaded up with other stuff, a lot of which is big and showy and seemingly designed to dazzle the high rollers. It can be hard to remember you're eating galbi-jjim after a server buries it beneath a tableside avalanche of shaved raclette. Eunjo Park, Kawi's executive chef, avoids this type of distraction. This is lucky, because she makes food that you want to concentrate on. Before joining the Momofuku stable, she worked in the formal and highly fastidious kitchens of Daniel , Le Bec-Fin and Per Se . She later returned to South Korea, where she had lived until she was 12, for advanced studies at the Seoul restaurant Gaon and at the kitchen of the Chunjinam hermitage, presided over by Jeong Kwan , certainly the most celebrated cooking Zen nun in her country. A strong interest in tradition marks Ms. Park's food at Kawi. Her dishes are set apart from versions you may have had before by the exactitude of the technique and the quality of the ingredients. One section of her menu is turned over to kimbap, those wide, nori-wrapped sushi rolls often spotted at salad bars, languishing under plastic wrap. Most kimbap is designed to be portable, filling and inexpensive. Ms. Park's kimbap, on the other hand, is built for pleasure. She has a pickled vegetable kimbap on the lunch menu that is truly exciting; you are meant to dip it in a dark liquid that tastes a bit like soy sauce but is made with beets. The dinner menu brings kimbap filled with chives, pickled daikon, citrus jelly and a buttery pink vein of foie gras terrine. Has this really never been done before, you wonder as you eat it, and if not, why not? Among the other gussied-up raw fish that you expect in Momofukuland, like a refreshing if somewhat staid madai tartare, are some dime-size clams in chile sauce and an elegant, inspired interpretation of gejang. Blue crab legs and claw are cracked and given a three-day soak in soy sauce, among other things, which gives them an impressive amount of flavor. Then, in case you haven't noticed that you're dealing with a real chef, Ms. Park stirs the crab's roe with creamy rice and spoons this Korean risotto into the open belly of the shell. At moments like this, or in the hwedupbap filled with raw fish as strikingly good as any you'll find in a $200 omakase, or in the doenjang jjigae, a potful of braised fermented bean paste with pork belly that appears on the menu as \"yesterday's stinky soybean stew\" and manages to be homespun and polished at the same time, it's possible to see Kawi as Ms. Park's response to Atomix . It's as if she had looked at Junghyun Park's dazzlingly complex compositions at his year-old modern Korean restaurant and decided that she could cook in a style that was every bit as modern and painstaking, but that instead of turning traditional dishes into tasting-menu food she would keep the old forms and innovate inside them. With her tidy, refined, French-influenced neo-traditionalism, Ms. Park could become something like the Alain Ducasse of Korean cooking. It's not obvious, though, that Kawi needs an Alain Ducasse. Certain appetizers seem to belong on another planet, more beautiful and gentle than ours, such as the soft tofu with soy syrup that, sitting under a shattering thin crust of caramelized sugar, is like a savory crème brûlée by way of Seoul. And there are others, such as the sticks of fried cod that a server pointlessly snips in half with scissors and then spritzes with atomized yuzu juice, that are right at home at Hudson Yards. The presentation seemed forced. That could also describe the boiled chicken dish, one of the menu's showiest items and, at $64, one of its most expensive. The whole bird is steamed, then the breast is sliced and served plain while the dark meat is fried and coated with spices. Neither is spectacular on its own, and the combination is bizarre. More successful versions of elaborate, oversize, multicomponent dishes are proven moneymakers elsewhere in the Momofuku republic. But arm-waving platters like that seem out of place at Kawi, which is the least Momofukian of the Momofukus. The most uncharacteristic thing of all is that the dining room has never been operating at anything close to capacity, at least when I've been there. Maybe tables are being kept off the reservation books to give the cooks time to learn where the spice cabinet is. Or maybe the fans who are so devoted to Mr. Chang's downtown spots are still trying to figure out the escalators.

{"id": 45, "data": " More than a year ago, I was on the verge of reviewing Del Posto when the news intervened. The restaurant had changed significantly since the last time it had been evaluated by a Times critic: Sam Sifton promoted it from three stars to four in 2010, when Mark Ladner was the executive chef and Brooks Headley was running the pastry kitchen. First, Mr. Headley had quit this stately, expensive Italian restaurant in Chelsea so he could sell fast, cheap vegetarian burgers . Next, Del Posto had spent about $1 million on crystal candle vases, white leather chairs and other luxurious fittings that made it even more stately and expensive. Finally, Mr. Ladner had left to sell fast, cheap pasta. A fresh review was clearly in order. Before I could write it, though, a number of women who had worked for Mario Batali, one of the owners, started talking about the sexual harassment and abuse that they say he had doled out. Suddenly there seemed to be more important questions than whether the braised-rabbit agnolotti were cooked al dente. Negotiations took more than a year, but Mr. Batali no longer profits from Del Posto, having sold his stake in March to a group led by his former partner, Joe Bastianich . Employees have said that Mr. Bastianich himself helped, at a minimum, to build the sexist and disrespectful environment in which Mr. Batali operated. Mr. Bastianich has apologized, saying that he had heard Mr. Batali speak inappropriately to employees, and that he should have done more to stop the sexual harassment. Some diners will stay away, feeling that Mr. Bastianich has not sufficiently atoned. I understand this, but I am also interested in the way employees may be treated at the restaurant now and in the future. Here, there is reason to hope. Among other human-resources reforms, employees can now report complaints about owners or corporate officers to an independent investigative firm with the power to refer cases to outside counsel. As part of the restructuring, Melissa Rodriguez, who has been the executive chef of Del Posto since 2017, was made a partner in the restaurant, along with Jeff Katz, now the managing partner. A new pastry chef, Georgia Wodder, was appointed last spring. Del Posto is, with the possible exception of Aquavit , the grandest and most expensive restaurant in New York where women are in charge of everything you eat, starting with the miniature saffron waffle rolled like a cannoli and stuffed at one tiny end with taleggio and at the other with fennel pesto, and ending with the prosecco marshmallow tucked into the wooden drawer of a custom-made cheese grater. The cooking is more subdued now. The kitchen is not seen as a beacon of innovation the way it used to be, perhaps because Ms. Rodriguez is less interested than Mr. Ladner was in feats of technical derring-do like 100-layer lasagnas . She gets her effects by following old Italian templates and putting them together so elegantly that they seem to light up from inside. There's an honesty to her approach -- she doesn't try to shoot out all the lights by supercharging dishes with fat -- but it's not the kind of peasant simplicity people usually mean when they talk about honesty in Italian food. It's a sophisticated honesty. You know chicken cacciatore, of course. Ms. Rodriguez's version is made from guinea hen breast, roasted until the skin crackles like parchment. What would be the body of the stew is now a sauce; the tomato, celery and onion in it come through distinctly. Occupying a little sidecar is a pressed puck of braised leg meat under a single, Roman-style gnocco, a small featherbed of semolina held together by eggs, milk and cheese. One side has been broiled so hard it is nearly burned, which seems like a mistake at first, but turns out to supply the bit of campfire that this hunter's stew needs. It has to be far more complicated to prepare than the cacciatore at your neighborhood Italian restaurant, but it seems simpler, pared to essentials, and wonderful in every bite. I've never seen anyone wring as much flavor out of salsify as Ms. Rodriguez does. Sliced transparently thin and fried, it makes crunchy brown chips about half the size of an M&M. These decorate the top of a grilled-salsify pudding that has the refreshing bittersweetness of one of those plant-based Italian aperitifs. If it were not garnished with streaky leaves of radicchio, it could pass for a dessert. The menu structure has not changed, although the prices have. Everything can be had à la carte. Lunch is still a relative bargain, though the price has shimmied up to $59 for three courses. For a blowout $194 dinner, the Captain's Menu yields eight courses or so. Most people, however, go with the $164, five-course Menu del Posto. The primary argument in favor of this strategy is, to me, an overwhelming one: Two of those five courses are pasta. Del Posto's pastas are worth doubling up on. They can come in many forms. Delicate conical tortellini have hidden pockets of nettles and spring peas; they are half-submerged in a light spring-vegetable brodo in which Parmigiano-Reggiano rinds once bobbed like bay leaves. This is the spring minestrone. A single, plate-spanning raviolo, called a fazzoletto, is topped with poached mussels and filled with spinach and fresh herbs -- not a lawnmower-mulch of greenery but a layer of emulsion as thin and velvety as the dough that envelops it. The sauce of mussel juices, white wine, butter and saffron makes this the only convincing mussel pasta I've ever had. The range of flavors Ms. Wodder commands in her pastry kitchen seems unnecessarily limited to me, although I may be unfairly comparing her desserts with Mr. Headley's, which roamed all over the place. Individually, her desserts are soothing, often showcasing the comforts of dairy. More emphasis, some extra acidity or bitterness, might have brought an assemblage of quince paste, brown-butter gelato and griddled brioche into relief. But I appreciated the way winter squash in the batter modified the sweetness of an olive oil-orange cake, and I enjoyed the moody sulkiness that amaro lent to a citrus salad served with the cake. Del Posto has in recent years picked up a reputation as a restaurant for one-percenters. It rarely gives that impression once you are inside, where servers solemnly accommodate just about anyone. There is a vegan menu at Del Posto. A vegetarian meal can be put together easily, and almost everything can be made without gluten, including the pasta. Yes, the stockpile of Champagnes includes some lock-and-key stuff, and should you require a Barolo costing between $2,000 and $4,000, one will quickly be added to your bill. But among the 3,100 or so Italian labels superintended by Evan Clagnaz, the wine director, are more marked from $60 to $75 than I can count. Piemonte is a place to hunt, and Friuli, and the Valle d'Aosta, for starters. Though the restaurant is not exclusively for rich people, it is explicitly for occasions. Once, when a reservationist called to confirm and asked whether I was celebrating anything special, I said no, and was gently laughed at: \"Just a normal Tuesday night at Del Posto?\" There is little danger that anyone will mistake a night at Del Posto for normal. If nothing else, the napkins and towels are a tip-off. First, there is a small hot linen napkin scented with tomato-vine oil, to wipe the dust of the outside world from your hands. Then a large white linen napkin, followed just before dessert by a small yellow one. It is given to you, and the white one is taken away, by a server using a large fork and spoon as tongs. When you go to the restrooms, you may encounter an attendant who has just restocked the hand towels from a large basket she carries on one arm, like Heidi out gathering wildflowers for Grandfather. There are little ceremonies like this from start to finish; I don't know of any other restaurant that performs quite so many tasks whose only real purpose is to draw attention to themselves. And these things are rarely done with a smile; employees seem to have been directed to keep a respectful, formal distance as they carry out your requests and perform other services you'd never think of requesting. They rarely seem comfortable. Their solemnity is underlined by the sepulchral lighting at night, so gloomy it makes the crypt of Grant's tomb look like a tiki bar. A good deal of the service is the attentive, helpful kind that you really want, but the rest of it seems designed only to give customers the sensation of temporary power over other people. Some people may love this, but it reflects a serious lack of imagination when you think about the ways the service at Blue Hill at Stone Barns or Noma , for instance, is integrated into the experience. Is it stretching a point to ask if enshrining subservience, as Del Posto does, reflects the same twisted sense of priorities that allowed Mr. Batali to get away with abusing his own power for so long? (And is it a coincidence that far more men than women seem to work in the dining room, particularly in the upper ranks?) Now that Ms. Rodriguez owns a piece of the restaurant, perhaps she can lead a reconsideration of priorities in the front of the house, and find a tone that more closely matches her philosophy in the back. She shouldn't have to clean up the messes men made.

{"id": 46, "data": " How clam pizza, with all its charms, remained trapped in New Haven for most of a century is a mystery that may never be unraveled. At least it has escaped now. For the past decade or so, Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana , the 93-year-old establishment said to have invented the regional delicacy, has been exporting it to its other branches in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. There is also a small cult of the clam pie among New York pizzaioli. It has become a fixture at Lombardi's and some Staten Island pizzerias, as well as inspiring lovingly considered tributes at Pasquale Jones , Motorino and the Clam . I have eaten most of them, and happily, but on a recent trip to Connecticut I was led to what I now realize is the clam pie against which all others should be measured. It is baked at Zuppardi's Apizza in the city of West Haven. Unlike the coal ovens used to fire New Haven's more famous \"abeetz,\" to use the Connecticut-Neapolitan dialect, the ovens at Zuppardi's are fired by gas. As a result, Zuppardi's pies are not nearly as blackened as the ones from Pepe's, but the crust still bulges with air pockets and emerges with a pleasingly dry, thin and crackery crunch. [ Learn how to make pizza at home with this guide from NYT Cooking. ] Zuppardi's tops its clam pizza (market price, typically $32.45 for a medium pie) with fresh garlic, olive oil, dried oregano, cracked red pepper and littlenecks. Smaller clams may be opaque when they reach the table. Larger specimens will be just warmed through. All will taste as if they had just been shucked, as in fact they were. Opening clams to order means that the clam pizza takes longer than Zuppardi's other specialties, like the plain pie (tomato sauce, grated cheese, no mozzarella), itself worth a detour from Interstate 95, which rumbles by about a cherrystone's throw away.

{"id": 47, "data": " It is true that the bacalaitos at the Freakin Rican in Astoria, Queens, are not quite as big around as the ones you will see browning in veritable caldrons of oil over wood fires at kiosks scattered along the beach road in Piñones, outside San Juan. These flattened cod fritters are the size of pie plates in Puerto Rico, while in Queens they are roughly the diameter of a coffee can. Dimensions aside, they give off all the right signals. They are the color of a corn muffin, with green specks of chopped cilantro under the surface that let you know they are not made from Goya's mix. They don't leave your fingertips entirely free of grease, but they come close. They have an exterior crunch that surrenders quickly to the firm, chewy interior of mashed salt cod; the texture is less fried dough than fish taffy. You could start to build a business around bacalaitos like these. That, in fact, has been Derick López's plan for some time now. Mr. López, who was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the South Bronx, is the Freakin Rican's chef and, with his husband, Victor Vargas, its owner. About four years ago, armed with picnic coolers and a couple of folding tables, the two men began selling a short menu of Puerto Rican staples at the street fairs that seem to infiltrate a different New York thoroughfare each weekend. As they promoted the Freakin Rican catering operation, the Freakin Rican product line, the Freakin Rican Facebook page and the Freakin Rican YouTube channel, they saved their earnings so they could found the Freakin Rican restaurant. After a false start in another part of Queens, it opened a short distance from the Museum of the Moving Image one year ago this month. The dining room has 19 seats. The banana-plant wallpaper on the left wall is reflected in the mirrors on the right. In between are some metal chickens and bright-green figurines of coquís, the little frogs that chirp from every Puerto Rican tree. Diners sip on tropical-fruit shakes or bottles of Kola Champagne, Coco Rico and Malta India, the Harry, Ron and Hermione of Puerto Rican soft drinks. Héctor Lavoe may be playing over the speakers, or Víctor Manuelle, not so loudly that they can't be drowned out by the sounds of a small number of employees singing \"Happy Birthday\" while wielding a tambourine and a pair of maracas. If you have spent any time at all on the trail of chicharrones, mofongo, sancocho and other wonders of the Puerto Rican kitchen, you know that Astoria is not a primary hunting ground for any of them. You also know, though, that blinking-light cuchifritos parlors and family-run cocina criolla luncheonettes have been disappearing from the Bronx, East Harlem and the Lower East Side over the past few decades, along with many of their customers. The Puerto Rican population in New York peaked around 1990, when residents of the old barrios began to flow to the suburbs in large numbers, according to Laird W. Bergad , the director of the Center for Latin American, Caribbean and Latino Studies at City University of New York Graduate Center. Beacons of Puerto Rican cuisine still survive; Casa Adela, for instance, is still busily dispensing chickens from its venerable lemon-yellow rotisserie on Avenue C, despite the death last year of its founder, Adela Fargas. But there are not so many of these places left that we can take an unlimited supply of tostones and mojo de ajo for granted, either. The Freakin Rican developed its act on the street-fair circuit, but it applied the same tactics that succeed at Smorgasburg and similar urban foraging grounds, where the ideal dish can be held in one hand, gets immediate attention, costs under $10 and can serve as a plank in a branding platform. This may explain why appetizers are the strong suit on the Freakin Rican menu. The sorullitos, Puerto Rico's answer to hush puppies, are an exception; they are dense and dry, as if the cornmeal hadn't absorbed enough water. Mr. López's alcapurrias, though, are very good, even if the picadillo that runs down the middle of a tube of mashed fried plantains like the graphite in a pencil could be seasoned a little more forcefully. And his pasteles are exceptional. Pasteles are structured like tamales. Where the masa would be, Mr. López makes a sweet, enjoyably gummy mash of green plantains, taro root and kabocha squash. The filling is a soft, rich vein of stewed pork shoulder with ham, bacon, red peppers and green olives. Rolled up in a banana leaf, these pasteles probably deserve their own float in the Puerto Rican Day Parade. Mr. López fries chicken in two styles. One, the chicharrones de pollo, is traditional. The other, the Freakin Crispy Wings, is not. Each has its rewards. The chicharrones, hacked into three-bite hunks, taste of cider vinegar and garlic powder and have a smooth, achiote-tinted buttermilk crust that breaks open with a pleasing crackle. The Freakin Crispy Wings are spicier, and the shell is thicker and more deeply crevassed. These wings may owe more to Atlanta than to Mayagüez, although you can get them with a guava barbecue sauce that's reasonably tropical. Leave behind these appetizers, the core of the street-fair business, and the menu can start to appear unsteady. At dinner, the main courses tend to be fairly plain fried or grilled meat. Grilled pork chops splashed with mojo can be dry and dull, and the grilled chicken breasts are not much more interesting. Baked pork ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce are tender enough, but they aren't very persuasive. On several nights, I found myself gazing longingly at the lunch specials on the back of the menu, wondering why I couldn't have a brick of pastelón for dinner. (I came back for it one Thursday afternoon, and was glad I did.) Until more long-cooked dishes like it appear at dinnertime, consider a bowl of sancocho. Listed as \"vegetable root soup\" for $7, it doesn't sound like much of a meal. But it is a grab bag of a stew with at least two kinds of meat, great hunks of taro and yuca, a couple of inches of corn on the cob and a magical squash broth that has the consistency of heavy cream and the color of very ripe mango. In the unlikely event that you finish it and the bowl of rice that comes with it and then cry out for more, the Freakin Rican has just the thing for you: mofongo. A dome of mashed plantains possessed by garlic, the mofongo is cooked to order to keep the crunchy bits crunchy and the whole thing from getting boggy. You can have it with chicharrones or sliced roast pork, which leaves behind a happy impression of garlic, oregano and salt. If you have come for a birthday, a candle stuck in the meringue icing of a tres leches cake is probably in your future. If not, flan and espresso will do, and a bag of pasteles for tomorrow.

{"id": 48, "data": " If you ate at Spice Market before it closed two years ago, you may experience low-key but persistent flashbacks at Wayan , which set up shop in February on the east end of Spring Street in NoLIta. Again the flavors come from Asia and the methods, generally, from France. Again the far-off tropics are evoked through the play of indirect, dappled light, as if filtered through jungle foliage or a carved wooden screen. Again the presiding culinary sensibility belongs to a Vongerichten. Jean-Georges Vongerichten put together Spice Market in 2004, a confection of teak, silk, vodka, peanut sauce and high heels that brought the Asian Party Temple restaurant genre to its apotheosis. All the earlier examples suddenly seemed fumbling and unsophisticated, and with the possible exception of the Spice Market spinoffs in Qatar and Mexico, the ones that would follow seemed increasingly mindless and out of touch. Interior design that rummages through the musty old trunks of Orientalism doesn't look as alluring as it did 15 years ago, and cooking that filters Asian flavors through a Western sensibility isn't automatically met with gales of excitement. Wayan, where Mr. Vongerichten's son, Cédric, is the chef, avoids both traps, I think. The restaurant is a tribute to Indonesia, the home of his wife and business partner, Ochi Vongerichten, and the site of two restaurants that he opened recently. (He is also the chef of Perry St. in Manhattan, which his father owns.) The scale is more personal and the cultural references are more specific at Wayan than at Spice Market and its kind. The menu is far from encyclopedic, but it is clear that Indonesia's cuisine has been given more than the quick glance that informs a lot of Asian fusion. Ms. Vongerichten works in the dining room, stopping by tables to offer explanations of the menu and how the cooking differs from that at some other Indonesian restaurants in New York, which she cheerfully calls \"more authentic.\" More than any other factor, she helps keep Wayan from turning into a junior version of one of her father-in-law's restaurants -- Young Vongerichtenstein. Servers will tell you to start with a stick or two of satay. You can, although the skewers are cooked on a flattop instead of a grill, and inconsistency is an issue. The pork skewers that are so appealingly juicy and savory with sweet soy one week can be scorched and bitter the next time you see them, and just ordinary the following week. (The pickled watermelon radishes on the side, though, are always terrific; they're brined with lime leaf.) The peanut sauce on chicken satay may hum with red curry and chiles, or may present as a sweet, inert blob. A more promising opening move, and one that will help place Cédric and Ochi Vongerichten's mental map of Indonesia in perspective, would be the Jimbaran-style clams. This is not a dish that is likely to have been stirred by generations of sainted grandmothers since the dawn of time. It is, in fact, a specialty of the seafood vendors who sprang up on a stretch of Balinese beach where resorts first began to appear sometime around the birth of Taylor Swift. Littlenecks, flavored with soy sauce and garlic paste, are grilled under flakes of coconut, which form the golden crust that would be provided by bread crumbs if these were clams oreganata. A slice of pickled red chile sits on each one, waiting. If you were on vacation, you would order tray after tray of these. Here on Spring Street, other things will keep you distracted. In the hearts-of-palm salad, sweet and sour are carefully pitted against each other by means of a mango vinaigrette, a lime-and-fish-sauce dressing and a neon coat of passion-fruit pulp. The crab cake is, despite its sweet chile sauce, about as Indonesian as Betty White, but it is fresh and fluffy and not worth arguing about. Wayan's rendition of the street snack bakwan jagung is a golden agglomeration of corn kernels and shallots fried into a flat, crunchy disc. There had better be nasi goreng at any restaurant that is even playing at being Indonesian. There is, the rice fried just until it crackles a bit between your teeth. It has a gentle but genuine spice undercurrent that would be welcome in more of the cooking. Of course there is a gado gado, and this being 2019, of course the main ingredient is avocado; the hard-cooked eggs belong to quail. This time the peanut dressing isn't cloying or clumpy. As the plates get larger, few dishes really come forward as the kind of knockout that everybody will talk about later. The closest contender must be the lobster and basil with wavy noodles in a sauce containing, among other things, sweet soy and melted butter -- a combination that the senior Mr. Vongerichten has used so successfully that it may be his son's inheritance. Should the calamansi vinaigrette poured over the steamed black sea bass be more sour and spicy? Probably. But if there are few stars on the table, the contrast of flavors, colors, textures and techniques makes the meal into a memorable ensemble piece. The drumsticks in yellow chicken are crunchy, and the thighs are tender; both are mellow with a yellow curry seasoned by lemongrass and ginger. The tomato-chile sambal pressed into the surface of cod \"bilindango\" is potent enough to carry over to the spears of asparagus and fiddlehead ferns sprawled alongside. All of this looks very come-hither in the dining room, where the Rockwell Group has abandoned stadium-size props, building atmospheric effects instead out of contrasting textures and light values and the movement of shadows. This is the visual language of expensive tropical resorts, and Wayan seems to give people the feeling they're on vacation. It is not necessarily a loud restaurant, but New Yorkers are a loud people, and around 10 the noise can start to press down. It is a good time to call for dessert. The purple-yam ice cream with banana cake and caramelized bananas is good if sundaes are your thing. The pandan custard under passion-fruit pulp gets a lot of mileage from just a few flavors. But the one that sounds too boring to bother with (\"assorted exotic fruit?\") is worth a second look. Lychee, mango, pineapple and dragon fruit may not be particularly exotic, but a dip or a dunk into a dark, spicy syrup of tamarind and palm sugar will wake them right up.

{"id": 49, "data": " Looking around Haenyeo's dining room one night in early March, I thought maybe Jenny Kwak's time has finally come. Her third restaurant, Haenyeo was about three months old and already filled with people who looked as if they'd been going there for years. It sits on a prime corner lot, on a stretch of Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that is rich in local minichains serving banh mi, burritos, lobster rolls and so on, to take out or eat in. Intimidating restaurants don't tend to prosper here. Very few people inside Haenyeo look the least bit intimidated as they lift grilled oysters by the shell to pour the dregs of hot seaweed butter over toast; or carve wedges of zucchini-scallion pancakes fried to a dark and satisfyingly rich brown; or stir mushrooms, squid, bean sprouts, steamed spinach and cabbage kimchi with a just-cracked egg into a bibimbap whose bottom layer of rice is golden and crunchy where it meets the hot stone bowl. The customers at Haenyeo seem to have an easy familiarity with Korean food. Some of them, at least, can probably thank Ms. Kwak for that. In 1992, when she began serving the cuisine in the East Village at her first restaurant, Dok Suni's, the words tteokbokki and seolleongtang and jajangmyeon did not roll off the tongues of most non-Koreans. But that's who she wanted to lure in with American music, date-night décor and Western-style service. Once she had them, she would tempt, teach, turn them on to the flavors she'd grown up with. Her mother, Myung Ja Kwak, shared cooking duties. Ms. Kwak's was not the take-it-or-leave-it approach of 32nd Street, and she kept at it. She wrote \"Dok Suni: Recipes From My Mother's Korean Kitchen,\" which was one of the few Korean cookbooks in English when it came out, in 1998. At her second restaurant, Do Hwa, she and her mother led customers deeper into unfamiliar ground. Each of the restaurants stayed open for about two decades, which is a very long time in New York. If you want a metaphor for how effectively Ms. Kwak paved the way for restaurants like Atoboy , Soogil, Danji and others whose chefs weave Korean cuisine into new patterns, consider that one of them, Oiji, moved into its address on First Avenue right after Dok Suni's moved out. What Ms. Kwak is doing in Park Slope isn't all that different from what she has done all her career, except that by now South Korean comfort food has become comfort food for New York in general. Haenyeo does pay more attention to seafood than Dok Suni or Do Hwa did, though. Ms. Kwak hasn't gone pescatarian on us. She still serves impressive pork and beef bulgogis with ssamjang and lettuce, and the pan-fried dumplings are filled with high-fat ground beef seasoned with kimchi, garlic and soy. But her menu's orientation has shifted slightly toward the ocean. This is good news, because the seafood at Haenyeo has a sparkle and sweetness you don't always find in the smoke-filled rooms of 32nd Street. A bibimbap variant may be the menu's sleeper dish, partly because it starts out looking like a lunch bowl from Sweetgreen. It is a version of hwe dup bap. At first you just see raw tuna, shredded romaine and perilla leaves, grated carrots and cucumber, and strips of seaweed. Hidden underneath is warm rice. But there is a pink mound of spicy cod roe in the bowl, too, with cured salmon eggs and a few lobes of sea urchin. Both of them will break apart as you stir, bringing their distinct saltwater intonations to the rice and vegetables. What the menu calls \"white fish fillets\" -- pan-fried cod with rings of scallion showing through their thin gold sheet of egg batter, otherwise known as saeng seon jeon -- is so modestly named it might get overlooked; it shouldn't. The menu plays Don't Mind Me again with \"mackerel, grilled or braised.\" Just get the mackerel, because the kitchen knows how to cook it, whether over a flame or in a dark, smoky pan of garlic and gochujang. In truth, the kitchen seems to know how to cook every kind of seafood, although perhaps it could come with a better partner for the fried scallops than the sweet, yellowish tartar sauce with corn in it. The walls are hung with photographs of Korean women in wet suits. These are the haenyeo of Jeju island , who dive up to 30 feet deep for conch, abalone and seaweed while holding their breath for several minutes at a time. The money they made diving is probably the reason parts of Jeju have a matriarchal family structure. Naming the restaurant after them, Ms. Kwak continues a theme started with Dok Suni's, which means \"strong women's.\" One dish that seems out of place is a revival of Dok Suni's fried chicken. Was the batter always so pasty and airless? That's not how I remember it, but it's possible my standards have changed as Korean fried chicken has infiltrated nearly every part of town over the past decade. In any case, there is better chicken to seek out here, not just the home-style dokdoritang stewed in chile sauce but also the wings. Haenyeo double-fries wings that have been dipped in potato starch, then coats them with a fine version of a yangnyeom chile sauce, tangier and a little less sweet than some. When Ms. Kwak detours from the Korean straight and narrow, consider traipsing along behind her. You may wind up having beignets for dessert, buried under a fresh coat of powdered sugar in the best Café du Monde style. (This and the grilled oysters may betray the hand of her business partner, Terrence Segura, who is from New Orleans. He is also her husband.) Or you may follow her all the way to the joyous rice cake fundido, which starts out as tteokbokki in chile sauce and becomes totally atypical through the addition of chorizo, sliced jalapeños and a melted, browned topcoat of Oaxacan cheese that comes up in long, stretchy strings when you pull on it. It is, in all likelihood, the best Tex-Mex dish in New York. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 50, "data": " In 2012 and 2013, when people were lining up at Smorgasburg and then on the second floor of the Houston Street Whole Foods Market for biodegradable bowls of Yuji Haraguchi's mazemen -- noodles that might be dressed with crisped twigs of bacon and a jiggling onsen egg, say, or yuzu-cured salmon and some Camembert soft enough to transform into a sauce -- I was sure the crowds would multiply and fan out, demanding more of this strange brothless ramen. And they did, in a sense. Soon Mr. Haraguchi had established his own free-standing establishment, Yuji Ramen in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where he serves that bacon-and-egg mazemen along with his possibly visionary \"tunakotsu\" ramen. In 2014, when Ivan Orkin came to New York , he brought along his own mazemen recipes. Over the next few years mazemen turned up in other restaurants, too, but all of them remained better known for soup ramen, and sold more of it. It began to look as if mazemen would never be more than a sideshow act, the one-armed ax-catcher of the ramen circus. Then at the start of the year, the chef Shigetoshi Nakamura, who operates an intimate ramen shop on the Lower East Side, opened an annex next door that is dedicated to mazemen. All the seating at this new place, Niche , is at a dozen or so stools arranged around one long, narrow table. When the dining room is fully occupied, the only way to get from one end to the other is to walk sideways while holding your breath and picking up all the coats that you are going to knock off their wall pegs as you go. Not that there is much reason to roam around. Orders are taken from and delivered to the table, and there is no public restroom on the premises. As is the case next door at Nakamura, seats by the window offer a close-up view of the stone walls that support the last few yards of the Williamsburg Bridge before it empties onto Delancey Street. Before he came to New York, Mr. Nakamura was already well known in Tokyo, where he proved to have a theatrical streak. Before filling a bowl with noodles, he would yank them from the boiling water with his left hand and then hold them high in the air for a few seconds, letting them drain while standing completely motionless. Suddenly he would drop his arm and the basket would plunge toward the water again, before stopping just in time and getting one quick, emphatic shake. When Mr. Nakamura was immortalized as one of four \"ramen gods\" in a set of Hello Kitty notepads and phone straps, Kitty was posed with her left paw raised high in emulation of the Nakamura Shake. If Mr. Nakamura has been practicing his choreography on the spaghetti-like, crinkly noodles at Niche, I haven't seen it yet. The Nakamura Shake seems designed to extract cooking water as quickly as possible before the noodles cool, and temperature is not especially critical in mazemen. The idea of noodle soup without the soup has been on the loose in Japan for decades. Broth is the most expensive and labor-intensive part of a bowl of ramen; in the 1950s, a Tokyo noodle shop, in the pitiless logic of the restaurant business, began omitting the broth when ladling out noodles at staff meals, or so the story goes. This \"abura soba\" -- oil noodle, because it was moistened with lard along with the seasoning sauce called tare -- wasn't half bad, so it went on the menu at a discounted price. As an even cheaper version of an already cheap and filling meal, abura soba was quickly embraced, especially by students. As food ideas tend to do in Japan, it evolved rapidly. Today, abura soba tends to refer to dry soups that have more or less the same toppings you'd find in a bowl of normal ramen, while mazemen generally has toppings that are rarely seen in soup and often would not respond well to being submerged in hot liquid. There is Italian-style mazemen, with anchovies, salami, olives and tomatoes. Some mazemen shops specialize in fried beef cutlets. At a Tokyo restaurant called Beefst , the centerpiece of each bowl is sliced roast beef, served rare. Mr. Nakamura has an answer to that: steak mazemen. The steak is rib-eye, in cubes that have been browned with a kitchen torch. When you stir them with the noodles and a smooth, creamy spoonful of something the menu simply calls \"pork sauce,\" their juices and flecks of char flavor the whole bowl. Plain spinach and fermented bamboo, meanwhile, keep the total effect from being queasy-making. Novel, straightforward, refined, unruly and impure of heart, steak mazemen has the makings of a classic New York dish. So does the duck, a common special. A sliced breast of moulard duck cooked to a deep violet-pink, it is served with a bright, focused sauce built on soy and enough warm duck juices to lubricate the whole-wheat noodles. It is not an austere dish by any means, but it is balanced and restrained. The same cannot be said for another special that is always offered on the same nights: a bowl of liquefied foie gras topped with pistachios and truffle oil. It is not clear what will happen to anyone who tries to eat this with a spoon, but the prognosis does not seem good. Instead, everybody orders it with the duck mazemen and dips the noodles into the foie gras, after which conscious thought tends to stop for a minute or two. When cerebral activity resumes, you might wonder why the sauce doesn't come with its own noodles. No other mazemen is such a joy ride, but the vaguely Italian one with tomatoes, mushrooms, kombu and an angry red soak of chile oil is not the kind of thing you want to turn your back on. Even the tribute to Russ & Daughters , where the noodles are coated with spicy cod roe and the topping is sliced smoked salmon, can sneak up on you. Niche is one of the few ramen-yas in town where the appetizers are worth noticing. Sea urchin perched on tiny corners of toast is a strange and awkward affair, but the sardines on toast, dressed with chile flakes, are very good, as are the raw scallops with yuzu juice and the avocado salad showered with tempura flakes. Should fries be an appetizer? Maybe not, particularly Niche's \"umami kombu fries,\" which have been sprinkled with powdered shio kombu until they are almost subliminally green. Apart from the color, they look like the fries at McDonald's. The difference is that the shio kombu makes them almost diabolically hard to stop eating. And if you don't eat them before the mazemen arrives, then when will you? Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 51, "data": " Nothing about the appearance of the Cornish game hen at Blue Smoke screams, \"I am the best thing you will eat today!\" It looks a bit like a deflated football that somebody punctured with a pair of sticks and dragged through the mud. In fact, in Blue Smoke's attempt to bring together the barbecued game hen of Cozy Corner , in Memphis, with the fried hot chicken of places like Prince's, in Nashville, the bird has been through a good deal more than that. The process goes like this, approximately : spatchcocked, brined, rubbed with spices, smoked, chilled, dunked in a frothy batter, tossed in seasoned flour, deep fried, dipped in spicy oil and sprinkled with four kinds of ground pepper. \"Just a little pop-pop dust right on top\" is how Jean-Paul Bourgeois, Blue Smoke's chef, describes the last step. \"That introduction of fresh chile onto that fried chicken, it just brings the zing.\" Then came one final touch, he said: \"a little swirlybird of Tabasco hot honey.\" Handily, this can all be shortened to smoked, fried hen when you order ($24 at the Battery Park City location and $26 on East 27th Street). But you'll know there's more to it when your jaw smashes through the dark crust with a sonic boom; when the particular forms of heat contributed by habanero, black pepper, Sichuan peppercorn, Aleppo pepper, cayenne and Tabasco sauce all start to pile up and reverberate like My Bloody Valentine guitar chords ; when the meat gives up juices that swirl with wood smoke.

{"id": 52, "data": " I'm starting to think the American cult of chef worship may really be on the way out. At the very least, it has paused to catch its breath. Since the seven-story food court in Hudson Yards was unveiled last month, the public reaction has been somewhere between shrug and ugh. Attitudes may improve as visitors eat their way to the top floor. So far, though, the response hasn't come close to matching the greeting bestowed on the restaurants at Time Warner Center in 2004, even though the project represents the same basic idea executed by the same developer with at least one of the same chefs, Thomas Keller . Even more striking has been the low-key reception to Rocco DiSpirito's return. Late last year Mr. DiSpirito took over the kitchen at Standard Grill in the meatpacking district. At one point, when he was the chef at both Union Pacific and Rocco's on 22nd while starring in a television show, he was arguably the most famous chef in the country. Then both places closed, and the show was canceled. Mr. DiSpirito has not been in charge of a restaurant since George W. Bush was in the White House. For that matter, it has been some years since Standard Grill itself has done anything noteworthy. In 2009, when it was new and Dan Silverman was the chef, I reviewed it, gave it one star and then lost track of it. In other words, the selection of Mr. DiSpirito did not just come out of left field. It came from the weeds across the street from the parking lot behind left field. For surprise value alone, it should have been one of the year's most buzzed-about news items. But the trumpets have been muted, and the back handsprings seem to lack a certain bounce. This, at least, is the view from outside the restaurant. Once you're sitting at one of the tables -- newly topped with leather pads in a major retrofitting that has made the dining room look like an expensive cabaret, blue velvet and all -- you will hear quite a lot of talk about Mr. DiSpirito, or as they call him here, Chef Rocco. Chef Rocco, you learn, conceived each dish on the menu so that it can be eaten by one person or shared with others. No, I didn't believe it at first, either, but apparently it's true: Rocco DiSpirito invented food. There is also something that servers call Chef Rocco's Game Changing Toast, although sometimes they shorten it to Rocco's Game Changing or simply Game Changing, as in \"Here's a little more Game Changing for you.\" The item in question is a toasted, cracker-thin slice of bread made of nuts, oats, seeds and psyllium-seed husks held together without benefit of wheat flour. Like nearly everything on the menu, it is free of gluten. Being mostly made of browned nuts, it is also delicious. Whether it is truly Rocco's is up for debate. It seems to strongly resemble the Life-Changing Loaf of Bread recipe that Sarah Britton published on her blog, \"My New Roots,\" in 2013, and that appeared on another blog two years later, with minor changes, as Game Changing Nut & Seed Bread . It's one of the items that reflect Mr. DiSpirito's recent obsession with nutrient-dense dietary supplements , although the way it keeps coming up in the servers' patter makes you wonder if Mr. DiSpirito spent too much time as a QVC pitchman. Anyway, somebody-or-other's toast sits under the smoked gravlax, red with beet juice and very silky on its bed of coconut crème fraîche, that Mr. DiSpirito sends out as an amuse. A plate of the toast will also appear if you order the platter of acorn-fed, hand-sliced Ibérico ham or the chilled Maine sea urchins served on the spiky half-shell. Either one will convince you that Mr. DiSpirito knows how to get his hands on raw materials that can stun with almost no assistance. The best things at Standard Grill, and there are quite a lot of them, depend on very good ingredients touched as little as possible. Back in the Union Pacific days, Mr. DiSpirito's interest in East Asian cuisines came out in the form of complex preparations, arcane ingredients and out-of-nowhere juxtapositions. Now he seems to have moved on to the luxury minimalism of an omakase sushi chef, a style that was foreshadowed by the only Union Pacific dish he's brought back, bay scallops and sea urchin with a few throat-searing drops of mustard oil. Standard Grill's ice-cold cubes of bluefin chu-toro stirred with golden osetra caviar, meanwhile, could have come straight out of Masa , while the yellowfin tartare, barely dressed with crushed macadamias and freshly grated wasabi, is like one of the better items at Tetsu . Each night there are half a dozen or so skewers cooked over Japanese charcoal and wheeled to the table on a mini-grill the size of a toaster oven. Speared on a stick might be fantastic small scallops out of Peconic Bay; a feathery mop of maitake mushrooms; buttery chicken livers with barely a hint of bitterness; or firefly squid, a little bigger than a fava bean and grilled whole so they can be swallowed guts and all. Again, the ingredients are exceptional. The skewers look simple enough, but they are all, you learn, brushed with \"a little sauce Chef Rocco came up with to complement the charcoal.\" The sauce for seafood involves coconut nectar and lemongrass, and what it actually does is put you, vaguely and pleasantly, in mind of Thailand. While I am one of those increasingly stooped and wizened diners who remembers, in detail, Mr. DiSpirito's cooking at Union Pacific, far more people recall him as the meatball-pushing antihero of \"The Restaurant,\" an NBC series about Rocco's on 22nd, an actual (and doomed, it turned out) Italian-American restaurant. The show, which debuted in 2003, was a pioneer in the genre of cooking-focused reality television, although when everybody started suing everybody else, it became clear it was a pioneer in the way the members of the Donner Party were pioneers. The handful of Italian dishes at Standard Grill may be meant for \"Restaurant\" fans. Neither of the two pastas showed Mr. DiSpirito at his best, but a chewy risotto with red shrimp and what seemed like half a dozen forms of black truffles may make you understand why Ruth Reichl started her 1998 Times review of Union Pacific with a woman moaning at the next table. Standard Grill's Norwegian salmon on an ivory puddle of vegan cashew sauce won't inspire the same reaction, but the steaks might; they are dry-aged until ripe, and earn their deep-brown crust over extremely hot Japanese charcoal. Given what Mr. DiSpirito is capable of doing with a piece of halibut and some goose fat, I can't quite believe that I'm recommending the rib-eye over the seafood, but I am. It may be that Mr. DiSpirito knows exactly what he is doing. Simplicity is the whole point of a grill, which is first cousin to the steakhouse. He has also designed a menu so straightforward that if, after a respectable period of time, he is no longer in the kitchen, the food quality can stay roughly the same as long as the hotel doesn't argue about ingredient costs. The Standard has not left the restaurant's fate entirely in his hands, either; besides redecorating, it hired a maître d'hôtel, Michael Cecchi-Azzolina, away from Le Coucou ; he is hard at work building an audience every night, handing out old-school business cards to old-school producers, chefs and publishers, sitting down to chat with Brooke Shields and Ms. Reichl. Standard Grill is so much better than it used to be, and so much better than almost any restaurant serving a comparable menu of grilled meats and chilled seafood, that it's foolish to wish for the return of the same Mr. DiSpirito who gave us Union Pacific. It's a little bit as if Barbra Streisand had returned to Broadway, and then sang all her songs in a whisper sitting on the edge of the stage. It might not be what you had been waiting for, but you'd watch. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 53, "data": " Over the years, I have eaten many bowls of pasta with clams that have been rewired by a chef who was trying to stand out. But I had not come across one that made as much sense to me as the big, sloshing platters you get at old-line Italian-American clam bars like Randazzo's until tripping into a new Greenwich Village restaurant called Babs this summer. Mind you, virtually the only Italian thing about the tagliatelle with clams at Babs was the tagliatelle. The sauce was a mustard beurre blanc, one of those French sauces that all culinary-school students are supposed to be able to make in their sleep. Mustard beurre blanc is often found providing a decorous yellow veil over a chicken breast or salmon fillet. It is not normally poured over noodles. But, tossed with salty French ham and Manila clams smaller than a thumbprint, it made a strangely exciting bowl of pasta that was much more coherent than it sounds. Once I got to know Babs better, I understood that strange excitement is what it does best. Its chef, Efrén Hernández, has talked about Babs as a European grill, and many of the dishes are seared over hot charcoal, but he has a wider frame of reference than that. He was raised in Southern California by immigrants from Mexico, and Mexican cuisine runs through his menu like an underground stream that sometimes gurgles up to the surface. Mr. Hernández is not particularly interested in fusion, though; as far as I can tell, he likes rubbing cultures together to see what color the sparks will be. See, for example, what the menu calls divorced sea bream, a handsome dish that would be splashed around Instagram even more frequently than it already is if the dining tables were lighted by ceiling pinspots rather than disco-era chrome globes that look as if they were salvaged from Regine's . The bream is split, and one side brushed with a red sauce and the other with a green sauce, before it is grilled over charcoal. The dish is an allusion to the two-tone pescado a la talla served at Contramar in Mexico City, itself derived from huevos divorciados, a breakfast of two fried eggs beneath two contrasting salsas. In Mr. Hernández's kitchen, though, the red adobo at Contramar is replaced by a Catalan romesco, and the parsley salsa becomes a French pistou. But surely the tortilla on its own plate off to one side brings it back to Mexico? Not so fast. According to the menu, it is a taloa, a Basque cornmeal cake that cooks from Bayonne to Bilbao have been griddling for centuries. The taloa at Babs is tender, smooth and floral. Mr. Hernández has been cooking at Babs since it opened in July. He is also the chef at Mimi , a French restaurant a block away that is owned by the same people (Daniel Bennett, his brother Evan, and Louis Levy; they named Babs and Mimi after their grandmothers.) I haven't been back to Mimi since Liz Johnson was the chef . She was aiming for a style that was at once brawny and lavish, and since taking over last year Mr. Hernández has seemed to continue in that vein while bringing his far-ranging curiosity to bear. As they did at Mimi, the owners have planted a small curved bar right by the door at Babs. The cocktails stirred and shaken there are mostly recognizable relatives of classics, like a martini made with two brands of gin. There's something charmingly self-deprecating about a cocktail list that includes Mount Gay and tonic, which seasoned barflies know as one of the drinks you can safely order in dives that don't do anything else right. The wine list, meanwhile, is mostly French and sticks to the old guard; you can tell it's not trying especially hard to be cool by the way it has just one orange wine, lumped in with the sparkling wines. Only the wine geeks will wish for more, but the rest of us might wish there were as many bottles costing around $50 as there are in the $90 range. The numbers on the menu can sneak up on you, too. My $48 lobster was a small creature that couldn't have weighed much more than a pound. The server brightly suggested dunking its tomalley into the smoked potato purée, and I would have tried it if I had found any tomalley. And while I can imagine happily paying $36 for Babs's lamb chops, I'd want them to be served with something more compelling than the cold, underseasoned \"Basque potato salad\" into which some baby sardines had apparently disappeared without a trace. But there is nothing wrong with the charcoal-grilled swordfish with mint salsa verde, fennel and green olives, and if you ordered the chicken andouille this summer you found Mr. Hernández knocking cuisines together again, this time with a corn-and-chanterelles risotto under a slow-burning splash of Calabrian chile oil. He shows how well he can work in small strokes with a layered appetizer of raw sea scallops, sweet potato purée and trout roe, seasoned with a briny and fascinating salsa of chopped cucumbers, seaweed and fermented serrano chiles; or the fried cod cheeks, tender and crunchy over an orange slick of romesco aioli. Mr. Hernández's imagination fights against predictability. A crab salad, for instance, doesn't need to be interesting if it is fresh, but the one at Babs is both. It's seasoned with a gribiche that's full of chopped fresh dill, and then it's piled up in a big beehive on top of a smoked potato pancake. Like many small restaurants these days, Babs doesn't offer many desserts, but the ones it does are far more intriguing than average. A fine apple galette is improved by a grating of Swiss-style cheese from Edelweiss Creamery in Wisconsin and by a drizzle of 20-year-old Pedro Ximénez sherry, thick as syrup and tasting like chocolate and coffee. Why sherry with Swiss cheese? I don't know, but Mr. Hernández does. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 54, "data": " I can count on Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn to produce certain sensations at every meal. There is the insistent smell of broiled dry-aged steak that hits me the minute I open the door and sometimes sooner, while I'm still outside on the South Williamsburg sidewalk, producing a raised pulse, a quickening of the senses and a restlessness familiar to anyone who has seen a tiger that has just heard the approach of the lunch bucket. There is the hiss of butter and melted tallow as they slide down the hot platter, past the sliced porterhouse or rib steak and their charred bones, to make a pool at one end. The server will spoon some of this sizzling fat over the meat he has just plated, generally with some line like \"Here are your vitamins.\" There is the thunk of a bowl filled with schlag landing on a bare wood table when dessert is served, and soon after, the softer tap-tap-tap of waxy chocolate coins in gold foil dropped one at a time on top of the check. And after I've paid, there is the unshakable sense that I've been scammed. The last sensation was not part of the Peter Luger experience when I started eating there, in the 1990s. I was acutely aware of the cost back then because I would settle the tab by counting out $20 bills; cash was the only way to pay unless you had a Peter Luger credit card. At the end of the night my wallet would be empty. Because a Peter Luger steak made me feel alive in a way that few other things did, I considered this a fair trade, although I could afford it only once a year or so. I don't remember when the doubts began, but they grew over time. Diners who walk in the door eager to hand over literal piles of money aren't greeted; they're processed. A host with a clipboard looks for the name, or writes it down and quotes a waiting time. There is almost always a wait, with or without a reservation, and there is almost always a long line of supplicants against the wall. A kind word or reassuring smile from somebody on staff would help the time pass. The smile never comes. The Department of Motor Vehicles is a block party compared with the line at Peter Luger. [ Sign up for Sam Sifton's Cooking newsletter for recipes, food writing and culinary inspiration. ] The management seems to go out of its way to make things inconvenient. Customers at the bar have to order drinks from the bartender and food from an overworked server on the other side of the bar, and then pay two separate checks and leave two separate tips. And they can't order lunch after 2:30 p.m., even though the bar and the kitchen remain open. Since its last, two-star review in the Times , written by Frank Bruni in 2007, the restaurant has started taking online reservations. It accepts debit cards, too, which is nice. But the credit card you use to buy a cortado at the cafe or a bag of chips at the bodega will still not buy you a meal at Peter Luger. The servers, who once were charmingly brusque, now give the strong impression that these endless demands for food and drink are all that's standing between them and a hard-earned nap. Signals that a customer has a question or request don't get picked up as quickly; the canned jokes about spinach and schlag don't flow as freely. Some things are the same as ever. The shrimp cocktail has always tasted like cold latex dipped in ketchup and horseradish. The steak sauce has always tasted like the same ketchup and horseradish fortified by corn syrup. Although the fries are reasonably crisp, their insides are mealy and bland in a way that fresh-cut potatoes almost certainly would not be. The sole -- yes, I'm the person who ordered the sole at Peter Luger -- was strangely similar: The bread crumbs on top were gold and crunchy, but the fish underneath was dry and almost powdery. Was the Caesar salad always so drippy, the croutons always straight out of a bag, the grated cheese always so white and rubbery? I know there was a time the German fried potatoes were brown and crunchy, because I eagerly ate them each time I went. Now they are mushy, dingy, gray and sometimes cold. I look forward to them the way I look forward to finding a new, irregularly shaped mole. [ Readers respond to the Pete Wells review of Peter Luger .] Lunch one afternoon vividly demonstrated the kitchen's inconsistency: I ordered a burger, medium-rare, at the bar. So had the two people sitting to my right, it turned out. One of them got what we'd all asked for, a midnight-dark crust giving way to an evenly rosy interior so full of juices it looked like it was ready to cry. The other one got a patty that was almost completely brown inside. I got a weird hybrid, a burger whose interior shaded from nearly perfect on one side to gray and hard on the other. The same issue afflicted a medium-rare porterhouse I was served one night: The fillet was ideal but the other side of the T-bone, the strip, ranged from medium-rare to medium-well. I could live with this; big cuts of meat don't always cook evenly. What gnaws at me every time I eat a Luger porterhouse is the realization that it's just another steak, and far from the best New York has to offer. [ Melissa Clark shows you how to cook a steak at home . ] Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, can put a formidable crust on both sides of the cut; Luger caramelizes the top side only, while the underside is barely past raw, as if it had done all its cooking on the hot platter. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, buy beef that is tender, richly marbled and deeply flavorful; at Luger, you get the first two but not the third. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, age that beef to make flavor grow and intensify and double back on itself; dry-aging at Luger still results in a tender steak, but it rarely achieves a hypnotic or compelling or even very interesting one. But those other restaurants are not Peter Luger, as Friedrich Nietzsche might have said. \"When in this essay I declare war upon Wagner,\" Nietzsche wrote in \" The Case of Wagner ,\" \"the last thing I want to do is start a celebration for any other musicians. Other musicians don't count compared to Wagner.\" I could say the same thing about other steakhouses -- compared to Peter Luger, they don't count. Luger is not the city's oldest, but it's the one in which age, tradition, superb beef, blistering heat, an instinctive avoidance of anything fancy and an immensely attractive self-assurance came together to produce something that felt less like a restaurant than an affirmation of life, or at least life as it is lived in New York City. This sounds ridiculously grand. Years ago I thought it was true, though, and so did other people. The restaurant will always have its loyalists. They will laugh away the prices, the $16.95 sliced tomatoes that taste like 1979, the $229.80 porterhouse for four. They will say that nobody goes to Luger for the sole, nobody goes to Luger for the wine, nobody goes to Luger for the salad, nobody goes to Luger for the service.

{"id": 55, "data": " Tsismis is the opposite of a speakeasy. It isn't hiding anything; its glass facade on Orchard Street wants to strike up a conversation so badly that it almost follows you home. The windows are stenciled with cartoon characters and with text-message bubbles that call out in English (\"Hello! New York\"), Spanish (\"que rico!\"), French (\"bon appétit\") and Tagalog (\"masarap,\" for delicious). The language lessons continue on the front door, which gives translations for \"tuloy po kayo\" (welcome) and the restaurant's name (gossip), pronounced chiss-miss. In case you miss all of this, a sandwich board straddles the sidewalk, advertising discounted beer, wine and wings at the bar during happy hour (\"5:thirsty\"). If you accept the facade's invitation to benaquitodits (come here here, a repetitive bit of Tagalog slang), the conversation will continue inside. Tsismis, which opened in June, is a chatty restaurant. At times, when one of the owners pulls up alongside your table and expounds on how the chef's interpretation of the dish you're trying to eat differs from what you might find in the Philippines, you may find yourself eyeing the exit. If you've found your way to the menu's strengths, though, odds are you won't want to go anywhere. Kinilaw, a Filipino ceviche in a piercingly sour calamansi and cane vinegar marinade with a jab of bird's-eye chile, is worth sticking around for, especially on those nights when it's made with bay scallops instead of fish. After that, you might look into the fried pork-and-carrot won tons called pinsec frito (or, as the menu has them, pinsit frito). They are typically folded into triangles, but the ones at Tsismis are twisted into little cones that look like Hershey's kisses, though slightly bigger and golden-brown. Once they stop steaming, you can hold them by the cowlick of fried wrapper at the top and swish them around in the sweet chile sauce. Won tons with the same filling flop around in the soup called pancit molo, although these are boiled. There is almost as much ground pork inside them as outside in the broth, which is thick with garlic and chopped scallions. Even if it's well after 5:thirsty and you're not sitting at the bar, Jappy's wings are worth considering. Jappy is the chef, Jappy Afzelius, and he fries those wings with thinly sliced garlic and sends them out to the dining room with a salsa of raw mangoes, charred onions and chiles. The heat of the salsa will not cause your shirt to burst into flames, but it is hot enough to make your memory of Jappy's wings a lasting one. Mr. Afzelius is a native of the Philippines and a graduate of a cooking academy in Manila, which shipped him off to Paris to intern in one of Alain Ducasse's bistros. The Ducasse masterminds then sent him to work at Benoit in New York, after which he turned up as the sous-chef at a Filipino restaurant in Brooklyn that was best known for its $100 doughnut -- ube-filled, Cristal-frosted and gold-leafed. Happily, nothing at Tsismis approaches that level of look-at-me desperation. Mr. Afzelius's cooking is loose, unfussy and liberated. He tosses tradition under the bus when it suits him. The result is Filipino-American drinking food that tends to be charmingly offhand. From time to time, it can lean toward sloppiness. One night the fried milkfish in pritong isda was so overdone that even topping it with calamansi juice, fish sauce and a crisp, juicy spoonful of marinated chayote on top didn't revive it. A version of adobong manok, which Mr. Afzelius makes as a roasted chicken plus a soy-turmeric sauce rather than an all-in-one stew, would have been more successful if the smoked eggplant hadn't been so undercooked it squeaked. But the grilled eggplant on top of the kare-kare was as soft as warm marrow, and the other vegetables -- crisp green beans, bok choy, enoki mushrooms -- made a refreshing counterpoint to the stewed oxtails in thick peanut sauce. Already pungent with shrimp paste, the kare-kare comes with extra on the side that you can add to your heart's content. As they do at Bad Saint in Washington, probably the country's most talked-about Filipino restaurant, Tsismis makes its laing by simmering local kale, rather than the more traditional taro leaves, in coconut milk. And if this version doesn't have the perspective-altering funk of Bad Saint's, it still draws plenty of depth from the shrimp paste and smoked fish in the milk and the big handful of dried baby shrimp dropped on top. By this point, you will probably want to have a glass in your hand. Housemade calamansi soda sounds lovely, but mine was a little flat and weak. In lieu of hard spirits, sake is the backbone of most of the cocktails. They are typically fleshed out with half a dozen other ingredients -- vermouth, Aperol, artichoke liqueur and bitters, in the case of the A La Bira -- which sound at first as if they had been assembled by walking through a liquor store blindfolded, but which after a closer look reveal a degree of inner logic. If this does not pique your curiosity, the list of wines by the glass is almost long enough to qualify Tsismis as a wine bar, although the choices are not as outré as they are across the street at Wildair . In a city crazy for kakigori , patbingsu and other varieties of flavored snow, Tsismis's halo-halo will probably be an instant hit. Mr. Afzelius has the very good idea of putting coconut sorbet where the shaved ice would usually go; from there he goes to town with coconut jellies and what seems like every fresh fruit he can put his hands on. But discerning collectors of Filipino sweets should note that Tsismis serves excellent silvanas. A silvana is either a shrunken cake or a cookie with big ideas, depending on your perspective. It is made of two cashew meringues that are sandwiched together with buttercream and then painted with more buttercream, which holds cashew crumbs to the outside of the whole package. Once frosted and crumbed, it has to be refrigerated or the buttercream will melt before it gets inside your mouth. No gold leaf adorns the silvanas. It would only get in the way.

{"id": 56, "data": " For a long time, the seriousness of a pizzeria could be gauged by a simple yes-or-no question: Did it sell pizza by the slice? The ones that cared the most about upholding traditions, maintaining quality and so on -- like Totonno's , John's of Bleecker Street , Kesté , Lucali , Una Pizza Napoletana -- emphatically did not. Today, we live in the era of the elevated slice joint. Some of them, like Scarr's , grind wheat berries into new flour every day. Many use minuscule quantities of yeast; others abandon commercial yeast altogether in favor of the natural leavening in sourdough starters. There are slice joints that ferment their dough for a day, some that let it bubble away for two days and a few that go in for three days. A new example of the breed, F&F Pizzeria , opened in Brooklyn last week with the help of a baker whose starter dough has traveled internationally and another baker who has decades of experience at the end of a pizza paddle. Among themselves, these new-school pizza makers speak of hydration levels, fermentation periods and digestibility. Many of these slice masters are chasing an ideal version of the foldable, portable triangle sold across linoleum counters in all five boroughs, a search suffused with nostalgia for an era before processed cheese, sweetened sauce and wholesale dough. Others are celebrated for achievements in the square slice, a descendant of the Sicilian, with an airier, less doughy crust; leaders in this style include Corner Slice and Mama's Too . Perhaps the smallest group of all are the bakers who turn their eyes toward Rome, where the slices are rectangular and are known as pizza al taglio. They resemble focaccia more than a $3 slice from Ray's , and it's doubtful that the practitioners of this style even think of themselves as belonging to the elevated-slice movement. But I'd argue that they do belong to it, and that some of the most elevated slices in the area at the moment are the Roman-style ones that Bread and Salt sells inside its bakery and restaurant on Palisade Avenue, up in the Jersey City Heights. At any given time, three to six pizzas sit on the counter. They are oblong and, because they are baked without a pan to shape the dough, they have rounded corners, like a horse track. The crust is noticeably lightweight when you pick it up, an impression that is confirmed by the mouth and, later, the stomach. The interior is honeycombed with air pockets. The underside of each slice is strong enough to carry a relatively heavy load of toppings without bending or collapsing. This structural soundness is key to the pleasure. The toppings on a Bread and Salt slice are not decorations or seasonings, as they often are on round pizza. Each one is the point of its slice: a mix of fresh mushrooms with pepper, parsley and flecks of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano; zucchini shaved into fine threads and showered at the last minute with mint leaves; slices of late-summer red and yellow peppers picked while they still had few faintly bitter streaks of green reaching up their sides; a rough, dark pesto spooned around cherry tomatoes that were roasted until their skins turned black and pulled away from the globes of pulp inside; Concord grapes that blotch the dough with purple like exploded jelly grenades. A chef's hand is at work here, tossing black pepper and rosemary over the grape pizza, adding salt and excellent Sicilian olive oil to the tomato pulp, and hammering basil and hazelnuts for the pesto in a mortar. The hand belongs to Rick Easton, who oversees the pizzas and the nonpizzas and owns the restaurant. He also owned its predecessor, the Bread and Salt that operated in Pittsburgh for all of 2015 plus a few weeks on either side. For a short-lived place, it got a lot of media attention, luring restaurant hunters and recipe gatherers from across the country. By the start of 2016, he had decided to move to New York City. When his first job fell through, he began shopping for a location for Bread and Salt. The real estate market had ideas of its own, as it often does, which is how the incarnation of Bread and Salt that Mr. Easton opened early this summer wound up in New Jersey. In addition to cheaper rents, Jersey City has ordinances that allow customers to show up with bottles of wine or beer and drink them, a handy policy because Bread and Salt's beverage list has nothing more potent than Italian sodas and sparkling water. Each night's menu, written in chalk on a blackboard next to the counter where you order, contains at least as many things that are not pizza as things that are. Generally these other items are modest in size and trattoria-ish in spirit; prepared ahead of time, they need at most five minutes in the oven before a cook will arrange them on a board and carry them to one of the 25 or so seats. I wish the tripe stewed in spicy tomato sauce, the way Romans do it, were available all the time. It is not, but the meatballs almost always are, and they are wonderful, made with enough bread that they are extremely tender in a bright marinara. Another reliable find is a sandwich of some kind, made with plain, untopped pizza. Twice I've had a warm mortadella sandwich there, and both times I was convinced there was no way to improve on it. One dish was denoted on the menu by a single word: beans. I've thought of it nearly every day since, partly because the beans -- scarlet runners -- were perfectly intact but perfectly tender; partly because of the brooding depth they took on from being finished with sweet red peppers that the kitchen dried and fried, an ingredient the Italians call peperoni cruschi; and partly because their broth tasted so good when given a chance to soak into the slice of thick-crusted sourdough bread that came on top. That bread is Mr. Easton's, too. It comes with a lot of things, and it is excellent. Bread and Salt is still settling into New Jersey. Some ingredients may be better when Mr. Easton has had time to infiltrate the local farm scene. In August, when the state was rolling in juicy peaches, he was serving crunchy unripe ones in red wine for dessert. There was also a very strange cantaloupe pudding. By September things were looking up; one day there was a scoop of Tristar strawberry sorbet served with anise-seed-flecked polenta gelato, both made by Superiority Burger. (Mr. Easton is friendly with that restaurant's owner, Brooks Headley , and helped devise the recipe for the focaccia Superiority Burger serves on Fridays.) Although Mr. Easton has a handful of employees, Bread and Salt has some of the blind spots of a one-person operation. It is not the easiest restaurant to communicate with, having an Instagram account but no website or phone. On a recent Sunday, when the restaurant was supposed to open at 1 p.m., a sign on the front door announced that it would be delayed until 1:30. That was the last communiqué; the doors were not unlocked until 2. But Mr. Easton has a singular vision, and it is the reason the food is so compelling. Looking around at the place, you're not sure how it can keep going like this. But then the plates start to come out of the kitchen and you don't want them ever to stop.

{"id": 57, "data": " Last month I had dinner with a friend who lives a thousand miles away and doesn't get to Manhattan as often as he once did. When I asked where he wanted to eat, he answered, a bit wistfully, \"Somewhere that speaks of New York, a city I have lost touch with.\" At first, I looked for a place where we could be in the thick of it all. I thought of Bar Pisellino , that narrow glass sarcophagus run by Rita Sodi and Jody Williams, where you drink your sgroppino standing up between the window along Grove Street and the one along Seventh Avenue. People trickle in, eat some olives and a tuna tramezzino, and head out again. Although it's about the size of a subway car, you get the feeling that if you stayed long enough, you'd eventually see everybody you know. But a restaurant that truly speaks of the place New York has become over the past decade or so would be nearly the opposite of Bar Pisellino. This restaurant would not be in the thick of it all. It would be hushed, sheltered, exclusive, admitting no more than a handful of people at a time. It would protect those people, once they were inside, from crowds spilling in from the street, even from the street itself. It would join the steady march of new tasting counters and omakase hideaways. And it would illustrate the growing ease with which New Yorkers of means can glide through and above the fray, slipping from one cloistered room to another in black cars without touching down. That restaurant would be a lot like Frevo , which has been serving suave, $124 tasting menus with a modern-French sensibility in Greenwich Village for the past four months. Frevo is the work of Franco Sampogna, who is the chef, and Bernardo Silva, the manager. Mr. Sampogna is from Brazil and Mr. Silva comes from Portugal; they met 10 years ago while working in restaurants in France, and quickly decided that one day they would open a restaurant in New York City that would give diners \"that feeling of being in your own secluded safe haven,\" as Mr. Sampogna put it. To get into Frevo, you first need to know that Frevo exists. There's no sign. When you arrive at the correct address, what you see is an art gallery with just enough room on its white walls for the six abstract paintings that hang there fairly close together. The paintings are real paintings made by a real artist, Thomas Labarthe, who goes by Toma-L , but the gallery is not entirely a real gallery. If it were, the young woman who sits there keeping an eye on things would stare blankly ahead when you entered, instead of walking up to you with a smile and reassuring you that, yes, you've come to the right place. Then she reaches behind one of the canvases and it swings out on invisible hinges, leaving in its place a doorway through which you can see, illuminated in a large, dark room, a stainless-steel kitchen and a long, curving counter of polished quartzite. You hop up on one of the 18 padded seats, and the door clicks closed. You are in. When the door opens again, typically not for another half an hour, in will walk another set of people who, like you, knew that the gallery was not a normal gallery. Let's say that the misdirection of the gallery and the secret door do not make these newcomers feel sufficiently insulated from the outside world. Frevo gives them the opportunity to sit at a round chef's table in a back corner around which a curtain can be drawn, as in a hospital room. Much of this comes right out of the neo-speakeasy handbook, although Frevo does throw itself into the act with an unusual level of commitment. The gallery, for instance, installed a new batch of Mr. Labarthe's canvases around Labor Day. But each time I went to Frevo, I stared at that curtain. Nobody ever closed it while I was there, but it still reminded me how easy it is now for some New Yorkers to climb into the treehouse and pull the ladder up behind them. I have to admit, though, that I like Frevo more than I like the version of New York that it brings to mind. The pleasures of this secluded safe haven are real, and Mr. Sampogna's cooking is focused and refined. I haven't been able to get his halibut dish out of my mind, for instance. The fish rests on a thin, crisp platform of fried bread shellacked with a dark mushroom marmalade; this miniature mushroom tart drinks up the flavor of the halibut as it goes, in the oven, from raw to that just-cooked state where its flesh slides apart into thick and almost fluffy white flakes. Alongside the fish are bulbs of melted fennel, their spiced cooking juices boiled down to a bittersweet syrup. Mr. Sampogna's opening salvo often involves quinoa doing something quinoa doesn't usually do, and doing it quite nicely. I liked its freshness when it was used in a salad spooned over a demitasse of creamy hummus; I liked its crunch when it was dehydrated and sprinkled over a few mouthfuls of black lentils topped with glistening orbs of smoked trout roe. A dish from early July brought peas, at the tail end of their season, together with a rich pistachio-tarragon cream and white puffs of coconut mousse: light and charming. I wished Mr. Sampogna had exploited summer produce as sensitively when I went back in August and September. His kitchen is small enough that he could respond to the market day by day, but so far this doesn't seem to interest him. Frevo, at $124 for five courses, is not a huge splurge by New York standards, but servers try to inflate the total by pushing supplements. For $30 you can get Kaluga caviar troweled on to your first course; $20 gets you upgraded to a foie gras torchon instead of the less-thrilling mushrooms with gnocchi; it's $18 for a serving of aged Comté before dessert, and another $30 to have white truffles with the cheese. This tactic is not as grating as it is at Per Se , where the supplements are piled onto a base charge of $355, but it is still a snag in the otherwise smooth hospitality provided by Frevo's small crew of servers and cooks. Everyone I've brought to Frevo has fallen under its spell, which is hard to resist. The music is slinky and sinuous. The room has a nocturnal theatricality; sitting at the counter with darkness behind you facing the spotlighted kitchen can feel like attending an extremely elegant campfire. I still think Frevo is a perfect spot to familiarize yourself with the frictionless New York of 2019. Still, when my out-of-town friend arrived, we had our dinner at Bar Pisellino. We were hungry for a taste of the old chaos. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 58, "data": " Billy Durney, the Brooklyn restaurateur and pitmaster, has been talking for several years about the fried chicken that he planned to bring to Red Hook. At first, there was no reason to doubt him. That the man is comfortable with long time horizons was clear to anyone who watched how patiently he studied the science of indirect heat at his first establishment in the neighborhood, Hometown Bar-B-Que . After Hurricane Sandy flooded streets and knocked out power in the area shortly before the scheduled opening in 2012, he gave away smoked briskets, ribs and shoulders to local residents until electricity was restored almost three weeks later, honing his technique all the while. The years rolled by without a drumstick in sight. But as recently as March, it was still possible to take Mr. Durney at his word when he talked about the star attraction of his nearly completed fried-chicken emporium , to be called Red Hook Tavern. The doors were finally unlocked in July, revealing a row of tables under electrified gas lamps and a row of stools in front of a white-oak bar that looks as if it was built to last at least until Van Brunt Street sinks into the sea. Wearing wallpaper and wainscoting and pressed tin, Red Hook Tavern does a straight-faced impression of a whiskey-simmered New York corner bar of a certain age. The attention to detail was to be expected, given how convincingly Hometown conjures a Texas Hill Country barbecue palace. What was something of a surprise, though, was that chickens were not being fried anywhere on the premises. In fact, Red Hook Tavern's star attraction turned out to be a cheeseburger. To be fair, Mr. Durney probably would not have drummed up much enthusiasm had he gone around telling people he was going to open a bar that served hamburgers. New York has so many of those already that the style they typically serve is a recognized subgenre that George Motz calls \"the New York City pub burger.\" According to Mr. Motz, a filmmaker and author whose work explores all things ground-beef-and-bun-related, the hallmarks of a pub burger are a thicker-than-average patty and a relative lack of adornment. It is the plain, sturdy and hunger-calming burger you get at P.J. Clarke's , JG Melon and Fanelli Cafe in Manhattan and at Donovan's Pub in Queens. Mr. Durney has said that he intends the Red Hook Tavern burger as a homage to the one at Peter Luger Steak House . (You might think that Luger traffics in the style known as the steakhouse burger, but most burger taxonomists agree that what it serves, only at the bar and only at lunch, is a pub burger.) Like Peter Luger, Red Hook Tavern employs a toasted and buttered hard roll with a smattering of sesame seeds -- about as many as the stars you can see in the sky over Manhattan on a very clear night. In both places, the patties are made with some portion of dry-aged prime beef, stand about an inch and a half tall, and possess a dark crust that fills your head with the instinct-triggering aromas and flavors whose creation in browned meat was described by Louis Camille Maillard . There are some minor divergences. At Peter Luger, cheese is optional, while the top and sides of the burger at Red Hook Tavern are tightly wrapped in glossy yellow American cheese by default. A thick cross-section of white onion is laid below the top bun at Luger. At Red Hook Tavern, the onion is stationed below the patty, where it helps keep the bottom bun dry, like a coaster. They give you a half-sour pickle spear and fries, too, which are about the same dimensions. The important difference between the burgers, though, is that lately Peter Luger's have tended to be better in memory than in reality, while the Red Hook Tavern's is, right now, one of the few absolutely mandatory burgers in New York City. The kitchen is overseen by Allison Plumer, a chef who has done most of her cooking in Brooklyn. She has an excellent dry-aged steak -- New York strip, naturally -- impressively browned and served with a small cast-iron skillet full of creamed spinach, a touch so right it may qualify as art. It is the kind of detail that makes Red Hook Tavern something more than a place for the locals to get beer and burgers. Another is the golden chicken gravy with a hint of butterscotch that is ladled into a well in the mashed potatoes that come with the half-chicken, which is advertised as simply pan-roasted, although it has the wonderfully stiff shards of skin you get from weighting down the bird as it cooks. Everybody who has eaten at Red Hook Tavern will tell you to get the country-ham-and-Cheddar croquettes on a creamy pool of whole-grain Dijonnaise. Everybody is right, too. Consensus has also formed around the wedge salad, which is clearly not a wedge, but is still a very fine salad, with blue cheese and a thick, Lugeresque bacon slice flopped over individual leaves of romaine. There is considerably less unanimity about the roasted corn, kernels of which you are supposed to wrap in radicchio that you've first smeared with 'nduja; I'm in the camp that thinks it would be a fine dish for another restaurant. There is no restaurant where I'd be glad to see littlenecks steamed with way too much stale, acrid garlic. Of course, there's no correct amount of stale, acrid garlic, but the kitchen really goes all in. There are two desserts. Both are sundaes . They do not have the thematic inevitability of the creamed spinach, but they're put together with more sophistication than average. The truth is, though, that nothing on the menu gives the burger a real run for its money. What does, or at least equals it as a reason to reserve a table a couple of weeks in advance, is the list of drinks Mr. Durney has put together with Jeff Porter and Kenneth Crum. Mr. Durney's enthusiasm for wines made by small, eccentric producers is on view at Hometown, surely the only place on earth where you can drink Milan Nasterec's skin-fermented Moravian pinot noir alongside a taco filled with a slice of barbecued brisket and, in lieu of salsa, a glowing yellow stripe of queso. Mr. Durney indulges his curiosity more deeply at the tavern. Ten grower Champagnes can be had for under $100 a bottle, and there's a $40 sparkling red from Maryland. Darlings of the nonconformist wine movement such as Radikon , Marcel Lapierre and Frank Cornelissen are all given the space you'd expect, but there are also less familiar names like Subject to Change , a Forestville, Calif., outfit that has the peculiar idea of making a bright-toned, low-alcohol zinfandel-syrah blend and calling it Moon Juice. A small number of brews from Other Half, Folksbier and Threes Brewing, leading lights of the Brooklyn suds scene, are on tap, along with uncredited light and dark ales billed as \"A Tribute To McSorleys Ale House.\" McSorley's, famously, has you buy two mugs at once, which Red Hook Tavern doesn't do. It's less well known that McSorley's serves a burger. Like the one at Luger, it's only available at lunch. It is, of course, a pub burger.

{"id": 59, "data": " There are no roving carts loaded with bamboo steamer baskets at the new Chinese restaurant Hutong , no menu cards to be stamped each time you take a dish of har gow or turnip cake. In fact, dim sum is only a small portion of what the menu offers at Hutong, which opened in Midtown in July. But you would do well to make it a large portion of what you order, because only one or two other restaurants in town can plausibly claim to make dim sum that rivals Hutong's. Where else will you find cooks who have the dexterity to make Wagyu-beef mille-feuilles whose flaky layers of pastry overlap each other by only a few millimeters, like the feathers on a songbird's wing? Who can craft steamed buns that look just like shiitake mushrooms, which happen to be the chief ingredient in their filling? Or who knows the secret that allows the crunchy, chewy, charcoal-black mini-footballs stuffed with pork (in what is known in Sichuan as \"fish-fragrant\" seasoning) to sparkle as if diamond chips had been kneaded into the dough? There is real skill in the kitchen at Hutong. You see it most clearly in the dim sum, but much of the other cooking evinces the kind of discipline, precision and technical mastery that has rarely been seen in this city over the past few decades, to the dismay of eaters who know what Chinese food is capable of. \"While expensive French restaurants in New York can hold their own against many places in Paris, if you want to move beyond steamed dumplings and stir-fries to experience the complexity of Chinese banquet cuisine, the possibilities grow dimmer each year,\" Ruth Reichl wrote in The New York Times in 1998. She gave reasons for the poor showing, including talented chefs being paid more in Hong Kong and China. That is as true as it was 21 years ago, but what has changed is the rise of global Chinese restaurant groups, from the disappointing duck specialist DaDong to the surprisingly solid Hao Noodle outposts and, now, to Hutong. The original Hutong opened in 2003 on the 28th floor of a glass tower overlooking the Hong Kong harbor, but the dining room tries to conjure the atmosphere of Beijing's vanishing premodern alleys, or hutongs, by means of red paper lanterns, carved wooden doors and birdcages. The Manhattan branch makes a different impression. The entrance is on the east side of the circular driveway below the Bloomberg Building between East 58th and 59th Streets. Turn right and you are in a narrow hallway between two soaring glass stacks of wine bottles, every one of them for decorative purposes only. Turn left and you are in a glittering, soaring, hard-edge dining room. The inspiration seems to be Art Deco with a pinch of cocaine; the blue leather banquettes, beveled mirrors and chandeliers of mirror-polished steel could come from the set of a nightclub in some cross between \" Scarface \" and \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\" A guest who has lived in China allowed his eyes to adjust to the glinting light as he looked toward the ceiling, which seemed to be far away. \"It's very  yin,\" he said. Hutong is ostensibly a Northern Chinese restaurant. This is more apparent in Hong Kong than in Manhattan, where the menu has been pruned to about half the size. Lamb, a mainstay in the northern provinces, was represented in August by a single dish, cumin-speckled ribs roasted languorously to a mind-altering tenderness. By the time of my last visit, lamb had ambled off the menu entirely. The most famous preparation from northern China, Peking duck, arrived at my table worse for wear and tear, carved haphazardly, with blobs of unmelted fat clinging to limp skin. The second course, a dark-meat stir-fry to be folded in iceberg lettuce, was more skillfully done, but the sting of paying $84 for a whole duck with uncrisp skin lingered. Much of what hasn't been trimmed from the Hong Kong menu comes from Sichuan. So does Fei Wang, the executive chef of the New York branch, and a native of Chengdu. Most recently seen running the kitchen of the Hutong in London, Mr. Wang weaves chiles -- fresh, dried, roasted, pickled, name it -- into nearly everything. In the dish known as Red Lantern, the whole dried peppers the size of cherries are mostly decorative; fried soft-shell crabs are buried under the chiles in a pan with an arcing bamboo handle, like jelly beans in the plastic grass of an Easter basket. The ground spices on the crabs' shatteringly brittle crust -- lightly sweet and more aromatic than searingly hot -- may remind you of a Chinese rice-cracker snack you grew up on, or it may make you think of Old Bay. Fermented chiles provide an electric buzz, and a modicum of heat, to the steamed halibut that arrives boxed up inside a red bell pepper and sitting on a nest of rice noodles. (The pepper opens into a six-pointed star that gives the dish its name, halibut red star noodles.) Kou shui chicken is nearly submerged in an orange lake of excellent chile oil, although the adroit way the oil is balanced by rice vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger and other flavors is what gives Hutong one of the city's most impressive versions of this traditional cold dish. If Hutong has another appetizer that equals it, I haven't found it yet. I did, however, have a cryptic encounter with a log-cabin stack of okra doused in a sweet wasabi sauce, and an inconclusive rendezvous with some steamed asparagus stalks whose tips were enrobed in white sesame sauce; it was as if somebody had tried to replicate strawberries dipped in white chocolate without access to strawberries or white chocolate. You could attempt to unknot these mysteries. Then again, you could simply begin your meal with dim sum. And then, after picking your way through the chile-besotted main courses, you could end it that way, too. There is a dessert that mimics the shape of a steamed bun, pleated and twisted into a pucker at the top. It is made of white chocolate, the wrapper on this trompe l'oeil bao, and filled with white sesame cream and a core of bittersweet salted caramel. Alongside it is a single scoop of ice cream made from lightly sweetened soy milk. The soy milk is extremely fresh. I don't mean that the carton won't expire for another three weeks; I mean that somebody in the kitchen was squeezing the soybeans shortly before the ice cream was frozen. This is a snack from a Chinese childhood, bread and a glass of milk, and it would be hard, after several courses of spice, to think of anything more welcome.

{"id": 60, "data": " Four summers ago, a young chef named José Luis Chávez began leveraging the poke craze and the salad-bowl trend into a string of fast-casual ceviche bars. He began with a counter in the Gansevoort Market food hall called Mission Ceviche ; there is now another in Canal Street Market and a third is supposed to open in Norwalk, Conn., later this year. At all locations, the stock-in-trade is citrus-marinated raw fish with sweet potatoes and kernels of chubby Andean corn, in both its soft and crunchy forms. This is of course the standard Peruvian formula, but Mr. Chávez had the inspiration of serving his ceviche in a clear plastic bowl over a base of salad, rice or, for a dollar more, quinoa. The supplemental ingredients make a plausible desk lunch out of a dish that some New Yorkers still aren't quite sure what to do with. The surprising thing about Mission Ceviche's salad bowls is that they taste like real Peruvian food. The raw fish is firm and cold and neatly cut up into solid pieces that hold their shape. The leche de tigre marinade in Mr. Chávez's \"ceviche clásico\" is a bright and precise cocktail of lime and rocoto chiles, although you might wish that the rocotos had been applied with a little less restraint. You get a higher-caliber shot of spice, this time from ají amarillo chiles, in the ceviche mixto, a combination of octopus, shrimp and fluke enveloped in a creamy, goldenrod-colored leche de tigre. The clásico is accessorized with sweet potato purée; the mixto gets avocado purée, too. The purées are piped out of pastry bags like buttercream roses on a wedding cake, and they are delicious. When I wandered into the Gansevoort Market location in February, it seemed clear that Mr. Chávez could run an interesting restaurant if he ever decided to put his food into something other than recyclable salad bowls. Then, at the beginning of the summer, he did just that, opening a sit-down restaurant on the Upper East Side with real plates and bowls. The new space is not particularly large or lavish, but compared with the earlier efforts, Mission Ceviche Restaurant & Bar is a palace. There is seating for 65 or so people beneath a wall sculpture of a fish that glows from behind and a pink neon sign that reads \"tiger milk effect,\" probably a reference to the belief that drinking leftover leche de tigre can put extra topspin on sexual performance. The menu now paints a slightly fuller picture of Peruvian cuisine, extending into new foods including the grilled skewers known as anticuchos. Mr. Chávez dresses up the country's most popular anticucho, grilled beef heart, brushing it with a creamy rocoto sauce and serving it with newly fried blue potato chips and kernels of choclo corn. The trio of rocoto, blue potatoes and choclo is so solidly Peruvian that it can withstand the chimichurri that Mr. Chávez brings in, by way of Argentina, as a final touch. He clearly has a soft spot for chimichurri because he deploys it again with the shrimp anticuchos (the shrimp are very big and look even bigger because they're grilled with their heads on), served with a squirt of huancaína, the spicy yellow cheese sauce that is something like Peru's version of queso dip. My favorite anticucho is a more straightforward situation, grilled scallops under arugula, lime zest and a smooth Parmesan fondue. But Mr. Chávez has the ability to put several flavors in motion at once and keep his balance, as evidenced by the beef-heart skewer and his octopus causa. This is, reduced to bare bones, a tendril of octopus curled around a disc of mashed potatoes. But the potatoes, seasoned with lime and yellow chiles, are coated in a smooth lavender-colored sauce made from Peruvian black olives; the octopus has been rubbed with cumin, oregano and ají panca paste and grilled to a crackle; the plate is decorated with a few wobbly curls of paper made with purple Peruvian potatoes. Mission Ceviche's servers, while eager to be helpful, have a habit of singling out the most obvious dishes -- the classic ceviche, the octopus leg -- and pushing them so hard you might suspect the rest of the menu is a minefield. It isn't. There is nothing to avoid unless the kitchen brings back the bizarre strawberry-kiwi ceviche that showed up as a special one night. If you are being herded into getting the \"Peruvian paella,\" you should know that the other three main courses are also worth looking into, like the ají de gallina, shredded chicken breast in a creamy ají amarillo sauce that is both soothing and spicy; or the seco norteño, a slowly braised short rib in cilantro sauce. All are larger than average, too. Still, nothing on the menu quite rivals the ceviches. They are served, yes, without lettuce or rice, and they are better for it. Mr. Chávez's creative engine seems to have a high idle, and he has come up with different ways to present dishes that are also on the menu at the fast-casual counters. The \"Nikkei\" ceviche, for instance -- tuna in a kind of modified ponzu sauce seasoned with ají amarilllo and togarashi -- now comes with watermelon and a bloop of ginger foam that would never survive a trip from the food court back to the office. Neither would the odd but intriguing attempt at a vegetarian ceviche where the fish is replaced by shiitakes and the leche de tigre takes the form of snow, frozen by liquid nitrogen. The art of ceviche-making has at least as much in common with mixology as with cooking, so it is no surprise that the cocktails are well calibrated and sing out with fresh lime. There is a twist on the pisco sour made with passion-fruit juice and another with the purple-corn drink chicha morada, although neither quite achieves the bracing elegance of the original. And it's nice to see the less well-known chilcano, a pisco highball made with lime juice and ginger ale. (Would ginger beer be better?) Chicha morada appears again in the raspadilla dessert. This time it is a syrup poured over shaved ice and sprinkled with lucuma foam. When I had the raspadilla, it was sprinkled with candied pecan crumbs but in a phone interview on Monday Mr. Chávez said he had replaced the nuts with crumbled Oreos. This, it hardly needs pointing out, was not exactly a staple in the diet of the Incas. \"What can I say?\" he asked. \"I just really like Oreos.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 61, "data": " New York is getting crowded with hot pots. The city is not yet in the same league as, say, Chongqing, where the dish is said to have originated and where an association dedicated to keeping track of such things says there are about 50,000 places to eat it. New York, by my count, has a mere two or three dozen, most of them in the sections of Brooklyn, Queens and Lower Manhattan that have considerable Chinese populations. But new hot pot restaurants seem to arrive every few weeks, with some independent operators among a growing number of chains from China. Downtown Flushing, Queens, has Little Sheep Hot Pot , founded in Inner Mongolia and one of the first hot pot purveyors in New York to move beyond the all-you-can-eat model, which led to widespread improvement in ingredient quality; Mister Hotpot, known among the city's pig worshipers for its creamy, ivory-toned pork-bone broth; and Liuyishou Hot Pot , a Chongqing-based concern where the spiced beef tallow that is an essential component of Sichuan hot pot is molded into the shape of a smiling, bow-tied cow. Farther south in Flushing is Niu Pot , the city's best hot pot establishment by several measures, including the number and complexity of its broths. Niu Pot cooks a very good winter-melon soup and serves it inside the melon's hollow shell, although it is most widely known for serving marbled slices of raw beef wrapped tightly around a Barbie doll , like a dress for Lady Gaga . In Manhattan, hot pot outposts have been planted along the Bowery in a line advancing toward Chinatown, starting with Zhen Wei Fang . If there had been a hot pot restaurant in \"Blade Runner,\" it would have looked like Zhen Wei Fang, an import from Miami that has private booths, simultaneous videos projected side by side on the walls and a robot host by the entrance. (Adding to the sense of a future gone awry, the robot wasn't working the last time I went.) A few blocks south is Tang Hotpot , probably the most luxe hot pot in the city. The menu is illustrated with still-life ingredient photographs that look as if Vermeer painted them, and the pictures aren't that far off from reality. Almost all of these emporiums offer Sichuan hot pot, a broth covered in a deep slice of chile oil in which dried red chiles, Sichuan peppercorns and various other spices churn around like the remains of toy sailboats after a hurricane. But Da Long Yi Hot Pot, which opened in May in a second-story space above Canal Street, has the advantage over most of its competitors of having originated in Sichuan. Its home base, from which more than 200 Da Long Yis have issued, is the provincial capital of Chengdu. Chongqing was administratively sheared from the rest of the province in 1997. Although you key your name into a touch pad at the top of the stairs to get on Da Long Yi's waiting list, and you learn that your table is ready from an automated text, you order by penciling an X on the paper menu, in a box next to the item you want. The menu also suggests the length of time each item should be held down in the boiling soup. It goes without saying that you will want a Sichuan hot pot at Da Long Yi. You will be asked whether you want it mild, medium or spicy, although in my experience there isn't much difference. A more important question is whether you will cook your meal in Sichuan broth alone; in a split pot with Sichuan broth on one side and either tomato or mushroom broth, neither of them spicy, on the other; or in a three-chambered pot with some of each. The narrow range of choices can be an advantage for a novice hot potter, who might be swamped by the maximalist menus at Tang or Niu Pot. The split pots make Da Long Yi a good place to take somebody with a low tolerance for heat, although as a practical matter it is impossible to eat a Sichuan hot pot meal without ingesting at least a spoonful or two of chile oil. Old hands know that the oil tends to pool away from the region of the broth that is bubbling most furiously, and ingredients that, after cooking, are removed from the pot in this area will emerge relatively clean. Whether this is desirable varies from eater to eater and from ingredient to ingredient. Deeply furrowed, folded or layered foods -- the Kungfu beef tripe spread out on a mound of chipped ice; the tofu skins; the fried dough sticks known as youtiao or, on Da Long Yi's menu, \"fried bun\" -- retain spicy oil in quantities that may become challenging. Extremely smooth items, like the hard-cooked quail eggs, the rabbit kidneys speared on a toothpick, or the long and surprisingly slippery tubes of duck intestine, on the other hand, can survive a trip through the deepest patch of chile oil without any appreciable damage. You can, if you like, follow the custom of Chengdu or Chongqing by focusing on ingredients that are prized more for feel than flavor. The duck intestines, for instance, which quickly contract in the hot broth and come out about 30 seconds later with the texture of barely cooked squid. Or the pale ivory sheets of flattened artery, which after cooking about twice as long have a long-lasting chew that reminds me of geoduck. On the other hand, more flavorful ingredients, once they've cooked for a few minutes, can help punch up the broths, which aren't quite as deep or complex as they are at some other hot pot providers. This does not apply to the lengths of corn on the cob, which don't taste like anything to begin with. And I would avoid the \"vegetable platter,\" which was more like a lettuce platter. But it is useful to keep in mind that if you toss sliced king oyster mushrooms, or crown daisy greens, or bands of kelp tied into knots, or even the Hershey's Kiss-shaped fish balls with gooey orange roe inside, into the soup and forget about them for a while, both the ingredients and the soup will rise to the occasion. Some ingredients, though, you hold in your chopsticks, watching for 30 seconds or a minute until you can see they're ready. The marble tiles of Wagyu rib are in this category, and the New Zealand lamb shaved as thin as prosciutto, and the Kurobuta pork belly from Japan. The whole prawns on wooden skewers will be tender and running with juices in just over a minute. The sweet, small flounder fillets might need twice that. Even if you are careful to pull these bites out in the bubbling center of the pot, away from the oil, the chiles and Sichuan peppercorns will catch up with you sooner or later. They build up on your tongue, they slowly infiltrate your dipping sauce, and the mala tingle will take over. There is no fighting it at that point, of course, though a bowl of white rice is a good investment in the future. And when conversation at the table has stopped completely, when the water you keep pouring into sadistically small cups won't help any more, there is one thing that will: fresh watermelon juice, sold by the carafe.

{"id": 62, "data": " Lately I have fallen under the spell of an East Village restaurant called Foxface . The cooking there is hard to pin down, geographically. Stopping in a few weeks ago, I ate Low Countryish wild red shrimp on grits, with sweet corn off the cob and a potent saffron-lobster sauce. More recently, I had skinless pork sausage inspired by sai ua, the spicy and tangy specialty identified with the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai. The soft tripe I enjoyed the other weekend had been simmered with 'nduja, the fiery and malleable Calabrian sausage, and then covered with a few thin shingles of shaved pecorino. If I had started hanging around at Foxface sooner, especially during the cold months after its opening, in February, I might have run into a wider variety of cuisines and main ingredients. I did manage to get some of the elk osso buco while that was still on the menu. I never got to try the wild hare, though, stewed in red wine with a bit of chocolate and thickened with its own blood, a formula that students of very old-guard French cooking will recognize as lièvre à la royale. Nor did I make it in time for the venison, left to bubble for hours in white wine with mushrooms and dark juniper berries. The Foxface dish I may never forgive myself for missing, though, is the kebabs served with preserved lemons and tahini, because the kebabs were made from ground lamb and camel. Although these foods may lack any unifying cultural background, they did have one thing in common: They were all served on rolls. Apart from an occasional salad or soup, everything cooked at Foxface arrives in sandwich form. And with the exception of a muffuletta that briefly manifested a few months back, every sandwich at Foxface is filled with hot, cooked meat or seafood or vegetables. In Mexico, certain taco stands specialize in tacos de guisado, tortillas filled with one kind of stew or another. Most of Foxface's offerings are, in effect, sandwiches de guisado. Which reminds me of another impressive Foxface sandwich, a magenta and green tangle of cilantro stems and pickled onions pressed into an engagingly tart pile of pork, marinated in sour orange juice and roasted very slowly under a banana leaf in emulation of cochinita pibil from the Yucatán. There is no guarantee that any of these items will be available when you go to Foxface. The menu is printed daily and taped up next to the window on St. Marks Place where most of the business is transacted. Sometimes a new sandwich appears after the printed menu has already been posted, so it will be written out by hand on a card that has in its upper left corner the restaurant's logo, a drawing of an elegant fox in cat's-eye glasses with a cigarette holder in one gloved hand. The sandwiches have names like It's What's 'Nside (for the tripe with 'nduja) or 120 BPM (bison heart with tahini and \"many spices\"). The Smoking Fox is sold every day. It is filled with smoked pork rib the color of a dry rosé, separated from the bones and covered with coleslaw, pickles and a few splashes of habanero-orange vinegar. Your mind, of course, goes either to Memphis or to the McRib , and neither is exactly wrong, but the meat is of a superior grade and is smoked with the attention to timing and nuance that characterizes Foxface's cooking. It's a great sandwich. To place an order, you lean in to the window and speak with Sivan Lahat, who owns and runs Foxface with Ori Kushnir, her partner in life and in sandwiches. They immigrated to New York from Israel almost 20 years ago and have lived here ever since, apart from a brief flirtation with the Midwest and a longer experimental period in Tokyo. While they were in Japan, they operated a pop-up restaurant, which is the closest either of them came to running a food business before opening Foxface. Like the fox in the logo, Ms. Lahat has coppery hair and wears cat's-eye glasses. She prepares the orders in the room behind the window, which measures 48 square feet. Inside the building, under the stairs, Foxface has a second room. Mr. Kushnir thinks it could be as large as 14 square feet. A variety of equipment is stowed in the two rooms, including three induction burners, a roaster, a smoker and a dishwasher. After business hours, some of it comes out as Mr. Kushnir supervises the more time-consuming roasts and stews. He describes the food that he and Ms. Lahat cook as \"dishes we like to eat, reimagined as sandwiches.\" I like to eat a lot of the same dishes, as it happens, but they have been hard to come by lately, especially those shapeless brown stews that are so out of style. Following some of the world's most influential chefs and shamed, perhaps, by the unflattering lenses of a million amateur photographers, restaurants have shifted away from plain and plain-looking cooking. The subtlety and the thrill of plain cooking comes from searing, simmering, reducing, skimming and so on. All the people who own Instant Pots know this, but the segment of the restaurant scene with artistic leanings has forgotten it, focusing instead on plating, arranging six or seven things in some photogenic design and hoping they will cohere. Slapping a roll on it is one way to get a shapeless brown stew ready for its close-up, although it has to be said that on the mean streets of Instagram, an elk osso buco sandwich is no match for a rainbow unicorn ice cream sundae. Because space is at a premium, there is no room to sit and eat your Smoking Fox at Foxface itself. You can, however, take it to a table a few steps away inside an adjoining business called the William Barnacle Tavern . This is a reassuringly gloomy bar that is said to have originated as a speakeasy. Model ships and other nautical paraphernalia are strewn about, references to the rumrunning operation a former owner of the building presided over during Prohibition. (The stairs that Foxface's dishwasher is housed below lead to an exhibition space called the Museum of the American Gangster .) The bar's current owner has resisted some modern conveniences. Most of the lighting at night comes from small candles, and all of the music is provided by old films -- of Irish folk recitals, Cab Calloway concerts -- that run in looping, watery projections on the back wall. All Foxface sandwiches are presented in a trim little white box that can be unfolded into a place mat. You can purchase an Italian fruit soda for $3 from Foxface, or buy alcohol from the tavern. The beer is not expensive, but the specialty of the house is absinthe. Most patrons drink theirs diluted with ice water poured from a four-spigot absinthe fountain at the end of the bar. The bartender will make absinthe cocktails, too, including the one Ernest Hemingway supposedly invented that is just absinthe and Champagne in a big glass . He called it Death in the Afternoon, and it is what I intend to drink if I ever get my hands on that camel sandwich.

{"id": 41, "data": " I can count on Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn to produce certain sensations at every meal. There is the insistent smell of broiled dry-aged steak that hits me the minute I open the door and sometimes sooner, while I'm still outside on the South Williamsburg sidewalk, producing a raised pulse, a quickening of the senses and a restlessness familiar to anyone who has seen a tiger that has just heard the approach of the lunch bucket. There is the hiss of butter and melted tallow as they slide down the hot platter, past the sliced porterhouse or rib steak and their charred bones, to make a pool at one end. The server will spoon some of this sizzling fat over the meat he has just plated, generally with some line like \"Here are your vitamins.\" There is the thunk of a bowl filled with schlag landing on a bare wood table when dessert is served, and soon after, the softer tap-tap-tap of waxy chocolate coins in gold foil dropped one at a time on top of the check. And after I've paid, there is the unshakable sense that I've been scammed. The last sensation was not part of the Peter Luger experience when I started eating there, in the 1990s. I was acutely aware of the cost back then because I would settle the tab by counting out $20 bills; cash was the only way to pay unless you had a Peter Luger credit card. At the end of the night my wallet would be empty. Because a Peter Luger steak made me feel alive in a way that few other things did, I considered this a fair trade, although I could afford it only once a year or so. I don't remember when the doubts began, but they grew over time. Diners who walk in the door eager to hand over literal piles of money aren't greeted; they're processed. A host with a clipboard looks for the name, or writes it down and quotes a waiting time. There is almost always a wait, with or without a reservation, and there is almost always a long line of supplicants against the wall. A kind word or reassuring smile from somebody on staff would help the time pass. The smile never comes. The Department of Motor Vehicles is a block party compared with the line at Peter Luger. [ Sign up for Sam Sifton's Cooking newsletter for recipes, food writing and culinary inspiration. ] The management seems to go out of its way to make things inconvenient. Customers at the bar have to order drinks from the bartender and food from an overworked server on the other side of the bar, and then pay two separate checks and leave two separate tips. And they can't order lunch after 2:30 p.m., even though the bar and the kitchen remain open. Since its last, two-star review in the Times , written by Frank Bruni in 2007, the restaurant has started taking online reservations. It accepts debit cards, too, which is nice. But the credit card you use to buy a cortado at the cafe or a bag of chips at the bodega will still not buy you a meal at Peter Luger. The servers, who once were charmingly brusque, now give the strong impression that these endless demands for food and drink are all that's standing between them and a hard-earned nap. Signals that a customer has a question or request don't get picked up as quickly; the canned jokes about spinach and schlag don't flow as freely. Some things are the same as ever. The shrimp cocktail has always tasted like cold latex dipped in ketchup and horseradish. The steak sauce has always tasted like the same ketchup and horseradish fortified by corn syrup. Although the fries are reasonably crisp, their insides are mealy and bland in a way that fresh-cut potatoes almost certainly would not be. The sole -- yes, I'm the person who ordered the sole at Peter Luger -- was strangely similar: The bread crumbs on top were gold and crunchy, but the fish underneath was dry and almost powdery. Was the Caesar salad always so drippy, the croutons always straight out of a bag, the grated cheese always so white and rubbery? I know there was a time the German fried potatoes were brown and crunchy, because I eagerly ate them each time I went. Now they are mushy, dingy, gray and sometimes cold. I look forward to them the way I look forward to finding a new, irregularly shaped mole. [ Readers respond to the Pete Wells review of Peter Luger .] Lunch one afternoon vividly demonstrated the kitchen's inconsistency: I ordered a burger, medium-rare, at the bar. So had the two people sitting to my right, it turned out. One of them got what we'd all asked for, a midnight-dark crust giving way to an evenly rosy interior so full of juices it looked like it was ready to cry. The other one got a patty that was almost completely brown inside. I got a weird hybrid, a burger whose interior shaded from nearly perfect on one side to gray and hard on the other. The same issue afflicted a medium-rare porterhouse I was served one night: The fillet was ideal but the other side of the T-bone, the strip, ranged from medium-rare to medium-well. I could live with this; big cuts of meat don't always cook evenly. What gnaws at me every time I eat a Luger porterhouse is the realization that it's just another steak, and far from the best New York has to offer. [ Melissa Clark shows you how to cook a steak at home . ] Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, can put a formidable crust on both sides of the cut; Luger caramelizes the top side only, while the underside is barely past raw, as if it had done all its cooking on the hot platter. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, buy beef that is tender, richly marbled and deeply flavorful; at Luger, you get the first two but not the third. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, age that beef to make flavor grow and intensify and double back on itself; dry-aging at Luger still results in a tender steak, but it rarely achieves a hypnotic or compelling or even very interesting one. But those other restaurants are not Peter Luger, as Friedrich Nietzsche might have said. \"When in this essay I declare war upon Wagner,\" Nietzsche wrote in \" The Case of Wagner ,\" \"the last thing I want to do is start a celebration for any other musicians. Other musicians don't count compared to Wagner.\" I could say the same thing about other steakhouses -- compared to Peter Luger, they don't count. Luger is not the city's oldest, but it's the one in which age, tradition, superb beef, blistering heat, an instinctive avoidance of anything fancy and an immensely attractive self-assurance came together to produce something that felt less like a restaurant than an affirmation of life, or at least life as it is lived in New York City. This sounds ridiculously grand. Years ago I thought it was true, though, and so did other people. The restaurant will always have its loyalists. They will laugh away the prices, the $16.95 sliced tomatoes that taste like 1979, the $229.80 porterhouse for four. They will say that nobody goes to Luger for the sole, nobody goes to Luger for the wine, nobody goes to Luger for the salad, nobody goes to Luger for the service. The list goes on, and gets harder to swallow, until you start to wonder who really needs to go to Peter Luger, and start to think the answer is nobody.

{"id": 42, "data": " Over the years, I have eaten many bowls of pasta with clams that have been rewired by a chef who was trying to stand out. But I had not come across one that made as much sense to me as the big, sloshing platters you get at old-line Italian-American clam bars like Randazzo's until tripping into a new Greenwich Village restaurant called Babs this summer. Mind you, virtually the only Italian thing about the tagliatelle with clams at Babs was the tagliatelle. The sauce was a mustard beurre blanc, one of those French sauces that all culinary-school students are supposed to be able to make in their sleep. Mustard beurre blanc is often found providing a decorous yellow veil over a chicken breast or salmon fillet. It is not normally poured over noodles. But, tossed with salty French ham and Manila clams smaller than a thumbprint, it made a strangely exciting bowl of pasta that was much more coherent than it sounds. Once I got to know Babs better, I understood that strange excitement is what it does best. Its chef, Efrén Hernández, has talked about Babs as a European grill, and many of the dishes are seared over hot charcoal, but he has a wider frame of reference than that. He was raised in Southern California by immigrants from Mexico, and Mexican cuisine runs through his menu like an underground stream that sometimes gurgles up to the surface. Mr. Hernández is not particularly interested in fusion, though; as far as I can tell, he likes rubbing cultures together to see what color the sparks will be. See, for example, what the menu calls divorced sea bream, a handsome dish that would be splashed around Instagram even more frequently than it already is if the dining tables were lighted by ceiling pinspots rather than disco-era chrome globes that look as if they were salvaged from Regine's . The bream is split, and one side brushed with a red sauce and the other with a green sauce, before it is grilled over charcoal. The dish is an allusion to the two-tone pescado a la talla served at Contramar in Mexico City, itself derived from huevos divorciados, a breakfast of two fried eggs beneath two contrasting salsas. In Mr. Hernández's kitchen, though, the red adobo at Contramar is replaced by a Catalan romesco, and the parsley salsa becomes a French pistou. But surely the tortilla on its own plate off to one side brings it back to Mexico? Not so fast. According to the menu, it is a taloa, a Basque cornmeal cake that cooks from Bayonne to Bilbao have been griddling for centuries. The taloa at Babs is tender, smooth and floral. Mr. Hernández has been cooking at Babs since it opened in July. He is also the chef at Mimi , a French restaurant a block away that is owned by the same people (Daniel Bennett, his brother Evan, and Louis Levy; they named Babs and Mimi after their grandmothers.) I haven't been back to Mimi since Liz Johnson was the chef . She was aiming for a style that was at once brawny and lavish, and since taking over last year Mr. Hernández has seemed to continue in that vein while bringing his far-ranging curiosity to bear. As they did at Mimi, the owners have planted a small curved bar right by the door at Babs. The cocktails stirred and shaken there are mostly recognizable relatives of classics, like a martini made with two brands of gin. There's something charmingly self-deprecating about a cocktail list that includes Mount Gay and tonic, which seasoned barflies know as one of the drinks you can safely order in dives that don't do anything else right. The wine list, meanwhile, is mostly French and sticks to the old guard; you can tell it's not trying especially hard to be cool by the way it has just one orange wine, lumped in with the sparkling wines. Only the wine geeks will wish for more, but the rest of us might wish there were as many bottles costing around $50 as there are in the $90 range. The numbers on the menu can sneak up on you, too. My $48 lobster was a small creature that couldn't have weighed much more than a pound. The server brightly suggested dunking its tomalley into the smoked potato purée, and I would have tried it if I had found any tomalley. And while I can imagine happily paying $36 for Babs's lamb chops, I'd want them to be served with something more compelling than the cold, underseasoned \"Basque potato salad\" into which some baby sardines had apparently disappeared without a trace. But there is nothing wrong with the charcoal-grilled swordfish with mint salsa verde, fennel and green olives, and if you ordered the chicken andouille this summer you found Mr. Hernández knocking cuisines together again, this time with a corn-and-chanterelles risotto under a slow-burning splash of Calabrian chile oil. He shows how well he can work in small strokes with a layered appetizer of raw sea scallops, sweet potato purée and trout roe, seasoned with a briny and fascinating salsa of chopped cucumbers, seaweed and fermented serrano chiles; or the fried cod cheeks, tender and crunchy over an orange slick of romesco aioli. Mr. Hernández's imagination fights against predictability. A crab salad, for instance, doesn't need to be interesting if it is fresh, but the one at Babs is both. It's seasoned with a gribiche that's full of chopped fresh dill, and then it's piled up in a big beehive on top of a smoked potato pancake. Like many small restaurants these days, Babs doesn't offer many desserts, but the ones it does are far more intriguing than average. A fine apple galette is improved by a grating of Swiss-style cheese from Edelweiss Creamery in Wisconsin and by a drizzle of 20-year-old Pedro Ximénez sherry, thick as syrup and tasting like chocolate and coffee. Why sherry with Swiss cheese? I don't know, but Mr. Hernández does. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 43, "data": " For a long time, the seriousness of a pizzeria could be gauged by a simple yes-or-no question: Did it sell pizza by the slice? The ones that cared the most about upholding traditions, maintaining quality and so on -- like Totonno's , John's of Bleecker Street , Kesté , Lucali , Una Pizza Napoletana -- emphatically did not. Today, we live in the era of the elevated slice joint. Some of them, like Scarr's , grind wheat berries into new flour every day. Many use minuscule quantities of yeast; others abandon commercial yeast altogether in favor of the natural leavening in sourdough starters. There are slice joints that ferment their dough for a day, some that let it bubble away for two days and a few that go in for three days. A new example of the breed, F&F Pizzeria , opened in Brooklyn last week with the help of a baker whose starter dough has traveled internationally and another baker who has decades of experience at the end of a pizza paddle. Among themselves, these new-school pizza makers speak of hydration levels, fermentation periods and digestibility. Many of these slice masters are chasing an ideal version of the foldable, portable triangle sold across linoleum counters in all five boroughs, a search suffused with nostalgia for an era before processed cheese, sweetened sauce and wholesale dough. Others are celebrated for achievements in the square slice, a descendant of the Sicilian, with an airier, less doughy crust; leaders in this style include Corner Slice and Mama's Too . Perhaps the smallest group of all are the bakers who turn their eyes toward Rome, where the slices are rectangular and are known as pizza al taglio. They resemble focaccia more than a $3 slice from Ray's , and it's doubtful that the practitioners of this style even think of themselves as belonging to the elevated-slice movement. But I'd argue that they do belong to it, and that some of the most elevated slices in the area at the moment are the Roman-style ones that Bread and Salt sells inside its bakery and restaurant on Palisade Avenue, up in the Jersey City Heights. At any given time, three to six pizzas sit on the counter. They are oblong and, because they are baked without a pan to shape the dough, they have rounded corners, like a horse track. The crust is noticeably lightweight when you pick it up, an impression that is confirmed by the mouth and, later, the stomach. The interior is honeycombed with air pockets. The underside of each slice is strong enough to carry a relatively heavy load of toppings without bending or collapsing. This structural soundness is key to the pleasure. The toppings on a Bread and Salt slice are not decorations or seasonings, as they often are on round pizza. Each one is the point of its slice: a mix of fresh mushrooms with pepper, parsley and flecks of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano; zucchini shaved into fine threads and showered at the last minute with mint leaves; slices of late-summer red and yellow peppers picked while they still had few faintly bitter streaks of green reaching up their sides; a rough, dark pesto spooned around cherry tomatoes that were roasted until their skins turned black and pulled away from the globes of pulp inside; Concord grapes that blotch the dough with purple like exploded jelly grenades. A chef's hand is at work here, tossing black pepper and rosemary over the grape pizza, adding salt and excellent Sicilian olive oil to the tomato pulp, and hammering basil and hazelnuts for the pesto in a mortar. The hand belongs to Rick Easton, who oversees the pizzas and the nonpizzas and owns the restaurant. He also owned its predecessor, the Bread and Salt that operated in Pittsburgh for all of 2015 plus a few weeks on either side. For a short-lived place, it got a lot of media attention, luring restaurant hunters and recipe gatherers from across the country. By the start of 2016, he had decided to move to New York City. When his first job fell through, he began shopping for a location for Bread and Salt. The real estate market had ideas of its own, as it often does, which is how the incarnation of Bread and Salt that Mr. Easton opened early this summer wound up in New Jersey. In addition to cheaper rents, Jersey City has ordinances that allow customers to show up with bottles of wine or beer and drink them, a handy policy because Bread and Salt's beverage list has nothing more potent than Italian sodas and sparkling water. Each night's menu, written in chalk on a blackboard next to the counter where you order, contains at least as many things that are not pizza as things that are. Generally these other items are modest in size and trattoria-ish in spirit; prepared ahead of time, they need at most five minutes in the oven before a cook will arrange them on a board and carry them to one of the 25 or so seats. I wish the tripe stewed in spicy tomato sauce, the way Romans do it, were available all the time. It is not, but the meatballs almost always are, and they are wonderful, made with enough bread that they are extremely tender in a bright marinara. Another reliable find is a sandwich of some kind, made with plain, untopped pizza. Twice I've had a warm mortadella sandwich there, and both times I was convinced there was no way to improve on it. One dish was denoted on the menu by a single word: beans. I've thought of it nearly every day since, partly because the beans -- scarlet runners -- were perfectly intact but perfectly tender; partly because of the brooding depth they took on from being finished with sweet red peppers that the kitchen dried and fried, an ingredient the Italians call peperoni cruschi; and partly because their broth tasted so good when given a chance to soak into the slice of thick-crusted sourdough bread that came on top. That bread is Mr. Easton's, too. It comes with a lot of things, and it is excellent. Bread and Salt is still settling into New Jersey. Some ingredients may be better when Mr. Easton has had time to infiltrate the local farm scene. In August, when the state was rolling in juicy peaches, he was serving crunchy unripe ones in red wine for dessert. There was also a very strange cantaloupe pudding. By September things were looking up; one day there was a scoop of Tristar strawberry sorbet served with anise-seed-flecked polenta gelato, both made by Superiority Burger. (Mr. Easton is friendly with that restaurant's owner, Brooks Headley , and helped devise the recipe for the focaccia Superiority Burger serves on Fridays.) Although Mr. Easton has a handful of employees, Bread and Salt has some of the blind spots of a one-person operation. It is not the easiest restaurant to communicate with, having an Instagram account but no website or phone. On a recent Sunday, when the restaurant was supposed to open at 1 p.m., a sign on the front door announced that it would be delayed until 1:30. That was the last communiqué; the doors were not unlocked until 2. But Mr. Easton has a singular vision, and it is the reason the food is so compelling.

{"id": 44, "data": " Tsismis is the opposite of a speakeasy. It isn't hiding anything; its glass facade on Orchard Street wants to strike up a conversation so badly that it almost follows you home. The windows are stenciled with cartoon characters and with text-message bubbles that call out in English (\"Hello! New York\"), Spanish (\"que rico!\"), French (\"bon appétit\") and Tagalog (\"masarap,\" for delicious). The language lessons continue on the front door, which gives translations for \"tuloy po kayo\" (welcome) and the restaurant's name (gossip), pronounced chiss-miss. In case you miss all of this, a sandwich board straddles the sidewalk, advertising discounted beer, wine and wings at the bar during happy hour (\"5:thirsty\"). If you accept the facade's invitation to benaquitodits (come here here, a repetitive bit of Tagalog slang), the conversation will continue inside. Tsismis, which opened in June, is a chatty restaurant. At times, when one of the owners pulls up alongside your table and expounds on how the chef's interpretation of the dish you're trying to eat differs from what you might find in the Philippines, you may find yourself eyeing the exit. If you've found your way to the menu's strengths, though, odds are you won't want to go anywhere. Kinilaw, a Filipino ceviche in a piercingly sour calamansi and cane vinegar marinade with a jab of bird's-eye chile, is worth sticking around for, especially on those nights when it's made with bay scallops instead of fish. After that, you might look into the fried pork-and-carrot won tons called pinsec frito (or, as the menu has them, pinsit frito). They are typically folded into triangles, but the ones at Tsismis are twisted into little cones that look like Hershey's kisses, though slightly bigger and golden-brown. Once they stop steaming, you can hold them by the cowlick of fried wrapper at the top and swish them around in the sweet chile sauce. Won tons with the same filling flop around in the soup called pancit molo, although these are boiled. There is almost as much ground pork inside them as outside in the broth, which is thick with garlic and chopped scallions. Even if it's well after 5:thirsty and you're not sitting at the bar, Jappy's wings are worth considering. Jappy is the chef, Jappy Afzelius, and he fries those wings with thinly sliced garlic and sends them out to the dining room with a salsa of raw mangoes, charred onions and chiles. The heat of the salsa will not cause your shirt to burst into flames, but it is hot enough to make your memory of Jappy's wings a lasting one. Mr. Afzelius is a native of the Philippines and a graduate of a cooking academy in Manila, which shipped him off to Paris to intern in one of Alain Ducasse's bistros. The Ducasse masterminds then sent him to work at Benoit in New York, after which he turned up as the sous-chef at a Filipino restaurant in Brooklyn that was best known for its $100 doughnut -- ube-filled, Cristal-frosted and gold-leafed. Happily, nothing at Tsismis approaches that level of look-at-me desperation. Mr. Afzelius's cooking is loose, unfussy and liberated. He tosses tradition under the bus when it suits him. The result is Filipino-American drinking food that tends to be charmingly offhand. From time to time, it can lean toward sloppiness. One night the fried milkfish in pritong isda was so overdone that even topping it with calamansi juice, fish sauce and a crisp, juicy spoonful of marinated chayote on top didn't revive it. A version of adobong manok, which Mr. Afzelius makes as a roasted chicken plus a soy-turmeric sauce rather than an all-in-one stew, would have been more successful if the smoked eggplant hadn't been so undercooked it squeaked. But the grilled eggplant on top of the kare-kare was as soft as warm marrow, and the other vegetables -- crisp green beans, bok choy, enoki mushrooms -- made a refreshing counterpoint to the stewed oxtails in thick peanut sauce. Already pungent with shrimp paste, the kare-kare comes with extra on the side that you can add to your heart's content. As they do at Bad Saint in Washington, probably the country's most talked-about Filipino restaurant, Tsismis makes its laing by simmering local kale, rather than the more traditional taro leaves, in coconut milk. And if this version doesn't have the perspective-altering funk of Bad Saint's, it still draws plenty of depth from the shrimp paste and smoked fish in the milk and the big handful of dried baby shrimp dropped on top. By this point, you will probably want to have a glass in your hand. Housemade calamansi soda sounds lovely, but mine was a little flat and weak. In lieu of hard spirits, sake is the backbone of most of the cocktails. They are typically fleshed out with half a dozen other ingredients -- vermouth, Aperol, artichoke liqueur and bitters, in the case of the A La Bira -- which sound at first as if they had been assembled by walking through a liquor store blindfolded, but which after a closer look reveal a degree of inner logic. If this does not pique your curiosity, the list of wines by the glass is almost long enough to qualify Tsismis as a wine bar, although the choices are not as outré as they are across the street at Wildair . In a city crazy for kakigori , patbingsu and other varieties of flavored snow, Tsismis's halo-halo will probably be an instant hit. Mr. Afzelius has the very good idea of putting coconut sorbet where the shaved ice would usually go; from there he goes to town with coconut jellies and what seems like every fresh fruit he can put his hands on. But discerning collectors of Filipino sweets should note that Tsismis serves excellent silvanas. A silvana is either a shrunken cake or a cookie with big ideas, depending on your perspective. It is made of two cashew meringues that are sandwiched together with buttercream and then painted with more buttercream, which holds cashew crumbs to the outside of the whole package. Once frosted and crumbed, it has to be refrigerated or the buttercream will melt before it gets inside your mouth. No gold leaf adorns the silvanas. It would only get in the way.

{"id": 45, "data": " Last month I had dinner with a friend who lives a thousand miles away and doesn't get to Manhattan as often as he once did. When I asked where he wanted to eat, he answered, a bit wistfully, \"Somewhere that speaks of New York, a city I have lost touch with.\" At first, I looked for a place where we could be in the thick of it all. I thought of Bar Pisellino , that narrow glass sarcophagus run by Rita Sodi and Jody Williams, where you drink your sgroppino standing up between the window along Grove Street and the one along Seventh Avenue. People trickle in, eat some olives and a tuna tramezzino, and head out again. Although it's about the size of a subway car, you get the feeling that if you stayed long enough, you'd eventually see everybody you know. But a restaurant that truly speaks of the place New York has become over the past decade or so would be nearly the opposite of Bar Pisellino. This restaurant would not be in the thick of it all. It would be hushed, sheltered, exclusive, admitting no more than a handful of people at a time. It would protect those people, once they were inside, from crowds spilling in from the street, even from the street itself. It would join the steady march of new tasting counters and omakase hideaways. And it would illustrate the growing ease with which New Yorkers of means can glide through and above the fray, slipping from one cloistered room to another in black cars without touching down. That restaurant would be a lot like Frevo , which has been serving suave, $124 tasting menus with a modern-French sensibility in Greenwich Village for the past four months. Frevo is the work of Franco Sampogna, who is the chef, and Bernardo Silva, the manager. Mr. Sampogna is from Brazil and Mr. Silva comes from Portugal; they met 10 years ago while working in restaurants in France, and quickly decided that one day they would open a restaurant in New York City that would give diners \"that feeling of being in your own secluded safe haven,\" as Mr. Sampogna put it. To get into Frevo, you first need to know that Frevo exists. There's no sign. When you arrive at the correct address, what you see is an art gallery with just enough room on its white walls for the six abstract paintings that hang there fairly close together. The paintings are real paintings made by a real artist, Thomas Labarthe, who goes by Toma-L , but the gallery is not entirely a real gallery. If it were, the young woman who sits there keeping an eye on things would stare blankly ahead when you entered, instead of walking up to you with a smile and reassuring you that, yes, you've come to the right place. Then she reaches behind one of the canvases and it swings out on invisible hinges, leaving in its place a doorway through which you can see, illuminated in a large, dark room, a stainless-steel kitchen and a long, curving counter of polished quartzite. You hop up on one of the 18 padded seats, and the door clicks closed. You are in. When the door opens again, typically not for another half an hour, in will walk another set of people who, like you, knew that the gallery was not a normal gallery. Let's say that the misdirection of the gallery and the secret door do not make these newcomers feel sufficiently insulated from the outside world. Frevo gives them the opportunity to sit at a round chef's table in a back corner around which a curtain can be drawn, as in a hospital room. Much of this comes right out of the neo-speakeasy handbook, although Frevo does throw itself into the act with an unusual level of commitment. The gallery, for instance, installed a new batch of Mr. Labarthe's canvases around Labor Day. But each time I went to Frevo, I stared at that curtain. Nobody ever closed it while I was there, but it still reminded me how easy it is now for some New Yorkers to climb into the treehouse and pull the ladder up behind them. I have to admit, though, that I like Frevo more than I like the version of New York that it brings to mind. The pleasures of this secluded safe haven are real, and Mr. Sampogna's cooking is focused and refined. I haven't been able to get his halibut dish out of my mind, for instance. The fish rests on a thin, crisp platform of fried bread shellacked with a dark mushroom marmalade; this miniature mushroom tart drinks up the flavor of the halibut as it goes, in the oven, from raw to that just-cooked state where its flesh slides apart into thick and almost fluffy white flakes. Alongside the fish are bulbs of melted fennel, their spiced cooking juices boiled down to a bittersweet syrup. Mr. Sampogna's opening salvo often involves quinoa doing something quinoa doesn't usually do, and doing it quite nicely. I liked its freshness when it was used in a salad spooned over a demitasse of creamy hummus; I liked its crunch when it was dehydrated and sprinkled over a few mouthfuls of black lentils topped with glistening orbs of smoked trout roe. A dish from early July brought peas, at the tail end of their season, together with a rich pistachio-tarragon cream and white puffs of coconut mousse: light and charming. I wished Mr. Sampogna had exploited summer produce as sensitively when I went back in August and September. His kitchen is small enough that he could respond to the market day by day, but so far this doesn't seem to interest him. Frevo, at $124 for five courses, is not a huge splurge by New York standards, but servers try to inflate the total by pushing supplements. For $30 you can get Kaluga caviar troweled on to your first course; $20 gets you upgraded to a foie gras torchon instead of the less-thrilling mushrooms with gnocchi; it's $18 for a serving of aged Comté before dessert, and another $30 to have white truffles with the cheese. This tactic is not as grating as it is at Per Se , where the supplements are piled onto a base charge of $355, but it is still a snag in the otherwise smooth hospitality provided by Frevo's small crew of servers and cooks. Everyone I've brought to Frevo has fallen under its spell, which is hard to resist. The music is slinky and sinuous. The room has a nocturnal theatricality; sitting at the counter with darkness behind you facing the spotlighted kitchen can feel like attending an extremely elegant campfire. I still think Frevo is a perfect spot to familiarize yourself with the frictionless New York of 2019. Still, when my out-of-town friend arrived, we had our dinner at Bar Pisellino. We were hungry for a taste of the old chaos. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 46, "data": " Billy Durney, the Brooklyn restaurateur and pitmaster, has been talking for several years about the fried chicken that he planned to bring to Red Hook. At first, there was no reason to doubt him. That the man is comfortable with long time horizons was clear to anyone who watched how patiently he studied the science of indirect heat at his first establishment in the neighborhood, Hometown Bar-B-Que . After Hurricane Sandy flooded streets and knocked out power in the area shortly before the scheduled opening in 2012, he gave away smoked briskets, ribs and shoulders to local residents until electricity was restored almost three weeks later, honing his technique all the while. The years rolled by without a drumstick in sight. But as recently as March, it was still possible to take Mr. Durney at his word when he talked about the star attraction of his nearly completed fried-chicken emporium , to be called Red Hook Tavern. The doors were finally unlocked in July, revealing a row of tables under electrified gas lamps and a row of stools in front of a white-oak bar that looks as if it was built to last at least until Van Brunt Street sinks into the sea. Wearing wallpaper and wainscoting and pressed tin, Red Hook Tavern does a straight-faced impression of a whiskey-simmered New York corner bar of a certain age. The attention to detail was to be expected, given how convincingly Hometown conjures a Texas Hill Country barbecue palace. What was something of a surprise, though, was that chickens were not being fried anywhere on the premises. In fact, Red Hook Tavern's star attraction turned out to be a cheeseburger. To be fair, Mr. Durney probably would not have drummed up much enthusiasm had he gone around telling people he was going to open a bar that served hamburgers. New York has so many of those already that the style they typically serve is a recognized subgenre that George Motz calls \"the New York City pub burger.\" According to Mr. Motz, a filmmaker and author whose work explores all things ground-beef-and-bun-related, the hallmarks of a pub burger are a thicker-than-average patty and a relative lack of adornment. It is the plain, sturdy and hunger-calming burger you get at P.J. Clarke's , JG Melon and Fanelli Cafe in Manhattan and at Donovan's Pub in Queens. Mr. Durney has said that he intends the Red Hook Tavern burger as a homage to the one at Peter Luger Steak House . (You might think that Luger traffics in the style known as the steakhouse burger, but most burger taxonomists agree that what it serves, only at the bar and only at lunch, is a pub burger.) Like Peter Luger, Red Hook Tavern employs a toasted and buttered hard roll with a smattering of sesame seeds -- about as many as the stars you can see in the sky over Manhattan on a very clear night. In both places, the patties are made with some portion of dry-aged prime beef, stand about an inch and a half tall, and possess a dark crust that fills your head with the instinct-triggering aromas and flavors whose creation in browned meat was described by Louis Camille Maillard . There are some minor divergences. At Peter Luger, cheese is optional, while the top and sides of the burger at Red Hook Tavern are tightly wrapped in glossy yellow American cheese by default. A thick cross-section of white onion is laid below the top bun at Luger. At Red Hook Tavern, the onion is stationed below the patty, where it helps keep the bottom bun dry, like a coaster. They give you a half-sour pickle spear and fries, too, which are about the same dimensions. The important difference between the burgers, though, is that lately Peter Luger's have tended to be better in memory than in reality, while the Red Hook Tavern's is, right now, one of the few absolutely mandatory burgers in New York City. The kitchen is overseen by Allison Plumer, a chef who has done most of her cooking in Brooklyn. She has an excellent dry-aged steak -- New York strip, naturally -- impressively browned and served with a small cast-iron skillet full of creamed spinach, a touch so right it may qualify as art. It is the kind of detail that makes Red Hook Tavern something more than a place for the locals to get beer and burgers. Another is the golden chicken gravy with a hint of butterscotch that is ladled into a well in the mashed potatoes that come with the half-chicken, which is advertised as simply pan-roasted, although it has the wonderfully stiff shards of skin you get from weighting down the bird as it cooks. Everybody who has eaten at Red Hook Tavern will tell you to get the country-ham-and-Cheddar croquettes on a creamy pool of whole-grain Dijonnaise. Everybody is right, too. Consensus has also formed around the wedge salad, which is clearly not a wedge, but is still a very fine salad, with blue cheese and a thick, Lugeresque bacon slice flopped over individual leaves of romaine. There is considerably less unanimity about the roasted corn, kernels of which you are supposed to wrap in radicchio that you've first smeared with 'nduja; I'm in the camp that thinks it would be a fine dish for another restaurant. There is no restaurant where I'd be glad to see littlenecks steamed with way too much stale, acrid garlic. Of course, there's no correct amount of stale, acrid garlic, but the kitchen really goes all in. There are two desserts. Both are sundaes . They do not have the thematic inevitability of the creamed spinach, but they're put together with more sophistication than average. The truth is, though, that nothing on the menu gives the burger a real run for its money. What does, or at least equals it as a reason to reserve a table a couple of weeks in advance, is the list of drinks Mr. Durney has put together with Jeff Porter and Kenneth Crum. Mr. Durney's enthusiasm for wines made by small, eccentric producers is on view at Hometown, surely the only place on earth where you can drink Milan Nasterec's skin-fermented Moravian pinot noir alongside a taco filled with a slice of barbecued brisket and, in lieu of salsa, a glowing yellow stripe of queso. Mr. Durney indulges his curiosity more deeply at the tavern. Ten grower Champagnes can be had for under $100 a bottle, and there's a $40 sparkling red from Maryland. Darlings of the nonconformist wine movement such as Radikon , Marcel Lapierre and Frank Cornelissen are all given the space you'd expect, but there are also less familiar names like Subject to Change , a Forestville, Calif., outfit that has the peculiar idea of making a bright-toned, low-alcohol zinfandel-syrah blend and calling it Moon Juice. A small number of brews from Other Half, Folksbier and Threes Brewing, leading lights of the Brooklyn suds scene, are on tap, along with uncredited light and dark ales billed as \"A Tribute To McSorleys Ale House.\" McSorley's, famously, has you buy two mugs at once, which Red Hook Tavern doesn't do. It's less well known that McSorley's serves a burger. Like the one at Luger, it's only available at lunch. It is, of course, a pub burger.

{"id": 47, "data": " There are no roving carts loaded with bamboo steamer baskets at the new Chinese restaurant Hutong , no menu cards to be stamped each time you take a dish of har gow or turnip cake. In fact, dim sum is only a small portion of what the menu offers at Hutong, which opened in Midtown in July. But you would do well to make it a large portion of what you order, because only one or two other restaurants in town can plausibly claim to make dim sum that rivals Hutong's. Where else will you find cooks who have the dexterity to make Wagyu-beef mille-feuilles whose flaky layers of pastry overlap each other by only a few millimeters, like the feathers on a songbird's wing? Who can craft steamed buns that look just like shiitake mushrooms, which happen to be the chief ingredient in their filling? Or who knows the secret that allows the crunchy, chewy, charcoal-black mini-footballs stuffed with pork (in what is known in Sichuan as \"fish-fragrant\" seasoning) to sparkle as if diamond chips had been kneaded into the dough? There is real skill in the kitchen at Hutong. You see it most clearly in the dim sum, but much of the other cooking evinces the kind of discipline, precision and technical mastery that has rarely been seen in this city over the past few decades, to the dismay of eaters who know what Chinese food is capable of. \"While expensive French restaurants in New York can hold their own against many places in Paris, if you want to move beyond steamed dumplings and stir-fries to experience the complexity of Chinese banquet cuisine, the possibilities grow dimmer each year,\" Ruth Reichl wrote in The New York Times in 1998. She gave reasons for the poor showing, including talented chefs being paid more in Hong Kong and China. That is as true as it was 21 years ago, but what has changed is the rise of global Chinese restaurant groups, from the disappointing duck specialist DaDong to the surprisingly solid Hao Noodle outposts and, now, to Hutong. The original Hutong opened in 2003 on the 28th floor of a glass tower overlooking the Hong Kong harbor, but the dining room tries to conjure the atmosphere of Beijing's vanishing premodern alleys, or hutongs, by means of red paper lanterns, carved wooden doors and birdcages. The Manhattan branch makes a different impression. The entrance is on the east side of the circular driveway below the Bloomberg Building between East 58th and 59th Streets. Turn right and you are in a narrow hallway between two soaring glass stacks of wine bottles, every one of them for decorative purposes only. Turn left and you are in a glittering, soaring, hard-edge dining room. The inspiration seems to be Art Deco with a pinch of cocaine; the blue leather banquettes, beveled mirrors and chandeliers of mirror-polished steel could come from the set of a nightclub in some cross between \" Scarface \" and \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\" A guest who has lived in China allowed his eyes to adjust to the glinting light as he looked toward the ceiling, which seemed to be far away. \"It's very … yin,\" he said. Hutong is ostensibly a Northern Chinese restaurant. This is more apparent in Hong Kong than in Manhattan, where the menu has been pruned to about half the size. Lamb, a mainstay in the northern provinces, was represented in August by a single dish, cumin-speckled ribs roasted languorously to a mind-altering tenderness. By the time of my last visit, lamb had ambled off the menu entirely. The most famous preparation from northern China, Peking duck, arrived at my table worse for wear and tear, carved haphazardly, with blobs of unmelted fat clinging to limp skin. The second course, a dark-meat stir-fry to be folded in iceberg lettuce, was more skillfully done, but the sting of paying $84 for a whole duck with uncrisp skin lingered. Much of what hasn't been trimmed from the Hong Kong menu comes from Sichuan. So does Fei Wang, the executive chef of the New York branch, and a native of Chengdu. Most recently seen running the kitchen of the Hutong in London, Mr. Wang weaves chiles -- fresh, dried, roasted, pickled, name it -- into nearly everything. In the dish known as Red Lantern, the whole dried peppers the size of cherries are mostly decorative; fried soft-shell crabs are buried under the chiles in a pan with an arcing bamboo handle, like jelly beans in the plastic grass of an Easter basket. The ground spices on the crabs' shatteringly brittle crust -- lightly sweet and more aromatic than searingly hot -- may remind you of a Chinese rice-cracker snack you grew up on, or it may make you think of Old Bay. Fermented chiles provide an electric buzz, and a modicum of heat, to the steamed halibut that arrives boxed up inside a red bell pepper and sitting on a nest of rice noodles. (The pepper opens into a six-pointed star that gives the dish its name, halibut red star noodles.) Kou shui chicken is nearly submerged in an orange lake of excellent chile oil, although the adroit way the oil is balanced by rice vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger and other flavors is what gives Hutong one of the city's most impressive versions of this traditional cold dish. If Hutong has another appetizer that equals it, I haven't found it yet. I did, however, have a cryptic encounter with a log-cabin stack of okra doused in a sweet wasabi sauce, and an inconclusive rendezvous with some steamed asparagus stalks whose tips were enrobed in white sesame sauce; it was as if somebody had tried to replicate strawberries dipped in white chocolate without access to strawberries or white chocolate. You could attempt to unknot these mysteries. Then again, you could simply begin your meal with dim sum. And then, after picking your way through the chile-besotted main courses, you could end it that way, too. There is a dessert that mimics the shape of a steamed bun, pleated and twisted into a pucker at the top. It is made of white chocolate, the wrapper on this trompe l'oeil bao, and filled with white sesame cream and a core of bittersweet salted caramel. Alongside it is a single scoop of ice cream made from lightly sweetened soy milk. The soy milk is extremely fresh. I don't mean that the carton won't expire for another three weeks; I mean that somebody in the kitchen was squeezing the soybeans shortly before the ice cream was frozen. This is a snack from a Chinese childhood, bread and a glass of milk, and it would be hard, after several courses of spice, to think of anything more welcome.

{"id": 48, "data": " Four summers ago, a young chef named José Luis Chávez began leveraging the poke craze and the salad-bowl trend into a string of fast-casual ceviche bars. He began with a counter in the Gansevoort Market food hall called Mission Ceviche ; there is now another in Canal Street Market and a third is supposed to open in Norwalk, Conn., later this year. At all locations, the stock-in-trade is citrus-marinated raw fish with sweet potatoes and kernels of chubby Andean corn, in both its soft and crunchy forms. This is of course the standard Peruvian formula, but Mr. Chávez had the inspiration of serving his ceviche in a clear plastic bowl over a base of salad, rice or, for a dollar more, quinoa. The supplemental ingredients make a plausible desk lunch out of a dish that some New Yorkers still aren't quite sure what to do with. The surprising thing about Mission Ceviche's salad bowls is that they taste like real Peruvian food. The raw fish is firm and cold and neatly cut up into solid pieces that hold their shape. The leche de tigre marinade in Mr. Chávez's \"ceviche clásico\" is a bright and precise cocktail of lime and rocoto chiles, although you might wish that the rocotos had been applied with a little less restraint. You get a higher-caliber shot of spice, this time from ají amarillo chiles, in the ceviche mixto, a combination of octopus, shrimp and fluke enveloped in a creamy, goldenrod-colored leche de tigre. The clásico is accessorized with sweet potato purée; the mixto gets avocado purée, too. The purées are piped out of pastry bags like buttercream roses on a wedding cake, and they are delicious. When I wandered into the Gansevoort Market location in February, it seemed clear that Mr. Chávez could run an interesting restaurant if he ever decided to put his food into something other than recyclable salad bowls. Then, at the beginning of the summer, he did just that, opening a sit-down restaurant on the Upper East Side with real plates and bowls. The new space is not particularly large or lavish, but compared with the earlier efforts, Mission Ceviche Restaurant & Bar is a palace. There is seating for 65 or so people beneath a wall sculpture of a fish that glows from behind and a pink neon sign that reads \"tiger milk effect,\" probably a reference to the belief that drinking leftover leche de tigre can put extra topspin on sexual performance. The menu now paints a slightly fuller picture of Peruvian cuisine, extending into new foods including the grilled skewers known as anticuchos. Mr. Chávez dresses up the country's most popular anticucho, grilled beef heart, brushing it with a creamy rocoto sauce and serving it with newly fried blue potato chips and kernels of choclo corn. The trio of rocoto, blue potatoes and choclo is so solidly Peruvian that it can withstand the chimichurri that Mr. Chávez brings in, by way of Argentina, as a final touch. He clearly has a soft spot for chimichurri because he deploys it again with the shrimp anticuchos (the shrimp are very big and look even bigger because they're grilled with their heads on), served with a squirt of huancaína, the spicy yellow cheese sauce that is something like Peru's version of queso dip. My favorite anticucho is a more straightforward situation, grilled scallops under arugula, lime zest and a smooth Parmesan fondue. But Mr. Chávez has the ability to put several flavors in motion at once and keep his balance, as evidenced by the beef-heart skewer and his octopus causa. This is, reduced to bare bones, a tendril of octopus curled around a disc of mashed potatoes. But the potatoes, seasoned with lime and yellow chiles, are coated in a smooth lavender-colored sauce made from Peruvian black olives; the octopus has been rubbed with cumin, oregano and ají panca paste and grilled to a crackle; the plate is decorated with a few wobbly curls of paper made with purple Peruvian potatoes. Mission Ceviche's servers, while eager to be helpful, have a habit of singling out the most obvious dishes -- the classic ceviche, the octopus leg -- and pushing them so hard you might suspect the rest of the menu is a minefield. It isn't. There is nothing to avoid unless the kitchen brings back the bizarre strawberry-kiwi ceviche that showed up as a special one night. If you are being herded into getting the \"Peruvian paella,\" you should know that the other three main courses are also worth looking into, like the ají de gallina, shredded chicken breast in a creamy ají amarillo sauce that is both soothing and spicy; or the seco norteño, a slowly braised short rib in cilantro sauce. All are larger than average, too. Still, nothing on the menu quite rivals the ceviches. They are served, yes, without lettuce or rice, and they are better for it. Mr. Chávez's creative engine seems to have a high idle, and he has come up with different ways to present dishes that are also on the menu at the fast-casual counters. The \"Nikkei\" ceviche, for instance -- tuna in a kind of modified ponzu sauce seasoned with ají amarilllo and togarashi -- now comes with watermelon and a bloop of ginger foam that would never survive a trip from the food court back to the office. Neither would the odd but intriguing attempt at a vegetarian ceviche where the fish is replaced by shiitakes and the leche de tigre takes the form of snow, frozen by liquid nitrogen. The art of ceviche-making has at least as much in common with mixology as with cooking, so it is no surprise that the cocktails are well calibrated and sing out with fresh lime. There is a twist on the pisco sour made with passion-fruit juice and another with the purple-corn drink chicha morada, although neither quite achieves the bracing elegance of the original. And it's nice to see the less well-known chilcano, a pisco highball made with lime juice and ginger ale. (Would ginger beer be better?) Chicha morada appears again in the raspadilla dessert. This time it is a syrup poured over shaved ice and sprinkled with lucuma foam. When I had the raspadilla, it was sprinkled with candied pecan crumbs but in a phone interview on Monday Mr. Chávez said he had replaced the nuts with crumbled Oreos.

{"id": 49, "data": " New York is getting crowded with hot pots. The city is not yet in the same league as, say, Chongqing, where the dish is said to have originated and where an association dedicated to keeping track of such things says there are about 50,000 places to eat it. New York, by my count, has a mere two or three dozen, most of them in the sections of Brooklyn, Queens and Lower Manhattan that have considerable Chinese populations. But new hot pot restaurants seem to arrive every few weeks, with some independent operators among a growing number of chains from China. Downtown Flushing, Queens, has Little Sheep Hot Pot , founded in Inner Mongolia and one of the first hot pot purveyors in New York to move beyond the all-you-can-eat model, which led to widespread improvement in ingredient quality; Mister Hotpot, known among the city's pig worshipers for its creamy, ivory-toned pork-bone broth; and Liuyishou Hot Pot , a Chongqing-based concern where the spiced beef tallow that is an essential component of Sichuan hot pot is molded into the shape of a smiling, bow-tied cow. Farther south in Flushing is Niu Pot , the city's best hot pot establishment by several measures, including the number and complexity of its broths. Niu Pot cooks a very good winter-melon soup and serves it inside the melon's hollow shell, although it is most widely known for serving marbled slices of raw beef wrapped tightly around a Barbie doll , like a dress for Lady Gaga . In Manhattan, hot pot outposts have been planted along the Bowery in a line advancing toward Chinatown, starting with Zhen Wei Fang . If there had been a hot pot restaurant in \"Blade Runner,\" it would have looked like Zhen Wei Fang, an import from Miami that has private booths, simultaneous videos projected side by side on the walls and a robot host by the entrance. (Adding to the sense of a future gone awry, the robot wasn't working the last time I went.) A few blocks south is Tang Hotpot , probably the most luxe hot pot in the city. The menu is illustrated with still-life ingredient photographs that look as if Vermeer painted them, and the pictures aren't that far off from reality. Almost all of these emporiums offer Sichuan hot pot, a broth covered in a deep slice of chile oil in which dried red chiles, Sichuan peppercorns and various other spices churn around like the remains of toy sailboats after a hurricane. But Da Long Yi Hot Pot, which opened in May in a second-story space above Canal Street, has the advantage over most of its competitors of having originated in Sichuan. Its home base, from which more than 200 Da Long Yis have issued, is the provincial capital of Chengdu. Chongqing was administratively sheared from the rest of the province in 1997. Although you key your name into a touch pad at the top of the stairs to get on Da Long Yi's waiting list, and you learn that your table is ready from an automated text, you order by penciling an X on the paper menu, in a box next to the item you want. The menu also suggests the length of time each item should be held down in the boiling soup. It goes without saying that you will want a Sichuan hot pot at Da Long Yi. You will be asked whether you want it mild, medium or spicy, although in my experience there isn't much difference. A more important question is whether you will cook your meal in Sichuan broth alone; in a split pot with Sichuan broth on one side and either tomato or mushroom broth, neither of them spicy, on the other; or in a three-chambered pot with some of each. The narrow range of choices can be an advantage for a novice hot potter, who might be swamped by the maximalist menus at Tang or Niu Pot. The split pots make Da Long Yi a good place to take somebody with a low tolerance for heat, although as a practical matter it is impossible to eat a Sichuan hot pot meal without ingesting at least a spoonful or two of chile oil. Old hands know that the oil tends to pool away from the region of the broth that is bubbling most furiously, and ingredients that, after cooking, are removed from the pot in this area will emerge relatively clean. Whether this is desirable varies from eater to eater and from ingredient to ingredient. Deeply furrowed, folded or layered foods -- the Kungfu beef tripe spread out on a mound of chipped ice; the tofu skins; the fried dough sticks known as youtiao or, on Da Long Yi's menu, \"fried bun\" -- retain spicy oil in quantities that may become challenging. Extremely smooth items, like the hard-cooked quail eggs, the rabbit kidneys speared on a toothpick, or the long and surprisingly slippery tubes of duck intestine, on the other hand, can survive a trip through the deepest patch of chile oil without any appreciable damage. You can, if you like, follow the custom of Chengdu or Chongqing by focusing on ingredients that are prized more for feel than flavor. The duck intestines, for instance, which quickly contract in the hot broth and come out about 30 seconds later with the texture of barely cooked squid. Or the pale ivory sheets of flattened artery, which after cooking about twice as long have a long-lasting chew that reminds me of geoduck. On the other hand, more flavorful ingredients, once they've cooked for a few minutes, can help punch up the broths, which aren't quite as deep or complex as they are at some other hot pot providers. This does not apply to the lengths of corn on the cob, which don't taste like anything to begin with. And I would avoid the \"vegetable platter,\" which was more like a lettuce platter. But it is useful to keep in mind that if you toss sliced king oyster mushrooms, or crown daisy greens, or bands of kelp tied into knots, or even the Hershey's Kiss-shaped fish balls with gooey orange roe inside, into the soup and forget about them for a while, both the ingredients and the soup will rise to the occasion. Some ingredients, though, you hold in your chopsticks, watching for 30 seconds or a minute until you can see they're ready. The marble tiles of Wagyu rib are in this category, and the New Zealand lamb shaved as thin as prosciutto, and the Kurobuta pork belly from Japan. The whole prawns on wooden skewers will be tender and running with juices in just over a minute. The sweet, small flounder fillets might need twice that. Even if you are careful to pull these bites out in the bubbling center of the pot, away from the oil, the chiles and Sichuan peppercorns will catch up with you sooner or later. They build up on your tongue, they slowly infiltrate your dipping sauce, and the mala tingle will take over. There is no fighting it at that point, of course, though a bowl of white rice is a good investment in the future. And when conversation at the table has stopped completely, when the water you keep pouring into sadistically small cups won't help any more, there is one thing that will: fresh watermelon juice, sold by the carafe.

{"id": 50, "data": " Lately I have fallen under the spell of an East Village restaurant called Foxface . The cooking there is hard to pin down, geographically. Stopping in a few weeks ago, I ate Low Countryish wild red shrimp on grits, with sweet corn off the cob and a potent saffron-lobster sauce. More recently, I had skinless pork sausage inspired by sai ua, the spicy and tangy specialty identified with the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai. The soft tripe I enjoyed the other weekend had been simmered with 'nduja, the fiery and malleable Calabrian sausage, and then covered with a few thin shingles of shaved pecorino. If I had started hanging around at Foxface sooner, especially during the cold months after its opening, in February, I might have run into a wider variety of cuisines and main ingredients. I did manage to get some of the elk osso buco while that was still on the menu. I never got to try the wild hare, though, stewed in red wine with a bit of chocolate and thickened with its own blood, a formula that students of very old-guard French cooking will recognize as lièvre à la royale. Nor did I make it in time for the venison, left to bubble for hours in white wine with mushrooms and dark juniper berries. The Foxface dish I may never forgive myself for missing, though, is the kebabs served with preserved lemons and tahini, because the kebabs were made from ground lamb and camel. Although these foods may lack any unifying cultural background, they did have one thing in common: They were all served on rolls. Apart from an occasional salad or soup, everything cooked at Foxface arrives in sandwich form. And with the exception of a muffuletta that briefly manifested a few months back, every sandwich at Foxface is filled with hot, cooked meat or seafood or vegetables. In Mexico, certain taco stands specialize in tacos de guisado, tortillas filled with one kind of stew or another. Most of Foxface's offerings are, in effect, sandwiches de guisado. Which reminds me of another impressive Foxface sandwich, a magenta and green tangle of cilantro stems and pickled onions pressed into an engagingly tart pile of pork, marinated in sour orange juice and roasted very slowly under a banana leaf in emulation of cochinita pibil from the Yucatán. There is no guarantee that any of these items will be available when you go to Foxface. The menu is printed daily and taped up next to the window on St. Marks Place where most of the business is transacted. Sometimes a new sandwich appears after the printed menu has already been posted, so it will be written out by hand on a card that has in its upper left corner the restaurant's logo, a drawing of an elegant fox in cat's-eye glasses with a cigarette holder in one gloved hand. The sandwiches have names like It's What's 'Nside (for the tripe with 'nduja) or 120 BPM (bison heart with tahini and \"many spices\"). The Smoking Fox is sold every day. It is filled with smoked pork rib the color of a dry rosé, separated from the bones and covered with coleslaw, pickles and a few splashes of habanero-orange vinegar. Your mind, of course, goes either to Memphis or to the McRib , and neither is exactly wrong, but the meat is of a superior grade and is smoked with the attention to timing and nuance that characterizes Foxface's cooking. It's a great sandwich. To place an order, you lean in to the window and speak with Sivan Lahat, who owns and runs Foxface with Ori Kushnir, her partner in life and in sandwiches. They immigrated to New York from Israel almost 20 years ago and have lived here ever since, apart from a brief flirtation with the Midwest and a longer experimental period in Tokyo. While they were in Japan, they operated a pop-up restaurant, which is the closest either of them came to running a food business before opening Foxface. Like the fox in the logo, Ms. Lahat has coppery hair and wears cat's-eye glasses. She prepares the orders in the room behind the window, which measures 48 square feet. Inside the building, under the stairs, Foxface has a second room. Mr. Kushnir thinks it could be as large as 14 square feet. A variety of equipment is stowed in the two rooms, including three induction burners, a roaster, a smoker and a dishwasher. After business hours, some of it comes out as Mr. Kushnir supervises the more time-consuming roasts and stews. He describes the food that he and Ms. Lahat cook as \"dishes we like to eat, reimagined as sandwiches.\" I like to eat a lot of the same dishes, as it happens, but they have been hard to come by lately, especially those shapeless brown stews that are so out of style. Following some of the world's most influential chefs and shamed, perhaps, by the unflattering lenses of a million amateur photographers, restaurants have shifted away from plain and plain-looking cooking. The subtlety and the thrill of plain cooking comes from searing, simmering, reducing, skimming and so on. All the people who own Instant Pots know this, but the segment of the restaurant scene with artistic leanings has forgotten it, focusing instead on plating, arranging six or seven things in some photogenic design and hoping they will cohere. Slapping a roll on it is one way to get a shapeless brown stew ready for its close-up, although it has to be said that on the mean streets of Instagram, an elk osso buco sandwich is no match for a rainbow unicorn ice cream sundae. Because space is at a premium, there is no room to sit and eat your Smoking Fox at Foxface itself. You can, however, take it to a table a few steps away inside an adjoining business called the William Barnacle Tavern . This is a reassuringly gloomy bar that is said to have originated as a speakeasy. Model ships and other nautical paraphernalia are strewn about, references to the rumrunning operation a former owner of the building presided over during Prohibition. (The stairs that Foxface's dishwasher is housed below lead to an exhibition space called the Museum of the American Gangster .) The bar's current owner has resisted some modern conveniences. Most of the lighting at night comes from small candles, and all of the music is provided by old films -- of Irish folk recitals, Cab Calloway concerts -- that run in looping, watery projections on the back wall. All Foxface sandwiches are presented in a trim little white box that can be unfolded into a place mat. You can purchase an Italian fruit soda for $3 from Foxface, or buy alcohol from the tavern. The beer is not expensive, but the specialty of the house is absinthe. Most patrons drink theirs diluted with ice water poured from a four-spigot absinthe fountain at the end of the bar. The bartender will make absinthe cocktails, too, including the one Ernest Hemingway supposedly invented that is just absinthe and Champagne in a big glass .

{"id": 51, "data": " Some restaurants push their tasting menus. Rezdôra doesn't. A few steps down from the sidewalk, on the same block of East 20th Street as Gramercy Tavern and the brownstone where Teddy Roosevelt was born, Rezdôra lists a \"regional pasta tasting\" for $90 on its menu. The region in question is Emilia-Romagna, whose refinements in the art of rolling and saucing noodles are admired even by Italians from other parts of the country. Chances are that most of the five pastas in the tasting are exactly the ones you picture when you think about Emilia-Romagna, starting with tortellini in brodo. This would seem to make it an easy sell, and yet servers at Rezdôra never tried to sell me on the tasting. Until I asked about it one night, I had never seen the separate menu card that describes each course. With some hesitation, I ordered it. Every one of the pastas was excellent, and one or two would be worth walking a long distance for. After the fifth course was gone, it slowly dawned on me that Stefano Secchi, Rezdôra's chef and one of its owners, had just laid down a straight flush. The tortellini were penny-size hoops rolled around minced and blended pork in a parcel just big enough to suggest the idea of meat. \"This is a special broth made from older chickens,\" a server said as he poured a steaming liquid from a kettle over the tortellini. It was the color of turkey gravy. The broth spent about half a day on the burner; drew some of its power from melted Parmigiano-Reggiano; and was more intense than canned chicken broth in roughly the same way that a dry-aged rib-eye is more intense than a McDonald's all-beef patty. This was followed by a smooth, almost fluffy tomato-basil sauce over maccheroni al pettine, delicate tubes with ridges they get from being rolled by hand along a comb made for the job. Three straw-colored blobs that looked like melted Brie turned out to be a glossy and wonderful fonduta made from Parmigiano-Reggiano. From there it was on to tortelloni, each about three bites big, filled with plush fresh ricotta and shiny with melted brown butter in which a few sage leaves had been bubbled. If we are talking about Emilia-Romagna we have to talk about ragù, and that was the next course, tossed with slim ribbons of tagliolini. Some people will find the ragù saltier than they like. Almost everyone will find it more tender and smooth than the last 20 or 30 ragús they ate. The tour winds down with round, meat-filled anolini, a branch of the ravioli family that resides in Parma. They are served in something called crema di Parmigiano; you will not be far off if you imagine an Alfredo sauce cooked for one of the more sybaritic Roman emperors. This is not Rome, though, and the sauce gets the tart counterpoint it needs from an inky, 25-year-old balsamic vinegar poured straight from the bottle. Mr. Secchi blew into town in May on a small gust of publicity whipped up over his time at Osteria Francescana , the Modena workshop where Massimo Bottura reconfigures the touchstone flavors of the region in dishes with names like \"memories of a mortadella sandwich.\" Mr. Bottura's approach to menu writing seems to have rubbed off on Mr. Secchi more than his experimental urges did. At Rezdôra, you are unlikely to catch the kitchen using any overtly modernist techniques, but you may well encounter \"cherry season in Vignola,\" a pleasant if somewhat too soupy plate of stracciatella with toasted almonds, almond milk and cherries both sweet and sour; or \"cow grazing in Emilia-Romagna,\" a sirloin basted with butter whose richness is modulated by a sauce of sweet red peppers; or \"Grandma walking through forest in Emilia,\" a transfixing plate of mushroom purée, slivered snap-pea pods and little hats of spinach pasta filled with braised leeks. If we are tracing influences, though, Mr. Secchi's cooking at Rezdôra seems to have been molded at least as deeply by his time working at the pasta station of another restaurant in Modena, Hosteria Giusti . Laura Galli Morandi, Giusti's chef, steadfastly defends the style of the local nonna tradition that Mr. Secchi channels in his pasta tasting and other parts of his menu. Like a meal in Giusti's four-table dining room, one at Rezdôra can and probably should start with prosciutto and other manifestations of salted pork draped over warm pillows of fried dough called gnocchi fritti. Before leaving Italy, Mr. Secchi also cooked at Antica Moka in Modena and All'Enoteca in the Piedmont; after coming back home to Dallas, where he grew up, he ran the kitchens of two restaurants his parents own there. Still, I suspect the Bottura connection is responsible for the speed with which the bar stools fill up when the restaurant opens at 5:30 each night, for the difficulty of reserving one of the other 48 seats, and for the way would-be customers collect in eddies outside the door to strategize. Not much about the interior is likely to lure crowds; with its brick walls, timbered ceiling and bare wood tables, it looks like any number of Manhattan restaurants that emulate the trattorias, enotecas and osterias of Italy. And of course, people who eat at Rezdôra have a way of becoming repeat customers. They come back even though it is still a young restaurant and occasionally makes a young restaurant's mistakes. One night, the stewed cannellini beans placed alongside black sea bass and black garlic zabaglione were still crunchy; the rock shrimp served with strozzapreti could have been a little less tough and tasted a little shrimpier. And some of the original pastas aren't quite as stunning as the classics, but then every grandmother in Emilia-Romagna could have told you that. Mr. Secchi is still one of the most appealing new talents in years to enter the city's Italian restaurant scene, the kind of cook who can unite ordinary people who just like to eat pasta and the fanatics who collect menus from Osteria Francescana. (The date-stamped copy of the regional tasting menu that's given out at the end of the night, signed by Mr. Secchi and his kitchen crew, must be for this crowd.) He also has the good luck to come along when some of the figures who dominated New York's Italian landscape for the past two decades or so have either disappeared or gone into hibernation. There is one more workplace that I hope has left a mark on Mr. Secchi: his parents' restaurants in Texas, both of which are called Ferrari's Italian Villa & Chop House . The first has been in business since 1983, a life span that any restaurateur would envy. The odds are against Rezdôra's being around 36 years from now, but Mr. Secchi and his business partner have made one move that tends to be associated with longevity in New York restaurants. They bought the building. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 52, "data": " In the fall of 1980, Patrick Clark, the first chef at Keith McNally's first restaurant, the Odeon , helped introduce nouvelle cuisine to New York when it was all the rage in Europe. Nearly every place Mr. McNally has built since then has been a firm rejection of all that is fashionable in food, and each one has been, at least in its first few months, the most fashionable restaurant in town. The one he opened in early June in the meatpacking district, Pastis , was assembled partly from the salvaged bones of a nearby restaurant he closed five years ago, Pastis. (He salvaged the name, too.) The onion soup, the meaty snails sloshing around in the divots of a black iron snail pan with what must be half a pint of garlic butter, and a few other old war horses from the original menu have been summoned for one more joust on the battlefield. In short, the new Pastis takes almost everything straight from the old Pastis , which in turn took almost everything from the stodgiest, least trend-conscious sort of French cafes and brasseries. Needless to say, reservations are harder to come by than at any other New York restaurant that's opened this year. The paradox of this is that Pastis is really meant for those nights when you decide to cancel your reservations at the little nine-seat tasting counter where the menu is inspired by Kieslowski's \"Decalogue.\" It is for those times when you get an urge to eat a Gruyère omelet after 10 p.m., cooked medium-rare, flecked with herbs, skillfully rolled and staunchly backed up by a cold white from the Savoie. Urges like that do not typically announce themselves three weeks in advance, and they don't tend to survive exposure to rooms filled with people who have read about Pastis on the blogs but haven't yet figured out what it is for. For much of his life, Mr. McNally has been chipping, cracking, distressing and weathering interiors that are the architectural equivalent of rumpled sweaters two sizes too large. Perhaps the largest and certainly the most rumpled of all is Pastis. It doesn't have the corner entrance it had at its former address, or the long communal table that sliced through the front room like a surfboard. And the shelves of cigarette packs are definitely gone. ( You could still smoke in restaurants in 1999, when Pastis opened.) But the magazine racks are back, along with the overhead fans turning steadily below a stamped tin ceiling. Once again the walls are covered with chipped subway tiles, white, framed by black grout. The chairs still don't match. The ambient light is the color of a Scotch and soda and makes everybody look the way they do after you've drunk one. On an antique mirror, or one that looks like an antique, someone has scrawled a menu of desserts, almost none of which Pastis actually serves. You can, however, get an energetically whisked dark-chocolate mousse under shaved curls of chocolate, or a baba au rhum so drenched in booze that it might spontaneously combust if it weren't being restrained by a white dune of whipped Chantilly cream. The most significant change from the first Pastis to the second happened offstage. Mr. McNally, who had a stroke two years ago, has brought on the restaurateur Stephen Starr as a partner who, essentially, manages everything except the design. Familiar faces from La Mercerie and other Starr enterprises work alongside loyal retainers from the McNally empire. The McNally troops are exquisitely poised, self-assured, able to spot a misplaced butter knife from across the street. The Starr cadre is more casual, and occasionally a server will ask your opinion of \"the flavors so far,\" a question that has surely never been uttered at Minetta Tavern . Mr. Starr has oversight of the wine list, which is less conservative than a typical McNally lineup, and of the food, which has not been a strong suit of the McNally organization since the chefs Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr went out on their own. Pastis's chef, Michael Abt, was until recently in charge of the kitchen at the Washington restaurant Le Diplomate , which Mr. Starr owns. Better qualifications would be hard to conjure, given that Le Diplomate is essentially an imitation McNally restaurant. Taking his cues from the old days, Mr. Abt is putting out simple, unadorned, hunger-obliterating French cuisine drawn from the era before supermarkets and fast food. The salad of pickled herring and carrots with boiled potatoes might come straight from Brasserie Lipp . The country pâté is laden with chicken livers and riddled with soft white pork fat in gobs the size of gumdrops, although it could stand more salt, and I'd be happy to trade the slab of butter that comes with it for a pot of mustard. The pâté is made in house, as is the gorgeously smooth boudin blanc. With the boudin, you want puréed potatoes that are almost liquid. That is what you get. You might argue that, when it offers chilled king crab legs to be dipped in aioli, this unextravagant cafe breaks character. Does the same apply to garnishing sardines served in the can with an ingot of prized, costly butter made by Jean-Yves Bordier? Maybe. I thought, in any case, that the sardines and the olive oil they are packed in tended to talk over the butter. The half roast chicken is not in the same class as the birds that Antoine Westermann cooked when he was still at Le Coq Rico , but it is probably as good a roast chicken as any normal restaurant can produce. The duck in olives, though, is misconceived; the sauce is thin, acrid and one-dimensional instead of head-spinningly rich, the way it is at Allard in Paris . The seafood -- the trout amandine with its sautéed skin taut beneath its armor of toasted almonds; steamed mussels in a lemon broth that's satiny with melted butter; an entire steamed branzino with enough crisp summer vegetables to make a salad -- is very appealing, though that won't stop the people who are going to get steak frites without even a glance at the menu. Those people may get fries that are crunchy and golden, or they might end up with a limp, oily batch, or they may get both in the same night, as I did. At the length of 20 years, memories are untrustworthy, but I'm reasonably sure the food at Pastis is better than it used to be. The wine is certainly more interesting. What's gone, and won't be back now that the surrounding addresses have been taken over by shops like Loro Piana, Sephora, Hermès and RH, is the pure downtown electricity Pastis once generated. Sharing real estate with meat cutters in blood-smeared aprons and prostitutes in dresses as tight as the skins on a boudin blanc, Pastis did a drop-dead perfect imitation of the coolest restaurant in France. The French part was fake, but the cool was real. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 53, "data": " The high cost of doing business in New York takes a toll on many restaurants in the long run, but it can also lead to compromises whose shortcomings become part of the fun -- for diners, at least. If Darryl and Melissa Burnette had been able to afford to rent a space bigger than 275 square feet for their restaurant, Belle Harlem , Mr. Burnette might do the cooking behind a wall instead of behind a counter. Ms. Burnette, his wife and business partner, might spend all night going in and out a swinging kitchen door instead of paying attention to the customers sitting at the 12 seats in the restaurant's single room. At this point, after three years in business, Belle Harlem might be run by employees, and the Burnettes might come in a few times a week to keep an eye on things. Instead they have a paid staff of one. His name is Alex Geudelekian. He was eating dinner there one night, noticed that the weeds were growing up around Mr. Burnette's ankles, asked if he needed help, and has been the sous-chef ever since. The smell of foie gras gravy with duck breast being seared on one of the three induction burners might not rush up to meet you when you step through the door, on the opposite side of Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard from Striver's Row. You might not hear the hiss of chicken being fried inside buttermilk batter before it is arranged between standing partitions of pizzelle and tied together by an amber river of truffled maple syrup warmed with jalapeños and bananas. If you didn't hear the low roar of a Searzall torch as it warms a plate and then melts and browns a patch of Cheddar, you might not know that you're about to be served Mr. Burnette's cheese-steak crostini. (These are small toasts stacked with seared filet and melted cheese, and in between are onions that have been caramelized until they're sweet enough to be a dessert topping. The Cheddar would cause every Philadelphian who lives within 10 blocks of East Passyunk Avenue to pick up the nearest blunt object, but it makes a certain amount of sense when you taste it.) Some of Belle Harlem's space limitations are, in fact, a little constricting. When the place is full, some customers have to ride sidesaddle, their knees angled away from the counter, because if they faced it head-on they'd cut off the narrow path to the restroom in the back. But 275 square feet are what the Burnettes have to work with, and they have made this shallow sliver into something rare not just in Harlem but in all Manhattan. One of the peculiarities of dining in the city, circa 2019, is that the more high-functioning a restaurant is, the less likely you are to encounter a proprietor. There are exceptions, of course, but often the most successful restaurateurs are very busy people, so they leave their dining rooms in the hands of professional managers. Proprietors aren't always as smooth as professionals, but they are as attuned to what goes on in their dining rooms as new parents are to the noises coming from a bassinet. I never quite felt as if I were attending a dinner party in the Burnettes' apartment, which is the feeling they say they're going for, but I always knew I was in a place that somebody cared about. Their original plan was to feed everyone the same meal -- a tasting menu. \"We found out pretty quickly Harlem wasn't ready,\" Mr. Burnette said in an interview. How quickly? \"We tried one night.\" Belle Harlem rolled out an à la carte menu the next day. It stuck. The first half is given to smaller plates, although one of the hallmarks of the restaurant is that the Burnettes don't serve anything truly small. They want you to eat. Two people could get away with ordering one main course and two appetizers, though I'd urge anyone going to Belle Harlem not to overlook dessert. These introductory dishes are where Mr. Burnette takes casual American vernacular food like chicken and waffles out for a stroll. His fried chicken has a convoluted, frilly crust, with plenty of golden surface area for the jalapeño-banana syrup to get lost in. The pizzelles are a new idea of his, replacing the regular waffles he used to make, and they work best when he cooks them to a dark crisp. This is also where you'll find the cheese-steak crostini, as well as spring rolls stuffed with macaroni and cheese -- kid food in a fried shell, yes, but a bacon marmalade with fresh dill makes it unexpectedly complex, a chef's dish. The bottom of the menu is more substantial: The pan-seared, smoked pork tenderloin, for instance, is bigger than what usually crosses a 12-seat tasting counter. This month, Mr. Burnette is laying the barrels of pork over a cherry compote with basil leaves, with a few snap peas for added sweetness. He brings a keen sense of what to do with ingredients as they come into season to the vegetables he grows on the roof of the Burnettes' apartment building, a block away. The tiny yields of an urban garden wouldn't satisfy a larger restaurant, but they can shuffle right onto the menu at Belle Harlem, and shuffle off again when they're all gone. This month, there are thin bands of zucchini under the beef tenderloin, and young, soft favas around the lobster salad. There are more favas over pan-seared dorade and garden chives, with the almost transparently thin noodles tossed with butter and cream and tucked under the fish fillet. Mr. Burnette, who is black and who grew up in rural southwestern Virginia, has said he worked up the nerve to move north for culinary school after seeing the chef Marcus Samuelsson on television . (\"I thought, hell, if he could do it, I could do it, too.\") Sometimes today, in his restaurant less than a mile away from Mr. Samuelsson's Red Rooster Harlem , he reaches back to his childhood for ideas. A dessert in a glass called the Triflin' Ho-Ho is an acknowledged homage to Hostess cakes, although there is an English trifle in the mix, too, as well as a trace of Spice Market , where Mr. Burnette once worked. The chocolate in the broken shards of cake pulses, intriguingly, with Urfa pepper; its heat rubs up against the passion-fruit cream, brandied cherries and whipped cream that fill the glass. A year ago, Belle Harlem eliminated tips and raised prices. If you take that into account, check totals can still seem high, especially if you happen to be served pale, limp housemade potato chips or a $42 duck breast with a bitter arugula sauce and a poached pear that tastes like alcohol. The margins must be tight. At times you almost hear them squeak, as when Ms. Burnette anxiously reminds you that you were a few minutes late and suggests you order quickly so she can turn the seat in time for the next reservation. A professional manager might have brought a more soothing manner to the exchange. But a manager might not be as genuinely happy to see a party of three walk in without a reservation just when three seats had opened up, and might not smile as widely when told that the sparkling rosé is fantastic with the lobster salad, and would she mind pouring another glass? No, she doesn't mind at all. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 54, "data": " Sooner or later, those of us who follow the career of Jean-Georges Vongerichten reach a point where our memories can't keep up. The tuna tartares start to run together; we can't recall whether it's served in lettuce cups with threads of shiso at Perry St. or at JoJo . At some point it's hard to recall what makes the chicken breast inside a resoundingly crunchy Parmesan crust at Nougatine different from the Parmesan-crusted chicken at the Mark. With his partner, Phil Suarez, Mr. Vongerichten has founded scores of new restaurants around the world. Nearly 40 of them are still up and running, 15 in New York. Devising menus for each new place, he repeats himself occasionally, but more often he rearranges old patterns. Lime juice is traded for yuzu, cherry vinegar comes in for balsamic. Almost always, the result is a dish that is similar enough to his past work to be recognizably Vongerichtenesque but different enough to seem fresh. Maybe he can keep track of it in his head, but for the rest of us it would be really useful to have a family tree of every dish he ever invented, with its parentage and offspring. Something like 23andMe , it could tell you which strands of kitchen DNA are shared by which Vongerichten restaurants -- 23andV. This service would come in handy in times like the present, when critics and superfans are trying to metabolize the two restaurants Mr. Vongerichten opened in New York City during a single week in May. One is the Paris Café , a casual, all-day proposition inside Eero Saarinen's T.W.A. terminal at Kennedy International Airport, now gloriously resurrected as the TWA Hotel. The second is a polished seafood house that sits out in the East River on the end of Pier 17, next to the wreck of the old Fulton Fish Market; it's called the Fulton . Because I've been to both so recently, I can report confidently that the Fulton slices deep-red strawberries over strawberry ice cream and a sorbet made from strawberries and red wine to make its strawberry sundae, while the one at the Paris Café substitutes dried strawberries. That version isn't bad, but there is an undeniable difference between fresh summer berries and dehydrated ones, and that difference suggests the quality gap between the two restaurants. The best reasons to go to the Paris Café are Saarinen's glass walls, gliding curves and suspended catwalk, although the dining areas are swell, too, smartly evoking Raymond Loewy's original design for the space, which looked like a coffee shop on the moon. The place has some likable pizzas and salads, and it vaults clear over the other restaurants at the airport. But the recipes seem designed not to push the kitchen too hard, the menu is even more Vongerichtenesque than usual, and any dishes involving fruits or vegetables will make you wonder whether the produce truck drove to La Guardia instead. The Fulton, though, is a grown-up production. Under the day-to-day command of Noah Poses, the executive chef, it is easily the best seafood restaurant to open in Manhattan since the Pool , and easier to afford. Yes, a handful of items on the menu have that glassy-eyed stare, but almost everything else comes through. To get to the Fulton, you have to walk almost all the way to the end of the pier, where some tall planters cordon off the Fulton's outdoor tables. All the tables, indoors and out, have a view of the Brooklyn Bridge, but the best backdrops are inside and upstairs, where you can see that you're surrounded by water. Mentioning the view as a selling point will make some New Yorkers cringe. But Pier 17's developer, clearly hoping to erase the stigma, has recruited David Chang, Andrew Carmellini and Mr. Vongerichten. Day trippers and tourists will love the Fulton, in any case, and they will be right. True, the outdoor patio feels like the beachside bar of some island resort, with soft-core club music playing and servers carrying too-small trays slinking around in long skirts. Once you get inside, though, the tension in the open kitchen lets you know this is, in fact, New York. Running a seafood house gives Mr. Vongerichten an opening to lead with one of his strong suits, raw fish. The sea trout tartare is stirred with raw oysters and horseradish, which creates the uncanny momentary illusion that you're eating beef. White ponzu, made from white soy sauce, is the centerpiece of a platter of iced sashimi. Local fluke, taking a bath in habanero vinaigrette, is topped with mint and Sichuan buttons; even if you know what's coming -- Sichuan buttons are the flower buds of the toothache plant, which when chewed, produce a numbing and cooling sensation -- the dish is a surprise. The Fulton's Manhattan clam chowder is spicy, thick with potatoes and a healthy portion of clams. It's the rare version that tastes as good as it sounds, although purists will deduct one point for the absence of oyster crackers. There's a very intriguing sesame-poppy crust on the soft-shell crabs; you have just enough time to register the seeds before a potent green salsa of coriander and jalapeño kicks in. Few chefs are as skilled at using acidity, heat and salt to bring definition to a dish. So it's a surprise to realize how generic the Fulton's fish stew is, or to wonder what the ingredient is that throws the red snapper ceviche in watermelon juice out of whack. A separate menu card lets you know that most of the seafood in the main courses can be ordered \"simply cooked.\" I was never curious enough to try it, being too distracted by the salmon in a cumin-coriander seed crust so fragrant it turns heads; the sea bass and carrots in a life-affirming pool of lemon-turmeric sauce; and the detailed-oriented fish and crisps, a brick of flounder kept at scalding temperature by a leakproof and supernaturally crunchy buckwheat batter. Served with mashed fresh peas, it could almost pass for English if it didn't come with saffron aioli. Most distracting of all is the whole black bass baked inside a fish-shaped pastry lavishly decorated with golden scales, fins, gills and other parts the bass itself won't be needing anymore. It takes a good 10 minutes to unveil it, fillet it and then plate it together with slices of crust, some tomato concassé and a sauce choron, and I doubt many movies playing in theaters now can rival it for entertainment. Wonderful as it is to see one of the showpieces of pre-nouvelle cuisine given so much attention, you could ask whether whole fish en croute really makes sense after, say, kale salad. Mr. Vongerichten's technical approach may let him generate a menu full of smart, reliably pleasurable food, but it doesn't guarantee that it will all hang together. The pastry menu does, though, by sneakily staying true to classic American desserts. What's sold as Meyer lemon pudding turns out to be more like a lemon meringue tart with a quick, pulsing acidity; the apricot pie is more like a crisp, with oatmeal streusel on top; and the highlight of the strawberry sundae isn't the fresh fruit but the strawberry ice cream, its flavor straight out of the summertime ice cream shacks in a thousand vacation towns.

{"id": 55, "data": " \"Does the sheep's head soup have a lot of stuff in it?\" I asked my server. Realizing that this was somewhat ambiguous, especially applied to a dish as laden with stuff as the brew of lambs' snouts, ears, tongues, cheeks and eyeballs known in Turkey as kelle paca, I tried again. \"Is it very filling, I mean?\" My concern was a familiar one, to me at least. I was in Queens, at a new Turkish restaurant in Astoria called Lokanta , and the menu was so appealing that I wanted to try it all. Already I was set on a few bourekas, some labneh, the fava dip and some form of braised lamb over eggplant. I'd spotted another three or four dishes that I was probably going to tack on at the end of my order, as if by afterthought. I suspected that I could add a small bowl of kelle paca and still eat everything else. But a big bowl, one so thick with bits formerly affixed to a sheep's skull that a spoon would stand up in it, might tip the scale. The server pondered this for a while until a wiry man got up from his marble-topped table in the corner and conferred with her. Wearing baggy jeans, a white T-shirt and a baseball cap that kept his zinc-colored ponytail in place, he looked like a contractor, maybe a painter who'd come by to touch up the moldings and had been invited to stay for a Turkish coffee. Then he spoke to us about the sheep's head soup. \"I am a genius,\" he began. \"And even I don't know how to answer this question. I think that the question must be wrong.\" As those who chase the scent of lamb and charred eggplant around the city have probably guessed, this was no contractor. This was Orhan Yegen, the Turkish-born chef and restaurateur who has opened close to 20 Turkish restaurants over the past two decades or so while keeping up a running monologue that made him a favorite of food writers . In 2004, Mr. Yegen opened Sip Sak in Turtle Bay, then proceeded to surprise those who had charted his career by embarking on a long, stable period . All was quiet, relatively speaking, until April, when Lokanta arrived in Astoria to supplement the Greek and Cypriot menus along its stretch of Broadway, and Mr. Yegen arrived to tell customers that their questions were wrong. The kelle paca colloquy ended when I agreed to order it. After hours on the stove, the meat on the head had fallen away into about eight different textures, from frilly to ropy to collagenously chewy to tender and lean. All of this suspended in a slippery, almost sticky broth the color of cappuccino. And no, it was not too filling. Soups, braises, stews and other recipes requiring plenty of time and even more olive oil are the basis of Mr. Yegen's reputation. They set his menus apart from those at other Turkish restaurants around town, which tend to revolve around the grill. Lokanta makes very fine kofte, but for a full medley of minced and skewered meats, you are better off under the swaying chandeliers of Taci's Beyti on Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn. Lokanta will grill or roast a whole fish, but it will not be all that different from what might be served in Brooklyn at Liman , where your bass will be filleted within view of the fishing boats and swans of Sheepshead Bay. Diners in Lokanta's custody have signed on for a more nuanced view of the Turkish kitchen. Take, for instance, the shadings that lamb takes on. In hunkar begendi, chunks of it are stewed in tomatoes and peppers and ladled over an eggplant mash beaten to a memorable richness with cheese and milk. Ali nazik is, in schematic form, the same thing, built on the same foundation of milky eggplant, but in Lokanta's version the lamb is ground and simmered with onions and red and green peppers; somehow it achieves a rich, unctuous consistency that is amplified by the eggplant and the scoop of strained yogurt dropped on top. Lokanta's \"roasted lamb and rice\" is in the pilaf family, which means that the rice is not just a side dish but the heart of the recipe, baked until alluringly sweet with currants, allspice and cinnamon, then sprinkled with fresh dill at the last minute. The lamb's job is to be obligingly tender, and it succeeds, one reason the dish is requested by so many tables. To fend off boredom, I imagine, Mr. Yegen fills his manti with both lamb and beef. Each little dumpling is rolled by fingertip and is roughly the size of one. The meat has been seasoned just forcefully enough that it will announce itself, politely but clearly, as it breaks through the dough. It would be possible to sit down in front of a bowl of these, spooning them up with their warm yogurt and chile oil and dried mint, and call for another bowl a minute later. Of course, the meal should begin with strips of nigella-dotted Turkish bread and a spread or two -- maybe memorably creamy purée of dried favas; or the roughly mashed eggplant, smoky without a trace of bitterness; and one of the strained-yogurt dips, either the tangy cacik, laced with minced cucumbers, or the labneh, as firm as a new mattress. Either will prove useful as the meal goes on. So will a simple salad, especially the one with white beans and purple onions. The tightly rolled, golden bourekas are like skinny Turkish spring rolls filled with dill and melting feta. Cold poached leeks, a frequent special, are more appealing than the cold poached artichokes that have a permanent spot on the menu. If Mr. Yegen tells you that the grilled octopus is the best in the city, keep in mind that he rarely seems to leave his own restaurant. It's quite good, though, with a fugitive sweetness that may be supplied by the tomatoes and purple onions. Desserts run toward milky white puddings, nice if you are looking for a mild sedative. The baklava, imported from Turkey, is a treat for those of us who like pistachios and think sugar syrup makes a better baklava sweetener than honey. The unlikely champion, though, is the butternut squash that has been languorously baked in its own juices with nothing but sugar. The technique is one of those small tricks that helps Mr. Yegen's cooking stand out, like the perfume of lemon peel in the Turkish lemonade. Lokanta has no liquor license yet. Some customers smuggle wine through the door and keep the bottles on their tables, which are topped with radiant white marble from Turkey and surrounded by classic bentwood cafe chairs.

{"id": 56, "data": " The chef John Fraser's new restaurant has a blandly corporate name, 701West , that tells you less about the place than simply walking into the dining room. One of several operations he is running in the new Times Square Edition hotel, it is clad in paneling on the walls and ceilings. Velvet curtains and banquettes are the slightly alarming color of a blue macaw's tail feathers. Wooden blinds are usually snapped shut against the strobes of 47th Street and Seventh Avenue. To get to your table, you must first pass between two identical Champagne trolleys. An iced reservoir in the center of each is loaded with about half a dozen bottles that range in price from a Blanquette de Limoux for $26 a glass to a 2006 brut from Dom Pérignon for $66 a glass. Before you sit down, you've already learned that wine is front and center, literally and figuratively; that it is more likely to come from classic, mannerly European estates than, say, Macedonian villages still using amphoras that Odysseus drank from; that the ideal customer is not likely to get up and walk out upon being offered a $66 aperitif; and that the restaurant expects to attract so many of these customers that a single Champagne trolley is not enough. Which is to say that Marriott International and the hotelier Ian Schrager installed 701West on the 11th floor of the Edition for people who still think a leisurely, three-course dinner with a few interesting bottles and some of the customary niceties is worth spending money on. It belongs to a species of restaurant that is no longer in great supply in Manhattan, let alone on the intersection where the green neon of the Olive Garden faces off across Seventh Avenue against the giant candy bars of Hershey's Chocolate World. It also marks Mr. Fraser's first arabesques on the stage of formal dining since Dovetail closed last year. These are early days for 701West, but so far I've found the cooking more original and appealing than Dovetail's in its final phase. As you know if you've tried the fried-cauliflower buns at Nix, or the ramen-style boiled eggs at the Loyal whose yolks are red with a film of jellied chile oil, Mr. Fraser has a playful, imaginative streak. He needs it at 701West, where there is no real theme beyond wine and style. But there is enough creativity across the menu, on which he collaborates with the chef de cuisine, Rob Lawson, and the pastry chef, Sébastien Rouxel, to make dinner the engaging, somewhat eccentric experience it is clearly meant to be. Before the first courses appear, for example, there may be a \"cauliflower mille-feuille,\" the raw vegetable shaved into white sheets that are softened by chilled mezcal cream and then topped with sturgeon caviar. It's enticingly off-kilter, and another frequent amuse manages to outdo it: a spoonful or so of white-asparagus foam above a warm custard of sunflower-seed butter, dense and nutty and sweet with a few drops of honey. This is luxury dining in its way, which is not the predictable way. The menu proposes three courses for $98, but a server informed me that \"we also have à la carte, if that's more your rhythm for the evening.\" Frequently the surprises come in the form of an unexpected tweak dealt to a vegetable. Slowly cooked in beet juice, a whole beet takes on the glistening ruby intensity of raw bluefin tuna. There is an appetizer of actual bluefin as well, and it has the precise, Japanese-informed minimalism of a dish you'd get at Jean-Georges, with tiny spring peas and young turnip greens and an electrifying white cloud of grated horseradish. In a dish of fava agnolotti, the X factor is the bright, almost effervescent sparkle of vinegar-marinated tomatoes and their juices stirred into a Parmesan-rind broth. There is one mystifying appetizer in which the dueling tidal flavors of sea urchin and squid-ink risotto are allowed to cancel each other out. For the most part, though, the plates don't overreach, for all the inventiveness on display. Asparagus dipped in aioli is a good idea, of course, but what if the asparagus has been steamed inside a wrapper of thinly shaved cedar until it is nearly as smoky as country bacon? And what if the aioli is enhanced by truffles? It may sound overworked, but it is such a thrill that one of my guests asked for another plate before we could move on to the main courses, throwing the rhythm for the evening right out the window. The night will pause again if one of the main courses is the sweet potato, as everyone tries to figure out where it got its creaminess and savory depth. Even once you know it's been sealed up and baked inside a little coffin of sourdough that is streaked with green threads of wakame seaweed, you still can't quite believe that all this flavor has been achieved with an ordinary sweet potato. Some of the large pieces of fish and meat are showstoppers on their own, like the lobster that rests for four days in aged-beef fat before being broiled and set over some jammy ratatouille. When they are not, something else on the plate usually is. The long slab of roasted duck breast dredged in powdered herbes de Provence would keep my attention even without its sidekick, a curiously likable risotto made from pine nuts. In the case of lamb, the firecracker is a cocotte of fresh, creamy cranberry beans. Mr. Rouxel, recently of Upland and the Clocktower, brings a lighter-than-air quality to the desserts. Hovering over a crunchy buckwheat pastry crust is a wavy sea of pastry cream infused with parsnips. It's earthy and ethereal at the same time. He even knows what to do with white chocolate, aerating it into a mousse to frost an English-pea sponge cake, and giving it a piercing sour-cherry sorbet as a foil. All seven captains working at 701West are sommeliers, listed by name on the menu; they are assisted by back servers who are sommeliers in training. This is one of those innovations in service that seems obvious now that somebody's actually doing it. The meal can become an evening-long conversation about wine; the sommeliers even invite you to play the wine-insiders' game of guessing the identity of a mystery pour in a black glass. It is slightly incredible that a restaurant that tries so hard to give wine equal status with the cooking does not have more bottles for under $80. That said, the ones it does have tend to be very good and fairly priced. Besides 701West, Mr. Fraser is in charge of the deep-dish focaccia, carrot Bolognese and \"billboard burger\" at the Terrace and Outdoor Gardens, which is open all day on the ninth floor. He also oversees the dinner-theater menus at the Paradise Club on the seventh floor, which is currently staging \"The Devouring,\" a neo-Burlesque extravaganza (juggling, sword swallowing, aerial acrobatics) purportedly inspired by William Blake. This was no doubt the destination of the stilt walker I nearly ran into in the lobby one night. Dressed in scarlet from head to heel, she got along faster on her stilts than I do on my own legs. She was the first thing I've seen in years that gave me hope for the future of Times Square. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 57, "data": " When a batch of banh beo comes to the table at Van Da , any confusion about how to eat them does not last long. Banh beo, a species of small rice cake, are a favorite afternoon snack in the central Vietnamese city of Hue. Each one is steamed in a ceramic dish just big enough to hold a few spare coins. Faced with a platter of banh beo, you realize fairly quickly that you have essentially two choices: You can use a spoon, or hold the dish to your mouth and tip it up while throwing your head back, as if doing a Jell-O shot. If you go the Jell-O shot route, it may help to bring a pair of chopsticks or a fingertip into play at the last minute to encourage the banh beo to leave the nest. You have now transferred to your mouth a warm divot of steamed rice and tapioca flours that has a consistency like panna cotta's and a negligible flavor on its own. All the action is in the toppings. At Van Da, these include a spoonful of chopped scallions and the green oil in which they were sizzled, red rings of fresh Thai chile, some fish sauce, rehydrated dried shrimp and a flap of fried tofu skin, standing in for the pork rinds a banh beo vendor in Hue would use. The divot of rice cake is still warm, which helps the aromas drive their way into your head. It's over in a minute. If you're lucky, there will be another banh beo on the table so you can start over. Van Da joined the East Village's growing hub of interesting Vietnamese restaurants three months ago. Like Hanoi House , Madame Vo and Madame Vo BBQ , it is semitraditional and semimodern. Those two strains are embodied at Van Da by, respectively, Yen Ngo and Hannah Wong. Ms. Ngo, who owns the place, was raised in Dalat, Vietnam, and while she has worked in restaurants and catering in New York City for years, she has never had a chance before to show off the food of her childhood, like the banh beo steamed by her mother, who had grown up in Hue. Ms. Wong is the chef. Though she has cooked at Gramercy Tavern and Battersby , her background in the food of Vietnam before Van Da was more or less confined to the roughly two weeks she spent traveling there while living in Hong Kong on a Fulbright grant a decade ago. Nevertheless, she has put together a trenchant, concise and pleasure-focused menu of Vietnamese dishes. Some she learned directly from her boss, and on those recipes she was apparently discouraged from drawing outside the lines. Others are more freely interpreted. It's a credit to Ms. Wong's sensitivity that if you don't already know the original templates, it can be hard to tell where they end and her imagination begins. Banh beo and the other snacks from Hue that Ms. Ngo taught Ms. Wong get their own berth on the menu. As you'd imagine, they tend to be very good. Banh it ram are chewy, fried balls of mochi, filled with a coconut-soaked mash of mung beans and shallots. Banh khot are little rice-flour pancakes molded into edible cups about the size of a Ritz cracker. In Vietnam, the cups would be filled with shrimp. Ms. Wong instead spoons sautéed mushrooms into hers, along with a crisscrossing of fresh herbs and a spill of coconut cream. Ms. Wong makes an effort to bring out regional differences in Vietnamese cuisine by devoting sections of the menu to Saigon and Hanoi, hundreds of miles apart, as well as Hue, somewhere in the middle. She doesn't have quite enough dishes from any one place to paint a full picture, but the project is intriguing. Like other New York chefs, she has been caught in the tractor beam of cha ca la Vong , the turmeric-and dill-scented fish dish that is a specialty of a 100-year-old Hanoi restaurant of the same name. Her version, though, supplies less dill, less sauce and less satisfaction than some others. Her two improvisations on the theme of Hanoi's best-known contribution to gastronomy, pho, are more effective. One gives you the soup without the noodles; floating in a rich and cloudy broth are ghostly white, billowing won tons that contain chopped beef fillet freely seasoned with black pepper. The other dish is, humbly enough, a plate of soupless pho noodles stir-fried with springy mushrooms, bitter greens and chopped scallions. Its simplicity makes the impact of the dish hard to explain until you learn that it has been showered with Maggi Seasoning , a soylike sauce that is the invisible secret of many Vietnamese dishes. Nodding toward Saigon, Ms. Wong makes a rendition of shaking beef by stir-frying tender and chewy marinated hanger steak with potatoes and then throwing a fistful of watercress at it. If you think that sounds like a French bistro plate, then you are starting to understand how her mind works. Ms. Wong cooks skillfully, with an appreciation for nuance, and she doesn't abuse her freedom by innovating pointlessly. It's possible, though, that she could stand to be less shy with chiles and herbs. The table salad of greenery to be wrapped around grilled shrimp offers no herbs other than mint and basil, and you'll run out of lettuce before the fourth shrimp has been dressed. The green papaya salad is a little too innocuous, and while her version of the street snack of grilled corn in fish sauce is a real success, fresh chiles would have more impact than the chile threads Ms. Wong balances on top. (Incidentally, the kitchen at Van Da makes a fine hot sauce that is like a milder and less acidic Sriracha, but servers never seem to remember to mention it until the end of the meal.) There are just three desserts. By the time you order, one or two may have been 86ed. With luck, though, the che will have survived. In Vietnam, che is thought of as a drink even though it can take the form of a pudding, as it does here, where warm pearls and threads of tapioca are cooked in coconut milk with cubes of soft taro. It is just sweet enough to qualify as a dessert. A black dust darkens the surface: black-sesame brittle, ground to powder. Even a single dessert qualifies as an impressive feat inside Van Da's tight quarters. Through the miracle of careful design, the space almost never feels cramped, but this is still an intimate restaurant. In the basement is a small seating area laid out as efficiently as the cockpit of a fighter jet; above it, at the top of a staircase, is an even smaller seating area sharing a room with a window-facing dining counter, the kitchen and a bar. The cocktails that roll off that bar, like the gin-and-celery duet called the White Tiger, are much more sharply drawn than the drinks at restaurants with twice the space and four times the budget.

{"id": 58, "data": " Talking about how good the chef Thomas Keller's new restaurant is would be easier if it weren't also painfully out of step with the city's mood. TAK Room is so determined to be \"timeless,\" as Mr. Keller has often called it, that it seems clueless. TAK Room opened in March, one of 11 restaurants inside the 720,000-square-foot mall at 20 Hudson Yards. Parts of Hudson Yards are still under construction, but enough has been finished for most New Yorkers to figure out that this fistful of glass needles stabbed into the West Side wasn't built for them. Just as the helipad the city offered to build for Amazon crystallized anger about the cruddy state of our subways, the glittering new home on 10th Avenue for global luxury brands, investment funds, law firms, business travelers and hunters of seven- or eight-figure apartments spurred a lot of New Yorkers to ask, What's in it for us? Mr. Keller's answer is a restaurant that looks and acts like a millionaire's hangout in an old New Yorker cartoon. It charges like one, too, with adjustments for inflation. An eggplant Parmesan is the least expensive main course, at $30, followed by the New Zealand salmon for $42. After that, please turn off all electronic devices and place your tray tables in the upright, locked position, because we are going up to $66 and $75 before reaching a cruising altitude of $85. Look down there -- don't the people look just like ants? TAK Room's timing is off in other ways, too. Hudson Yards has stirred up New Yorkers' latent resentment of chain stores from beyond the Hudson, and what does Mr. Keller offer them but a clone of his restaurant in Florida, the Surf Club ? The name has been changed, but the menus are nearly identical; they glorify the strait-laced, spice-free food that rich white Americans used to feed on when nobody was shaming them into being adventurous. It is the food of \"21,\" of three-martini lunches, steakhouses and country clubs: prime rib and Dover sole, iceberg lettuce and oysters Rockefeller. Of course, being a Thomas Keller production, TAK Room serves the most refined, meticulous country club food you've ever seen. Most of it is very good, and a few things are so inexplicably delicious that you have the sensation of slipping the knots of gravity and floating an inch or so above your seat. The entrance is on the fifth floor, just past Neiman Marcus. But the action is on the sixth floor, up a Deco-cubist staircase so grand that you may feel a little underdressed unless you have Carole Lombard on one arm. (There is no dress code.) At the top, you find yourself in a lounge where a pianist and upright bassist glide through satiny jazz standards. Bartenders whip up streamlined, uncomplicated drinks that are either genuine classics, like the Pendennis Club, or modern drinks built along classic proportions, like the Tritter rickey, a tall, fizzy gin number that shimmies with absinthe. Around sunset, when pink light trickles through the western windows, it has to be the most pleasant room within a mile for fighting vainly the old ennui . They let people eat in this room, too, and it is tempting. But there is more to see, room after room, all laid out by the London interior-design firm David Collins Studio. There are leather banquettes deep enough to lose a small child in. Facing them are mohair-velvet chairs that swivel so you can quietly surveil the room without craning your neck. Each table gets a white linen cloth and a flickering oil lamp behind a white porcelain shade. The other colors are black walnut, midnight blue and law-firm green. At some point a captain in a crisply tailored suit will deposit the wine list. It mostly avoids the latest fashions, like a croquet party on Nantucket. Later there will be a preamble to the menu. Under the day-to-day care of Jarrod Huth, TAK Room's chef de cuisine, it has a continental theme and an à la carte format. Highlights will be pointed out, and the prime rib will certainly be mentioned, as will the restored 1930s silver trolley on which it is ferried from table to table. Here comes a French onion dip surrounded by newly fried potato chips that are dark without a hint of charring. This is TAK Room in one extremely crunchy, lusciously creamy bite: an hors d'oeuvre from the age of Naugahyde and polyester, transformed into something so good and pure it's beyond reproach. The Parker House rolls are gravity-defying orbs served with soft cultured butter that, in the evening's best magic trick, rises from a custom-made dish in six identical ridged curls , like shrimp performing a Busby Berkeley routine. Bespoke flourishes like that are a TAK Room hallmark; see also the oyster crackers, like down pillows shrunk to the size of Chiclets, served with the silk-smooth New England clam chowder that is one of the most likable appetizers and, at $16, the best value. Another hallmark, though, is unevenness. Avocado Louie with a small bouquet of other vegetables is thrillingly right, thanks to a Thousand Island dressing that crackles with energy; the Caesar salad, made while you watch, has almost no personality. Grated Parmesan and anchovies vanish into it without a trace, along with dull croutons that could take some pointers from the oyster crackers. Something called \"warm soft boiled egg\" is a quietly joyous celebration of luxurious flavors and textures, the yolk running like lava over a buckwheat blin and a heap of warm osetra caviar in crème fraîche. (Yes, warm. It's wonderful.) And the chilled prawn cocktail is going to be my platonic ideal of the dish from now on. But the crab cake had very little crab flavor, on two different nights, although it contained almost nothing else. Lobster thermidor (now there's a name I've not heard in a long, long time) is so tender, its sauce so fluffy and rich, that eating it becomes an intimate act. Dover sole meunière, though, has neither the crisped skin nor the juicy flesh that can make this fish so alluring. Yes, life cannot be one giant plate of dancing butter-shrimp. Still, the gap between great and non-great items -- nothing comes close to bad -- is a bit too wide and comes into view a bit too often. Regulars will learn to work the menu the way golfers learn their way around the eighth hole at Pebble Beach. Some will love the prime rib, which could not be any more moist without breaking several laws of chemistry. Others will wish that it had more concentrated beef flavor and that the flaps and handles had not been trimmed off, perhaps in pursuit of some Kellerian quest for bovine symmetry. A large number will settle on the roast chicken for two. The meat is juicy but not gushy, the flavor full but not salty, the jus dark but not over-reduced. After the chicken, the pastry chef, Alex McClenaghan, can offer a highly refined coconut cake or an urbane lemon meringue tart, but you'd almost have to be insane not to get the chocolate cake. Certainly a close relative of devil's food cake, his version weaves dark-chocolate cremeux between its many, many layers, all of them wrapped in a dark-chocolate frosting. And there will be regulars, because the rewards of TAK Room, if you can find them and pay for them, are as intense as the chocolate in that cake. The core audience may turn out to be travelers on loan from the Surf Club and Mr. Keller's California strongholds, or they may just be people who like the feeling of crashing the country club. Anti-plutocrat fevers come and go, but the trappings of American aristocracy are always in style somewhere.

{"id": 59, "data": " One of the ways people pretend to be sophisticated about restaurants these days is by claiming that the New York City dining scene has lost its edge. The sheer number of restaurants in the city -- about 27,000, according to the health inspectors -- makes the argument absurd. How many of them are slipping? All of them? Just the first 20,000 or so? In reality, people who gripe about the state of New York restaurants are usually talking about a sliver of a slice of a fraction, probably around 50 places whose names are in steady circulation, with the newest weighing most heavily in the results. The number of really good ones is higher than anyone can count. Places that other cities would brag about get lost in the crowd here. The chef Günther Seeger, for instance, was a national star when he cooked in Atlanta. The tasting-menu restaurant he opened in the West Village three years ago should have been a major destination, especially after he dropped the prices. Mr. Seeger can make ingredients bend to his will almost without touching them. His cooking outshone that of some of the city's more famous chefs, who whip their ingredients harder with far less payoff. Yet he struggled to put Günther Seeger NY on the map. I reviewed it, but some other critics didn't, and by the time it closed, last month, Chris Crowley of Grub Street wrote , \"it wasn't a restaurant you heard a lot of food geeks talk about.\" Mr. Seeger complained to one acquaintance that he couldn't even get on a list of New York's 100 best restaurants. Of course, good restaurants fail everywhere, but it's hard to imagine Mr. Seeger vanishing into the crowd in San Francisco, Chicago or Los Angeles. Considered and rejected, maybe. But overlooked? Not likely. I'm not sure that any words of mine could have persuaded the city to cuddle up to Mr. Seeger, who isn't particularly cuddly. But I wish I'd found ways to remind New Yorkers that his breathtakingly pure cooking was there to be enjoyed while that was still true. Which brings us, by a circuitous and not particularly well-paved route, to Anthony Mangieri of Una Pizza Napoletana . Using naturally leavened dough and a short shopping list of ingredients, Mr. Mangieri makes what is unmistakably the finest sit-down pizza in the five boroughs. (I doubt he has any rivals in the stand-up joints, either, but slice pizza is a different game.) Two years ago, I posited that Razza, a pizzeria in Jersey City, made \"the best pizza in New York.\" I don't regret writing that, but I would like to point out that Mr. Mangieri was not cooking in the city at the time and that Razza's chef, Dan Richer, has said that he began taking pizza seriously only after he met Mr. Mangieri. Una Pizza Napoletana saw a rush of curious pie-eaters after it opened on Orchard Street a little more than a year ago. But the last few times I've gone, there were too many unclaimed chairs and bar stools. When Anthony Mangieri is making pizza, the right number of empty seats is zero, as any New Yorker who waited in line at the old Una Pizza Napoletana, in the East Village from 2004 to 2009, could tell you. Press interest in the new place has died down, too. So when I heard a rumor that Mr. Mangieri was thinking of leaving the city and taking his pizza with him, I was unnerved, to put it mildly. Asked about it, he told me he was considering it but hadn't made up his mind. Mr. Mangieri has left New York before, and I didn't like it then, either. This time, I wasn't going to let him get away without a fight. It is true that my review of Una Pizza Napoletana last year was decidedly mixed. It is also true, though, that almost every criticism I made has been addressed. It has gone from one of the most confounding pizzerias in the city to one of the most enjoyable. The problem with Una Pizza a year ago was that it was trying to be two things at once. It was, of course, a Neapolitan pizzeria, serving classic, unadorned pies baked for about two minutes inside a wood-burning oven shaped like an igloo. But it was also a cutting-edge Lower East Side experiment. At the instigation of Mr. Mangieri's partners, the chefs Fabian von Hauske Valtierra and Jeremiah Stone, the kitchen brought forth appetizers that had rarely if ever been asked to live under one roof with a pizza. There was a jellylike mass of raw lobster inside a ring of chickpeas, and a rust-colored puddle of 'nduja under raw turnips and nasturtium leaves. The wine list was virtually a treatise on natural wines, a long document full of the names of eccentric producers and obscure European villages. In another restaurant, all this would have been the departure point for some adventurous evenings. But in a pizzeria it led to some peculiar pairings, made the check a bit higher than you wanted and resulted in long waits before you were finally allowed to eat the delicious pizza you'd come for. Over the past year, Mr. von Hauske and Mr. Stone have stepped aside, letting Mr. Mangieri call the shots. The wines on offer now number about 15. They are still a likably eccentric lot, but picking one doesn't feel like studying for a master sommelier exam. The appetizers are simpler and less expensive: a plate of marinated white anchovies, a dish of warm Italian olives or a bowl of Little Gem lettuce with sunflower seeds in a Caesarish dressing. I do miss the tiramisù from the opening menu, but the new cannoli filled with ricotta -- a blend of domestic cow's milk and Italian sheep's milk -- are nearly as good. It's common for a new restaurant to trim its sails, but this one has trimmed its prices, too. In the beginning the five regular pizzas were all $25; now they range from $19 to $25, and the two extra-complicated Friday and Saturday pizzas are priced at $26. I liked Mr. Mangieri's pies in the East Village, I liked them more when he came back to town, and it's possible, just possible, that they've improved over the past year. He is, like Mr. Seeger, a minimalist. He lets you notice each ingredient: the little ping of sourness in the Campanian buffalo mozzarella, for instance. Or the unruly, windswept-hillside aroma of dried Sicilian oregano. The precise crunch of each unrefined Trapani sea-salt crystal waiting to dissolve. The crust is so tender it barely fights fork, knife or teeth. Some diners will wish it put up more crackly resistance. You inhale it at least as much as you eat it. When you have finished, some of the most popular pizzas in town will seem tough, leathery, overworked. Even if this is not the style you crave, you'll know that it's the work of a baker who has spent years listening to the dough. There is a place for people who are as obsessed with pizza as Mr. Mangieri, and the place is New York City.

{"id": 60, "data": " Good restaurants don't rain down from nowhere, but Crown Shy came close. No doubt it went through the same birth pangs as all the others. As far as I can tell, though, it simply materialized one morning this March at 70 Pine Street, and was open for business that afternoon by the time the financial district's elevators began disgorging traders, bankers and analysts in search of 5-o'clock refreshment. One reason it seems to have crept up on the city is that it's a large, well-capitalized, big-time restaurant of the kind that only established groups seem able to get off the ground these days. Yet Crown Shy doesn't come from Danny Meyer, Andrew Carmellini or any of the other usual suspects. Its two main players were recruited after talks among April Bloomfield, Ken Friedman and the building's developer fell apart in 2016, before accusations of sexual harassment engulfed Mr. Friedman. Crown Shy's chef, James Kent, used to run the kitchen at the NoMad , and his partner, Jeff Katz, is the managing partner at Del Posto . Neither exactly fell off the turnip truck last week. As a team, though, they're unproven, and as they went through construction and hiring, the drumbeat of publicity was more muted than it might have been if marquee names had led the project. Then there is Crown Shy's location, a sprawling, soaring, street-level space that, as far as anyone recalls, has never held a restaurant before. Many New Yorkers have seen the 1932 building's distinctive, hulking, pyramidal silhouette on the skyline, but until recently, when the offices on its 67 stories were repurposed as expensive apartments and hotel rooms, not many had encountered the frenzied exuberance of the lobby, which makes use of polished marble in at least five contrasting colors. It looks like something Bernini would have designed if he'd lived to see the Jazz Age. Depending on which entrance you use -- the revolving doors are crowned with aluminum reliefs of Art Deco flowers being pollinated by elongated stylized butterflies -- you may want to allow an extra five or 10 minutes to take it all in before you eat. Above all, it's the extent to which Crown Shy already has its act together that makes you ask: Where did this place come from? The whole operation radiates confidence from start to finish. The finish brings real desserts from a real pastry chef, Renata Ameni. She comes to Crown Shy fresh from Manresa, in Los Gatos, Calif ., and before that, she put in half a decade at Eleven Madison Park . Her desserts at Crown Shy look uncomplicated, and you don't realize how intelligently they've been put together until you start to eat one. There's a milky-white yogurt cheesecake under tender spring strawberries, with smooth strawberry sorbet in the center and a pistachio crumble sprinkled over that. Her chocolate tart gives her a chance to show off about half a dozen different effects she can work with chocolate, starting with a crunchy, crumbly, almost salty chocolate crust, moving on to a soft, soufflé-like filling and ending with curls of dark chocolate. Ms. Ameni's side of the kitchen is also responsible for the savory churros filled with Gruyère sauce -- the menu calls them fritters, they taste like gougères and the texture is something else entirely. Also her work: the miniature loaf of pull-apart bread that appears after you order. With dried olives on top and olive tapenade between every skinny slice, it is one of the most memorable parts of the meal. Even the obligatory scoops of ice cream that restaurants seem required to offer aren't allowed to leave her pastry station until they've been turned into a composed dessert, and not some kind of slapdash sundae , either. Satsuma ice cream gets to wear a toasted turban of marshmallowy meringue and some cracked honeycomb candy on the side. The effect is witty and delicious, progressing from purely sweet to bittersweet to tart and bittersweet. Mr. Kent's savory dishes pursue the same strategy. This is to say, they regularly over-deliver, starting with the iced Wellfleet oysters dressed with cucumber jelly, diced cucumbers, grains of jalapeño and microleaves of purple shiso. An almost absurdly creamy purée of white bean hummus under a fiery red slick of melted 'nduja is probably meant to be shared, but as soon as I'd tasted it I came up with other ideas, as my dinner guests will testify. Two tartares show Mr. Kent's talent for carrying bright new ideas with him into well-traveled territory. In the first, he laces hand-chopped raw beef with toasted walnuts and earthy rye croutons; in the other, chopped raw snapper is sprinkled with individual juice-filled vesicles of grapefruit, lime, lemon and orange that pop between your teeth, a kind of instant, interactive ceviche. Maybe one or two ideas should have been left by the side of the road. The chicken liver ragù tossed with housemade cavatelli doesn't need to be so sweet with sherry; a rough pesto is a fine use for fresh chickpeas, but isn't there a better partner for it than shaved jicama? All is forgiven when Mr. Kent turns a mainstay like grilled chicken into a main course as exciting as the one at Crown Shy, which keeps the sunshine brightness of its citrus marinade, and is served with a purée-slash-hot sauce of fermented hot and sweet peppers. The vivid orange of that hot sauce almost matches the marble in the lobby. But Crown Shy's two big dining rooms and extended bar are a little more restrained, dominated by cream tones, blond wood tables, and chairs with saddle-brown leather seats and backs. The only echoes of grandeur are the enormous windows and the ceiling high up overhead. The wine list is one to get lost in. Finance wizards with bonuses to expunge can certainly do that, but it's great to see lots of bottles under $100 on almost every page. Anyone who knows what some of these wines cost wholesale will be able to locate any number of good deals, but even the unschooled will notice the value regions. They jump off the page: Portugal, Greece and New Zealand, for instance, along with vast stretches of Germany and pockets of Spain, France and Italy. With so many strengths, Crown Shy must have at least one thing wrong with it. And yes, it does. Obviously that name is ridiculous. Knowing that it refers to a tendency of very tall trees not to let their upper stories grow into their neighbors' branches doesn't help, either. But we should probably get used to it, because we're going to be hearing more about this restaurant. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 41, "data": " I can count on Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn to produce certain sensations at every meal. There is the insistent smell of broiled dry-aged steak that hits me the minute I open the door and sometimes sooner, while I'm still outside on the South Williamsburg sidewalk, producing a raised pulse, a quickening of the senses and a restlessness familiar to anyone who has seen a tiger that has just heard the approach of the lunch bucket. There is the hiss of butter and melted tallow as they slide down the hot platter, past the sliced porterhouse or rib steak and their charred bones, to make a pool at one end. The server will spoon some of this sizzling fat over the meat he has just plated, generally with some line like \"Here are your vitamins.\" There is the thunk of a bowl filled with schlag landing on a bare wood table when dessert is served, and soon after, the softer tap-tap-tap of waxy chocolate coins in gold foil dropped one at a time on top of the check. And after I've paid, there is the unshakable sense that I've been scammed. The last sensation was not part of the Peter Luger experience when I started eating there, in the 1990s. I was acutely aware of the cost back then because I would settle the tab by counting out $20 bills; cash was the only way to pay unless you had a Peter Luger credit card. At the end of the night my wallet would be empty. Because a Peter Luger steak made me feel alive in a way that few other things did, I considered this a fair trade, although I could afford it only once a year or so. I don't remember when the doubts began, but they grew over time. Diners who walk in the door eager to hand over literal piles of money aren't greeted; they're processed. A host with a clipboard looks for the name, or writes it down and quotes a waiting time. There is almost always a wait, with or without a reservation, and there is almost always a long line of supplicants against the wall. A kind word or reassuring smile from somebody on staff would help the time pass. The smile never comes. The Department of Motor Vehicles is a block party compared with the line at Peter Luger. [ Sign up for Sam Sifton's Cooking newsletter for recipes, food writing and culinary inspiration. ] The management seems to go out of its way to make things inconvenient. Customers at the bar have to order drinks from the bartender and food from an overworked server on the other side of the bar, and then pay two separate checks and leave two separate tips. And they can't order lunch after 2:30 p.m., even though the bar and the kitchen remain open. Since its last, two-star review in the Times , written by Frank Bruni in 2007, the restaurant has started taking online reservations. It accepts debit cards, too, which is nice. But the credit card you use to buy a cortado at the cafe or a bag of chips at the bodega will still not buy you a meal at Peter Luger. The servers, who once were charmingly brusque, now give the strong impression that these endless demands for food and drink are all that's standing between them and a hard-earned nap. Signals that a customer has a question or request don't get picked up as quickly; the canned jokes about spinach and schlag don't flow as freely. Some things are the same as ever. The shrimp cocktail has always tasted like cold latex dipped in ketchup and horseradish. The steak sauce has always tasted like the same ketchup and horseradish fortified by corn syrup. Although the fries are reasonably crisp, their insides are mealy and bland in a way that fresh-cut potatoes almost certainly would not be. The sole -- yes, I'm the person who ordered the sole at Peter Luger -- was strangely similar: The bread crumbs on top were gold and crunchy, but the fish underneath was dry and almost powdery. Was the Caesar salad always so drippy, the croutons always straight out of a bag, the grated cheese always so white and rubbery? I know there was a time the German fried potatoes were brown and crunchy, because I eagerly ate them each time I went. Now they are mushy, dingy, gray and sometimes cold. I look forward to them the way I look forward to finding a new, irregularly shaped mole. [ Readers respond to the Pete Wells review of Peter Luger .] Lunch one afternoon vividly demonstrated the kitchen's inconsistency: I ordered a burger, medium-rare, at the bar. So had the two people sitting to my right, it turned out. One of them got what we'd all asked for, a midnight-dark crust giving way to an evenly rosy interior so full of juices it looked like it was ready to cry. The other one got a patty that was almost completely brown inside. I got a weird hybrid, a burger whose interior shaded from nearly perfect on one side to gray and hard on the other. The same issue afflicted a medium-rare porterhouse I was served one night: The fillet was ideal but the other side of the T-bone, the strip, ranged from medium-rare to medium-well. I could live with this; big cuts of meat don't always cook evenly. What gnaws at me every time I eat a Luger porterhouse is the realization that it's just another steak, and far from the best New York has to offer. [ Melissa Clark shows you how to cook a steak at home . ] Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, can put a formidable crust on both sides of the cut; Luger caramelizes the top side only, while the underside is barely past raw, as if it had done all its cooking on the hot platter. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, buy beef that is tender, richly marbled and deeply flavorful; at Luger, you get the first two but not the third. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, age that beef to make flavor grow and intensify and double back on itself; dry-aging at Luger still results in a tender steak, but it rarely achieves a hypnotic or compelling or even very interesting one. But those other restaurants are not Peter Luger, as Friedrich Nietzsche might have said. \"When in this essay I declare war upon Wagner,\" Nietzsche wrote in \" The Case of Wagner ,\" \"the last thing I want to do is start a celebration for any other musicians. Other musicians don't count compared to Wagner.\" I could say the same thing about other steakhouses -- compared to Peter Luger, they don't count. Luger is not the city's oldest, but it's the one in which age, tradition, superb beef, blistering heat, an instinctive avoidance of anything fancy and an immensely attractive self-assurance came together to produce something that felt less like a restaurant than an affirmation of life, or at least life as it is lived in New York City. This sounds ridiculously grand. Years ago I thought it was true, though, and so did other people. The restaurant will always have its loyalists. They will laugh away the prices, the $16.95 sliced tomatoes that taste like 1979, the $229.80 porterhouse for four. They will say that nobody goes to Luger for the sole, nobody goes to Luger for the wine, nobody goes to Luger for the salad, nobody goes to Luger for the service. The list goes on, and gets harder to swallow, until you start to wonder who really needs to go to Peter Luger, and start to think the answer is nobody.

{"id": 42, "data": " Over the years, I have eaten many bowls of pasta with clams that have been rewired by a chef who was trying to stand out. But I had not come across one that made as much sense to me as the big, sloshing platters you get at old-line Italian-American clam bars like Randazzo's until tripping into a new Greenwich Village restaurant called Babs this summer. Mind you, virtually the only Italian thing about the tagliatelle with clams at Babs was the tagliatelle. The sauce was a mustard beurre blanc, one of those French sauces that all culinary-school students are supposed to be able to make in their sleep. Mustard beurre blanc is often found providing a decorous yellow veil over a chicken breast or salmon fillet. It is not normally poured over noodles. But, tossed with salty French ham and Manila clams smaller than a thumbprint, it made a strangely exciting bowl of pasta that was much more coherent than it sounds. Once I got to know Babs better, I understood that strange excitement is what it does best. Its chef, Efrén Hernández, has talked about Babs as a European grill, and many of the dishes are seared over hot charcoal, but he has a wider frame of reference than that. He was raised in Southern California by immigrants from Mexico, and Mexican cuisine runs through his menu like an underground stream that sometimes gurgles up to the surface. Mr. Hernández is not particularly interested in fusion, though; as far as I can tell, he likes rubbing cultures together to see what color the sparks will be. See, for example, what the menu calls divorced sea bream, a handsome dish that would be splashed around Instagram even more frequently than it already is if the dining tables were lighted by ceiling pinspots rather than disco-era chrome globes that look as if they were salvaged from Regine's . The bream is split, and one side brushed with a red sauce and the other with a green sauce, before it is grilled over charcoal. The dish is an allusion to the two-tone pescado a la talla served at Contramar in Mexico City, itself derived from huevos divorciados, a breakfast of two fried eggs beneath two contrasting salsas. In Mr. Hernández's kitchen, though, the red adobo at Contramar is replaced by a Catalan romesco, and the parsley salsa becomes a French pistou. But surely the tortilla on its own plate off to one side brings it back to Mexico? Not so fast. According to the menu, it is a taloa, a Basque cornmeal cake that cooks from Bayonne to Bilbao have been griddling for centuries. The taloa at Babs is tender, smooth and floral. Mr. Hernández has been cooking at Babs since it opened in July. He is also the chef at Mimi , a French restaurant a block away that is owned by the same people (Daniel Bennett, his brother Evan, and Louis Levy; they named Babs and Mimi after their grandmothers.) I haven't been back to Mimi since Liz Johnson was the chef . She was aiming for a style that was at once brawny and lavish, and since taking over last year Mr. Hernández has seemed to continue in that vein while bringing his far-ranging curiosity to bear. As they did at Mimi, the owners have planted a small curved bar right by the door at Babs. The cocktails stirred and shaken there are mostly recognizable relatives of classics, like a martini made with two brands of gin. There's something charmingly self-deprecating about a cocktail list that includes Mount Gay and tonic, which seasoned barflies know as one of the drinks you can safely order in dives that don't do anything else right. The wine list, meanwhile, is mostly French and sticks to the old guard; you can tell it's not trying especially hard to be cool by the way it has just one orange wine, lumped in with the sparkling wines. Only the wine geeks will wish for more, but the rest of us might wish there were as many bottles costing around $50 as there are in the $90 range. The numbers on the menu can sneak up on you, too. My $48 lobster was a small creature that couldn't have weighed much more than a pound. The server brightly suggested dunking its tomalley into the smoked potato purée, and I would have tried it if I had found any tomalley. And while I can imagine happily paying $36 for Babs's lamb chops, I'd want them to be served with something more compelling than the cold, underseasoned \"Basque potato salad\" into which some baby sardines had apparently disappeared without a trace. But there is nothing wrong with the charcoal-grilled swordfish with mint salsa verde, fennel and green olives, and if you ordered the chicken andouille this summer you found Mr. Hernández knocking cuisines together again, this time with a corn-and-chanterelles risotto under a slow-burning splash of Calabrian chile oil. He shows how well he can work in small strokes with a layered appetizer of raw sea scallops, sweet potato purée and trout roe, seasoned with a briny and fascinating salsa of chopped cucumbers, seaweed and fermented serrano chiles; or the fried cod cheeks, tender and crunchy over an orange slick of romesco aioli. Mr. Hernández's imagination fights against predictability. A crab salad, for instance, doesn't need to be interesting if it is fresh, but the one at Babs is both. It's seasoned with a gribiche that's full of chopped fresh dill, and then it's piled up in a big beehive on top of a smoked potato pancake. Like many small restaurants these days, Babs doesn't offer many desserts, but the ones it does are far more intriguing than average. A fine apple galette is improved by a grating of Swiss-style cheese from Edelweiss Creamery in Wisconsin and by a drizzle of 20-year-old Pedro Ximénez sherry, thick as syrup and tasting like chocolate and coffee. Why sherry with Swiss cheese? I don't know, but Mr. Hernández does. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 43, "data": " For a long time, the seriousness of a pizzeria could be gauged by a simple yes-or-no question: Did it sell pizza by the slice? The ones that cared the most about upholding traditions, maintaining quality and so on -- like Totonno's , John's of Bleecker Street , Kesté , Lucali , Una Pizza Napoletana -- emphatically did not. Today, we live in the era of the elevated slice joint. Some of them, like Scarr's , grind wheat berries into new flour every day. Many use minuscule quantities of yeast; others abandon commercial yeast altogether in favor of the natural leavening in sourdough starters. There are slice joints that ferment their dough for a day, some that let it bubble away for two days and a few that go in for three days. A new example of the breed, F&F Pizzeria , opened in Brooklyn last week with the help of a baker whose starter dough has traveled internationally and another baker who has decades of experience at the end of a pizza paddle. Among themselves, these new-school pizza makers speak of hydration levels, fermentation periods and digestibility. Many of these slice masters are chasing an ideal version of the foldable, portable triangle sold across linoleum counters in all five boroughs, a search suffused with nostalgia for an era before processed cheese, sweetened sauce and wholesale dough. Others are celebrated for achievements in the square slice, a descendant of the Sicilian, with an airier, less doughy crust; leaders in this style include Corner Slice and Mama's Too . Perhaps the smallest group of all are the bakers who turn their eyes toward Rome, where the slices are rectangular and are known as pizza al taglio. They resemble focaccia more than a $3 slice from Ray's , and it's doubtful that the practitioners of this style even think of themselves as belonging to the elevated-slice movement. But I'd argue that they do belong to it, and that some of the most elevated slices in the area at the moment are the Roman-style ones that Bread and Salt sells inside its bakery and restaurant on Palisade Avenue, up in the Jersey City Heights. At any given time, three to six pizzas sit on the counter. They are oblong and, because they are baked without a pan to shape the dough, they have rounded corners, like a horse track. The crust is noticeably lightweight when you pick it up, an impression that is confirmed by the mouth and, later, the stomach. The interior is honeycombed with air pockets. The underside of each slice is strong enough to carry a relatively heavy load of toppings without bending or collapsing. This structural soundness is key to the pleasure. The toppings on a Bread and Salt slice are not decorations or seasonings, as they often are on round pizza. Each one is the point of its slice: a mix of fresh mushrooms with pepper, parsley and flecks of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano; zucchini shaved into fine threads and showered at the last minute with mint leaves; slices of late-summer red and yellow peppers picked while they still had few faintly bitter streaks of green reaching up their sides; a rough, dark pesto spooned around cherry tomatoes that were roasted until their skins turned black and pulled away from the globes of pulp inside; Concord grapes that blotch the dough with purple like exploded jelly grenades. A chef's hand is at work here, tossing black pepper and rosemary over the grape pizza, adding salt and excellent Sicilian olive oil to the tomato pulp, and hammering basil and hazelnuts for the pesto in a mortar. The hand belongs to Rick Easton, who oversees the pizzas and the nonpizzas and owns the restaurant. He also owned its predecessor, the Bread and Salt that operated in Pittsburgh for all of 2015 plus a few weeks on either side. For a short-lived place, it got a lot of media attention, luring restaurant hunters and recipe gatherers from across the country. By the start of 2016, he had decided to move to New York City. When his first job fell through, he began shopping for a location for Bread and Salt. The real estate market had ideas of its own, as it often does, which is how the incarnation of Bread and Salt that Mr. Easton opened early this summer wound up in New Jersey. In addition to cheaper rents, Jersey City has ordinances that allow customers to show up with bottles of wine or beer and drink them, a handy policy because Bread and Salt's beverage list has nothing more potent than Italian sodas and sparkling water. Each night's menu, written in chalk on a blackboard next to the counter where you order, contains at least as many things that are not pizza as things that are. Generally these other items are modest in size and trattoria-ish in spirit; prepared ahead of time, they need at most five minutes in the oven before a cook will arrange them on a board and carry them to one of the 25 or so seats. I wish the tripe stewed in spicy tomato sauce, the way Romans do it, were available all the time. It is not, but the meatballs almost always are, and they are wonderful, made with enough bread that they are extremely tender in a bright marinara. Another reliable find is a sandwich of some kind, made with plain, untopped pizza. Twice I've had a warm mortadella sandwich there, and both times I was convinced there was no way to improve on it. One dish was denoted on the menu by a single word: beans. I've thought of it nearly every day since, partly because the beans -- scarlet runners -- were perfectly intact but perfectly tender; partly because of the brooding depth they took on from being finished with sweet red peppers that the kitchen dried and fried, an ingredient the Italians call peperoni cruschi; and partly because their broth tasted so good when given a chance to soak into the slice of thick-crusted sourdough bread that came on top. That bread is Mr. Easton's, too. It comes with a lot of things, and it is excellent. Bread and Salt is still settling into New Jersey. Some ingredients may be better when Mr. Easton has had time to infiltrate the local farm scene. In August, when the state was rolling in juicy peaches, he was serving crunchy unripe ones in red wine for dessert. There was also a very strange cantaloupe pudding. By September things were looking up; one day there was a scoop of Tristar strawberry sorbet served with anise-seed-flecked polenta gelato, both made by Superiority Burger. (Mr. Easton is friendly with that restaurant's owner, Brooks Headley , and helped devise the recipe for the focaccia Superiority Burger serves on Fridays.) Although Mr. Easton has a handful of employees, Bread and Salt has some of the blind spots of a one-person operation. It is not the easiest restaurant to communicate with, having an Instagram account but no website or phone. On a recent Sunday, when the restaurant was supposed to open at 1 p.m., a sign on the front door announced that it would be delayed until 1:30. That was the last communiqué; the doors were not unlocked until 2. But Mr. Easton has a singular vision, and it is the reason the food is so compelling.

{"id": 44, "data": " Tsismis is the opposite of a speakeasy. It isn't hiding anything; its glass facade on Orchard Street wants to strike up a conversation so badly that it almost follows you home. The windows are stenciled with cartoon characters and with text-message bubbles that call out in English (\"Hello! New York\"), Spanish (\"que rico!\"), French (\"bon appétit\") and Tagalog (\"masarap,\" for delicious). The language lessons continue on the front door, which gives translations for \"tuloy po kayo\" (welcome) and the restaurant's name (gossip), pronounced chiss-miss. In case you miss all of this, a sandwich board straddles the sidewalk, advertising discounted beer, wine and wings at the bar during happy hour (\"5:thirsty\"). If you accept the facade's invitation to benaquitodits (come here here, a repetitive bit of Tagalog slang), the conversation will continue inside. Tsismis, which opened in June, is a chatty restaurant. At times, when one of the owners pulls up alongside your table and expounds on how the chef's interpretation of the dish you're trying to eat differs from what you might find in the Philippines, you may find yourself eyeing the exit. If you've found your way to the menu's strengths, though, odds are you won't want to go anywhere. Kinilaw, a Filipino ceviche in a piercingly sour calamansi and cane vinegar marinade with a jab of bird's-eye chile, is worth sticking around for, especially on those nights when it's made with bay scallops instead of fish. After that, you might look into the fried pork-and-carrot won tons called pinsec frito (or, as the menu has them, pinsit frito). They are typically folded into triangles, but the ones at Tsismis are twisted into little cones that look like Hershey's kisses, though slightly bigger and golden-brown. Once they stop steaming, you can hold them by the cowlick of fried wrapper at the top and swish them around in the sweet chile sauce. Won tons with the same filling flop around in the soup called pancit molo, although these are boiled. There is almost as much ground pork inside them as outside in the broth, which is thick with garlic and chopped scallions. Even if it's well after 5:thirsty and you're not sitting at the bar, Jappy's wings are worth considering. Jappy is the chef, Jappy Afzelius, and he fries those wings with thinly sliced garlic and sends them out to the dining room with a salsa of raw mangoes, charred onions and chiles. The heat of the salsa will not cause your shirt to burst into flames, but it is hot enough to make your memory of Jappy's wings a lasting one. Mr. Afzelius is a native of the Philippines and a graduate of a cooking academy in Manila, which shipped him off to Paris to intern in one of Alain Ducasse's bistros. The Ducasse masterminds then sent him to work at Benoit in New York, after which he turned up as the sous-chef at a Filipino restaurant in Brooklyn that was best known for its $100 doughnut -- ube-filled, Cristal-frosted and gold-leafed. Happily, nothing at Tsismis approaches that level of look-at-me desperation. Mr. Afzelius's cooking is loose, unfussy and liberated. He tosses tradition under the bus when it suits him. The result is Filipino-American drinking food that tends to be charmingly offhand. From time to time, it can lean toward sloppiness. One night the fried milkfish in pritong isda was so overdone that even topping it with calamansi juice, fish sauce and a crisp, juicy spoonful of marinated chayote on top didn't revive it. A version of adobong manok, which Mr. Afzelius makes as a roasted chicken plus a soy-turmeric sauce rather than an all-in-one stew, would have been more successful if the smoked eggplant hadn't been so undercooked it squeaked. But the grilled eggplant on top of the kare-kare was as soft as warm marrow, and the other vegetables -- crisp green beans, bok choy, enoki mushrooms -- made a refreshing counterpoint to the stewed oxtails in thick peanut sauce. Already pungent with shrimp paste, the kare-kare comes with extra on the side that you can add to your heart's content. As they do at Bad Saint in Washington, probably the country's most talked-about Filipino restaurant, Tsismis makes its laing by simmering local kale, rather than the more traditional taro leaves, in coconut milk. And if this version doesn't have the perspective-altering funk of Bad Saint's, it still draws plenty of depth from the shrimp paste and smoked fish in the milk and the big handful of dried baby shrimp dropped on top. By this point, you will probably want to have a glass in your hand. Housemade calamansi soda sounds lovely, but mine was a little flat and weak. In lieu of hard spirits, sake is the backbone of most of the cocktails. They are typically fleshed out with half a dozen other ingredients -- vermouth, Aperol, artichoke liqueur and bitters, in the case of the A La Bira -- which sound at first as if they had been assembled by walking through a liquor store blindfolded, but which after a closer look reveal a degree of inner logic. If this does not pique your curiosity, the list of wines by the glass is almost long enough to qualify Tsismis as a wine bar, although the choices are not as outré as they are across the street at Wildair . In a city crazy for kakigori , patbingsu and other varieties of flavored snow, Tsismis's halo-halo will probably be an instant hit. Mr. Afzelius has the very good idea of putting coconut sorbet where the shaved ice would usually go; from there he goes to town with coconut jellies and what seems like every fresh fruit he can put his hands on. But discerning collectors of Filipino sweets should note that Tsismis serves excellent silvanas. A silvana is either a shrunken cake or a cookie with big ideas, depending on your perspective. It is made of two cashew meringues that are sandwiched together with buttercream and then painted with more buttercream, which holds cashew crumbs to the outside of the whole package. Once frosted and crumbed, it has to be refrigerated or the buttercream will melt before it gets inside your mouth. No gold leaf adorns the silvanas. It would only get in the way.

{"id": 45, "data": " Last month I had dinner with a friend who lives a thousand miles away and doesn't get to Manhattan as often as he once did. When I asked where he wanted to eat, he answered, a bit wistfully, \"Somewhere that speaks of New York, a city I have lost touch with.\" At first, I looked for a place where we could be in the thick of it all. I thought of Bar Pisellino , that narrow glass sarcophagus run by Rita Sodi and Jody Williams, where you drink your sgroppino standing up between the window along Grove Street and the one along Seventh Avenue. People trickle in, eat some olives and a tuna tramezzino, and head out again. Although it's about the size of a subway car, you get the feeling that if you stayed long enough, you'd eventually see everybody you know. But a restaurant that truly speaks of the place New York has become over the past decade or so would be nearly the opposite of Bar Pisellino. This restaurant would not be in the thick of it all. It would be hushed, sheltered, exclusive, admitting no more than a handful of people at a time. It would protect those people, once they were inside, from crowds spilling in from the street, even from the street itself. It would join the steady march of new tasting counters and omakase hideaways. And it would illustrate the growing ease with which New Yorkers of means can glide through and above the fray, slipping from one cloistered room to another in black cars without touching down. That restaurant would be a lot like Frevo , which has been serving suave, $124 tasting menus with a modern-French sensibility in Greenwich Village for the past four months. Frevo is the work of Franco Sampogna, who is the chef, and Bernardo Silva, the manager. Mr. Sampogna is from Brazil and Mr. Silva comes from Portugal; they met 10 years ago while working in restaurants in France, and quickly decided that one day they would open a restaurant in New York City that would give diners \"that feeling of being in your own secluded safe haven,\" as Mr. Sampogna put it. To get into Frevo, you first need to know that Frevo exists. There's no sign. When you arrive at the correct address, what you see is an art gallery with just enough room on its white walls for the six abstract paintings that hang there fairly close together. The paintings are real paintings made by a real artist, Thomas Labarthe, who goes by Toma-L , but the gallery is not entirely a real gallery. If it were, the young woman who sits there keeping an eye on things would stare blankly ahead when you entered, instead of walking up to you with a smile and reassuring you that, yes, you've come to the right place. Then she reaches behind one of the canvases and it swings out on invisible hinges, leaving in its place a doorway through which you can see, illuminated in a large, dark room, a stainless-steel kitchen and a long, curving counter of polished quartzite. You hop up on one of the 18 padded seats, and the door clicks closed. You are in. When the door opens again, typically not for another half an hour, in will walk another set of people who, like you, knew that the gallery was not a normal gallery. Let's say that the misdirection of the gallery and the secret door do not make these newcomers feel sufficiently insulated from the outside world. Frevo gives them the opportunity to sit at a round chef's table in a back corner around which a curtain can be drawn, as in a hospital room. Much of this comes right out of the neo-speakeasy handbook, although Frevo does throw itself into the act with an unusual level of commitment. The gallery, for instance, installed a new batch of Mr. Labarthe's canvases around Labor Day. But each time I went to Frevo, I stared at that curtain. Nobody ever closed it while I was there, but it still reminded me how easy it is now for some New Yorkers to climb into the treehouse and pull the ladder up behind them. I have to admit, though, that I like Frevo more than I like the version of New York that it brings to mind. The pleasures of this secluded safe haven are real, and Mr. Sampogna's cooking is focused and refined. I haven't been able to get his halibut dish out of my mind, for instance. The fish rests on a thin, crisp platform of fried bread shellacked with a dark mushroom marmalade; this miniature mushroom tart drinks up the flavor of the halibut as it goes, in the oven, from raw to that just-cooked state where its flesh slides apart into thick and almost fluffy white flakes. Alongside the fish are bulbs of melted fennel, their spiced cooking juices boiled down to a bittersweet syrup. Mr. Sampogna's opening salvo often involves quinoa doing something quinoa doesn't usually do, and doing it quite nicely. I liked its freshness when it was used in a salad spooned over a demitasse of creamy hummus; I liked its crunch when it was dehydrated and sprinkled over a few mouthfuls of black lentils topped with glistening orbs of smoked trout roe. A dish from early July brought peas, at the tail end of their season, together with a rich pistachio-tarragon cream and white puffs of coconut mousse: light and charming. I wished Mr. Sampogna had exploited summer produce as sensitively when I went back in August and September. His kitchen is small enough that he could respond to the market day by day, but so far this doesn't seem to interest him. Frevo, at $124 for five courses, is not a huge splurge by New York standards, but servers try to inflate the total by pushing supplements. For $30 you can get Kaluga caviar troweled on to your first course; $20 gets you upgraded to a foie gras torchon instead of the less-thrilling mushrooms with gnocchi; it's $18 for a serving of aged Comté before dessert, and another $30 to have white truffles with the cheese. This tactic is not as grating as it is at Per Se , where the supplements are piled onto a base charge of $355, but it is still a snag in the otherwise smooth hospitality provided by Frevo's small crew of servers and cooks. Everyone I've brought to Frevo has fallen under its spell, which is hard to resist. The music is slinky and sinuous. The room has a nocturnal theatricality; sitting at the counter with darkness behind you facing the spotlighted kitchen can feel like attending an extremely elegant campfire. I still think Frevo is a perfect spot to familiarize yourself with the frictionless New York of 2019. Still, when my out-of-town friend arrived, we had our dinner at Bar Pisellino. We were hungry for a taste of the old chaos. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 46, "data": " Billy Durney, the Brooklyn restaurateur and pitmaster, has been talking for several years about the fried chicken that he planned to bring to Red Hook. At first, there was no reason to doubt him. That the man is comfortable with long time horizons was clear to anyone who watched how patiently he studied the science of indirect heat at his first establishment in the neighborhood, Hometown Bar-B-Que . After Hurricane Sandy flooded streets and knocked out power in the area shortly before the scheduled opening in 2012, he gave away smoked briskets, ribs and shoulders to local residents until electricity was restored almost three weeks later, honing his technique all the while. The years rolled by without a drumstick in sight. But as recently as March, it was still possible to take Mr. Durney at his word when he talked about the star attraction of his nearly completed fried-chicken emporium , to be called Red Hook Tavern. The doors were finally unlocked in July, revealing a row of tables under electrified gas lamps and a row of stools in front of a white-oak bar that looks as if it was built to last at least until Van Brunt Street sinks into the sea. Wearing wallpaper and wainscoting and pressed tin, Red Hook Tavern does a straight-faced impression of a whiskey-simmered New York corner bar of a certain age. The attention to detail was to be expected, given how convincingly Hometown conjures a Texas Hill Country barbecue palace. What was something of a surprise, though, was that chickens were not being fried anywhere on the premises. In fact, Red Hook Tavern's star attraction turned out to be a cheeseburger. To be fair, Mr. Durney probably would not have drummed up much enthusiasm had he gone around telling people he was going to open a bar that served hamburgers. New York has so many of those already that the style they typically serve is a recognized subgenre that George Motz calls \"the New York City pub burger.\" According to Mr. Motz, a filmmaker and author whose work explores all things ground-beef-and-bun-related, the hallmarks of a pub burger are a thicker-than-average patty and a relative lack of adornment. It is the plain, sturdy and hunger-calming burger you get at P.J. Clarke's , JG Melon and Fanelli Cafe in Manhattan and at Donovan's Pub in Queens. Mr. Durney has said that he intends the Red Hook Tavern burger as a homage to the one at Peter Luger Steak House . (You might think that Luger traffics in the style known as the steakhouse burger, but most burger taxonomists agree that what it serves, only at the bar and only at lunch, is a pub burger.) Like Peter Luger, Red Hook Tavern employs a toasted and buttered hard roll with a smattering of sesame seeds -- about as many as the stars you can see in the sky over Manhattan on a very clear night. In both places, the patties are made with some portion of dry-aged prime beef, stand about an inch and a half tall, and possess a dark crust that fills your head with the instinct-triggering aromas and flavors whose creation in browned meat was described by Louis Camille Maillard . There are some minor divergences. At Peter Luger, cheese is optional, while the top and sides of the burger at Red Hook Tavern are tightly wrapped in glossy yellow American cheese by default. A thick cross-section of white onion is laid below the top bun at Luger. At Red Hook Tavern, the onion is stationed below the patty, where it helps keep the bottom bun dry, like a coaster. They give you a half-sour pickle spear and fries, too, which are about the same dimensions. The important difference between the burgers, though, is that lately Peter Luger's have tended to be better in memory than in reality, while the Red Hook Tavern's is, right now, one of the few absolutely mandatory burgers in New York City. The kitchen is overseen by Allison Plumer, a chef who has done most of her cooking in Brooklyn. She has an excellent dry-aged steak -- New York strip, naturally -- impressively browned and served with a small cast-iron skillet full of creamed spinach, a touch so right it may qualify as art. It is the kind of detail that makes Red Hook Tavern something more than a place for the locals to get beer and burgers. Another is the golden chicken gravy with a hint of butterscotch that is ladled into a well in the mashed potatoes that come with the half-chicken, which is advertised as simply pan-roasted, although it has the wonderfully stiff shards of skin you get from weighting down the bird as it cooks. Everybody who has eaten at Red Hook Tavern will tell you to get the country-ham-and-Cheddar croquettes on a creamy pool of whole-grain Dijonnaise. Everybody is right, too. Consensus has also formed around the wedge salad, which is clearly not a wedge, but is still a very fine salad, with blue cheese and a thick, Lugeresque bacon slice flopped over individual leaves of romaine. There is considerably less unanimity about the roasted corn, kernels of which you are supposed to wrap in radicchio that you've first smeared with 'nduja; I'm in the camp that thinks it would be a fine dish for another restaurant. There is no restaurant where I'd be glad to see littlenecks steamed with way too much stale, acrid garlic. Of course, there's no correct amount of stale, acrid garlic, but the kitchen really goes all in. There are two desserts. Both are sundaes . They do not have the thematic inevitability of the creamed spinach, but they're put together with more sophistication than average. The truth is, though, that nothing on the menu gives the burger a real run for its money. What does, or at least equals it as a reason to reserve a table a couple of weeks in advance, is the list of drinks Mr. Durney has put together with Jeff Porter and Kenneth Crum. Mr. Durney's enthusiasm for wines made by small, eccentric producers is on view at Hometown, surely the only place on earth where you can drink Milan Nasterec's skin-fermented Moravian pinot noir alongside a taco filled with a slice of barbecued brisket and, in lieu of salsa, a glowing yellow stripe of queso. Mr. Durney indulges his curiosity more deeply at the tavern. Ten grower Champagnes can be had for under $100 a bottle, and there's a $40 sparkling red from Maryland. Darlings of the nonconformist wine movement such as Radikon , Marcel Lapierre and Frank Cornelissen are all given the space you'd expect, but there are also less familiar names like Subject to Change , a Forestville, Calif., outfit that has the peculiar idea of making a bright-toned, low-alcohol zinfandel-syrah blend and calling it Moon Juice. A small number of brews from Other Half, Folksbier and Threes Brewing, leading lights of the Brooklyn suds scene, are on tap, along with uncredited light and dark ales billed as \"A Tribute To McSorleys Ale House.\" McSorley's, famously, has you buy two mugs at once, which Red Hook Tavern doesn't do. It's less well known that McSorley's serves a burger. Like the one at Luger, it's only available at lunch. It is, of course, a pub burger.

{"id": 47, "data": " There are no roving carts loaded with bamboo steamer baskets at the new Chinese restaurant Hutong , no menu cards to be stamped each time you take a dish of har gow or turnip cake. In fact, dim sum is only a small portion of what the menu offers at Hutong, which opened in Midtown in July. But you would do well to make it a large portion of what you order, because only one or two other restaurants in town can plausibly claim to make dim sum that rivals Hutong's. Where else will you find cooks who have the dexterity to make Wagyu-beef mille-feuilles whose flaky layers of pastry overlap each other by only a few millimeters, like the feathers on a songbird's wing? Who can craft steamed buns that look just like shiitake mushrooms, which happen to be the chief ingredient in their filling? Or who knows the secret that allows the crunchy, chewy, charcoal-black mini-footballs stuffed with pork (in what is known in Sichuan as \"fish-fragrant\" seasoning) to sparkle as if diamond chips had been kneaded into the dough? There is real skill in the kitchen at Hutong. You see it most clearly in the dim sum, but much of the other cooking evinces the kind of discipline, precision and technical mastery that has rarely been seen in this city over the past few decades, to the dismay of eaters who know what Chinese food is capable of. \"While expensive French restaurants in New York can hold their own against many places in Paris, if you want to move beyond steamed dumplings and stir-fries to experience the complexity of Chinese banquet cuisine, the possibilities grow dimmer each year,\" Ruth Reichl wrote in The New York Times in 1998. She gave reasons for the poor showing, including talented chefs being paid more in Hong Kong and China. That is as true as it was 21 years ago, but what has changed is the rise of global Chinese restaurant groups, from the disappointing duck specialist DaDong to the surprisingly solid Hao Noodle outposts and, now, to Hutong. The original Hutong opened in 2003 on the 28th floor of a glass tower overlooking the Hong Kong harbor, but the dining room tries to conjure the atmosphere of Beijing's vanishing premodern alleys, or hutongs, by means of red paper lanterns, carved wooden doors and birdcages. The Manhattan branch makes a different impression. The entrance is on the east side of the circular driveway below the Bloomberg Building between East 58th and 59th Streets. Turn right and you are in a narrow hallway between two soaring glass stacks of wine bottles, every one of them for decorative purposes only. Turn left and you are in a glittering, soaring, hard-edge dining room. The inspiration seems to be Art Deco with a pinch of cocaine; the blue leather banquettes, beveled mirrors and chandeliers of mirror-polished steel could come from the set of a nightclub in some cross between \" Scarface \" and \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\" A guest who has lived in China allowed his eyes to adjust to the glinting light as he looked toward the ceiling, which seemed to be far away. \"It's very … yin,\" he said. Hutong is ostensibly a Northern Chinese restaurant. This is more apparent in Hong Kong than in Manhattan, where the menu has been pruned to about half the size. Lamb, a mainstay in the northern provinces, was represented in August by a single dish, cumin-speckled ribs roasted languorously to a mind-altering tenderness. By the time of my last visit, lamb had ambled off the menu entirely. The most famous preparation from northern China, Peking duck, arrived at my table worse for wear and tear, carved haphazardly, with blobs of unmelted fat clinging to limp skin. The second course, a dark-meat stir-fry to be folded in iceberg lettuce, was more skillfully done, but the sting of paying $84 for a whole duck with uncrisp skin lingered. Much of what hasn't been trimmed from the Hong Kong menu comes from Sichuan. So does Fei Wang, the executive chef of the New York branch, and a native of Chengdu. Most recently seen running the kitchen of the Hutong in London, Mr. Wang weaves chiles -- fresh, dried, roasted, pickled, name it -- into nearly everything. In the dish known as Red Lantern, the whole dried peppers the size of cherries are mostly decorative; fried soft-shell crabs are buried under the chiles in a pan with an arcing bamboo handle, like jelly beans in the plastic grass of an Easter basket. The ground spices on the crabs' shatteringly brittle crust -- lightly sweet and more aromatic than searingly hot -- may remind you of a Chinese rice-cracker snack you grew up on, or it may make you think of Old Bay. Fermented chiles provide an electric buzz, and a modicum of heat, to the steamed halibut that arrives boxed up inside a red bell pepper and sitting on a nest of rice noodles. (The pepper opens into a six-pointed star that gives the dish its name, halibut red star noodles.) Kou shui chicken is nearly submerged in an orange lake of excellent chile oil, although the adroit way the oil is balanced by rice vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger and other flavors is what gives Hutong one of the city's most impressive versions of this traditional cold dish. If Hutong has another appetizer that equals it, I haven't found it yet. I did, however, have a cryptic encounter with a log-cabin stack of okra doused in a sweet wasabi sauce, and an inconclusive rendezvous with some steamed asparagus stalks whose tips were enrobed in white sesame sauce; it was as if somebody had tried to replicate strawberries dipped in white chocolate without access to strawberries or white chocolate. You could attempt to unknot these mysteries. Then again, you could simply begin your meal with dim sum. And then, after picking your way through the chile-besotted main courses, you could end it that way, too. There is a dessert that mimics the shape of a steamed bun, pleated and twisted into a pucker at the top. It is made of white chocolate, the wrapper on this trompe l'oeil bao, and filled with white sesame cream and a core of bittersweet salted caramel. Alongside it is a single scoop of ice cream made from lightly sweetened soy milk. The soy milk is extremely fresh. I don't mean that the carton won't expire for another three weeks; I mean that somebody in the kitchen was squeezing the soybeans shortly before the ice cream was frozen. This is a snack from a Chinese childhood, bread and a glass of milk, and it would be hard, after several courses of spice, to think of anything more welcome.

{"id": 48, "data": " Four summers ago, a young chef named José Luis Chávez began leveraging the poke craze and the salad-bowl trend into a string of fast-casual ceviche bars. He began with a counter in the Gansevoort Market food hall called Mission Ceviche ; there is now another in Canal Street Market and a third is supposed to open in Norwalk, Conn., later this year. At all locations, the stock-in-trade is citrus-marinated raw fish with sweet potatoes and kernels of chubby Andean corn, in both its soft and crunchy forms. This is of course the standard Peruvian formula, but Mr. Chávez had the inspiration of serving his ceviche in a clear plastic bowl over a base of salad, rice or, for a dollar more, quinoa. The supplemental ingredients make a plausible desk lunch out of a dish that some New Yorkers still aren't quite sure what to do with. The surprising thing about Mission Ceviche's salad bowls is that they taste like real Peruvian food. The raw fish is firm and cold and neatly cut up into solid pieces that hold their shape. The leche de tigre marinade in Mr. Chávez's \"ceviche clásico\" is a bright and precise cocktail of lime and rocoto chiles, although you might wish that the rocotos had been applied with a little less restraint. You get a higher-caliber shot of spice, this time from ají amarillo chiles, in the ceviche mixto, a combination of octopus, shrimp and fluke enveloped in a creamy, goldenrod-colored leche de tigre. The clásico is accessorized with sweet potato purée; the mixto gets avocado purée, too. The purées are piped out of pastry bags like buttercream roses on a wedding cake, and they are delicious. When I wandered into the Gansevoort Market location in February, it seemed clear that Mr. Chávez could run an interesting restaurant if he ever decided to put his food into something other than recyclable salad bowls. Then, at the beginning of the summer, he did just that, opening a sit-down restaurant on the Upper East Side with real plates and bowls. The new space is not particularly large or lavish, but compared with the earlier efforts, Mission Ceviche Restaurant & Bar is a palace. There is seating for 65 or so people beneath a wall sculpture of a fish that glows from behind and a pink neon sign that reads \"tiger milk effect,\" probably a reference to the belief that drinking leftover leche de tigre can put extra topspin on sexual performance. The menu now paints a slightly fuller picture of Peruvian cuisine, extending into new foods including the grilled skewers known as anticuchos. Mr. Chávez dresses up the country's most popular anticucho, grilled beef heart, brushing it with a creamy rocoto sauce and serving it with newly fried blue potato chips and kernels of choclo corn. The trio of rocoto, blue potatoes and choclo is so solidly Peruvian that it can withstand the chimichurri that Mr. Chávez brings in, by way of Argentina, as a final touch. He clearly has a soft spot for chimichurri because he deploys it again with the shrimp anticuchos (the shrimp are very big and look even bigger because they're grilled with their heads on), served with a squirt of huancaína, the spicy yellow cheese sauce that is something like Peru's version of queso dip. My favorite anticucho is a more straightforward situation, grilled scallops under arugula, lime zest and a smooth Parmesan fondue. But Mr. Chávez has the ability to put several flavors in motion at once and keep his balance, as evidenced by the beef-heart skewer and his octopus causa. This is, reduced to bare bones, a tendril of octopus curled around a disc of mashed potatoes. But the potatoes, seasoned with lime and yellow chiles, are coated in a smooth lavender-colored sauce made from Peruvian black olives; the octopus has been rubbed with cumin, oregano and ají panca paste and grilled to a crackle; the plate is decorated with a few wobbly curls of paper made with purple Peruvian potatoes. Mission Ceviche's servers, while eager to be helpful, have a habit of singling out the most obvious dishes -- the classic ceviche, the octopus leg -- and pushing them so hard you might suspect the rest of the menu is a minefield. It isn't. There is nothing to avoid unless the kitchen brings back the bizarre strawberry-kiwi ceviche that showed up as a special one night. If you are being herded into getting the \"Peruvian paella,\" you should know that the other three main courses are also worth looking into, like the ají de gallina, shredded chicken breast in a creamy ají amarillo sauce that is both soothing and spicy; or the seco norteño, a slowly braised short rib in cilantro sauce. All are larger than average, too. Still, nothing on the menu quite rivals the ceviches. They are served, yes, without lettuce or rice, and they are better for it. Mr. Chávez's creative engine seems to have a high idle, and he has come up with different ways to present dishes that are also on the menu at the fast-casual counters. The \"Nikkei\" ceviche, for instance -- tuna in a kind of modified ponzu sauce seasoned with ají amarilllo and togarashi -- now comes with watermelon and a bloop of ginger foam that would never survive a trip from the food court back to the office. Neither would the odd but intriguing attempt at a vegetarian ceviche where the fish is replaced by shiitakes and the leche de tigre takes the form of snow, frozen by liquid nitrogen. The art of ceviche-making has at least as much in common with mixology as with cooking, so it is no surprise that the cocktails are well calibrated and sing out with fresh lime. There is a twist on the pisco sour made with passion-fruit juice and another with the purple-corn drink chicha morada, although neither quite achieves the bracing elegance of the original. And it's nice to see the less well-known chilcano, a pisco highball made with lime juice and ginger ale. (Would ginger beer be better?) Chicha morada appears again in the raspadilla dessert. This time it is a syrup poured over shaved ice and sprinkled with lucuma foam. When I had the raspadilla, it was sprinkled with candied pecan crumbs but in a phone interview on Monday Mr. Chávez said he had replaced the nuts with crumbled Oreos.

{"id": 49, "data": " New York is getting crowded with hot pots. The city is not yet in the same league as, say, Chongqing, where the dish is said to have originated and where an association dedicated to keeping track of such things says there are about 50,000 places to eat it. New York, by my count, has a mere two or three dozen, most of them in the sections of Brooklyn, Queens and Lower Manhattan that have considerable Chinese populations. But new hot pot restaurants seem to arrive every few weeks, with some independent operators among a growing number of chains from China. Downtown Flushing, Queens, has Little Sheep Hot Pot , founded in Inner Mongolia and one of the first hot pot purveyors in New York to move beyond the all-you-can-eat model, which led to widespread improvement in ingredient quality; Mister Hotpot, known among the city's pig worshipers for its creamy, ivory-toned pork-bone broth; and Liuyishou Hot Pot , a Chongqing-based concern where the spiced beef tallow that is an essential component of Sichuan hot pot is molded into the shape of a smiling, bow-tied cow. Farther south in Flushing is Niu Pot , the city's best hot pot establishment by several measures, including the number and complexity of its broths. Niu Pot cooks a very good winter-melon soup and serves it inside the melon's hollow shell, although it is most widely known for serving marbled slices of raw beef wrapped tightly around a Barbie doll , like a dress for Lady Gaga . In Manhattan, hot pot outposts have been planted along the Bowery in a line advancing toward Chinatown, starting with Zhen Wei Fang . If there had been a hot pot restaurant in \"Blade Runner,\" it would have looked like Zhen Wei Fang, an import from Miami that has private booths, simultaneous videos projected side by side on the walls and a robot host by the entrance. (Adding to the sense of a future gone awry, the robot wasn't working the last time I went.) A few blocks south is Tang Hotpot , probably the most luxe hot pot in the city. The menu is illustrated with still-life ingredient photographs that look as if Vermeer painted them, and the pictures aren't that far off from reality. Almost all of these emporiums offer Sichuan hot pot, a broth covered in a deep slice of chile oil in which dried red chiles, Sichuan peppercorns and various other spices churn around like the remains of toy sailboats after a hurricane. But Da Long Yi Hot Pot, which opened in May in a second-story space above Canal Street, has the advantage over most of its competitors of having originated in Sichuan. Its home base, from which more than 200 Da Long Yis have issued, is the provincial capital of Chengdu. Chongqing was administratively sheared from the rest of the province in 1997. Although you key your name into a touch pad at the top of the stairs to get on Da Long Yi's waiting list, and you learn that your table is ready from an automated text, you order by penciling an X on the paper menu, in a box next to the item you want. The menu also suggests the length of time each item should be held down in the boiling soup. It goes without saying that you will want a Sichuan hot pot at Da Long Yi. You will be asked whether you want it mild, medium or spicy, although in my experience there isn't much difference. A more important question is whether you will cook your meal in Sichuan broth alone; in a split pot with Sichuan broth on one side and either tomato or mushroom broth, neither of them spicy, on the other; or in a three-chambered pot with some of each. The narrow range of choices can be an advantage for a novice hot potter, who might be swamped by the maximalist menus at Tang or Niu Pot. The split pots make Da Long Yi a good place to take somebody with a low tolerance for heat, although as a practical matter it is impossible to eat a Sichuan hot pot meal without ingesting at least a spoonful or two of chile oil. Old hands know that the oil tends to pool away from the region of the broth that is bubbling most furiously, and ingredients that, after cooking, are removed from the pot in this area will emerge relatively clean. Whether this is desirable varies from eater to eater and from ingredient to ingredient. Deeply furrowed, folded or layered foods -- the Kungfu beef tripe spread out on a mound of chipped ice; the tofu skins; the fried dough sticks known as youtiao or, on Da Long Yi's menu, \"fried bun\" -- retain spicy oil in quantities that may become challenging. Extremely smooth items, like the hard-cooked quail eggs, the rabbit kidneys speared on a toothpick, or the long and surprisingly slippery tubes of duck intestine, on the other hand, can survive a trip through the deepest patch of chile oil without any appreciable damage. You can, if you like, follow the custom of Chengdu or Chongqing by focusing on ingredients that are prized more for feel than flavor. The duck intestines, for instance, which quickly contract in the hot broth and come out about 30 seconds later with the texture of barely cooked squid. Or the pale ivory sheets of flattened artery, which after cooking about twice as long have a long-lasting chew that reminds me of geoduck. On the other hand, more flavorful ingredients, once they've cooked for a few minutes, can help punch up the broths, which aren't quite as deep or complex as they are at some other hot pot providers. This does not apply to the lengths of corn on the cob, which don't taste like anything to begin with. And I would avoid the \"vegetable platter,\" which was more like a lettuce platter. But it is useful to keep in mind that if you toss sliced king oyster mushrooms, or crown daisy greens, or bands of kelp tied into knots, or even the Hershey's Kiss-shaped fish balls with gooey orange roe inside, into the soup and forget about them for a while, both the ingredients and the soup will rise to the occasion. Some ingredients, though, you hold in your chopsticks, watching for 30 seconds or a minute until you can see they're ready. The marble tiles of Wagyu rib are in this category, and the New Zealand lamb shaved as thin as prosciutto, and the Kurobuta pork belly from Japan. The whole prawns on wooden skewers will be tender and running with juices in just over a minute. The sweet, small flounder fillets might need twice that. Even if you are careful to pull these bites out in the bubbling center of the pot, away from the oil, the chiles and Sichuan peppercorns will catch up with you sooner or later. They build up on your tongue, they slowly infiltrate your dipping sauce, and the mala tingle will take over. There is no fighting it at that point, of course, though a bowl of white rice is a good investment in the future. And when conversation at the table has stopped completely, when the water you keep pouring into sadistically small cups won't help any more, there is one thing that will: fresh watermelon juice, sold by the carafe.

{"id": 50, "data": " Lately I have fallen under the spell of an East Village restaurant called Foxface . The cooking there is hard to pin down, geographically. Stopping in a few weeks ago, I ate Low Countryish wild red shrimp on grits, with sweet corn off the cob and a potent saffron-lobster sauce. More recently, I had skinless pork sausage inspired by sai ua, the spicy and tangy specialty identified with the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai. The soft tripe I enjoyed the other weekend had been simmered with 'nduja, the fiery and malleable Calabrian sausage, and then covered with a few thin shingles of shaved pecorino. If I had started hanging around at Foxface sooner, especially during the cold months after its opening, in February, I might have run into a wider variety of cuisines and main ingredients. I did manage to get some of the elk osso buco while that was still on the menu. I never got to try the wild hare, though, stewed in red wine with a bit of chocolate and thickened with its own blood, a formula that students of very old-guard French cooking will recognize as lièvre à la royale. Nor did I make it in time for the venison, left to bubble for hours in white wine with mushrooms and dark juniper berries. The Foxface dish I may never forgive myself for missing, though, is the kebabs served with preserved lemons and tahini, because the kebabs were made from ground lamb and camel. Although these foods may lack any unifying cultural background, they did have one thing in common: They were all served on rolls. Apart from an occasional salad or soup, everything cooked at Foxface arrives in sandwich form. And with the exception of a muffuletta that briefly manifested a few months back, every sandwich at Foxface is filled with hot, cooked meat or seafood or vegetables. In Mexico, certain taco stands specialize in tacos de guisado, tortillas filled with one kind of stew or another. Most of Foxface's offerings are, in effect, sandwiches de guisado. Which reminds me of another impressive Foxface sandwich, a magenta and green tangle of cilantro stems and pickled onions pressed into an engagingly tart pile of pork, marinated in sour orange juice and roasted very slowly under a banana leaf in emulation of cochinita pibil from the Yucatán. There is no guarantee that any of these items will be available when you go to Foxface. The menu is printed daily and taped up next to the window on St. Marks Place where most of the business is transacted. Sometimes a new sandwich appears after the printed menu has already been posted, so it will be written out by hand on a card that has in its upper left corner the restaurant's logo, a drawing of an elegant fox in cat's-eye glasses with a cigarette holder in one gloved hand. The sandwiches have names like It's What's 'Nside (for the tripe with 'nduja) or 120 BPM (bison heart with tahini and \"many spices\"). The Smoking Fox is sold every day. It is filled with smoked pork rib the color of a dry rosé, separated from the bones and covered with coleslaw, pickles and a few splashes of habanero-orange vinegar. Your mind, of course, goes either to Memphis or to the McRib , and neither is exactly wrong, but the meat is of a superior grade and is smoked with the attention to timing and nuance that characterizes Foxface's cooking. It's a great sandwich. To place an order, you lean in to the window and speak with Sivan Lahat, who owns and runs Foxface with Ori Kushnir, her partner in life and in sandwiches. They immigrated to New York from Israel almost 20 years ago and have lived here ever since, apart from a brief flirtation with the Midwest and a longer experimental period in Tokyo. While they were in Japan, they operated a pop-up restaurant, which is the closest either of them came to running a food business before opening Foxface. Like the fox in the logo, Ms. Lahat has coppery hair and wears cat's-eye glasses. She prepares the orders in the room behind the window, which measures 48 square feet. Inside the building, under the stairs, Foxface has a second room. Mr. Kushnir thinks it could be as large as 14 square feet. A variety of equipment is stowed in the two rooms, including three induction burners, a roaster, a smoker and a dishwasher. After business hours, some of it comes out as Mr. Kushnir supervises the more time-consuming roasts and stews. He describes the food that he and Ms. Lahat cook as \"dishes we like to eat, reimagined as sandwiches.\" I like to eat a lot of the same dishes, as it happens, but they have been hard to come by lately, especially those shapeless brown stews that are so out of style. Following some of the world's most influential chefs and shamed, perhaps, by the unflattering lenses of a million amateur photographers, restaurants have shifted away from plain and plain-looking cooking. The subtlety and the thrill of plain cooking comes from searing, simmering, reducing, skimming and so on. All the people who own Instant Pots know this, but the segment of the restaurant scene with artistic leanings has forgotten it, focusing instead on plating, arranging six or seven things in some photogenic design and hoping they will cohere. Slapping a roll on it is one way to get a shapeless brown stew ready for its close-up, although it has to be said that on the mean streets of Instagram, an elk osso buco sandwich is no match for a rainbow unicorn ice cream sundae. Because space is at a premium, there is no room to sit and eat your Smoking Fox at Foxface itself. You can, however, take it to a table a few steps away inside an adjoining business called the William Barnacle Tavern . This is a reassuringly gloomy bar that is said to have originated as a speakeasy. Model ships and other nautical paraphernalia are strewn about, references to the rumrunning operation a former owner of the building presided over during Prohibition. (The stairs that Foxface's dishwasher is housed below lead to an exhibition space called the Museum of the American Gangster .) The bar's current owner has resisted some modern conveniences. Most of the lighting at night comes from small candles, and all of the music is provided by old films -- of Irish folk recitals, Cab Calloway concerts -- that run in looping, watery projections on the back wall. All Foxface sandwiches are presented in a trim little white box that can be unfolded into a place mat. You can purchase an Italian fruit soda for $3 from Foxface, or buy alcohol from the tavern. The beer is not expensive, but the specialty of the house is absinthe. Most patrons drink theirs diluted with ice water poured from a four-spigot absinthe fountain at the end of the bar. The bartender will make absinthe cocktails, too, including the one Ernest Hemingway supposedly invented that is just absinthe and Champagne in a big glass .

{"id": 51, "data": " Some restaurants push their tasting menus. Rezdôra doesn't. A few steps down from the sidewalk, on the same block of East 20th Street as Gramercy Tavern and the brownstone where Teddy Roosevelt was born, Rezdôra lists a \"regional pasta tasting\" for $90 on its menu. The region in question is Emilia-Romagna, whose refinements in the art of rolling and saucing noodles are admired even by Italians from other parts of the country. Chances are that most of the five pastas in the tasting are exactly the ones you picture when you think about Emilia-Romagna, starting with tortellini in brodo. This would seem to make it an easy sell, and yet servers at Rezdôra never tried to sell me on the tasting. Until I asked about it one night, I had never seen the separate menu card that describes each course. With some hesitation, I ordered it. Every one of the pastas was excellent, and one or two would be worth walking a long distance for. After the fifth course was gone, it slowly dawned on me that Stefano Secchi, Rezdôra's chef and one of its owners, had just laid down a straight flush. The tortellini were penny-size hoops rolled around minced and blended pork in a parcel just big enough to suggest the idea of meat. \"This is a special broth made from older chickens,\" a server said as he poured a steaming liquid from a kettle over the tortellini. It was the color of turkey gravy. The broth spent about half a day on the burner; drew some of its power from melted Parmigiano-Reggiano; and was more intense than canned chicken broth in roughly the same way that a dry-aged rib-eye is more intense than a McDonald's all-beef patty. This was followed by a smooth, almost fluffy tomato-basil sauce over maccheroni al pettine, delicate tubes with ridges they get from being rolled by hand along a comb made for the job. Three straw-colored blobs that looked like melted Brie turned out to be a glossy and wonderful fonduta made from Parmigiano-Reggiano. From there it was on to tortelloni, each about three bites big, filled with plush fresh ricotta and shiny with melted brown butter in which a few sage leaves had been bubbled. If we are talking about Emilia-Romagna we have to talk about ragù, and that was the next course, tossed with slim ribbons of tagliolini. Some people will find the ragù saltier than they like. Almost everyone will find it more tender and smooth than the last 20 or 30 ragús they ate. The tour winds down with round, meat-filled anolini, a branch of the ravioli family that resides in Parma. They are served in something called crema di Parmigiano; you will not be far off if you imagine an Alfredo sauce cooked for one of the more sybaritic Roman emperors. This is not Rome, though, and the sauce gets the tart counterpoint it needs from an inky, 25-year-old balsamic vinegar poured straight from the bottle. Mr. Secchi blew into town in May on a small gust of publicity whipped up over his time at Osteria Francescana , the Modena workshop where Massimo Bottura reconfigures the touchstone flavors of the region in dishes with names like \"memories of a mortadella sandwich.\" Mr. Bottura's approach to menu writing seems to have rubbed off on Mr. Secchi more than his experimental urges did. At Rezdôra, you are unlikely to catch the kitchen using any overtly modernist techniques, but you may well encounter \"cherry season in Vignola,\" a pleasant if somewhat too soupy plate of stracciatella with toasted almonds, almond milk and cherries both sweet and sour; or \"cow grazing in Emilia-Romagna,\" a sirloin basted with butter whose richness is modulated by a sauce of sweet red peppers; or \"Grandma walking through forest in Emilia,\" a transfixing plate of mushroom purée, slivered snap-pea pods and little hats of spinach pasta filled with braised leeks. If we are tracing influences, though, Mr. Secchi's cooking at Rezdôra seems to have been molded at least as deeply by his time working at the pasta station of another restaurant in Modena, Hosteria Giusti . Laura Galli Morandi, Giusti's chef, steadfastly defends the style of the local nonna tradition that Mr. Secchi channels in his pasta tasting and other parts of his menu. Like a meal in Giusti's four-table dining room, one at Rezdôra can and probably should start with prosciutto and other manifestations of salted pork draped over warm pillows of fried dough called gnocchi fritti. Before leaving Italy, Mr. Secchi also cooked at Antica Moka in Modena and All'Enoteca in the Piedmont; after coming back home to Dallas, where he grew up, he ran the kitchens of two restaurants his parents own there. Still, I suspect the Bottura connection is responsible for the speed with which the bar stools fill up when the restaurant opens at 5:30 each night, for the difficulty of reserving one of the other 48 seats, and for the way would-be customers collect in eddies outside the door to strategize. Not much about the interior is likely to lure crowds; with its brick walls, timbered ceiling and bare wood tables, it looks like any number of Manhattan restaurants that emulate the trattorias, enotecas and osterias of Italy. And of course, people who eat at Rezdôra have a way of becoming repeat customers. They come back even though it is still a young restaurant and occasionally makes a young restaurant's mistakes. One night, the stewed cannellini beans placed alongside black sea bass and black garlic zabaglione were still crunchy; the rock shrimp served with strozzapreti could have been a little less tough and tasted a little shrimpier. And some of the original pastas aren't quite as stunning as the classics, but then every grandmother in Emilia-Romagna could have told you that. Mr. Secchi is still one of the most appealing new talents in years to enter the city's Italian restaurant scene, the kind of cook who can unite ordinary people who just like to eat pasta and the fanatics who collect menus from Osteria Francescana. (The date-stamped copy of the regional tasting menu that's given out at the end of the night, signed by Mr. Secchi and his kitchen crew, must be for this crowd.) He also has the good luck to come along when some of the figures who dominated New York's Italian landscape for the past two decades or so have either disappeared or gone into hibernation. There is one more workplace that I hope has left a mark on Mr. Secchi: his parents' restaurants in Texas, both of which are called Ferrari's Italian Villa & Chop House . The first has been in business since 1983, a life span that any restaurateur would envy. The odds are against Rezdôra's being around 36 years from now, but Mr. Secchi and his business partner have made one move that tends to be associated with longevity in New York restaurants. They bought the building. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 52, "data": " In the fall of 1980, Patrick Clark, the first chef at Keith McNally's first restaurant, the Odeon , helped introduce nouvelle cuisine to New York when it was all the rage in Europe. Nearly every place Mr. McNally has built since then has been a firm rejection of all that is fashionable in food, and each one has been, at least in its first few months, the most fashionable restaurant in town. The one he opened in early June in the meatpacking district, Pastis , was assembled partly from the salvaged bones of a nearby restaurant he closed five years ago, Pastis. (He salvaged the name, too.) The onion soup, the meaty snails sloshing around in the divots of a black iron snail pan with what must be half a pint of garlic butter, and a few other old war horses from the original menu have been summoned for one more joust on the battlefield. In short, the new Pastis takes almost everything straight from the old Pastis , which in turn took almost everything from the stodgiest, least trend-conscious sort of French cafes and brasseries. Needless to say, reservations are harder to come by than at any other New York restaurant that's opened this year. The paradox of this is that Pastis is really meant for those nights when you decide to cancel your reservations at the little nine-seat tasting counter where the menu is inspired by Kieslowski's \"Decalogue.\" It is for those times when you get an urge to eat a Gruyère omelet after 10 p.m., cooked medium-rare, flecked with herbs, skillfully rolled and staunchly backed up by a cold white from the Savoie. Urges like that do not typically announce themselves three weeks in advance, and they don't tend to survive exposure to rooms filled with people who have read about Pastis on the blogs but haven't yet figured out what it is for. For much of his life, Mr. McNally has been chipping, cracking, distressing and weathering interiors that are the architectural equivalent of rumpled sweaters two sizes too large. Perhaps the largest and certainly the most rumpled of all is Pastis. It doesn't have the corner entrance it had at its former address, or the long communal table that sliced through the front room like a surfboard. And the shelves of cigarette packs are definitely gone. ( You could still smoke in restaurants in 1999, when Pastis opened.) But the magazine racks are back, along with the overhead fans turning steadily below a stamped tin ceiling. Once again the walls are covered with chipped subway tiles, white, framed by black grout. The chairs still don't match. The ambient light is the color of a Scotch and soda and makes everybody look the way they do after you've drunk one. On an antique mirror, or one that looks like an antique, someone has scrawled a menu of desserts, almost none of which Pastis actually serves. You can, however, get an energetically whisked dark-chocolate mousse under shaved curls of chocolate, or a baba au rhum so drenched in booze that it might spontaneously combust if it weren't being restrained by a white dune of whipped Chantilly cream. The most significant change from the first Pastis to the second happened offstage. Mr. McNally, who had a stroke two years ago, has brought on the restaurateur Stephen Starr as a partner who, essentially, manages everything except the design. Familiar faces from La Mercerie and other Starr enterprises work alongside loyal retainers from the McNally empire. The McNally troops are exquisitely poised, self-assured, able to spot a misplaced butter knife from across the street. The Starr cadre is more casual, and occasionally a server will ask your opinion of \"the flavors so far,\" a question that has surely never been uttered at Minetta Tavern . Mr. Starr has oversight of the wine list, which is less conservative than a typical McNally lineup, and of the food, which has not been a strong suit of the McNally organization since the chefs Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr went out on their own. Pastis's chef, Michael Abt, was until recently in charge of the kitchen at the Washington restaurant Le Diplomate , which Mr. Starr owns. Better qualifications would be hard to conjure, given that Le Diplomate is essentially an imitation McNally restaurant. Taking his cues from the old days, Mr. Abt is putting out simple, unadorned, hunger-obliterating French cuisine drawn from the era before supermarkets and fast food. The salad of pickled herring and carrots with boiled potatoes might come straight from Brasserie Lipp . The country pâté is laden with chicken livers and riddled with soft white pork fat in gobs the size of gumdrops, although it could stand more salt, and I'd be happy to trade the slab of butter that comes with it for a pot of mustard. The pâté is made in house, as is the gorgeously smooth boudin blanc. With the boudin, you want puréed potatoes that are almost liquid. That is what you get. You might argue that, when it offers chilled king crab legs to be dipped in aioli, this unextravagant cafe breaks character. Does the same apply to garnishing sardines served in the can with an ingot of prized, costly butter made by Jean-Yves Bordier? Maybe. I thought, in any case, that the sardines and the olive oil they are packed in tended to talk over the butter. The half roast chicken is not in the same class as the birds that Antoine Westermann cooked when he was still at Le Coq Rico , but it is probably as good a roast chicken as any normal restaurant can produce. The duck in olives, though, is misconceived; the sauce is thin, acrid and one-dimensional instead of head-spinningly rich, the way it is at Allard in Paris . The seafood -- the trout amandine with its sautéed skin taut beneath its armor of toasted almonds; steamed mussels in a lemon broth that's satiny with melted butter; an entire steamed branzino with enough crisp summer vegetables to make a salad -- is very appealing, though that won't stop the people who are going to get steak frites without even a glance at the menu. Those people may get fries that are crunchy and golden, or they might end up with a limp, oily batch, or they may get both in the same night, as I did. At the length of 20 years, memories are untrustworthy, but I'm reasonably sure the food at Pastis is better than it used to be. The wine is certainly more interesting. What's gone, and won't be back now that the surrounding addresses have been taken over by shops like Loro Piana, Sephora, Hermès and RH, is the pure downtown electricity Pastis once generated. Sharing real estate with meat cutters in blood-smeared aprons and prostitutes in dresses as tight as the skins on a boudin blanc, Pastis did a drop-dead perfect imitation of the coolest restaurant in France. The French part was fake, but the cool was real. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 53, "data": " The high cost of doing business in New York takes a toll on many restaurants in the long run, but it can also lead to compromises whose shortcomings become part of the fun -- for diners, at least. If Darryl and Melissa Burnette had been able to afford to rent a space bigger than 275 square feet for their restaurant, Belle Harlem , Mr. Burnette might do the cooking behind a wall instead of behind a counter. Ms. Burnette, his wife and business partner, might spend all night going in and out a swinging kitchen door instead of paying attention to the customers sitting at the 12 seats in the restaurant's single room. At this point, after three years in business, Belle Harlem might be run by employees, and the Burnettes might come in a few times a week to keep an eye on things. Instead they have a paid staff of one. His name is Alex Geudelekian. He was eating dinner there one night, noticed that the weeds were growing up around Mr. Burnette's ankles, asked if he needed help, and has been the sous-chef ever since. The smell of foie gras gravy with duck breast being seared on one of the three induction burners might not rush up to meet you when you step through the door, on the opposite side of Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard from Striver's Row. You might not hear the hiss of chicken being fried inside buttermilk batter before it is arranged between standing partitions of pizzelle and tied together by an amber river of truffled maple syrup warmed with jalapeños and bananas. If you didn't hear the low roar of a Searzall torch as it warms a plate and then melts and browns a patch of Cheddar, you might not know that you're about to be served Mr. Burnette's cheese-steak crostini. (These are small toasts stacked with seared filet and melted cheese, and in between are onions that have been caramelized until they're sweet enough to be a dessert topping. The Cheddar would cause every Philadelphian who lives within 10 blocks of East Passyunk Avenue to pick up the nearest blunt object, but it makes a certain amount of sense when you taste it.) Some of Belle Harlem's space limitations are, in fact, a little constricting. When the place is full, some customers have to ride sidesaddle, their knees angled away from the counter, because if they faced it head-on they'd cut off the narrow path to the restroom in the back. But 275 square feet are what the Burnettes have to work with, and they have made this shallow sliver into something rare not just in Harlem but in all Manhattan. One of the peculiarities of dining in the city, circa 2019, is that the more high-functioning a restaurant is, the less likely you are to encounter a proprietor. There are exceptions, of course, but often the most successful restaurateurs are very busy people, so they leave their dining rooms in the hands of professional managers. Proprietors aren't always as smooth as professionals, but they are as attuned to what goes on in their dining rooms as new parents are to the noises coming from a bassinet. I never quite felt as if I were attending a dinner party in the Burnettes' apartment, which is the feeling they say they're going for, but I always knew I was in a place that somebody cared about. Their original plan was to feed everyone the same meal -- a tasting menu. \"We found out pretty quickly Harlem wasn't ready,\" Mr. Burnette said in an interview. How quickly? \"We tried one night.\" Belle Harlem rolled out an à la carte menu the next day. It stuck. The first half is given to smaller plates, although one of the hallmarks of the restaurant is that the Burnettes don't serve anything truly small. They want you to eat. Two people could get away with ordering one main course and two appetizers, though I'd urge anyone going to Belle Harlem not to overlook dessert. These introductory dishes are where Mr. Burnette takes casual American vernacular food like chicken and waffles out for a stroll. His fried chicken has a convoluted, frilly crust, with plenty of golden surface area for the jalapeño-banana syrup to get lost in. The pizzelles are a new idea of his, replacing the regular waffles he used to make, and they work best when he cooks them to a dark crisp. This is also where you'll find the cheese-steak crostini, as well as spring rolls stuffed with macaroni and cheese -- kid food in a fried shell, yes, but a bacon marmalade with fresh dill makes it unexpectedly complex, a chef's dish. The bottom of the menu is more substantial: The pan-seared, smoked pork tenderloin, for instance, is bigger than what usually crosses a 12-seat tasting counter. This month, Mr. Burnette is laying the barrels of pork over a cherry compote with basil leaves, with a few snap peas for added sweetness. He brings a keen sense of what to do with ingredients as they come into season to the vegetables he grows on the roof of the Burnettes' apartment building, a block away. The tiny yields of an urban garden wouldn't satisfy a larger restaurant, but they can shuffle right onto the menu at Belle Harlem, and shuffle off again when they're all gone. This month, there are thin bands of zucchini under the beef tenderloin, and young, soft favas around the lobster salad. There are more favas over pan-seared dorade and garden chives, with the almost transparently thin noodles tossed with butter and cream and tucked under the fish fillet. Mr. Burnette, who is black and who grew up in rural southwestern Virginia, has said he worked up the nerve to move north for culinary school after seeing the chef Marcus Samuelsson on television . (\"I thought, hell, if he could do it, I could do it, too.\") Sometimes today, in his restaurant less than a mile away from Mr. Samuelsson's Red Rooster Harlem , he reaches back to his childhood for ideas. A dessert in a glass called the Triflin' Ho-Ho is an acknowledged homage to Hostess cakes, although there is an English trifle in the mix, too, as well as a trace of Spice Market , where Mr. Burnette once worked. The chocolate in the broken shards of cake pulses, intriguingly, with Urfa pepper; its heat rubs up against the passion-fruit cream, brandied cherries and whipped cream that fill the glass. A year ago, Belle Harlem eliminated tips and raised prices. If you take that into account, check totals can still seem high, especially if you happen to be served pale, limp housemade potato chips or a $42 duck breast with a bitter arugula sauce and a poached pear that tastes like alcohol. The margins must be tight. At times you almost hear them squeak, as when Ms. Burnette anxiously reminds you that you were a few minutes late and suggests you order quickly so she can turn the seat in time for the next reservation. A professional manager might have brought a more soothing manner to the exchange. But a manager might not be as genuinely happy to see a party of three walk in without a reservation just when three seats had opened up, and might not smile as widely when told that the sparkling rosé is fantastic with the lobster salad, and would she mind pouring another glass? No, she doesn't mind at all. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 54, "data": " Sooner or later, those of us who follow the career of Jean-Georges Vongerichten reach a point where our memories can't keep up. The tuna tartares start to run together; we can't recall whether it's served in lettuce cups with threads of shiso at Perry St. or at JoJo . At some point it's hard to recall what makes the chicken breast inside a resoundingly crunchy Parmesan crust at Nougatine different from the Parmesan-crusted chicken at the Mark. With his partner, Phil Suarez, Mr. Vongerichten has founded scores of new restaurants around the world. Nearly 40 of them are still up and running, 15 in New York. Devising menus for each new place, he repeats himself occasionally, but more often he rearranges old patterns. Lime juice is traded for yuzu, cherry vinegar comes in for balsamic. Almost always, the result is a dish that is similar enough to his past work to be recognizably Vongerichtenesque but different enough to seem fresh. Maybe he can keep track of it in his head, but for the rest of us it would be really useful to have a family tree of every dish he ever invented, with its parentage and offspring. Something like 23andMe , it could tell you which strands of kitchen DNA are shared by which Vongerichten restaurants -- 23andV. This service would come in handy in times like the present, when critics and superfans are trying to metabolize the two restaurants Mr. Vongerichten opened in New York City during a single week in May. One is the Paris Café , a casual, all-day proposition inside Eero Saarinen's T.W.A. terminal at Kennedy International Airport, now gloriously resurrected as the TWA Hotel. The second is a polished seafood house that sits out in the East River on the end of Pier 17, next to the wreck of the old Fulton Fish Market; it's called the Fulton . Because I've been to both so recently, I can report confidently that the Fulton slices deep-red strawberries over strawberry ice cream and a sorbet made from strawberries and red wine to make its strawberry sundae, while the one at the Paris Café substitutes dried strawberries. That version isn't bad, but there is an undeniable difference between fresh summer berries and dehydrated ones, and that difference suggests the quality gap between the two restaurants. The best reasons to go to the Paris Café are Saarinen's glass walls, gliding curves and suspended catwalk, although the dining areas are swell, too, smartly evoking Raymond Loewy's original design for the space, which looked like a coffee shop on the moon. The place has some likable pizzas and salads, and it vaults clear over the other restaurants at the airport. But the recipes seem designed not to push the kitchen too hard, the menu is even more Vongerichtenesque than usual, and any dishes involving fruits or vegetables will make you wonder whether the produce truck drove to La Guardia instead. The Fulton, though, is a grown-up production. Under the day-to-day command of Noah Poses, the executive chef, it is easily the best seafood restaurant to open in Manhattan since the Pool , and easier to afford. Yes, a handful of items on the menu have that glassy-eyed stare, but almost everything else comes through. To get to the Fulton, you have to walk almost all the way to the end of the pier, where some tall planters cordon off the Fulton's outdoor tables. All the tables, indoors and out, have a view of the Brooklyn Bridge, but the best backdrops are inside and upstairs, where you can see that you're surrounded by water. Mentioning the view as a selling point will make some New Yorkers cringe. But Pier 17's developer, clearly hoping to erase the stigma, has recruited David Chang, Andrew Carmellini and Mr. Vongerichten. Day trippers and tourists will love the Fulton, in any case, and they will be right. True, the outdoor patio feels like the beachside bar of some island resort, with soft-core club music playing and servers carrying too-small trays slinking around in long skirts. Once you get inside, though, the tension in the open kitchen lets you know this is, in fact, New York. Running a seafood house gives Mr. Vongerichten an opening to lead with one of his strong suits, raw fish. The sea trout tartare is stirred with raw oysters and horseradish, which creates the uncanny momentary illusion that you're eating beef. White ponzu, made from white soy sauce, is the centerpiece of a platter of iced sashimi. Local fluke, taking a bath in habanero vinaigrette, is topped with mint and Sichuan buttons; even if you know what's coming -- Sichuan buttons are the flower buds of the toothache plant, which when chewed, produce a numbing and cooling sensation -- the dish is a surprise. The Fulton's Manhattan clam chowder is spicy, thick with potatoes and a healthy portion of clams. It's the rare version that tastes as good as it sounds, although purists will deduct one point for the absence of oyster crackers. There's a very intriguing sesame-poppy crust on the soft-shell crabs; you have just enough time to register the seeds before a potent green salsa of coriander and jalapeño kicks in. Few chefs are as skilled at using acidity, heat and salt to bring definition to a dish. So it's a surprise to realize how generic the Fulton's fish stew is, or to wonder what the ingredient is that throws the red snapper ceviche in watermelon juice out of whack. A separate menu card lets you know that most of the seafood in the main courses can be ordered \"simply cooked.\" I was never curious enough to try it, being too distracted by the salmon in a cumin-coriander seed crust so fragrant it turns heads; the sea bass and carrots in a life-affirming pool of lemon-turmeric sauce; and the detailed-oriented fish and crisps, a brick of flounder kept at scalding temperature by a leakproof and supernaturally crunchy buckwheat batter. Served with mashed fresh peas, it could almost pass for English if it didn't come with saffron aioli. Most distracting of all is the whole black bass baked inside a fish-shaped pastry lavishly decorated with golden scales, fins, gills and other parts the bass itself won't be needing anymore. It takes a good 10 minutes to unveil it, fillet it and then plate it together with slices of crust, some tomato concassé and a sauce choron, and I doubt many movies playing in theaters now can rival it for entertainment. Wonderful as it is to see one of the showpieces of pre-nouvelle cuisine given so much attention, you could ask whether whole fish en croute really makes sense after, say, kale salad. Mr. Vongerichten's technical approach may let him generate a menu full of smart, reliably pleasurable food, but it doesn't guarantee that it will all hang together. The pastry menu does, though, by sneakily staying true to classic American desserts. What's sold as Meyer lemon pudding turns out to be more like a lemon meringue tart with a quick, pulsing acidity; the apricot pie is more like a crisp, with oatmeal streusel on top; and the highlight of the strawberry sundae isn't the fresh fruit but the strawberry ice cream, its flavor straight out of the summertime ice cream shacks in a thousand vacation towns.

{"id": 55, "data": " \"Does the sheep's head soup have a lot of stuff in it?\" I asked my server. Realizing that this was somewhat ambiguous, especially applied to a dish as laden with stuff as the brew of lambs' snouts, ears, tongues, cheeks and eyeballs known in Turkey as kelle paca, I tried again. \"Is it very filling, I mean?\" My concern was a familiar one, to me at least. I was in Queens, at a new Turkish restaurant in Astoria called Lokanta , and the menu was so appealing that I wanted to try it all. Already I was set on a few bourekas, some labneh, the fava dip and some form of braised lamb over eggplant. I'd spotted another three or four dishes that I was probably going to tack on at the end of my order, as if by afterthought. I suspected that I could add a small bowl of kelle paca and still eat everything else. But a big bowl, one so thick with bits formerly affixed to a sheep's skull that a spoon would stand up in it, might tip the scale. The server pondered this for a while until a wiry man got up from his marble-topped table in the corner and conferred with her. Wearing baggy jeans, a white T-shirt and a baseball cap that kept his zinc-colored ponytail in place, he looked like a contractor, maybe a painter who'd come by to touch up the moldings and had been invited to stay for a Turkish coffee. Then he spoke to us about the sheep's head soup. \"I am a genius,\" he began. \"And even I don't know how to answer this question. I think that the question must be wrong.\" As those who chase the scent of lamb and charred eggplant around the city have probably guessed, this was no contractor. This was Orhan Yegen, the Turkish-born chef and restaurateur who has opened close to 20 Turkish restaurants over the past two decades or so while keeping up a running monologue that made him a favorite of food writers . In 2004, Mr. Yegen opened Sip Sak in Turtle Bay, then proceeded to surprise those who had charted his career by embarking on a long, stable period . All was quiet, relatively speaking, until April, when Lokanta arrived in Astoria to supplement the Greek and Cypriot menus along its stretch of Broadway, and Mr. Yegen arrived to tell customers that their questions were wrong. The kelle paca colloquy ended when I agreed to order it. After hours on the stove, the meat on the head had fallen away into about eight different textures, from frilly to ropy to collagenously chewy to tender and lean. All of this suspended in a slippery, almost sticky broth the color of cappuccino. And no, it was not too filling. Soups, braises, stews and other recipes requiring plenty of time and even more olive oil are the basis of Mr. Yegen's reputation. They set his menus apart from those at other Turkish restaurants around town, which tend to revolve around the grill. Lokanta makes very fine kofte, but for a full medley of minced and skewered meats, you are better off under the swaying chandeliers of Taci's Beyti on Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn. Lokanta will grill or roast a whole fish, but it will not be all that different from what might be served in Brooklyn at Liman , where your bass will be filleted within view of the fishing boats and swans of Sheepshead Bay. Diners in Lokanta's custody have signed on for a more nuanced view of the Turkish kitchen. Take, for instance, the shadings that lamb takes on. In hunkar begendi, chunks of it are stewed in tomatoes and peppers and ladled over an eggplant mash beaten to a memorable richness with cheese and milk. Ali nazik is, in schematic form, the same thing, built on the same foundation of milky eggplant, but in Lokanta's version the lamb is ground and simmered with onions and red and green peppers; somehow it achieves a rich, unctuous consistency that is amplified by the eggplant and the scoop of strained yogurt dropped on top. Lokanta's \"roasted lamb and rice\" is in the pilaf family, which means that the rice is not just a side dish but the heart of the recipe, baked until alluringly sweet with currants, allspice and cinnamon, then sprinkled with fresh dill at the last minute. The lamb's job is to be obligingly tender, and it succeeds, one reason the dish is requested by so many tables. To fend off boredom, I imagine, Mr. Yegen fills his manti with both lamb and beef. Each little dumpling is rolled by fingertip and is roughly the size of one. The meat has been seasoned just forcefully enough that it will announce itself, politely but clearly, as it breaks through the dough. It would be possible to sit down in front of a bowl of these, spooning them up with their warm yogurt and chile oil and dried mint, and call for another bowl a minute later. Of course, the meal should begin with strips of nigella-dotted Turkish bread and a spread or two -- maybe memorably creamy purée of dried favas; or the roughly mashed eggplant, smoky without a trace of bitterness; and one of the strained-yogurt dips, either the tangy cacik, laced with minced cucumbers, or the labneh, as firm as a new mattress. Either will prove useful as the meal goes on. So will a simple salad, especially the one with white beans and purple onions. The tightly rolled, golden bourekas are like skinny Turkish spring rolls filled with dill and melting feta. Cold poached leeks, a frequent special, are more appealing than the cold poached artichokes that have a permanent spot on the menu. If Mr. Yegen tells you that the grilled octopus is the best in the city, keep in mind that he rarely seems to leave his own restaurant. It's quite good, though, with a fugitive sweetness that may be supplied by the tomatoes and purple onions. Desserts run toward milky white puddings, nice if you are looking for a mild sedative. The baklava, imported from Turkey, is a treat for those of us who like pistachios and think sugar syrup makes a better baklava sweetener than honey. The unlikely champion, though, is the butternut squash that has been languorously baked in its own juices with nothing but sugar. The technique is one of those small tricks that helps Mr. Yegen's cooking stand out, like the perfume of lemon peel in the Turkish lemonade. Lokanta has no liquor license yet. Some customers smuggle wine through the door and keep the bottles on their tables, which are topped with radiant white marble from Turkey and surrounded by classic bentwood cafe chairs.

{"id": 56, "data": " The chef John Fraser's new restaurant has a blandly corporate name, 701West , that tells you less about the place than simply walking into the dining room. One of several operations he is running in the new Times Square Edition hotel, it is clad in paneling on the walls and ceilings. Velvet curtains and banquettes are the slightly alarming color of a blue macaw's tail feathers. Wooden blinds are usually snapped shut against the strobes of 47th Street and Seventh Avenue. To get to your table, you must first pass between two identical Champagne trolleys. An iced reservoir in the center of each is loaded with about half a dozen bottles that range in price from a Blanquette de Limoux for $26 a glass to a 2006 brut from Dom Pérignon for $66 a glass. Before you sit down, you've already learned that wine is front and center, literally and figuratively; that it is more likely to come from classic, mannerly European estates than, say, Macedonian villages still using amphoras that Odysseus drank from; that the ideal customer is not likely to get up and walk out upon being offered a $66 aperitif; and that the restaurant expects to attract so many of these customers that a single Champagne trolley is not enough. Which is to say that Marriott International and the hotelier Ian Schrager installed 701West on the 11th floor of the Edition for people who still think a leisurely, three-course dinner with a few interesting bottles and some of the customary niceties is worth spending money on. It belongs to a species of restaurant that is no longer in great supply in Manhattan, let alone on the intersection where the green neon of the Olive Garden faces off across Seventh Avenue against the giant candy bars of Hershey's Chocolate World. It also marks Mr. Fraser's first arabesques on the stage of formal dining since Dovetail closed last year. These are early days for 701West, but so far I've found the cooking more original and appealing than Dovetail's in its final phase. As you know if you've tried the fried-cauliflower buns at Nix, or the ramen-style boiled eggs at the Loyal whose yolks are red with a film of jellied chile oil, Mr. Fraser has a playful, imaginative streak. He needs it at 701West, where there is no real theme beyond wine and style. But there is enough creativity across the menu, on which he collaborates with the chef de cuisine, Rob Lawson, and the pastry chef, Sébastien Rouxel, to make dinner the engaging, somewhat eccentric experience it is clearly meant to be. Before the first courses appear, for example, there may be a \"cauliflower mille-feuille,\" the raw vegetable shaved into white sheets that are softened by chilled mezcal cream and then topped with sturgeon caviar. It's enticingly off-kilter, and another frequent amuse manages to outdo it: a spoonful or so of white-asparagus foam above a warm custard of sunflower-seed butter, dense and nutty and sweet with a few drops of honey. This is luxury dining in its way, which is not the predictable way. The menu proposes three courses for $98, but a server informed me that \"we also have à la carte, if that's more your rhythm for the evening.\" Frequently the surprises come in the form of an unexpected tweak dealt to a vegetable. Slowly cooked in beet juice, a whole beet takes on the glistening ruby intensity of raw bluefin tuna. There is an appetizer of actual bluefin as well, and it has the precise, Japanese-informed minimalism of a dish you'd get at Jean-Georges, with tiny spring peas and young turnip greens and an electrifying white cloud of grated horseradish. In a dish of fava agnolotti, the X factor is the bright, almost effervescent sparkle of vinegar-marinated tomatoes and their juices stirred into a Parmesan-rind broth. There is one mystifying appetizer in which the dueling tidal flavors of sea urchin and squid-ink risotto are allowed to cancel each other out. For the most part, though, the plates don't overreach, for all the inventiveness on display. Asparagus dipped in aioli is a good idea, of course, but what if the asparagus has been steamed inside a wrapper of thinly shaved cedar until it is nearly as smoky as country bacon? And what if the aioli is enhanced by truffles? It may sound overworked, but it is such a thrill that one of my guests asked for another plate before we could move on to the main courses, throwing the rhythm for the evening right out the window. The night will pause again if one of the main courses is the sweet potato, as everyone tries to figure out where it got its creaminess and savory depth. Even once you know it's been sealed up and baked inside a little coffin of sourdough that is streaked with green threads of wakame seaweed, you still can't quite believe that all this flavor has been achieved with an ordinary sweet potato. Some of the large pieces of fish and meat are showstoppers on their own, like the lobster that rests for four days in aged-beef fat before being broiled and set over some jammy ratatouille. When they are not, something else on the plate usually is. The long slab of roasted duck breast dredged in powdered herbes de Provence would keep my attention even without its sidekick, a curiously likable risotto made from pine nuts. In the case of lamb, the firecracker is a cocotte of fresh, creamy cranberry beans. Mr. Rouxel, recently of Upland and the Clocktower, brings a lighter-than-air quality to the desserts. Hovering over a crunchy buckwheat pastry crust is a wavy sea of pastry cream infused with parsnips. It's earthy and ethereal at the same time. He even knows what to do with white chocolate, aerating it into a mousse to frost an English-pea sponge cake, and giving it a piercing sour-cherry sorbet as a foil. All seven captains working at 701West are sommeliers, listed by name on the menu; they are assisted by back servers who are sommeliers in training. This is one of those innovations in service that seems obvious now that somebody's actually doing it. The meal can become an evening-long conversation about wine; the sommeliers even invite you to play the wine-insiders' game of guessing the identity of a mystery pour in a black glass. It is slightly incredible that a restaurant that tries so hard to give wine equal status with the cooking does not have more bottles for under $80. That said, the ones it does have tend to be very good and fairly priced. Besides 701West, Mr. Fraser is in charge of the deep-dish focaccia, carrot Bolognese and \"billboard burger\" at the Terrace and Outdoor Gardens, which is open all day on the ninth floor. He also oversees the dinner-theater menus at the Paradise Club on the seventh floor, which is currently staging \"The Devouring,\" a neo-Burlesque extravaganza (juggling, sword swallowing, aerial acrobatics) purportedly inspired by William Blake. This was no doubt the destination of the stilt walker I nearly ran into in the lobby one night. Dressed in scarlet from head to heel, she got along faster on her stilts than I do on my own legs. She was the first thing I've seen in years that gave me hope for the future of Times Square. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 57, "data": " When a batch of banh beo comes to the table at Van Da , any confusion about how to eat them does not last long. Banh beo, a species of small rice cake, are a favorite afternoon snack in the central Vietnamese city of Hue. Each one is steamed in a ceramic dish just big enough to hold a few spare coins. Faced with a platter of banh beo, you realize fairly quickly that you have essentially two choices: You can use a spoon, or hold the dish to your mouth and tip it up while throwing your head back, as if doing a Jell-O shot. If you go the Jell-O shot route, it may help to bring a pair of chopsticks or a fingertip into play at the last minute to encourage the banh beo to leave the nest. You have now transferred to your mouth a warm divot of steamed rice and tapioca flours that has a consistency like panna cotta's and a negligible flavor on its own. All the action is in the toppings. At Van Da, these include a spoonful of chopped scallions and the green oil in which they were sizzled, red rings of fresh Thai chile, some fish sauce, rehydrated dried shrimp and a flap of fried tofu skin, standing in for the pork rinds a banh beo vendor in Hue would use. The divot of rice cake is still warm, which helps the aromas drive their way into your head. It's over in a minute. If you're lucky, there will be another banh beo on the table so you can start over. Van Da joined the East Village's growing hub of interesting Vietnamese restaurants three months ago. Like Hanoi House , Madame Vo and Madame Vo BBQ , it is semitraditional and semimodern. Those two strains are embodied at Van Da by, respectively, Yen Ngo and Hannah Wong. Ms. Ngo, who owns the place, was raised in Dalat, Vietnam, and while she has worked in restaurants and catering in New York City for years, she has never had a chance before to show off the food of her childhood, like the banh beo steamed by her mother, who had grown up in Hue. Ms. Wong is the chef. Though she has cooked at Gramercy Tavern and Battersby , her background in the food of Vietnam before Van Da was more or less confined to the roughly two weeks she spent traveling there while living in Hong Kong on a Fulbright grant a decade ago. Nevertheless, she has put together a trenchant, concise and pleasure-focused menu of Vietnamese dishes. Some she learned directly from her boss, and on those recipes she was apparently discouraged from drawing outside the lines. Others are more freely interpreted. It's a credit to Ms. Wong's sensitivity that if you don't already know the original templates, it can be hard to tell where they end and her imagination begins. Banh beo and the other snacks from Hue that Ms. Ngo taught Ms. Wong get their own berth on the menu. As you'd imagine, they tend to be very good. Banh it ram are chewy, fried balls of mochi, filled with a coconut-soaked mash of mung beans and shallots. Banh khot are little rice-flour pancakes molded into edible cups about the size of a Ritz cracker. In Vietnam, the cups would be filled with shrimp. Ms. Wong instead spoons sautéed mushrooms into hers, along with a crisscrossing of fresh herbs and a spill of coconut cream. Ms. Wong makes an effort to bring out regional differences in Vietnamese cuisine by devoting sections of the menu to Saigon and Hanoi, hundreds of miles apart, as well as Hue, somewhere in the middle. She doesn't have quite enough dishes from any one place to paint a full picture, but the project is intriguing. Like other New York chefs, she has been caught in the tractor beam of cha ca la Vong , the turmeric-and dill-scented fish dish that is a specialty of a 100-year-old Hanoi restaurant of the same name. Her version, though, supplies less dill, less sauce and less satisfaction than some others. Her two improvisations on the theme of Hanoi's best-known contribution to gastronomy, pho, are more effective. One gives you the soup without the noodles; floating in a rich and cloudy broth are ghostly white, billowing won tons that contain chopped beef fillet freely seasoned with black pepper. The other dish is, humbly enough, a plate of soupless pho noodles stir-fried with springy mushrooms, bitter greens and chopped scallions. Its simplicity makes the impact of the dish hard to explain until you learn that it has been showered with Maggi Seasoning , a soylike sauce that is the invisible secret of many Vietnamese dishes. Nodding toward Saigon, Ms. Wong makes a rendition of shaking beef by stir-frying tender and chewy marinated hanger steak with potatoes and then throwing a fistful of watercress at it. If you think that sounds like a French bistro plate, then you are starting to understand how her mind works. Ms. Wong cooks skillfully, with an appreciation for nuance, and she doesn't abuse her freedom by innovating pointlessly. It's possible, though, that she could stand to be less shy with chiles and herbs. The table salad of greenery to be wrapped around grilled shrimp offers no herbs other than mint and basil, and you'll run out of lettuce before the fourth shrimp has been dressed. The green papaya salad is a little too innocuous, and while her version of the street snack of grilled corn in fish sauce is a real success, fresh chiles would have more impact than the chile threads Ms. Wong balances on top. (Incidentally, the kitchen at Van Da makes a fine hot sauce that is like a milder and less acidic Sriracha, but servers never seem to remember to mention it until the end of the meal.) There are just three desserts. By the time you order, one or two may have been 86ed. With luck, though, the che will have survived. In Vietnam, che is thought of as a drink even though it can take the form of a pudding, as it does here, where warm pearls and threads of tapioca are cooked in coconut milk with cubes of soft taro. It is just sweet enough to qualify as a dessert. A black dust darkens the surface: black-sesame brittle, ground to powder. Even a single dessert qualifies as an impressive feat inside Van Da's tight quarters. Through the miracle of careful design, the space almost never feels cramped, but this is still an intimate restaurant. In the basement is a small seating area laid out as efficiently as the cockpit of a fighter jet; above it, at the top of a staircase, is an even smaller seating area sharing a room with a window-facing dining counter, the kitchen and a bar. The cocktails that roll off that bar, like the gin-and-celery duet called the White Tiger, are much more sharply drawn than the drinks at restaurants with twice the space and four times the budget.

{"id": 58, "data": " Talking about how good the chef Thomas Keller's new restaurant is would be easier if it weren't also painfully out of step with the city's mood. TAK Room is so determined to be \"timeless,\" as Mr. Keller has often called it, that it seems clueless. TAK Room opened in March, one of 11 restaurants inside the 720,000-square-foot mall at 20 Hudson Yards. Parts of Hudson Yards are still under construction, but enough has been finished for most New Yorkers to figure out that this fistful of glass needles stabbed into the West Side wasn't built for them. Just as the helipad the city offered to build for Amazon crystallized anger about the cruddy state of our subways, the glittering new home on 10th Avenue for global luxury brands, investment funds, law firms, business travelers and hunters of seven- or eight-figure apartments spurred a lot of New Yorkers to ask, What's in it for us? Mr. Keller's answer is a restaurant that looks and acts like a millionaire's hangout in an old New Yorker cartoon. It charges like one, too, with adjustments for inflation. An eggplant Parmesan is the least expensive main course, at $30, followed by the New Zealand salmon for $42. After that, please turn off all electronic devices and place your tray tables in the upright, locked position, because we are going up to $66 and $75 before reaching a cruising altitude of $85. Look down there -- don't the people look just like ants? TAK Room's timing is off in other ways, too. Hudson Yards has stirred up New Yorkers' latent resentment of chain stores from beyond the Hudson, and what does Mr. Keller offer them but a clone of his restaurant in Florida, the Surf Club ? The name has been changed, but the menus are nearly identical; they glorify the strait-laced, spice-free food that rich white Americans used to feed on when nobody was shaming them into being adventurous. It is the food of \"21,\" of three-martini lunches, steakhouses and country clubs: prime rib and Dover sole, iceberg lettuce and oysters Rockefeller. Of course, being a Thomas Keller production, TAK Room serves the most refined, meticulous country club food you've ever seen. Most of it is very good, and a few things are so inexplicably delicious that you have the sensation of slipping the knots of gravity and floating an inch or so above your seat. The entrance is on the fifth floor, just past Neiman Marcus. But the action is on the sixth floor, up a Deco-cubist staircase so grand that you may feel a little underdressed unless you have Carole Lombard on one arm. (There is no dress code.) At the top, you find yourself in a lounge where a pianist and upright bassist glide through satiny jazz standards. Bartenders whip up streamlined, uncomplicated drinks that are either genuine classics, like the Pendennis Club, or modern drinks built along classic proportions, like the Tritter rickey, a tall, fizzy gin number that shimmies with absinthe. Around sunset, when pink light trickles through the western windows, it has to be the most pleasant room within a mile for fighting vainly the old ennui . They let people eat in this room, too, and it is tempting. But there is more to see, room after room, all laid out by the London interior-design firm David Collins Studio. There are leather banquettes deep enough to lose a small child in. Facing them are mohair-velvet chairs that swivel so you can quietly surveil the room without craning your neck. Each table gets a white linen cloth and a flickering oil lamp behind a white porcelain shade. The other colors are black walnut, midnight blue and law-firm green. At some point a captain in a crisply tailored suit will deposit the wine list. It mostly avoids the latest fashions, like a croquet party on Nantucket. Later there will be a preamble to the menu. Under the day-to-day care of Jarrod Huth, TAK Room's chef de cuisine, it has a continental theme and an à la carte format. Highlights will be pointed out, and the prime rib will certainly be mentioned, as will the restored 1930s silver trolley on which it is ferried from table to table. Here comes a French onion dip surrounded by newly fried potato chips that are dark without a hint of charring. This is TAK Room in one extremely crunchy, lusciously creamy bite: an hors d'oeuvre from the age of Naugahyde and polyester, transformed into something so good and pure it's beyond reproach. The Parker House rolls are gravity-defying orbs served with soft cultured butter that, in the evening's best magic trick, rises from a custom-made dish in six identical ridged curls , like shrimp performing a Busby Berkeley routine. Bespoke flourishes like that are a TAK Room hallmark; see also the oyster crackers, like down pillows shrunk to the size of Chiclets, served with the silk-smooth New England clam chowder that is one of the most likable appetizers and, at $16, the best value. Another hallmark, though, is unevenness. Avocado Louie with a small bouquet of other vegetables is thrillingly right, thanks to a Thousand Island dressing that crackles with energy; the Caesar salad, made while you watch, has almost no personality. Grated Parmesan and anchovies vanish into it without a trace, along with dull croutons that could take some pointers from the oyster crackers. Something called \"warm soft boiled egg\" is a quietly joyous celebration of luxurious flavors and textures, the yolk running like lava over a buckwheat blin and a heap of warm osetra caviar in crème fraîche. (Yes, warm. It's wonderful.) And the chilled prawn cocktail is going to be my platonic ideal of the dish from now on. But the crab cake had very little crab flavor, on two different nights, although it contained almost nothing else. Lobster thermidor (now there's a name I've not heard in a long, long time) is so tender, its sauce so fluffy and rich, that eating it becomes an intimate act. Dover sole meunière, though, has neither the crisped skin nor the juicy flesh that can make this fish so alluring. Yes, life cannot be one giant plate of dancing butter-shrimp. Still, the gap between great and non-great items -- nothing comes close to bad -- is a bit too wide and comes into view a bit too often. Regulars will learn to work the menu the way golfers learn their way around the eighth hole at Pebble Beach. Some will love the prime rib, which could not be any more moist without breaking several laws of chemistry. Others will wish that it had more concentrated beef flavor and that the flaps and handles had not been trimmed off, perhaps in pursuit of some Kellerian quest for bovine symmetry. A large number will settle on the roast chicken for two. The meat is juicy but not gushy, the flavor full but not salty, the jus dark but not over-reduced. After the chicken, the pastry chef, Alex McClenaghan, can offer a highly refined coconut cake or an urbane lemon meringue tart, but you'd almost have to be insane not to get the chocolate cake. Certainly a close relative of devil's food cake, his version weaves dark-chocolate cremeux between its many, many layers, all of them wrapped in a dark-chocolate frosting. And there will be regulars, because the rewards of TAK Room, if you can find them and pay for them, are as intense as the chocolate in that cake. The core audience may turn out to be travelers on loan from the Surf Club and Mr. Keller's California strongholds, or they may just be people who like the feeling of crashing the country club. Anti-plutocrat fevers come and go, but the trappings of American aristocracy are always in style somewhere.

{"id": 59, "data": " One of the ways people pretend to be sophisticated about restaurants these days is by claiming that the New York City dining scene has lost its edge. The sheer number of restaurants in the city -- about 27,000, according to the health inspectors -- makes the argument absurd. How many of them are slipping? All of them? Just the first 20,000 or so? In reality, people who gripe about the state of New York restaurants are usually talking about a sliver of a slice of a fraction, probably around 50 places whose names are in steady circulation, with the newest weighing most heavily in the results. The number of really good ones is higher than anyone can count. Places that other cities would brag about get lost in the crowd here. The chef Günther Seeger, for instance, was a national star when he cooked in Atlanta. The tasting-menu restaurant he opened in the West Village three years ago should have been a major destination, especially after he dropped the prices. Mr. Seeger can make ingredients bend to his will almost without touching them. His cooking outshone that of some of the city's more famous chefs, who whip their ingredients harder with far less payoff. Yet he struggled to put Günther Seeger NY on the map. I reviewed it, but some other critics didn't, and by the time it closed, last month, Chris Crowley of Grub Street wrote , \"it wasn't a restaurant you heard a lot of food geeks talk about.\" Mr. Seeger complained to one acquaintance that he couldn't even get on a list of New York's 100 best restaurants. Of course, good restaurants fail everywhere, but it's hard to imagine Mr. Seeger vanishing into the crowd in San Francisco, Chicago or Los Angeles. Considered and rejected, maybe. But overlooked? Not likely. I'm not sure that any words of mine could have persuaded the city to cuddle up to Mr. Seeger, who isn't particularly cuddly. But I wish I'd found ways to remind New Yorkers that his breathtakingly pure cooking was there to be enjoyed while that was still true. Which brings us, by a circuitous and not particularly well-paved route, to Anthony Mangieri of Una Pizza Napoletana . Using naturally leavened dough and a short shopping list of ingredients, Mr. Mangieri makes what is unmistakably the finest sit-down pizza in the five boroughs. (I doubt he has any rivals in the stand-up joints, either, but slice pizza is a different game.) Two years ago, I posited that Razza, a pizzeria in Jersey City, made \"the best pizza in New York.\" I don't regret writing that, but I would like to point out that Mr. Mangieri was not cooking in the city at the time and that Razza's chef, Dan Richer, has said that he began taking pizza seriously only after he met Mr. Mangieri. Una Pizza Napoletana saw a rush of curious pie-eaters after it opened on Orchard Street a little more than a year ago. But the last few times I've gone, there were too many unclaimed chairs and bar stools. When Anthony Mangieri is making pizza, the right number of empty seats is zero, as any New Yorker who waited in line at the old Una Pizza Napoletana, in the East Village from 2004 to 2009, could tell you. Press interest in the new place has died down, too. So when I heard a rumor that Mr. Mangieri was thinking of leaving the city and taking his pizza with him, I was unnerved, to put it mildly. Asked about it, he told me he was considering it but hadn't made up his mind. Mr. Mangieri has left New York before, and I didn't like it then, either. This time, I wasn't going to let him get away without a fight. It is true that my review of Una Pizza Napoletana last year was decidedly mixed. It is also true, though, that almost every criticism I made has been addressed. It has gone from one of the most confounding pizzerias in the city to one of the most enjoyable. The problem with Una Pizza a year ago was that it was trying to be two things at once. It was, of course, a Neapolitan pizzeria, serving classic, unadorned pies baked for about two minutes inside a wood-burning oven shaped like an igloo. But it was also a cutting-edge Lower East Side experiment. At the instigation of Mr. Mangieri's partners, the chefs Fabian von Hauske Valtierra and Jeremiah Stone, the kitchen brought forth appetizers that had rarely if ever been asked to live under one roof with a pizza. There was a jellylike mass of raw lobster inside a ring of chickpeas, and a rust-colored puddle of 'nduja under raw turnips and nasturtium leaves. The wine list was virtually a treatise on natural wines, a long document full of the names of eccentric producers and obscure European villages. In another restaurant, all this would have been the departure point for some adventurous evenings. But in a pizzeria it led to some peculiar pairings, made the check a bit higher than you wanted and resulted in long waits before you were finally allowed to eat the delicious pizza you'd come for. Over the past year, Mr. von Hauske and Mr. Stone have stepped aside, letting Mr. Mangieri call the shots. The wines on offer now number about 15. They are still a likably eccentric lot, but picking one doesn't feel like studying for a master sommelier exam. The appetizers are simpler and less expensive: a plate of marinated white anchovies, a dish of warm Italian olives or a bowl of Little Gem lettuce with sunflower seeds in a Caesarish dressing. I do miss the tiramisù from the opening menu, but the new cannoli filled with ricotta -- a blend of domestic cow's milk and Italian sheep's milk -- are nearly as good. It's common for a new restaurant to trim its sails, but this one has trimmed its prices, too. In the beginning the five regular pizzas were all $25; now they range from $19 to $25, and the two extra-complicated Friday and Saturday pizzas are priced at $26. I liked Mr. Mangieri's pies in the East Village, I liked them more when he came back to town, and it's possible, just possible, that they've improved over the past year. He is, like Mr. Seeger, a minimalist. He lets you notice each ingredient: the little ping of sourness in the Campanian buffalo mozzarella, for instance. Or the unruly, windswept-hillside aroma of dried Sicilian oregano. The precise crunch of each unrefined Trapani sea-salt crystal waiting to dissolve. The crust is so tender it barely fights fork, knife or teeth. Some diners will wish it put up more crackly resistance. You inhale it at least as much as you eat it. When you have finished, some of the most popular pizzas in town will seem tough, leathery, overworked. Even if this is not the style you crave, you'll know that it's the work of a baker who has spent years listening to the dough. There is a place for people who are as obsessed with pizza as Mr. Mangieri, and the place is New York City.

{"id": 60, "data": " Good restaurants don't rain down from nowhere, but Crown Shy came close. No doubt it went through the same birth pangs as all the others. As far as I can tell, though, it simply materialized one morning this March at 70 Pine Street, and was open for business that afternoon by the time the financial district's elevators began disgorging traders, bankers and analysts in search of 5-o'clock refreshment. One reason it seems to have crept up on the city is that it's a large, well-capitalized, big-time restaurant of the kind that only established groups seem able to get off the ground these days. Yet Crown Shy doesn't come from Danny Meyer, Andrew Carmellini or any of the other usual suspects. Its two main players were recruited after talks among April Bloomfield, Ken Friedman and the building's developer fell apart in 2016, before accusations of sexual harassment engulfed Mr. Friedman. Crown Shy's chef, James Kent, used to run the kitchen at the NoMad , and his partner, Jeff Katz, is the managing partner at Del Posto . Neither exactly fell off the turnip truck last week. As a team, though, they're unproven, and as they went through construction and hiring, the drumbeat of publicity was more muted than it might have been if marquee names had led the project. Then there is Crown Shy's location, a sprawling, soaring, street-level space that, as far as anyone recalls, has never held a restaurant before. Many New Yorkers have seen the 1932 building's distinctive, hulking, pyramidal silhouette on the skyline, but until recently, when the offices on its 67 stories were repurposed as expensive apartments and hotel rooms, not many had encountered the frenzied exuberance of the lobby, which makes use of polished marble in at least five contrasting colors. It looks like something Bernini would have designed if he'd lived to see the Jazz Age. Depending on which entrance you use -- the revolving doors are crowned with aluminum reliefs of Art Deco flowers being pollinated by elongated stylized butterflies -- you may want to allow an extra five or 10 minutes to take it all in before you eat. Above all, it's the extent to which Crown Shy already has its act together that makes you ask: Where did this place come from? The whole operation radiates confidence from start to finish. The finish brings real desserts from a real pastry chef, Renata Ameni. She comes to Crown Shy fresh from Manresa, in Los Gatos, Calif ., and before that, she put in half a decade at Eleven Madison Park . Her desserts at Crown Shy look uncomplicated, and you don't realize how intelligently they've been put together until you start to eat one. There's a milky-white yogurt cheesecake under tender spring strawberries, with smooth strawberry sorbet in the center and a pistachio crumble sprinkled over that. Her chocolate tart gives her a chance to show off about half a dozen different effects she can work with chocolate, starting with a crunchy, crumbly, almost salty chocolate crust, moving on to a soft, soufflé-like filling and ending with curls of dark chocolate. Ms. Ameni's side of the kitchen is also responsible for the savory churros filled with Gruyère sauce -- the menu calls them fritters, they taste like gougères and the texture is something else entirely. Also her work: the miniature loaf of pull-apart bread that appears after you order. With dried olives on top and olive tapenade between every skinny slice, it is one of the most memorable parts of the meal. Even the obligatory scoops of ice cream that restaurants seem required to offer aren't allowed to leave her pastry station until they've been turned into a composed dessert, and not some kind of slapdash sundae , either. Satsuma ice cream gets to wear a toasted turban of marshmallowy meringue and some cracked honeycomb candy on the side. The effect is witty and delicious, progressing from purely sweet to bittersweet to tart and bittersweet. Mr. Kent's savory dishes pursue the same strategy. This is to say, they regularly over-deliver, starting with the iced Wellfleet oysters dressed with cucumber jelly, diced cucumbers, grains of jalapeño and microleaves of purple shiso. An almost absurdly creamy purée of white bean hummus under a fiery red slick of melted 'nduja is probably meant to be shared, but as soon as I'd tasted it I came up with other ideas, as my dinner guests will testify. Two tartares show Mr. Kent's talent for carrying bright new ideas with him into well-traveled territory. In the first, he laces hand-chopped raw beef with toasted walnuts and earthy rye croutons; in the other, chopped raw snapper is sprinkled with individual juice-filled vesicles of grapefruit, lime, lemon and orange that pop between your teeth, a kind of instant, interactive ceviche. Maybe one or two ideas should have been left by the side of the road. The chicken liver ragù tossed with housemade cavatelli doesn't need to be so sweet with sherry; a rough pesto is a fine use for fresh chickpeas, but isn't there a better partner for it than shaved jicama? All is forgiven when Mr. Kent turns a mainstay like grilled chicken into a main course as exciting as the one at Crown Shy, which keeps the sunshine brightness of its citrus marinade, and is served with a purée-slash-hot sauce of fermented hot and sweet peppers. The vivid orange of that hot sauce almost matches the marble in the lobby. But Crown Shy's two big dining rooms and extended bar are a little more restrained, dominated by cream tones, blond wood tables, and chairs with saddle-brown leather seats and backs. The only echoes of grandeur are the enormous windows and the ceiling high up overhead. The wine list is one to get lost in. Finance wizards with bonuses to expunge can certainly do that, but it's great to see lots of bottles under $100 on almost every page. Anyone who knows what some of these wines cost wholesale will be able to locate any number of good deals, but even the unschooled will notice the value regions. They jump off the page: Portugal, Greece and New Zealand, for instance, along with vast stretches of Germany and pockets of Spain, France and Italy. With so many strengths, Crown Shy must have at least one thing wrong with it. And yes, it does. Obviously that name is ridiculous. Knowing that it refers to a tendency of very tall trees not to let their upper stories grow into their neighbors' branches doesn't help, either. But we should probably get used to it, because we're going to be hearing more about this restaurant. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 61, "data": " Before I tell you about the seasonally attuned courses the chef Hiroki Odo prepares at his new and virtuosic kaiseki restaurant, Odo, I want to tell you about some that he does not prepare. At two points during the March menu, a person who is not Mr. Odo faces you across the thick plank of Lebanon cedar that forms the dining counter and makes something for you. The first time is about halfway through the meal, when Seong Cheol Byun shows up, shapes half a dozen pieces of sushi and lays them down, one by one, in front of you. Some of his ingredients, kept on wooden trays that he carries from place to place, are typical, like the warm short-grain rice and the dark nikiri that he will brush over certain fish. Others are less typical. The ginger he mounds on your plate is pickled together with sliced lotus root and daikon. On March 1, looking forward to spring, he added cherry leaves to the mix. Mr. Byun, a Korean-American, ferments daikon, cabbage and sesame seeds to make white kimchi, which he wraps inside nori for a tuna roll. You eat it like an ice cream cone, but faster. When Mr. Byun worked at Sushi Nakazawa, much of the seafood he used was flown in from Japan. At Odo, almost all the fish have been caught off the East Coast of North America: Long Island black sea bass, Florida mackerel and North Carolina bluefin tuna, which may be several weeks old before Mr. Byun is ready to serve it. This sushi reflects the American region where it is made, incorporates the Korean background of the chef making it and still has an unmistakably Japanese spirit. This one course, if tripled in length, could be spun off into a separate establishment that would probably be among the top two dozen sushi restaurants in the city. The second time an Odo course is prepared while you watch, it is made in a cocktail shaker and served in a cocktail glass. It is, as you may have guessed, a cocktail, though it is also the first of two desserts, sweetish and not especially boozy. Frank Cisneros, the sommelier, subordinates the alcohol to fresh fruit, in the style of the revered Tokyo bar Gen Yamamoto . Barrel-aged shochu is muddled with one or two sprightly segments of mikan orange, subjected to a calisthenic shake and strained into a delicately etched glass before a shimmer of sparkling wine is laid down on top. Orange juice in cocktails usually tastes diluted and weak; in this drink, it was radiant. I would say that the drinkable dessert course could be expanded into a separate cocktail bar, except that Odo already has one of those. Odo, which opened in December a few minutes' walk from the Flatiron Building, is entered through a door hidden in the back of a compact den -- cafe by day and bar by night -- called Hall. This arrangement seems to remind people of a speakeasy, although it would take an especially clueless bootlegger to open a speakeasy inside a bar. So far, Hall has not been fully discovered, but it still gets busy enough at dinner time that you can be stranded by the front door for a few minutes before anyone on staff notices. Some diners on their way to Odo will find this an awkward start to a meal that costs $200 before tax, tip and drinks. But they may also discern that Hall, lined with carved oak panels salvaged from what appears to have been a library or church vestry from around 1900, is one of the neighborhood's most entrancing rooms; that the corridor, which seems too narrow and definitely climbs on its way toward a too-short brass door with no handle, is perspective-altering in a way a Surrealist would enjoy; and that Odo, a shadowy and windowless space on the far side of that door is an unusually tranquil shelter from crowds, noise and anything else you might want to get away from for a couple of hours. The 14 counter seats face the kitchen and, in the middle of it, a charcoal-gray island. This is where Mr. Odo and his cooks assemble the other courses I promised to tell you about. Duck breast has been grilled over charcoal and positioned between two sauces. One is a black spill of concentrated soy spiced with sansho pepper; the other is an ivory pool of puréed apples and cream. These sauces contrast in every way you can think of, including East versus West, and they come together like opposing poles of a magnet. A springy chunk of truffle-flavored mochi is crisped on the grill and engulfed in a white-miso soup that has grated white truffles floating on the surface. You smell truffles in the air first, get them on the tip of your tongue next and finally taste them everywhere when they're released from the mochi. A croquette tastes something like an Italian rice ball made from New England clam chowder that has young bamboo shoots in it. This golden, breaded arancino is finished with dots of grated goat cheese. Shaved lamb shoulder, baby harukei turnip and two asparagus stalks as thin as licorice whip are served, still cooking, in a hot broth, a kaiseki version of shabu shabu. Odo -- incidentally, the name is pronounced as a set of initials, O.D.O. -- pursues local ingredients not just for its sushi course but throughout its menu. The simmered lamb used to gambol in the Hudson Valley, the croquetted topneck clams were raked in off Long Island and so on. Kaiseki's near-liturgical focus on timeliness almost seems to demand local ingredients, and they have been central to Niki Nakayama's strategy at n/naka in Los Angeles, but less so for New York's few kaiseki chefs. Chikara Sono at Kyo Ya , for instance, takes pains to import traditional ingredients from Japan the minute they're available. Mr. Odo came to New York as the chef of Kajitsu , the extraordinary restaurant on East 39th Street that follows the vegetarian cooking tradition known as shojin ryori, born centuries ago in Zen Buddhist temples. One contribution he made in his five years there was to freshen up the menus with more food grown nearby. In the first and last tastes of his February and March menus, he anchors Odo firmly in the New York region. When you sit down, you are immediately poured a cup of cold sake. It is brewed in Brooklyn, and it is very good, swirling with fresh-fruit aromatics. Then at the end, after the fresh fruit, Mr. Odo serves ice cream made with kasu, the creamy solids left over at the end of sake distillation. The ice cream looks like vanilla and tastes, not surprisingly, like fermented rice. This particular kasu is supplied by the same brewery in Brooklyn that makes the sake. Expanding his range to meat and fish at Odo, he has kept the resourcefulness that limitations encourage. Somewhere along the way Mr. Odo also picked up technical skills in traditions far outside kaiseki. Each night, in the gohan course, Odo offers a choice of three starchy dishes. This is where I encountered a very fine seafood curry over rice; an elegant bowl of short ramen noodles in king crab broth; and fresh soba served with little pieces of pickled vegetables and wasabi blossoms, looking a bit like broccoli florets but tasting like mustard. As with the cocktail and the sushi, each of these dishes could, if Mr. Odo wanted, be leveraged into separate specialized restaurants, or food-hall stands. You could tell yourself that $200 is a large amount of money for a single meal or you could say that for the chance to visit all these different establishments without leaving your seat, it's a pretty good deal. Either way, you'd be right. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 62, "data": " When I left my home state of Rhode Island at 18, it didn't take long to discover that there was almost nothing about its local food customs that didn't make outsiders laugh. That small children routinely bought coffee-flavored milk in school cafeterias; that \"beer\" was not pronounced with an \"r\" at the end, but pizza was; that a hot dog shortened to about four inches and topped with meat sauce is called a hot wiener , and that a counterman preparing six of them at a time may deploy a maneuver known as \"wieners up the arm\" -- all of this apparently strikes people who grew up more than 20 miles from Providence as very funny. When New Yorkers hear that Violet , a new restaurant in the East Village, serves a style of pizza that comes from Rhode Island, they start to smile, as if getting ready for the punch line. In fact, though, Violet's pies are a homage not to the whole state but to a specific restaurant, Al Forno, in Providence. If you know one thing about Al Forno, you know that its pizza is not a joke. One of the restaurant's two founders, George Germon, originated the recipe in the early 1980s, more or less out of desperation. After failing to get an oven hot enough to produce a crust as thin and crunchy as the ones he remembered eating in Italy, he tossed dough on a wood-burning grill and watched in awe as it stiffened to a crisp almost instantly. The pizza he and his wife, Johanne Killeen, would develop and elaborate from there was in a category of its own. The skills required to bake dough in a pizza oven, whether it runs on gas, coal or wood, don't apply to grilled pizza at all. This makes it an unending source of fascination to pizza technologists including Violet's chef, Matt Hyland. With his wife and business partner, Emily Hyland, Mr. Hyland paid tribute to wood-fired New Haven and New York pizza at his first place, Emily , then took on Detroit pan pizza at Emmy Squared . They have expanded both restaurants to new locations, including Citi Field, where Emmy Squared is now the \"official pizza.\" But Mr. Hyland has been a student of the Al Forno school of pizza for years, since going to college in Rhode Island. Violet, which he opened at the start of the year, is dedicated to the style. He has worked allusions to other features of the state's cuisine into the menu, which makes forays into pasta and small seafood dishes, but the pizza grill is at the center of the action. Anyone who has eaten at Al Forno will recognize the lineage of Violet's pies. Both are as thin as a saltine all the way to the edge, with parallel lines of grill marks on their undersides. Al Forno puts fontina on its margheritas, as Violet did with all its pizzas until recently, when it began experimenting with havarti. In any case, the cheeses are on the dry side and grated for fast, thin distribution. Sauces are splashed down by the spoonful, quickly, before the crust burns. That's the template for a pie called the Atwells: a base coat of grated havarti and pecorino under big blots of a garlic-laden pesto made even greener than usual by the inclusion of broccoli and pistachios. While Al Forno tosses raw, slivered scallions on almost every pie, Violet may chop its scallions or grill them. One appealingly eccentric pie that combines a New Haven clam pizza with a Peking duck pancake is finished with fried julienned leeks. Olive oil does give Al Forno's crust extra crackle and flavor, but Violet's less lavishly oiled dough, made with a sourdough starter, has more flavor of its own. It's a little salty, crunchy but not brittle, more substantial than you expect, and highly chewable. Violet gives you a heavy pair of shears to snip the pie into wedges, or any shape you like. Wielding them supplies the palpable thrill of using exactly the right tool for the job, and it's even better than that because the job is eating pizza. A trip to Providence last weekend, though, turned up more than structural similarities between Violet and Al Forno. Three of the four pizzas on Al Forno's menu reminded me of pies I'd eaten at Violet. One resembled the Atwells, but its pesto was made with asparagus rather than broccoli. For Violet's Beech Vibes, a thin layer of duxelles is spread from rim to rim, then topped with tahini, caramelized onions and pickled beech mushrooms. It reminds me of a pissaladière in which the anchovies have been replaced by mushrooms. Al Forno makes a duxelles pizza, too, but tops it with unpickled white mushrooms, and doesn't use tahini. And, of course, both places do a variation on a Neapolitan margherita, called the margarita in Providence and the Classic in the East Village. The difference between their dough recipes doesn't quite put to rest the suspicion that Violet should be more conscientious about avoiding overlap even though Al Forno is 180 miles away. Most diners, of course, will just be happy to have a new style of pizza in town. Any of Violet's pies, eaten before or after the iceberg-wedge salad with blue cheese and a jolt of ranch dressing, or the frisée salad tossed with fried artichokes, would make an ideal fast dinner. Beyond that, the going can get tricky. All the pastas I tried seemed like rough drafts, from the radiatore baked in a very salty vodka sauce to the spaghetti con vongole con dashi, a Japanese-Italian blind date that doesn't have the right chemistry. The two desserts I had were even stranger. Describing one of them, a cheesecake with banana pudding on it, the server said, \"I'm just going to tell you what it is and if you guys want it, you can order it.\" If the warning had been any stronger it would have come with liability waivers. If you did want to build a longer meal, some of the seafood appetizers can help. Not the \"stuffies,\" baked stuffed littlenecks or cherrystones that could use more clam. The smoked mackerel, though, is excellent and comes with some unusually good fresh-fried potato chips. There are also shrimp that have been grilled with their heads and shells on, placed over johnnycakes and splashed with spiced piri-piri sauce. Johnnycakes, which are made of fried cornmeal mush and taste like it, are probably more strongly identified with Rhode Island than any other food. I have never been sure why, because johnnycakes can be found, if you really want to look for them, all along the Atlantic Coast. The only time I've seen Rhode Islanders eating them was on a Boy Scout camping trip, and boy scouts will eat anything if you leave them in the woods for a few days. In any case, the johnnycakes that Violet places under the shrimp and the piri-piri sauce are kind of wonderful. The cornmeal has a lush, right-off-the-cob flavor.

{"id": 63, "data": " The main attraction at Madame Vo BBQ , now two months into its run on Second Avenue in the East Village, is a seven-course dinner on the theme of beef. This is a familiar concept in Vietnam, where it is known as bo bay mon, as well as in San Jose, Calif., Houston and other areas with robust Vietnamese populations. In New York, where the Vietnamese restaurant scene is more anemic, bo bay mon is still a rarity. The rough outlines of the setup at Madame Vo, though, will be familiar to any New Yorker who has gone out for Korean barbecue. New York City bureaucracy is unwelcoming to the tabletop charcoal grills seen in Hanoi, so an electric grill under a metal screen is embedded in each table. Once the grill is switched on and the metal rods down at kneecap level begin to warm up, an array of sauces, condiments and vegetables will arrive. When the rods are red, a server with a pair of tongs will lay some meat down on the screen, return periodically to fiddle with it and eventually decide when it is ready to be eaten. The similarities with, say, Han Joo Chik Naeng Myun & BBQ in Queens end, of course, with the actual food. Yes, both offer lettuce for wrapping, but at Madame Vo BBQ it is part of a Vietnamese table salad, along with fresh herbs; raw cucumbers, pineapple and apple; and pickled carrots and daikon. The restaurant also sets out a nifty caddy that holds circles of rice paper and warm water, in a miniature bathtub, for wetting the paper until it is soft enough to fashion into rolls. Rather than gochujang and sesame oil, there is a classic Vietnamese nuoc cham, an intoxicatingly good version of the pineapple-and-fermented anchovy sauce known as mam nem, and lastly a tamarind sauce, which suggests Madame Vo BBQ can follow or leap over Vietnamese tradition at will. This is about what you'd expect if you've eaten at another restaurant, a few blocks north, simply called Madame Vo . Jimmy Ly is the chef in both places; he and his wife, Yen Vo, are the proprietors. Each was raised in the United States by immigrants from Vietnam, and like many children of immigrants they seem to be fluent not just in two languages but in two cultures, enabling them to serve dishes their families might recognize in a setting that outsiders might embrace. The wings at Madame Vo, sticky with caramel and fried garlic, are drive-straight-from-the-airport good. The restaurant produces some of the only pho in Manhattan worth talking about. One of them, in a porcelain bowl the size of a baptismal font, is filled with a potent beef broth, a short rib on the bone and enough other cuts to make a butcher smile. At least one dish at the couple's new restaurant can stand alongside the wings and the pho at their first: the oxtail congee. Congee, or chao thit bo, is customarily the last course in bo bay mon. It frequently takes the form of a cloudy beef-and-rice soup. Mr. Ly cooks his congee with some chicken stock until it has the consistency of polenta, then spoons over it some sweet and savory braised oxtails in honey, fish sauce and brown butter. Everything about it is wonderful, even the scallion greens on top. The first of the seven beefs is typically boi tai chanh, a raw beef salad, and this is a high point, too. Lean eye of round cut into thin pink sheets is the canvas for an action-painting whirl of fried shallots, raw red onions, chopped peanuts and slivers of fresh mint. Pretty standard stuff so far, but then Mr. Ly bathes the salad in tangerine-lime vinaigrette, which has a positively buoyant effect, and splashes it with a bright-green, lemony pulp of fresh rau ram puréed in oil. In the middle of this $59 menu come the grilled meats, the courses for which the table salad and rice paper wrappers have been waiting. The finest of these might be the relatively straightforward five-spice tongue, although the betel-leaf-wrapped bundles of seasoned ground beef -- bo la lot -- are soothing and stimulating at once, and the New York strip with marrow butter is a clever way to acknowledge Manhattan's own beef-eating rituals, even if it would draw blank stares on the streets of Saigon. If you, like me, are naturally skeptical when servers persistently push a big-ticket item, you might be tempted to blaze your own path through Madame Vo BBQ's menu. But once you've tried the bo bay mon you have, by and large, seen the kitchen at its best. Yes, you could get the whole catfish, and if you are not into beef perhaps you should. Despite what the menu says, the catfish is not grilled, but fried and then baked. It was perfectly done the night I had it, and was filleted at the table by a server who knew his way around a fish skeleton. By that time, all that was left to do was to wrap a chunk of fish in lettuce and rice paper with a squeeze of grilled lemon and some of the sautéed shallots, lemongrass and bird chiles that the kitchen had ladled along the snaking curve of the spine. If you are thinking about a vegetable, the skewered and grilled okra pods in soy are crunchy and unslimy. The other appetizers, though, can be tricky. One night, the grilled scallop brushed with duck fat was transporting; on another, it tasted too much like the grill. Spring rolls filled with short rib and bone marrow seemed pointlessly indulgent, and so did their truffle hoisin dipping sauce in which I couldn't taste the truffles. A few dishes might have been improved if they'd arrived while hot, like the extra-large grilled oysters under caramelized sea urchin mayonnaise or the charred sea urchin, basted in its shell with butter, sake and fish sauce. Grilled prawns brushed with a lovely orange butter were slightly more mushy than two prawns sold for $38 should be. And while the 44-ounce tomahawk steak was more than a fair deal at $90, it would have been helped by a more aggressive sear and more salt. On certain nights, the whole operation had a slack, inattentive feeling that's rare in new restaurants. The catfish sat on the table, getting cold, while we waited for the table salad to show up. The thick stems of stir-fried morning glory would have been better cut into shorter lengths. Madame Vo BBQ may eventually run as smoothly as its older sibling. While it works out the mechanics, the surest route to happiness is to eat the bo bay mon while sipping cold coconut water through a metal straw out of a whole green coconut that you hold in one hand, like a cup of coffee.

{"id": 64, "data": " The best way to enter the Albanian restaurant Cka Ka Qellu , if not the most direct, starts on Arthur Avenue. Arrive before the fish shops along this famous, not-quite-faded Italian strip in the Bronx take in the iced clams and octopus for the night. Across from Dominick's, turn into the indoor market that Fiorello La Guardia ordered up. Move on past the hand-rolled cigars and the T-shirts reflecting various tenets of Bronx philosophy. Keep going beyond the scamorza, the soppressata and the ready-to-go heroes, and walk out the door on to Hughes Avenue. Just to the right is a spinning wheel that looks old enough to have been Rumpelstiltskin's and next to it, another door. Open it, walk inside. The short trip seems to have taken you back in time. The spinning wheel turns out to be just one piece in Cka Ka Qellu's collection of antique tools, stringed instruments, yokes, brass coffee mills, manual typewriters, dishes of hammered metal and embroidered costumes that the owner, Ramiz Kukaj, brought over from the old country. Some, he says, go back to the 18th century. The floors and walls seem to have been airlifted from an Albanian farmhouse, and the speakers play wistful folk tunes on traditional instruments, not the modern, globally aware wake-up calls of the brass band Fanfara Tirana . The restaurant is soaked in nostalgia. The other reason for the walk from Arthur Avenue is that it recapitulates a pattern that's repeated throughout this neighborhood, where the signs and menus facing the street are still written in Italian but many of the people in the back rooms, seasoning the sausages and frying the veal cutlets, are Albanian. Here and there, those Albanians have brought a little of their cuisine into those Italian businesses. Cumin-laden suxhuk sausages hang to dry in the salumerias. In some pizzerias, the burek challenges the Jamaican beef patty for outsider meat-pie supremacy. One such place, also owned by Mr. Kukaj, is in the Norwood neighborhood and is called Tradita. ( Ligaya Mishan reviewed it in 2017.) But if you want a deep-end Albanian experience, Cka Ka Qellu, pronounced SHA ka chell-OO, is the place to go. The kitchen does not focus on the seafood of Albania's Adriatic coast, or the more intensely Greek- and Turkish-leaning cuisine of its southern reaches. Instead, it heavily favors the north, which shares many dishes with the former components of Yugoslavia that are its neighbors. In particular there is a strong overlap with Kosovo, home to many ethnic Albanians including, at one time, Mr. Kukaj and his chef, Afrim Kaliqani. In their kitchen, yogurt and cream are everywhere, along with curds of soft fresh cheese and triangles of creamy, unsqueaky feta. A good portion of the menu could be described as things in a creamy white sauce. Another, entirely different portion could be described as creamy white sauce with things in it. Included in the second group are some of the dips that are almost obligatory at the start of your Cka Ka Qellu experience: tarator, tart yogurt with minced cucumbers, garlic and parsley, similar to tzatziki, but nearly as fluffy as whipped cream; cream stirred with bits of suxhuk to give it a pinkish tint and a suggestion of spice; and kajmak , which our server described as \"like butter for bread\" and I would say was like crème fraîche blended with cream cheese and butter. (In parts of Albania, it would be made by boiling unpasteurized milk from water buffalo.) I found myself dipping sausages, vegetables and just about everything else into the kajmak, but it is exceptionally good with a warm slice of the bread that Cka Ka Qellu bakes in the pizza oven that is the first thing you see when you walk in. When the menu defines kacamak as \"cream with polenta,\" the cream in question is kajmak, stirred into a fine-grained, nearly white mass of cornmeal that takes on the lightly fluffed quality of really well-made mashed potatoes. Sometimes there is a creamy sauce where you don't expect one. Each slice of lecenik, a cornbread with spinach and cottage cheese that is so rich it is only a few rungs in the ladder from cheesecake, comes to the table under a spoonful of kajmak. Sometimes there is no creamy sauce where one would do some good. The restaurant's version of fli, the slow-baked, many-layered pancake, is served as a long, narrow wedge with no accompaniment, although it is somewhat less than fully tender and moist. Luckily it responds immediately to any spare yogurt you can forage from elsewhere on the table. The mantia, baked dumplings filled with ground veal and onions, will seem tough and dry, too, if you order them alone. The same mantia cooked with yogurt in a clay dish will seem perfect. Is there another restaurant in New York that makes as much use of veal, and as little of any other meat, as Cka Ka Qellu? It is the main ingredient in the restaurant's qofte, ground and mixed with onions and red pepper; and in its qebapa, mild skinless sausages cooked on the grill. (The sausages would be called cevapi in other corners of the Balkans, where they are likely to be made from lamb or beef.) Veal works its way into many of the clay-dish stews, including the veal tava, something like a Mediterranean ratatouille that got itself entangled with a meat-and-potato stew from another part of Europe. Rolled up with cheeses and smoked meat, breaded and fried, veal also serves as the filling for the alluring Skanderbeg. Named after a great patriotic hero of the 15th century, Skanderbeg is generally called Albania's national dish, although its resemblance to a kayak made from chicken cordon bleu renders it something of an outlier in the cuisine. Ladled along its crunchy, golden length is -- please rise and face Hughes Avenue -- a creamy white sauce. Eating all of this without a salad is unimaginable and probably unadvisable. Each of Cka Ka Qellu's several salads seems to consist of cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions and cheese in slightly different arrangements. If the vegetables were any fresher, you'd be embarrassed to eat them in public. Surprise appearances by olives and their ilk provide extra variety. Like the breads, the desserts are baked on site: syrup-soaked baklava, a nut cake called haxhimak, a sugar cookie with nuts pressed into the top whose Albanian name is sheqerpare. I like them best with coffee boiled on the stove in a long-handled brass pitcher and served on a matching tray, both of them engraved with ancient, geometric designs that repeat and repeat.

{"id": 65, "data": " For an operation that essentially serves one dish, Maxi's Noodle has a dauntingly long menu. The dish is Hong Kong-style won-ton noodle soup, though, which requires Maxi Lau, the chef and proprietor, to keep a large number of items on hand to be added to or subtracted from the soup at the customer's whim: the broth of pork bones boiled with dried shrimp; the skinny yellow noodles with their firm, elastic snap; the stewed beef cooked with a sizable pinch of five-spice powder; the dense fish balls streaked with scallions; the weightless, grease-free chips of fried fish skin; and so on. But the one item that is absolutely essential is the won ton. Make that plural -- won tons, as many as Ms. Lau will put into your bowl ($8). This turns out to be four if you also want noodles, and six if you don't. Years ago Ms. Lau's mother dreamed of opening a won-ton shop, and had gone to Toronto to learn the art of won-ton wrapping from a family friend. Those plans changed when she learned she had cancer. After she died, two years ago, Maxi Lau decided to rebuild her own life. Leaving her job in corporate management, she retraced her mother's steps, learning to make won tons with the same family friend. Three months ago, she started Maxi's as a pop-up every evening but Thursdays, taking over a Hong Kong-style breakfast and lunch cafe owned by an aunt in Flushing, Queens. Ms. Lau plans to set up a noodle soup shop of her own in another part of Flushing later this year. Until then, she is making more won tons than she expected, because customers keep coming back to buy them by the dozen, frozen. Ms. Lau's won tons are filled with a mixture of shrimp and pork, with the emphasis very much on the shrimp. Each bite -- it takes at least two to finish off a Maxi's Noodle won ton -- confirms that the shrimp are of very high quality and are cooked in a way that keeps them unusually crisp and juicy. You can see their bodies glowing pink through the thin skins of the wrappers, whose loose ends trail behind the plump, round won tons like comets' tails.

{"id": 66, "data": " Part of the fun of eating at a pop-up is the thrill of invading a space after hours, like being locked in the museum at night with the whale and the diamonds. Another part is the sense of being in on a secret, eating at some place that doesn't have a Yelp entry and may not even have a name, while your friends are waiting in line at Roberta's . The mismatch between the borrowed space and the borrowers can send off sparks, too. Three years ago, when the Danish chef Bo Bech staged a one-night pop-up in the kitchen at Cosme in Manhattan, using ingredients he'd bought from farmers and shellfishers in Virginia the day before, his Mid-Atlantic-Nordic cooking stood out against the aromas of griddled masa and roasted chiles. When a pop-up settles down into a space of its own, it loses those things. In their place, it takes on the extra weight of proprietorship. The owners have to make decisions that were previously made for them, and those decisions will start to define them. It's their paint color on the wall, their scented candles in the bathroom, their name on the door. This is the position in which we find the former pop-up Oxalis and its chef, Nico Russell, a veteran of Daniel , in New York, and Mirazur , on the French Riviera. Beginning in 2016, Mr. Russell slalomed through a series of restaurants that would hand him the keys on off nights so he could cook tasting menus of 10 courses or so. First he inhabited Fitzcarraldo , an Italian restaurant whose combination of industrial, nautical, cinematic and Mediterranean elements has made it a frequent wedding site. Later he moved on to Egg , an austerely contemporary temple to breakfast which had begun its own life, more than a decade earlier, as a pop-up. He sold tickets to his Oxalis dinners, enough of them to get a few investors interested. With enough funding to take on a lease in Crown Heights, Oxalis opened in November in a former wine bar within sight of the Brooklyn Museum. Mr. Russell's vision for Oxalis is the one behind the bistronomie movement in France and its disciples abroad: carefully considered food served without the hoopla that drives up tabs. He slings a lot of vegetables in Oxalis's four- to six-course set menus, and it's one sign of his skill that this doesn't come across as a cost-cutting measure even though it must be, at least in part -- dinner is an extremely reasonable $60. Both the price and the understated cooking style reminded me of Contra , which opened with a five-course, $55 menu. The last time I went I ate a dish built around spaghetti-like strands of rutabaga under a warm snowdrift of whipped Alpine fontina. These two mild-tasting ingredients were set in motion by the force of a third, a dark and focused coffee-and-chicory cream sauce. This was a rutabaga that made me smile. Granted, I probably like rutabaga more than the average person, but I suspect that exposure to the rutabaga at Oxalis would make the average person realize that I'm right. Meals begin with a couple of bite-size snacks, one of which tends to be a crisp potato cake dusted with bay-leaf powder and topped with a chip of nori. It looks harmless enough, but can produce powerful emotions, which are easier to understand once you know that the potatoes are stewed in duck fat and then deep-fried. The other snack might be some lightly dehydrated beets brushed with marjoram-infused cream, or tiny grilled carrots that you dip in chamomile sabayon. (This is one of the dishes that suggests the long shadow of Noma , which in its early days famously matched aged carrots with chamomile.) The price seems meant to encourage frequent visits, but if you return often you may experience déjà vu. At meals in December, January and February, I was always served some variation on raw sea scallops with daikon and apple and some version of duck breast, sweet potato and yogurt. The portions in both cases were restrained but the flavors were outsize. The scallops were cured in miso and refrigerated for a few days and came out of it with something like the concentration of flavor that beef gets from dry-aging, but none of the funk. The duck's flavor was less surprising, but there was some energy in its collision with sweet potato purée and fig-leaf yogurt tart enough to cause double-takes. Like the rest of the menu, desserts are unshowy but can be highly impressive. One worked goat milk up into a thing of beauty: Some of it was made into a simple frozen custard, the rest cooked down into cajeta. The cooking makes it clear why people chased Oxalis around Brooklyn in its various borrowed spaces, but other aspects of the restaurant suggest that it hasn't quite figured out how to live in a space of its own. A meal there can be a somewhat solemn experience, which doesn't seem to be what Mr. Russell and his partners are aiming for. The layout seems to work against it. The kitchen is right up front, and the bar is all the way in the back, separated from the dining room by a glass door in a glass wall. I can't imagine what the wall is for, unless Oxalis is planning to bring back the smoking section. Instead of serving as a street-side welcome and a source of energy for the dining room, the bar feels like a waiting room. And while it takes reservations, the tasting menu isn't served there. The bar menu is à la carte. The dining room could use a little lift. It's as plain as a Shaker church, with clamshell-colored wainscoting below white walls unbroken by pictures or anything else. (All the art is in the restroom.) The way the servers have been coached on their lines so far underlines the decorative stiffness. They say stuff like \"Moving now into more sweet things …\" rather than \"Here's your dessert,\" and my neighbor one night was instructed to \"sit back and relax,\" something that tends to go without saying in most restaurants. Things have loosened up since the liquor license came through. In the first few weeks, the servers were always trying to push a nonalcoholic beverage pairing for $20, and while the bar was mixing sodas that were more interesting than many cocktails around town, I'm not sure they were different enough from one another to justify drinking the whole slate. Now there are also wine pairings, starting at $35. Sometimes I wondered whether it would get the air circulating if the bar popped up in the dining room, or vice versa. There's probably some simple fix, or a series of them, that would give Oxalis some of its old sense of adventure. You can sense it lying there, waiting, when you taste that cajeta, those scallops, the fantastic little potato cakes.

{"id": 67, "data": " The great Midtown shrines to French cuisine were mourned one by one as they went, often at length and in print. At the same time, another style of French restaurant was dying off, but generally without benefit of a full obituary. This was the small, discreet bistro with forehead-height curtains in the windows, Piaf on the speakers, snails on the menu, chips on the china. They could be found uptown or downtown, almost always on a side street. Unlike Le Pavillon, La Côte Basque and their ilk, and unlike Keith McNally's immersive brasserie sets , which came later, these bistros were rarely fashionable. They were filled with professors and psychotherapists, Paris Review readers and Film Society of Lincoln Center members. Occasionally a passer-by out walking the dog would stand on tiptoe to peer over the curtain, but paparazzi did not stake out the doors of these establishments. Individually, few were landmarks. Collectively, their quiet continental self-assurance, their indifference to the passage of time, not to mention their crèmes brûlées and blood sausages and Fleuries, helped form the backdrop of the city. You always thought you'd have one within walking distance. Then, one day, you didn't. Bistro Pierre Lapin , which the chef and restaurateur Harold Moore opened last May in the West Village, is either a very late entry into the genre, or else a homage of impressive intensity. The dining room has the forehead-height curtains -- green gingham. It has Piaf on the playlist, and also Pink Martini's \"Sympathique,\" which has become the \"Vie en Rose\" of the Spotify era, for better or worse. Pierre Lapin also throws in some frills that go beyond the basic formula. White tapers burn on every table, wall sconces throw off Cognac-colored light from behind lampshades the size of teacups, a collection of thin flowery china dishes supplements the chunky white bistro ware. Most of all, Pierre Lapin has that rich, creamy, antique cooking -- all the stuff nouvelle cuisine tried to kill. As soon as you order, you get a preview of what you're in for: A length of chewy, substantial baguette arrives with a small mound of cultured butter, a pile of truffled cheese spread and a pink hunk of rustic pork pâté. On a quiet night at home, this could serve as a light dinner. At Pierre Lapin, it is a little snack to stave off hunger before the appetizers. Going back at least as far as his days at Commerce , Mr. Moore has seemed at home with profuse helpings and sauces that settled over them like a goose-down duvet over a sleeping Saint Bernard. After closing that restaurant, he opened an ode to Southern immoderation called Harold's Meat & Three, now just Harold's ; the most memorable thing I've eaten there was a Kentucky hot brown sandwich on which the Mornay sauce flowed freely. He also briefly ran a less focused study of Americana called the Greenwich Grille, where I ate a chicken potpie that I thought had potential. About a week later, I learned that the place had closed. None of Mr. Moore's previous kitchens went for the gut quite as gleefully as Pierre Lapin's. Your first course there could well be, and almost certainly will be if you leave the choice to me, an avalanche of mushrooms in cream cascading over the edge of a tall slab of buttered and griddled pain de mie. But it would be a mistake to overlook the Brie au four, roughly half a pound of baked Brie melting among dried figs and walnuts, all served with toasted baguette. I ended up ordering the Brie for the table, which freed somebody else to get the very meaty frogs' legs in a small lake of parsley, garlic, butter and lemon juice, while another guest tried the \"balle de matzo en consommé.\" In English, that means a nice bowl of chicken soup with a single matzo ball so densely packed that if you tossed it out of a second-story window it would probably put a dent in a car hood. This is not a bad trait in a matzo ball unless you happen to own the car. The lusty tune begun by the appetizers is picked up by the main courses. There is a fairly classic coq au vin, not too winy-tasting; some hefty sea scallops under toasted almonds, sensibly outfitted with endive and citrus sections; and a grouping of gnocchi, foie gras, sautéed sweetbreads and mushrooms, black truffle shavings and puffy chicken dumplings, all milling around in a Cognac-flamed cream sauce. It sounds insanely overcrowded, but is very rewarding to unpack. We have only scratched the surface of the menu. It goes on, perhaps longer than it should, because some dishes are more appealing than others. A black sea bass \"bonne femme\" was simply dull instead of simple. The soupy, thin cassoulet could have used more meat and a thicker crust of bread crumbs. The garlic sauce Mr. Moore made for snails tasted less garlicky than run-of-the-mill snail butter; the snails and I never figured out what we were supposed to do with the sunny-side-up egg planted in the middle of the plate. The menu could be trimmed by about a third. The same is most likely true for a few individual dishes, although Mr. Moore's shambolic, celebratory cooking style is one of the reasons Pierre Lapin works as well as it does. If he tidied everything up he'd be going head-to-head with Le Coucou , a contest that would not play to his strengths. The excess, the untucked shirttails on the dishes, the incomplete thoughts on the menu are part of the restaurant's charm. That charm does not quite extend to the wine list, which looks like one from four decades ago. It's almost entirely drawn from Bordeaux, Burgundy and the Rhone, with very few bottles under $75. This seems to be taking the joke a little too far -- in 1971, you could still get cheap Bordeaux. I drank well, but I always spent more on it than I meant to, which is the kind of thing that can keep diners from coming back. For dessert there is a coconut cake that has little to do with France. Dense and rich in a homespun American style that some people will love and others will find too leaden, it followed Mr. Moore here from Commerce, where it was a big hit. Other members of the lineup you already know. The chocolate mousse is deliciously dark, though not as airy as it could be. The sugar crust on the crème brûlée is burned to order. Both are overshadowed, though, by a peculiarly likable Pavlova. It is conceived as a tart, with a meringue crust and a whipped-cream topping; once it is sliced into a white wedge, bright yellow passion-fruit curd runs down its sides.

{"id": 68, "data": " Cherry Point sits on Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint, a few steps from the corner where Bedford Avenue, having flowed all the way across Brooklyn from the shores of Sheepshead Bay, suddenly comes to an end. The area is marked by a cluster of restaurants. Some have a washed-up feeling, as if they'd all been drifting along in Bedford's currents and had been stranded there. A few stand out in the landscape. In the fall, Cherry Point took a decisive turn into the second category when a new chef took over, but not everyone in the neighborhood seems to realize it yet. People still tumble in for happy hour, when servers whose hairstyles take a minute to adjust to will pour three-gulp martinis, manhattans and Rob Roys (due for a revival) in little Nick & Nora glasses for $8 each, and then after happy hour ends at 7 p.m. most of the crowd generally drifts out to find somewhere else for dinner. The space, with its old-timey wainscoting and its central bar, is easy to mistake for a tavern. Let's say you were among those who stayed put. Contemporaneously with your cocktail, you worked on a few smoked olives, green and warm; swirled a few of the golden, bite-size pig's head croquettes in a pale-pinkish ketchup made from pears; and became curious about what else this kitchen was up to. At one point you noticed that the dining room suddenly smelled like an herb garden in August, and a minute later Belon oysters on a nest of smoking rosemary branches sailed out of the kitchen opening that lights up the back of the restaurant. You ordered a plate of your own because you wanted to know how the warm oysters would taste under their yellow blankets of smoked rosemary hollandaise. From a short list of charcuterie you chose the squab and pork terrine, with a few prunes embedded into the pink and pleasingly coarse-grained slab. You spread this on toast with creamy whole-grain mustard, apricot-ginger mostarda or some of the pear ketchup, all of them made on the premises, like the pearl onions pickled in beer and the terrine itself. And you might have thought: If these are just the snacks, what is the food going to be like when this kitchen gets down to business? Whatever happens, odds are there will be meat on the table. Cherry Point opened in 2016, taking over what had been a Polish restaurant called Cinamoon. The charcuterie was made on site from the start, but the menu swerved in a more meat-focused and English-leaning direction last fall when Ed Szymanski was hired as the chef. This might have been predicted, if not from Mr. Szymanski's English upbringing and British citizenship, then from his work history. He has cooked at the Beatrice Inn , where various beasts of air and land are posed on silver platters for their roles in a fall-of-Rome spectacle; the Spotted Pig , in the days when it was still known for burgers basted in Roquefort and toasts buried under chopped chicken livers; and Pitt Cue , a London outpost of the modern, urbanized barbecue genre. For a panoramic tour of Mr. Szymanski's accumulated meat wisdom, you could call two days ahead and reserve a game-and-beef dinner, $65 for at least four courses along the lines of grilled tongue on watercress. The everyday menu, though, is not exactly made up of grain bowls. On any given night, you can drop in and marvel at the fried lamb ribs, their apple glaze augmented by broken coriander and fennel seeds and raw curls of shallot. The quail will be butterflied, grilled over charcoal and served on toast, with pickled prunes above it and a reduction swirled with port below. The duck breast will be seared down until the skin is a thin brown sheet next to pink and juicy meat. This is served with roasted, puréed celery root and brûléed pears. The plates are marked by a refinement and moderation that is not always achieved by other chefs in the guts-and-fat school of cookery. A creamy pheasant, leek and bacon pie is sealed inside a cast-iron pot by a beauty of a suet crust -- lacquered, scored in a starburst and very tender. Care is even lavished on the grilled rib-eye for two, which comes to the table with neatly sawed lengths of bone marrow under a tidy crust of parsley, chives, pickle shallots and buttered bread crumbs. Mr. Szymanski does not gesture toward fish and vegetables very often, but when he does he generally musters some conviction. True, the roasted pumpkin mash with toasted hazelnuts and fresh cheese has an obligatory air, as does the grilled bread with labneh and honey. But the smoked whitefish salad, with caramelized shallots and crème fraîche and a side of saltines, is more energetic than you might guess. Grilled flatbread looks out of place on this menu, but it is a fine canvas for roasted hens-of-the-woods and other wild mushrooms that are fleshy and flavorful enough to get noticed on their own. Skate, a main course, comes with smoked German butterball potatoes and a soaring, fino sherry-laced beurre blanc. The salad of radicchio and other bitter lettuces is as crisp and refreshing as any plate of leaves can be in February. It is also a very good thing to eat with steak, as it happens. Anyone who has not caught on to the English theme so far will get a last chance with the dessert menu, which offers treacle tart, sticky toffee pudding, a posset and three cheeses, all from England. The treacle tart was dry when I had it. The sticky toffee pudding was surprisingly but not unpleasantly cakelike. The posset, though, is a small miracle, an eggless custard of sugar, lemon juice and cream scented with Earl Grey tea, dressed up with Cara Cara orange wedges and a few Earl Grey meringues. There should be more possets around town. There should be possets galore. And by the way, there should be more wine lists like Cherry Point's. Assembled by Garret Smith, who owns the restaurant with Vincent Mazeau, it consistently favors obscure and surprising over familiar and dull. By the bottle, there are oddities such as apple wine and mead, but also a few things you might have heard of: a cremant d'Alsace from Dirler Cadé, a Sybille Kuntz riesling, an Olga Raffault chinon and a lean, exact pinot noir from Enderle & Moll. Only two bottles, both sparkling wines, are over $100, and most of the others are closer to $50. At these prices, you could just close your eyes and pick something, which is lucky because the servers, though charming and truly unpretentious, haven't fully internalized the list's ins and outs. It's one of the ways in which Cherry Point seems not to have caught up yet with how good it has become. If you treat it like a bar, you might not notice. But if you eat the way I did, ordering half the menu at a time, you could be putting more stress on the infrastructure than it can handle. You might be in for a very slow meal. But it will also be a very good meal. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 69, "data": " It is a safe guess that the Eastern European Jews who brought the bialy from Bialystok to New York City, piecing back together the recipe for this plain but beguiling dimpled roll in their new world after fleeing their old one, did not do it so that one day it could be sliced open and stuffed with a New Jersey pork sausage that comes in a cloth sack. To be fair, this was not the original plan at Shelsky's Brooklyn Bagels , either. The idea was to serve pork roll, egg and cheese sandwiches on a kaiser roll or one of the bakery's palm-size, hand-rolled bagels. Peter Shelsky, the bakery's owner, grew up in Manhattan, but he knew that some good things come from New Jersey, particularly pork roll, which he wanted to sell in the mornings. Also known as Taylor ham, pork roll is a cured, smoked and cooked meat product that has the tightly pebbled appearance of engineered stone, like a Corian countertop made of flesh. Pressing sliced pork roll on a hot griddle intensifies its saltiness while giving it a hint of a crust that contrasts attractively with the slightly spongy interior. Griddled pork roll, combined with a cooked egg and a slice of American cheese, is eaten across New Jersey as a breakfast sandwich. Usually it is found on a kaiser roll. Sometimes it is seen on a bagel. But some Shelsky's customers requested it on a freshly baked bialy, and others followed, and now pork roll sandwiches made on bialys are nearly as popular as the ones made on rolls, with bagels a distant third. The bialy might have been custom-made for the job, particularly the ones at Shelsky's, which are baked to a darker brown, their thumbprint divots filled with a more robustly caramelized onion confit, than garden-variety bialys. Both traits are intensified if you have the bialy thoroughly toasted, as the person behind the counter will almost certainly recommend.

{"id": 70, "data": " Need opinions on where to eat? They're easy to find these days, as consumers from around the globe fire off countless raves and pans about every known restaurant, cafe, chili counter, falafel cart and crêperie, not to mention post offices and jails. These mash notes and spitballs rain down endlessly not just from traditional review sites like TripAdvisor and Yelp (171 million reviews at last count) and retailers like Amazon, but also from Facebook and Google, those all-purpose giants. Everybody's a critic, right? I happen to get paid for criticism, and I would like to criticize that old platitude right out the window: No, everybody is not a critic. What most of you are doing out there, online and in three dimensions, is complaining. When we complain, we experience something that we don't like and we say something about it. A critic doesn't write about his own dissatisfaction, or doesn't just do that. A critic has to poke his head out of his turtle shell, look around and gesture, with stubby legs, toward the sources of dissatisfaction. Done perceptively, with analytic thinking and an effort to connect the dots between this experience and others, this can be the beginning of a value system that readers might share, or reject, or at least attempt to understand. Complaining is as easy as breathing. Writing criticism is a real pain. That was a complaint, by the way. But criticism and complaint are closely related enough for me to know that there's a lot of complaining going on, and that most of the complaints aren't having any effect at all. This may not be the point. People who study complaints divide them into two categories, instrumental and expressive. An instrumental complaint is \"directed toward a specific target and intended to bring about a specific outcome,\" according to Robin Kowalski, a professor of psychology at Clemson University who has studied the social functions of complaining. Calling a restaurant's owner the next day to say that you waited an hour for dessert and don't intend to come back is an instrumental complaint. Texting a friend to say the polar vortex is making your skin peel off is an expressive complaint. We call expressive complaints venting, kvetching, griping or a number of other names. It's important to know which of the two types of complaint is right for you before opening the first can of invective. Venting has its uses. In one study, Dr. Kowalski and some colleagues showed that when we are asked to put our feelings of dissatisfaction with somebody into writing, our \"positive affect\" -- good feelings, basically -- will rise about 15 minutes later, after an initial downswing. In the same way, if a meal lets you down, taking a pair of pliers and a blowtorch to the restaurant on Yelp might give you a brief lift. But once the rush of having gotten it off your chest is gone, you'd realize nothing has changed. You're still out the price of dinner, and you won't find out whether your grievance has reached the right ears unless somebody at the restaurant responds. Some owners make a point of scouring review sites so they can do just that. Others use the review's date and details to identify and get in touch with the kvetcher. But there are more direct ways to get your gripe acknowledged than scrawling it on the walls of the internet. \"If there's something that's really bothering you, the ultimate benefits are going to come from targeted complaining ,\" Dr. Kowalski said. \"Telling the person or restaurant.\" I know, I know. This is the part I avoid, too, by saving all my criticisms for my reviews. I hate confrontations, I run from them, I'd rather pay the check, even with my own money, and walk out never to return. But let's say you want something out of your complaint. Maybe you just want a rib-eye that's still rare instead of the overdone paving stone you were served. Or you have a reason for wanting an item taken off your bill. Or (and I think this is what most people are looking for when they complain) you just want somebody to look you in the eye and say: \"So sorry about that. Is there anything we can do to make it right?\" Whatever you want, you're more likely to get it if you have a word with a manager either before you leave or later on. As a side benefit, you'll be helping the restaurant, too; when somebody is un happy at the end of a meal, almost any manager or restaurateur wants to know. \"We actually really welcome complaints,\" said Melinda Shopsin, a film producer who cooks and waits tables at Shopsin's, her family's restaurant on the Lower East Side. This may come as a surprise to anyone who has heard the numerous accounts of customers' being tossed out of Shopsin's for any number of arcane infractions. And yet, Ms. Shopsin says that when her mother was still alive, she would ask what was wrong when she saw an unfinished plate, and then take a bite to see for herself. At other restaurants, this exploratory bite may happen backstage, in the kitchen. If you're going to make an instrumental complaint, though, you still need to figure out whether the reasons you're unhappy are subjective or objective. Did Medieval Times undercook the chicken, or do you just not like eating with your hands? Even if you're pretty sure the problem is objective, it can be useful to pretend it's subjective, for the sake of diplomacy. The chef John Tesar recalls a night, soon after he'd opened his Knife steakhouse in Dallas, when he got into an argument with a customer about the weight of a steak -- an objective complaint if ever there was one. \"We had a 33-ounce rib-eye for two,\" Mr. Tesar said. One customer who ordered it wasn't convinced and began \"screaming,\" according to Mr. Tesar: \"‘This steak is too small! This isn't enough to feed all of us!'\" He went to the table, and the hostilities quickly escalated, he said, until \"I went into the kitchen, got a scale, grabbed the steak, weighed it in front of her, and said, ‘It's 36 ounces!'\" The story ends happily, with the two combatants meeting again at a dinner party some time later and getting along swimmingly. \"We both realized how absurd and insecure we were being,\" he said. All this might have been avoided if the complaint had been cast subjectively: \"That steak looks smaller than we expected. Are you sure it's the one we ordered?\" Subjective complaints are still important data for restaurants. If one person doesn't like the new hot-dog lasagna, it's an aberration. If 15 people don't like it, the recipe probably needs to go back to the workshop. The chef or owner needs to know this, but also needs to hear it in terms that won't lead to a screaming match in the dining room . Perhaps you have seen Gordon Ramsay critique another chef's cooking on television? Don't do it like that. In general, the more specific your complaint, the more likely it is to be understood. The worst, most useless and potentially dangerous complaints are broad, sweeping condemnations. \"There is complaining that makes you think about what you're doing, and there is complaining where everybody thinks they're entitled to say anything,\" said Rita Sodi, the chef and owner of the Tuscan restaurant I Sodi in Manhattan. \"Saying, ‘This is terrible' is not complaining. That is being rude. It's like, ‘You're ugly.' It's telling me that I'm ugly. It's personal. It's my food.\" Even when the person you're grousing to did not cook your pasta personally, you should proceed gently, in nonconfrontational terms. It may be helpful to imagine that you are speaking with an air traffic controller trying to land 20 jets during a snowstorm; you would try very hard not to add to the overall stress level in the tower, even if your child was on one of those jets. \"If you can be patient, open and polite, that's really helpful,\" Ms. Shopsin said. \"The more collaborative and open you can be -- ‘Excuse me, I'm sorry' -- even though it's not your fault that it got messed up. People have to understand that sometimes to fix a mistake is not easy.\" And sometimes, a restaurant can make customers happy by changing something that isn't a mistake at all. Occasionally, diners at Shopsin's who had ordered migas complained about finding cilantro in the dish. Initially, the response would be that migas are supposed to have cilantro. Which may be true, but perhaps wasn't the point. Now, Ms. Shopsin asks customers whether they like cilantro.

{"id": 71, "data": " The nice man who brought samples of the banoffee macaron to me and other customers one recent morning began, a few moments later, to gently buff the doors and windows of a new, rose-gold prototype car with a soft cloth. I could see this because the car and I were sharing a room on West 14th Street. The car was in the back and I was in the middle, sitting at one of the cafe tables near the stairs to the second floor, where there is a bar shaped like a wheel and a restaurant with a menu devised by Gregory Marchand, the chef of the Frenchie restaurants in Paris and London. The employees in all of these rooms work for the Union Square Hospitality Group , which I suppose means that Danny Meyer, the group's founder and one of the world's best-known restaurateurs, is now also in the business of polishing automobiles. The whole operation is called Intersect by Lexus , which gives you a good idea who made the car and was paying to keep it shiny and free of dust. Intersect by Lexus is one of those modern places where brands, instead of asking you to buy one of their products then and there, instead try to make you feel the kinds of emotions about the brand that may lead to a sale later on. This is a job formerly performed by advertisements. In fact, Lexus used to publish a print magazine and mail it to its customers, back when that seemed like a good way to persuade people to have emotions about a car. Now we live in the age of the \"branded experience.\" A toilet-paper manufacturer will send you a wheeled toilet on demand . A mattress company will encourage you to sleep inside a roaming \"napmobile.\" Makers of a crunchy orange snack open restaurants, lasting just a few days , where chefs put the crunchy orange snack into meatballs, tacos, cheesecakes and everything else. You cannot get Anne Burrell to sprinkle a Lexus over the top of your mac and cheese, however, and not just because the cheapest one costs $33,000 more than a bag of crunchy orange snacks. Intersect by Lexus takes a different approach, closer to that of A/D/O , a \"creative hub\" in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, owned by the car brand Mini. A/D/O offers temporary exhibitions, talks, performances, work spaces for designers and a sun-filled, roomy Scandinavian cafe whose kitchen was, for a time, overseen by the chef Fredrik Berselius and the restaurateur Claus Meyer . (Mr. Berselius is no longer involved.) When I ate at the cafe, shortly after A/D/O opened, the food barely dented my consciousness, although I remember thinking that if I worked nearby I probably would drop in for lunch or a cortado. In the same way, if I find myself in the meatpacking district by day, I might join the Wi-Fi philosophers who occupy the spindle-backed chairs downstairs at Intersect, just so I could get a maple-bacon scone, a recipe imported from Frenchie to Go on the Rue du Nil in Paris. On the other hand, I'd go well out of my way to eat upstairs at Intersect again. It's not a restaurant in three dimensions -- the service, while skilled, is a bit anonymous, and the interior is a hodgepodge of expensive, subtle design and bric-a-brac that might have been ordered from a catalog. But the food is some of the most engaging I've come across in the past few months, and it will go away after the end of March, when Mr. Marchand's menu will be replaced by one devised by another chef from somewhere else in the world, chosen by representatives from Union Square Hospitality Group and Lexus. (A formal review, with stars, would be obsolete almost as soon as it was published.) I've never made it to Frenchie or its branch in London. Many New York chefs have, however, and working my way through Mr. Marchand's dishes at Intersect helped me understand what other restaurants around town have been trying to imitate: the charred leaves, the cooked grains, the gently swirling patterns that suggest the chef has been plating food on a turntable. Grilled baby leek greens angled out around a pile of barley topped with what looked like a deviled egg. It was, in fact, a smoked and lemon-spiked yolk plopped in the center of some \"whites\" made of Parmesan sabayon. Spice and crunch came from puffed barley dusted with piment d'Espelette. It was just tricky enough, this dish. And I loved the way a caraway brioche, pickled mustard seeds and cucumbers completed the deli allusions begun by a foie gras terrine with layers of soft, smoky pastrami. There was a very welcome spin on skate grenobloise in which the fish was replaced by creamy white halibut under a golden bread-crumb crust; sea beans extended the briny flavor of capers in the brown butter sauce. And if this all sounds a bit cerebral, the big, pillowy, pan-seared gnocchi with fried sweetbreads and veal-glazed mushrooms proved that Mr. Marchand knows the appeal of animal instincts. What to make of those few dishes that did not come together -- the pebbles of cauliflower under a layer of seeds and nuts that looked as if it had spilled from a bird feeder, or the lukewarm chocolate mousse at the bottom of a deep bowl? Was the problem Mr. Marchand's recipes? The way the Union Square Hospitality kitchen crew, led by Nickolas Martinez, had carried them out? The local terroir? Mr. Martinez and Dylan Shipsey, the general manager, say they want customers to feel as if they are walking into Frenchie in Paris. Intersect does not have the premodern limestone wall and ceiling timbers of the Rue du Nil, but Mr. Marchand tried to sprinkle some Right Bank pixie dust on West 14th Street by choosing the plates and bowls, consulting on flower arrangements and sharing his Spotify playlists. Maybe those things help. But the dining room, by the design firm Wonderwall , mostly looks like money to me, apart from the shelves half-filled with coffee-table books, black crow figurines and other eerily generic knickknacks. At least somebody had the good sense to keep the car downstairs, by the restrooms, before it was rolled out last weekend to make room for another temporary exhibition. In what may not be a good sign for Lexus, nobody paid much attention to it when I was there, but somebody was always marveling about the toilets, the Japanese kind that seem to know exactly what you are going to do before you do. The chef-in-residence conceit is not unique to Intersect. On Mulberry Street, Chefs Club also turns its permanent kitchen crew over to somebody else's menu; a new restaurant in Houston, the Decatur Bar & Popup Factory , gives its entire space to prospective restaurateurs for three months at a time so they can test-drive their ideas before going out on their own. The chefs of Contra , in Manhattan, and other restaurants sometimes turn over the menu to friends of theirs for a night or two. The most ambitious experiment in this vein may be In Situ , the restaurant inside the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art that on any given day faithfully reproduces a dozen or so dishes that are strongly identified with other restaurants around the world. To understand the appeal for chefs of these pop-ups and residencies, think about the Instagram posts, the email-address caches, the preview news items, even the occasional reviews they generate. For a few months' or even a few nights' work, a restaurant can refresh its aura of newness and relevance. In an era that feeds on novelty, chefs who just keep plugging along can seem older than they really are. The events make the host restaurant look cooler, too. (It's been a while since Union Square Hospitality Group hired a chef who got menu analysts chattering the way Mr. Marchand does.) And of course, people who go to these dinners can boast about them on social media. It's a big, beautiful marketing ecosystem in which everybody from predators to bottom feeders gets to believe they're at the top of the food chain.

{"id": 72, "data": " New York used to be a one-mole town, and that was mole poblano. A chocolate-colored, bittersweet agglomeration of two dozen or so ingredients, it comes, like most of the city's Mexican immigrants, from the state of Puebla. Typically simmered with chicken, mole poblano was a staple of takeout joints and lunch counters and restaurants before anyone took Mexican food in New York seriously. All the other moles -- Oaxaca's mole verde, say, which gets its green color from pumpkin seeds, tomatillos and fresh herbs -- were about as rare as a mandarin duck in Central Park. In recent years, as these once-exotic species have become regular features of the menus at Cosme , Empellón , Claro and other restaurants, mole poblano has become something like the pigeon of Mexican sauces, too common and familiar to be worth noticing. If you share this low view of mole poblano, you owe it to yourself to have the one at Casa Enrique . The chef, Cosme Aguilar, calls it mole de Piaxtla, after the Pueblan town where his father grew up, and as a reminder that there is not just one mole poblano but many. Some have apple in addition to raisins. Some are thickened with animal crackers. Mr. Aguilar remembers that in his childhood home, plantains were allowed to hang until they were black before they could be pounded into mole. Maybe this explains the particular sweetness of Casa Enrique's version, which is not the candy-bar sweetness of some. It's deep and complicated. The character of this mole de Piaxtla unfurls as you eat, whether the sauce has been soaked into enchiladas filled with chicken or simply pooled on a plate over and under a quartered chicken and yellow rice cooked with peas. Mr. Aguilar has been frying, blending and stirring mole de Piaxtla since Casa Enrique opened in 2012, just off Vernon Boulevard, in Long Island City, Queens. In fact, he has barely changed his menu since our Hungry City critic, Ligaya Mishan, reviewed it the next year. Mr. Aguilar says he is emulating the restaurants he likes best in Mexico, ones whose kitchens make the same dishes year in and year out. Whether despite this or because of it, the restaurant seems to have improved in subtle ways. Acoustic panels tacked to the ceiling make conversation easier. Servers, always welcoming, have become experts at anticipating the meal's ebb and flow. They'll step in just when you're ready for a fresh drink, maybe a margarita with some tamarind this time to offset the raw-sugar syrup. They'll gauge the precise moment when you're ready to have dinner plates cleared to make room for dessert. Or they'll break away from your table just long enough to join in a full-throated singing of \"Happy Birthday\" around a slice of tres leches cake with a candle stuck in it on the other side of the room. This may happen three or four times a night, probably not because Casa Enrique looks particularly festive -- from floor to ceiling, it's done almost entirely in white -- but, I'd guess, because regulars know it regularly outperforms any number of other restaurants that might seem to be more special on the surface but aren't, really. Also, the tres leches cake, if not as soggy with condensed milk as it could be, is still pretty good, though I think the flan is almost mandatory, and it, too, is a perfectly credible birthday-candle holder. Although the guacamole is freshly mashed and pleasingly minimalist, I tend to skip it as long as the people I'm with don't mind. Instead I'll head straight for the two-bite sopecitos topped with refried beans and loose chorizo, or the albondigas in cumin-laced chipotle sauce, each of the three meatballs stuffed with hard-cooked eggs. The best Mexican seafood dishes often come from restaurants that specialize in them. Mr. Aguilar, though, seems equally at home with fish and meat. The market fish offered as a main course -- lately a black sea bass -- has always been seared to a crisp on the skin side. Still, in all these years I've never been convinced that the corn under it compares to the best street-corner esquites, or that it and the fish really add up to a whole dish. The seafood appetizers, on the other hand, are some of my favorite things at Casa Enrique: the delicately fried oysters sitting in a mayonnaise that gets its tangerine color from ground chiles; the ceviche, freshly tossed with lime and herbs; the crab tostadas, loaded with a thin slice or two of Serrano chile, chopped tomato, leaves of cilantro, smooth avocado salsa and a spoonful of crab meat, pure and clean; and the shrimp cocktail, which gets its roundness and slight richness, I think, from orange soda, just the way you'd hope. Mr. Aguilar is not one of those chefs who set up masa factories in their basements. Casa Enrique's corn tortillas do not have the pretty floral aromas of Cosme's, or the sweet, focused corn flavor you taste in Claro's. But they are better than you'd find almost anywhere else in New York. They give a boost to the tacos, made with braised tongue or brisket; crumbled chorizo; or fried, battered fish, and they are especially delicious soaked in salsa verde and wrapped around roasted poblanos in cream to make enchiladas Doña Blanca. And while Cosme's more modern approach has soaked up more media attention, I've encountered more bloops and wobbles eating there than I have exploring the far more traditional menu at Casa Enrique. It isn't necessarily the more interesting restaurant, but it's the one where I'm more confident that if I went there tonight, everything would taste exactly the way it was supposed to. The pozole will be dark and intense, though not especially spicy, with tender strands of pork in the broth and all the usual mix-ins waiting on the side. The pork ribs will be slowly braised, in the style of Chiapas, in a thick cooked salsa built on a foundation of guajillo chiles. These ribs are not to be confused with the baby back ribs, cooked in an even thicker, creamier pipian rojo, that sometimes turn up as a daily special. Best of all, perhaps, will be the chamorro de borrego, or lamb shank stewed with chickpeas; it will be very tender and very flavorful in its rough sauce of pulla chiles with crushed guaje seeds. The name of that sauce is huaxmole, or sometimes guaxmole, or even mole de guaje. Yes, it's a mole, and one that rarely flies as far north as New York City. At Casa Enrique, it has found a permanent perch. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 73, "data": " The fancy mall in the Time Warner Center known as the Shops at Columbus Circle has a lot to answer for. Its opening, in 2003, may have marked Manhattan's capitulation to a retail landscape ruled by chains rather than independent, homegrown businesses. For diners, the mall is best known for its eating-and-drinking zone named, with matchless pretentiousness, the Restaurant Collection. This brought us Per Se and Masa , which overnight made the city's other high-end restaurants seem as affordable as Veselka . It was the start of a new class of restaurants where dinner would be priced like a luxury good, with entry-level meals that today cost $300 or more. Much more, in Masa's case. The purpose of this exclusivity was to signal to people with money to spend that they would be comfortable spending it in the Shops at Columbus Circle. For the same reason, businesses that were too far down-market were not welcome as tenants. This is why there's a Whole Foods Market but not a Family Dollar. So those of us who follow David Chang's mind along its switchbacks and cul-de-sacs have to wonder if he was being subversive when he decided to install Bang Bar , which is essentially a shawarma stand, on the mall's third floor. Mr. Chang is a close observer of the ways society assigns high status to the food of some cultures and devalues the cooking of others. One of his greatest hits is a riff about New Yorkers who complain about $17 bowls of ramen while paying $30 for spaghetti. If he has a routine about vertical rotisseries I've never heard it, but surely he is alive to the associations they conjure, from Greek diners to taco trucks to the Halal Guys carts parked near Columbus Circle. If anybody grasps the cultural implications of bringing $6 street-meat sandwiches indoors where they can perfume the air breathed by consumers of Pink shirts and Floga furs, it is Mr. Chang. Bang Bar might make more sense as a provocation than a business concern. It begins serving at 8:30 a.m. and closes when the food is gone, usually by 1 or 2 p.m. In the weeks after its opening, on Halloween, the lines were worthy of the Department of Motor Vehicles. Employees tried to appease the horde by handing out off-the-menu snacks, like rice porridge with fermented shiitakes, and asking whimsical survey questions. (\"Do you keep peanut butter in the fridge?\") After Mr. Chang opened a Momofuku Noodle Bar in the space next door, Bang Bar's crowds grew somewhat more manageable, and when I showed up for breakfast at the end of December, there was no line at all. Maybe Deutsche Bank employees will keep Bang Bar's early shift afloat, but right now its success seems to hinge on the lunch rush. There are two rotisseries. After 11 a.m., one spit is buried deep inside a missile of dark chicken marinated with a yakitori-style glaze. The other is at the center of a red, dripping, gochujang-rubbed tower of pork. Ideally, whichever meat you choose will have built up a dark outer bark that can be lopped off with a few knife strokes and stacked on to a disc of griddled flatbread. The bread, thicker than a tortilla and less oily than a roti, will be rolled tight, like a cigarette, then bent in half, with both open ends at the top. This is called, in Bang Bar parlance, a U. The chicken or pork can also be piled over a bowl of rice, but the bread is really very good. A close relative of the flatbread Mr. Chang's crew originated at Majordomo in Los Angeles, it is perceptibly tangy and salted, without being salty. A couple of condiments -- including habanero salsa and the brick-red Ssam Sauce used, in various iterations, to italicize Noodle Bar's pork buns and a hundred other creations in Mr. Chang's Momofuku restaurant group -- are kept out on a counter alongside the moist towelettes. But they're hard to apply once a U has been rolled. What I did want was a spoonful or two of raw white onions, some chopped cucumber, maybe parsley or cilantro -- the kind of simple salad that is almost always lobbed into a shawarma or a doner kebab. Both the chicken and pork are slightly sweet, and could use a lift. The lunch menu also has two dips -- a darkly fascinating, spicy eggplant spread, or whipped chickpeas whose sharp, pecorino-like flavor betrays the presence of Hozon, the fermented chickpea paste invented in a Momofuku laboratory. They are alluring enough, but the real reason to order them is the bread, puffier and softer than the one that wraps the U. A smaller version of this, maybe five inches across, is folded in half like a taco to make a \"mini,\" which replaces the U at breakfast. It is no great shock that this bread works nicely with smoked salmon and scallion cream cheese blended with just enough soy sauce to make it arguably Asian. It is more flavorful than a bagel and better at holding everything together. But it is somewhat surprising how delicious a freshly griddled mini is with caper-scallion cream cheese, salted cucumber, tomato and fresh dill inside. The whole thing tastes alive in a way that a bagel with a schmear of veggie cream cheese never will. I've saved the breakfast mini with mortadella for last, although it's been the subject of the most rapt online attention. Building logs of mortadella layered with lardo and roasting them on spits is exactly the sort of thing the Momofuku group was put on this earth to do. I am glad this revolving meat torpedo exists. I respect Bang Bar's cooks -- this collaborative effort has no chef, Mr. Chang said in a phone interview -- for realizing that the proper garnish for caramelized mortadella shavings is a slice of yellow American cheese and hot mustard. I appreciate the respect the sandwich pays to both fried baloney and Taylor Ham. And if I were in the habit of turning up at Columbus Circle with a hangover in the mornings, I would probably become a regular consumer of mortadella minis with Ssam Sauce. With a clear head and stomach, though, the saltiness can be a little too bracing. At either meal, Bang Bar offers a cinnamon roll modeled on the kkwabaegi, the twisted Korean doughnut stick. It is baked rather than fried, making it a rare example of a Momofuku dish that contains less fat than its inspiration. It is a fine pastry to have with Bang Bar's Vietnamese coffee, even after you learn that the cream cheese icing contains fermented chickpeas. By the way, bang, or bbang or ppang, depending on how you like your Korean words transliterated, means bread. So this shawarma joint inside a mall is officially a bread bar, which makes sense given how pleasant the bread is. Still, I can't help wondering how the people in charge of the Restaurant Collection felt about welcoming a place called Bang Bar.

{"id": 74, "data": " Dated was the word one friend used after going to Benno , and if you've eaten there, too, you'll know why. It's as if the past 15 years in food never happened. The menu seems to be stuck in some time between 1994, when Thomas Keller bought the French Laundry, and 2004, when he opened Per Se with a young Jonathan Benno leading the kitchen. The restaurant will probably be a tough sell to those diners who expect all restaurants to fall on a continuum between Noma and the Salt Bae place . But I prefer it to any number of newer, self-consciously modern restaurants, some of which are so determined to be of the moment that they might as well have a time stamp. Benno is not trying to be contemporary. It's trying to be delicious. And it is, from start to finish, almost without exception. Benno is the third of three dining operations that Mr. Benno opened last year in the Evelyn Hotel , on East 27th Street. It is the one where the prices, and presumably the stakes, are highest. We know it is a statement restaurant because Mr. Benno has put his name on it, for the first time in his career. Whatever the statement is, it is not forward-looking. Most of the statement is in French (barigoule, mousseline, tête de veau, béarnaise), a significant part is in Italian (carnaroli risotto, garganelli verde, pecorino ginepro) and not one word is in Danish or Mandarin. The statement has a lot to say on the topics of stocks and purées and accurate chopping and patient skimming; it is entirely silent on the subjects of fermented vegetables, or foraging, or immigration, or food deserts, or hashtags. The statement is delivered in a windowless hotel dining room to people sitting comfortably on black-leather chairs or velvet banquettes the color of a pinot noir from the Loire Valley. It takes the form of a fixed number of courses, three or four or five, your choice. One will be dessert and one a main course. None of them is a small plate meant for sharing. None is a large-format plate either, unless you count the veal sirloin chop that arrives on a silver platter in slices that are as pink and delicately shaded as the cheek on any blushing young aristocrat Fragonard ever painted. The presentations are not overly dramatic. They can be disarmingly modest, like the cold slice of fish terrine that appeared before the appetizers one night looking pale and somewhat lost. I barely noticed it. Then I tasted fennel and other bouillabaisse flavors and -- excuse me, what was your name again? -- I started to pay attention. It is not news that the liquid yolk of an egg tastes good trickled over baby leeks, fingerlings, black-truffle froth and pioppini mushrooms the size of shirt buttons. But just how good it is makes an interesting item. Lamb saddle, with grill marks that could come from a steakhouse, is served with fairytale eggplant and Thumbelina carrots. Each vegetable in this miniature garden is planted in a purée or a reduced essence of itself. Each is very good, and the carrots are fantastic. Alongside them sits lamb breast that has been pressed into a rich little brick coated in bread crumbs. One corner of this brick sits in a dark-green spread that tastes like gremolata. Not one combination of flavors on this plate is original, and it doesn't matter at all. The Italian food that Mr. Benno made at his last restaurant, Lincoln Ristorante , could be impressive, but I sometimes had the sense that he was cooking from the outside in, trying to unlock the flavors of Italy through process and method. The results didn't always match the evident effort. I still got a bit of that feeling from his food at Leonelli Taberna , in the back of the Evelyn lobby. It's supposed to be the hotel's casual Italian restaurant, and it would be if you didn't sometimes catch the food trying to relax. Only a lasagna with green noodles below a dark field of browned béchamel seemed completely comfortable with itself. (On the streetside end of the hotel is a pastry shop and bakery selling two-foot-long flatbreads called focaccia that have more in common with Roman pizza al taglio.) The cooking at Benno, overseen by Justin Skribner, the chef de cuisine, doesn't appear to be plagued by a similar anxiety. The French ideas, like a drum of pig's trotter under a fried quail egg with flageolets and other beans, or the darkly seared duck breast with melting foie gras and a savory triangle of duck leg, dates and pistachios in brik pastry, have an easy inevitability. Pasta is unlikely to become the thing Benno is known for. Still, when the kitchen stretches to Italy, nice things happen. Lobster fra diavolo, with the bent shells called lumache, is a tribute to an American pop hit made over, in the Thomas Keller tradition, with maximum clarity and precision. Spaghetti made with grano arso, or burned-wheat flour, tasted pleasantly toasted rather than incinerated as it soaked up the liquor of tiny hard-shell clams and a soft mass of very fresh sea urchin roe. Technique never overplayed its hand in these dishes. The only time it came up short was when a drum of steelhead salmon poached in olive oil arrived slightly mushy and underdone. A week later, the fish was cooked more successfully. The scope of the Evelyn's dining operation is big enough to support a full-time baker (Lisa Kalemkiarian, responsible for Benno's needle-tipped mini-baguettes, among other items) and pastry chef (Lindsey Bittner, whose desserts include a rosemary flan with candied cranberries that I ordered every time I went, so I could watch other people try it for the first time). You couldn't call the wine list dated, with its unwashed, uncombed natural types among other groomed, sedate numbers, and some fine values between $50 and $75 tiptoeing among the super-Tuscans and 2005 Bordeaux. All this should persuade some skeptics to give Benno a try. The restaurant's greatest challenge is that the food seems to come from an era that's too old to seem fresh but too recent to feel nostalgic about. When pop music is that age, we cringe. When buildings are that age, we knock them down before they can be landmarked. But sometimes one chef cooking what he believes is better than 10 chefs cooking what somebody else believes.

{"id": 75, "data": " Something seems to be going wrong at Bluebird London , the busily programmed 10,500-square-foot restaurant that the mall in the Time Warner Center imported from England in September. Maybe the people in charge have been taking management cues from Prime Minister Theresa May's government, which has approached its Brexit plan like a class of first graders trying to build a working jet airplane out of Lego pieces and a flying-squirrel sock puppet. Or maybe the mess back home has just sapped the restaurant's spirit. Whatever the cause, what was meant to be a cheerful gift from London has turned into the Bluebird of Unhappiness. Sir Terence Conran opened the original Bluebird in 1997 inside an Art Deco garage built on King's Road in Chelsea for the Bluebird Motor Company. It was one of his \"gastrodomes,\" those soaring complexes like Quaglino's and Bibendum that embedded restaurants within a busy hive of shops, cafes and bars. The gastrodomes' designs were talked about more often and more enthusiastically than their menus, which aimed for unthreatening familiarity. The current owners, D & D London , have managed to keep the London Bluebird in circulation by changing upholstery and chefs, but it is not at all clear why they or the Time Warner Center believed that a Bluebird clone would play in Manhattan in 2018. True, the retail shop has been dropped. But up front, next to the desk where the hosts have mastered the art of checking reservations without making eye contact, is a cafe-slash-wine bar. A glass case there serves as a temporary prison for aging pastries and tragic snacks. Beyond is a lounge followed by a bar, the centerpiece of which is an enormous plexiglass sculpture of a ponytailed woman's head that doubles as a shelf for weird liqueurs. Just before the ramp that descends to the main dining room is a console with two turntables which, a note on the website says menacingly, are operated on weekends by \"live DJs.\" At other times, the restaurant stages such events as a workshop in the art of making \"a seriously chic wreath.\" The poster-size menus drawn up by Nicolas Houlbert, the chef, cram so much copy onto a single page, and are organized so randomly, that they are best approached as if you were doing a word search, by unfocusing the eyes and waiting until the letters organize themselves into recognizable patterns. Look, here's butternut squash soup. This must be fluke -- no, fluke crudo. Long Island. Burrata. Long Island burrata? When you have finished the puzzle, please savor the warm feeling of accomplishment for a moment, because it goes away once the food arrives. The \"crispy shrimp\" have the limp, expired quality of tempura that's been doing laps all night at a conveyor-belt sushi place. Yellowfin tuna poke has been tossed onto a big, damp heap of unseasoned quinoa, which must be there to soak up any seasoning that accidentally attaches itself to the fish. At lunch there is a lobster Cobb salad with lettuce and round, red objects that are probably supposed to be tomatoes. Because you are in an English restaurant, you will be curious about the English food. Because you are in Bluebird London, you will regret this. A prawn and monkfish curry is presented on a thali with mango chutney, basmati rice and paratha, which run the gamut from unnecessarily sweet to ridiculously sweet. The fish half of fish and chips is golden and crisp on the ends but pale and soggy in the middle. At least the minted peas that come with it are crunchy. This is more than can be said for the potato chips that come with an order of beef tartare. They are pale, cobweb-colored, not fresh, and undercooked so they sag and fall apart beneath any amount of beef. The tartare, by the way, is seasoned with ketchup, which is not as wrong as you might think. If something comes with a pastry crust, exercise caution. On top of an allegedly Cornish chicken pie, sealing in dry chicken and mushrooms coated in grease that is trying its best to be mistaken for sauce, is a dome of puff pastry; it doesn't taste like butter or salt, but it is cooked. The thicker crust around a farmhouse pork terrine, served with a chill that brought out its Spammy qualities, is on its way to being cooked. The very, very thick football of crust encasing beef Wellington is cooked only on the surface; deep inside, where it meets the tenderloin, is a mass of wet, gluey dough. This costs $95 and will serve two people, both of whom had better like the taste of raw flour. All is not doom and gloom in the pastry department, though. The pull-apart cheese straws are thick, puffy and warm, bronzed on top with baked Montgomery's Cheddar. Most of the sweets are likable, particularly the cube of sticky toffee pudding and the wedge of Bakewell tart with a layer of orange marmalade between the frangipane and the pastry shell. The only real hazard on the dessert menu is the barely congealed Pimm's jelly at which somebody has hurled fistfuls of chopped cucumbers and strawberries. It's like a stray plate of salad that you might pick up at a party before you realized that somebody had dumped the warm dregs of a drink into it. The servers seemed eager to oblige, but gave the impression of struggling in the face of unseen enemies. One night, asked \"Still or sparkling?,\" I chose the sparkling water. My server began to walk away, then turned on his heel and said, \"I'm sorry, we're all out of sparkling.\" \"That's fine,\" I said. \"I'll just have the BrewDog I.P.A. instead.\" \"I apologize,\" he said. \"We don't have any draft beer.\" After the main course was cleared, I asked him for the Chocolate Bluebird. \"That is our signature dessert,\" he said. I nodded. I had read that this was a chocolate mousse inside a blue-chocolate shell in the shape of a vintage racecar once made by the Bluebird Motor Company. \"Unfortunately, we do not have it tonight,\" he said. His courtesy went a long way. Ultimately, though, I preferred the blunt approach that one of the bartenders took with one of my guests. Looking over the long list of old and new cocktails, she asked the bartender which he would recommend. \"If you want to drink something that tastes good,\" he said, \"I wouldn't order anything off our menu.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 76, "data": " Americans who weren't born into Korean cuisine have discovered it in many ways and many locales over the past decade or two. Bulgogi folded into tortillas has been handed out through the window of a roving truck . Smoked kimchi has been draped over pulled pork between halves of a cheese-glazed doughnut to make an outdoor food-stall sandwich called the Chonut . Hwe, raw fish eaten with condiments that typically spread across an entire table, has been streamlined to one or two bites in a tasting menu administered by servers in sci-fi tunics. The pork belly dish bo ssam has been reimagined as a whole roasted pork shoulder that a gang of hungry people could use in a bonding ritual involving heads of lettuce, a platter of oysters and a pair of tongs. More often than not, the audience for these items is young. Youth, in fact, has been a key part of the story of how kimchi and other dishes spread from immigrants' kitchens to the Instagram feeds of diners without a single Korean ancestor. You might get a Chonut at Smorgasburg with your roommate, take down a bo ssam at Momofuku Ssam Bar with your friends from college and sit at Atomix's U-shaped counter to celebrate your first anniversary. Hwaban , which opened in Chelsea in August, is something different. It's the modern Korean restaurant where you'd take your mother. The dining room is spare, sleek and uncontroversial. The brick walls have a recent coat of white paint, and there is plenty of light by which to read the menus. The banquettes and benches have gentle curves and soothing neutral colors. The only vaguely menacing items in sight are the canteloupe-size eyeballs hanging on the walls, but they turn out to be high-tech speakers, and the cocktail jazz they play never rises above a murmur. Just inside the front door is a lattice of shelves holding simple, geometric bowls and teaware. These give Hwaban the look of a cloistered Parisian salon de thé, which it resembles in other ways as well. Exceptional green tea from South Korea is brewed along with tisanes -- made from mulberry leaves, mistletoe stems or dried wild pears -- that Korean mothers brew in winter for sneezing and sniffling children. And while some restaurants are saving money by doing without pastry chefs, Hwaban needs two of them to keep up with its obsession with Western-style sweets. One, Ahram Song, is a buttercream specialist who tints and shapes frosting into botanically detailed flower arrangements decorating chocolate or honey-pecan cakes. Another, Lauren Kim, makes the fleecy cheesecake that is carved into slivers the length of a dinner plate; pretty, well-tailored French numbers like a passion-fruit Pavlova or a drum of white cake filled with fresh strawberries and frosted with whipped cream; and the cookies and toffees that are sold by the box, for takeout. The illusion that you've wandered into a tearoom somewhere on the Right Bank is extended by the drinks list, which has only two Korean sojus and a handful of Japanese sakes but several pages of wines from France. The rest of the menu is unmistakably Korean, and very often it is based on Korean family cooking. \"This is my mother's recipe,\" Mihyun Han, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Key Kim, will say on one of her frequent circuits around the tables. She said it one night about the shaggy white meatball of chicken, tofu and mushrooms -- the menu calls it a dumpling -- sitting in a warm and transfixing soy-milk broth. Another time, she was talking about what she calls \"snowy bibimbap,\" a gentle, agreeable wintertime variation on the classic rice dish made with strands of mung bean jelly and shaved burdock, bellflower root, and other vegetables in shades of ivory, cream and bone. The chef, Woong Jang, does very fine work in white. One of Hwaban's most luxurious dishes is a length of king crab leg with spinach and a poached egg, all surrounded in a rich pine-nut sauce the color of hotel sheets. Like the Manhattan restaurants Atomix and Jungsik , Hwaban de-emphasizes the sweeter and spicier side of the Korean palate so other flavors can come through. Coins of poached pollock roe are sliced over a block of soft tofu in a clear, subtle dried-seafood broth. Soy-braised abalone is served in an anchovy broth that is, if not exactly subtle, at least soft-spoken. One of two pork belly dishes on the menu involves ssamjang, the potent soy-chile paste now sold in supermarkets throughout the land, but the other does not. In that one, you eat a slice of simmered pork belly together with a pickled mushroom and a square of cabbage kimchi. There is, of course, a sharp little kick to the spicy fish stew known as maeun-tang, and a fair amount of chile paste in the daktori-tang , a spin on the classic braised chicken and vegetable dish, both of which Mr. Jang makes very well. But there is also the surprise of tasting ginger and carrots along with the chiles in a bright orange sauce for seared salmon. Ms. Han and Mr. Kim also own Kosaka , a chiaroscuro lair for omakase sushi on West 13th Street. I was a little put off by how active the servers were there; just as I was focusing on the piece of fish in front of me, somebody would dart in at one elbow or the other to ask how I was enjoying it all. The service style is similar at Hwaban, but it plays better there. A meal at Hwaban is also about three times less expensive, at $55 for an appetizer and two main courses. The mains are served at the same time, which Ms. Han says is her attempt to reproduce the abundance of Korean family tables like her mother's. Her mother also gets credit for the two-sided fritters of minced shrimp pressed against zucchini coins on the short à la carte menu. They're served with a crisp pair of fried shrimp and little cubes of jelly that melt into dipping sauce on contact with the warm fritters. The same soy jelly accompanies a kimchi-jeon that's topped with browned mozzarella -- in other words, a kimchi pizza. It would fit right in at Smorgasburg.

{"id": 77, "data": " Alex Raij and Eder Montero met while working in the kitchen of a sprawling, impersonal, gloomy modern-Spanish restaurant that lasted about two years. They went on to get married and, as joint chefs and owners, opened a string of compact, intimate, slinky modern-Spanish restaurants that are still in business. Their one misfire was a small, intimate non-Spanish coffee shop in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. After dusting themselves off, they replaced the cafe tables with taller and longer ones, traded the pastry cases for a bar, installed a stripe of backlighted glass blocks that cast a subaqueous glow on the room, and in September reopened as Saint Julivert Fisherie . And what is a fisherie, you ask, having quickly consulted your French, Spanish and English dictionaries and found no such word? Saint Julivert is my first, but if it is anything to go by, then a fisherie is a seafood establishment that aspires to be more than a raw bar but does not want to be mistaken for a full-bore restaurant. Wines come mostly from coastal regions (and are organized by the nearest body of salt water). Small plates abound. And if you guessed that they are something like the tapas that Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero explore at El Quinto Pino , Txikito and La Vara , but without the running Spanish theme, you are not far off. Not that the menu is entirely un-Spanish. The octopus carpaccio from Txikito makes a special guest appearance at Saint Julivert Fisherie, the way the Fresh Prince once turned up on an episode of \"Blossom.\" Under marjoram leaves and pinprick grains of Espelette pepper, the carpaccio is as good as you remember; the warm plate halfway melts the fattier bits of octopus into delicious goo. There is another cameo: El Quinto Pino's very fine combination of pink-fleshed anchovies with cold vanilla butter. The butter soothes the anchovies the way the vermouth in a martini helps the gin settle down. (On a related topic, the short cocktail list includes a deceptively soft-spoken number called the Kanpai Martini. It's a variation on the Vesper, which itself is the amended martini that Ian Fleming had James Bond order in \"Casino Royale.\") At times Saint Julivert reminds me of Cal Pep , in Barcelona, Spain, whose plain, cramped counter looks like the last place in the world where you are going to have an epiphany of the taste buds, right up until the moment the txipirones and thumbtack-size clams knock you off your barstool. Like Cal Pep, and unlike nearly every other New York restaurant, Saint Julivert serves gooseneck barnacles when they're available, boiling them with bay leaves and salt and mounding them on a cloth napkin before they cool so that when you twist the wrinkled sheath of skin away from the sweet, edible meat inside there is a good chance somebody in the vicinity will get hit with a squirt of hot barnacle juice. Mostly, though, any Spanish-ness in Saint Julivert has more to do with its spirit than its recipes, which come from all over: the deep-fried Puerto Rican cylinders of cornmeal known as sorrullitos; a kanpachi collar whose juicy meat is shockingly white under a black rub of jerk spices; tender slices of warm beef tenderloin on a fist-size roll, known in Portugal as a prego sandwich. There is also the crispy tuna bake, a peculiarly satisfying hybrid that crosses a tuna noodle casserole by way of India with fideuà, the Spanish dish that treats pasta like the rice in paella. The noodles, short ridged tubes, are toasted and cooked with oil-cured tuna in a tomato sauce that is seasoned with turmeric and curry leaves. It is one of the most fearless, not to mention filling, dishes on a menu that could use a little more of both qualities. Although Saint Julivert works with exceptional seafood, and treats it with the care that fans of Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero have come to expect, the menu plays it safe more often than it should. Like all of the couple's restaurants, Saint Julivert toggles between innovation and tradition. But the other places explore Spanish cuisine, so when they toss off a straight-ahead classic like patatas bravas, there's a reason. When Saint Julivert serves fluke ceviche or a crab and avocado salad dressed with yuzu juice and trout roe, it can seem to be grasping at ideas that other restaurants are already doing -- even when Saint Julivert does them better. The sautéed skate splashed with Manzanilla could not be fresher or more skillfully browned, but do the garlic chips and sliced dried chiles on top make this version of a well-known standard one I'll remember a month from now? Maybe not, although at the time I was very happy to have it, not least because it was one of the few things on the menu the size of a standard main course. Even if you're an old hand at navigating the shallow waters of small plates, it can be unnervingly easy to spend more than $100 on food and drinks at Saint Julivert and still wonder whether you've actually had dinner. Seafood this good is expensive, but the menu doesn't stray very far above $20; the result is that portions can seem somewhat airy. When there's an inexpensive opportunity to pad out a dish, Saint Julivert doesn't always take it. I understand why I can't have more than three excellent wild shrimp in a $21 bowl of red pozole, but couldn't there be more than a spoonful of hominy kernels? Saltines fried in canola oil are served with the ceviche and with a cold and highly appealing bowl of pickled shrimp under pink pickled onions; grilled bread slices accompany the mackerel whipped into a hummus-like orange spread with piri-piri oil. Still, each time I went, somebody at my table asked for more bread. None of Saint Julivert's issues are insoluble. The lighting could be warmed up so the room looks less like an aquarium. A few more dishes you won't see anywhere else, like the tuna bake, would make it harder to resist. Another two or three large plates would make it a place you think of when you're hungry. The excellent $19 prego sandwich is more snack than dinner, until you pay another $7 to have fried oysters tucked into the roll beside the beef, making it into a kind of crunchy carpetbagger. On the other hand, that's worth doing even if you're not hungry. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 78, "data": " There is a good case to be made for not reviewing the newly relocated Four Seasons Restaurant at all but just leaving it on the slush pile, and that case can be found in court records involving Julian Niccolini. Mr. Niccolini has operated the restaurant with Alex von Bidder since the mid-1990s, first at its original home in the Seagram Building and now, after a two-year hiatus, in a smaller berth on the other side of Park Avenue. Over that time, he has frequently been celebrated for his charm. Less frequently, he has been a defendant in civil and criminal actions arising from things he was accused of having done to women inside the restaurant. In 1991, one of his waitresses sued Mr. Niccolini and the Four Seasons , citing sexual harassment. She claimed that for more than three years he had repeatedly rubbed up against her, told her in vulgar terms about his sexual urges and called her \"slut,\" \"lesbian\" and other things. Mr. Niccolini denied the charges. In 2014, a former assistant manager filed suit against Mr. Niccolini , Mr. von Bidder and the Four Seasons, alleging discrimination. The ex-manager said that after she returned from a maternity leave, the restaurant made it difficult for her to pump breast milk during work hours and, about three months later, fired her and replaced her with a man. In a response filed with the court, the defendants denied the allegations. Both suits were settled under terms that have not been divulged. In 2015, Mr. Niccolini was arrested on a felony charge of sexual abuse. According to a prosecutor, he had attacked a woman at the Four Seasons bar \"with such force that he ripped her bra open and caused significant scratch marks on her back and bruising on her hip.\" After pleading guilty the following year to a reduced charge of misdemeanor assault, Mr. Niccolini was given a \"conditional discharge,\" avoiding jail. I know people who will never eat at the Four Seasons because they don't want to give Mr. Niccolini their money. I understand this. I also know people in the food media who think the Four Seasons should not get any coverage as long as Mr. Niccolini owns a piece of it. I understand this, too, but it's not my view. [Julian Niccolini has since been forced to resign from the restaurant.] Their stance rests, I think, on the idea that writing about powerful men who have been accused of abusing women amounts to condoning the abuse and helping the abusers stay in power. While it's true that media attention is often like oxygen to restaurants, critics have the power to tell a story other than the one the restaurant is pushing. Even when we're not writing a pan, a fair assessment often requires weaving shining threads with ugly ones. The ugliest threads at the Four Seasons happen to be ugly enough to make many people stay away. But there is beauty in the fabric, too. The Four Seasons has been a significant force in dining: a pioneer in championing American ingredients and wine; an innovator in bringing contemporary design into the restaurant world; a cultivator of an eclectic scene that treated political power, financial success and creative talent as coequal branches of a high society that was peculiar to New York. Most of this happened some time ago. In its last years in the Seagram Building, the Four Seasons had become a shabby but lovely museum of midcentury architecture and design, with martinis that I didn't mind overpaying for and food that I did. I was curious about its new incarnation, which opened in August, and curiosity is as good a reason as any for a critic to swing into action. If I were writing the next chapter in a long history, I'd mention how gracefully Diego Garcia has grown into his new job as the restaurant's chef. I enjoyed Mr. Garcia's fish cookery at his last restaurant, a small, bare-bones place in Hell's Kitchen called Gloria , but he seemed limited by the kitchen's size. He works on a grander scale now, with more expensive ingredients and more delicate treatments that still betray his creative streak. He roasts duck because the Four Seasons is famous for it, and makes fresh pasta and risotto because the captains in their black jackets need some place to shave all those white truffles. For all intents and purposes, though, he has turned the Four Seasons into a seafood restaurant, and a very good one. It's not hard to believe he was once a sous-chef at Le Bernardin when you taste, say, the raw scallop slivers in citrus juices, elegantly equipped with tart apple and caviar, or the intensely smooth chowder of tiny, just-cooked clams in a New England-style cream broth that's pale yellow with butterfat. He knows when to show restraint and when to go all in, taking sea-urchin ravioli that are already head-spinningly rich and draping lobes of sea urchin over them. Some of the cooking is boring in the right way. I don't want surprises in Dover sole à la meunière, and I didn't get any. It was flawless. The duck will surprise only people who don't know that duck meat cooked to well-done bastes in its own fat until it is almost a warm confit. Other dishes were boring in the usual sense. The mustard sauce poured around the golden crab cake tasted like cream that was shown a picture of a mustard jar. The chapter would also depict the return of Bill Yosses. Anybody who ate his desserts before he disappeared into the White House won't be surprised by how good they are here. They do have a slight Rip Van Winkle quality, suggesting that Mr. Yosses allowed several new waves in pastry to pass him by, but that's no criticism. He makes a better baba au rhum than almost anyone in town, his chocolate tart with a salted stripe of caramel is both powerful and precise, and his hazelnut financier balanced over roasted pears is more delicious than almost any almond financier you can find. He has even improved the restaurant's signature, the Kate Pierson beehive of cotton candy that sails out to the tables of valued guests. (Apparently I've joined that club.) This being the Four Seasons, the history would have to mention the new restaurant's interior. It reminded me of the old Philip Johnson dining rooms without making me sad to be here instead of there, a trick I had thought was impossible. The bronze bead curtains have transformed into strings of gilded glass baubles; the flatware and glasses pay homage to the vintage designs used at the original restaurant; and the bar is once again a four-sided island in the middle of a lounge. For the first time you can eat a real meal there, while you watch the Grand Central-bound commuters outside and the cotton candy-bound regulars inside, generally a mature group in tightly knotted ties or heels that echo down the corridor to the dining room like the ticking of a grandfather clock. All of this and a generous budget (the prices are as exclusionary as ever) could make for a few hours of celebratory sightseeing of a kind that is quickly disappearing from the city. The Four Seasons offers an escape from the outside world. Escaping from what's inside, however, takes a mental effort that is beyond me and will probably be beyond many others as well, whether Mr. Niccolini is in sight or not. During my three meals, I never saw him. Restaurants, even grand ones like the Four Seasons, are intimate places; eating is an act that requires trust and a sense of safety. We want to get up from the table feeling restored on all fronts except the financial one. Mr. Niccolini's actions have done serious damage to his power to provide that feeling, even as he and Mr. von Bidder have made the restaurant better than it has been in years.

{"id": 79, "data": " Almost everybody is calling Misi , the latest endeavor from the chef Missy Robbins, a pasta restaurant. That's not quite right. Yes, Ms. Robbins has given half of her menu over to long noodles and short ones; strands of linguine with chopped garlic and a double dose of fish in the form of chopped anchovies and drizzled colatura; circles filled with ricotta whipped until it is as soft as cream; pinched rings of tortelli stuffed with mascarpone and spinach; the deeply ridged Sardinian shells known as malloreddus; and other Italian marvels of starch formation. True, anybody who has been to Ms. Robbins's other restaurant, Lilia , also located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, knows that the pasta there reliably steals the show from everything else on the table. When those people show up at Misi, odds are good that they will not have chosen that day to start a keto diet. Moreover, Misi has a greater variety of pasta than Lilia, so many that the architecture makes space for them. Misi is across the street from the old Domino refinery on the East River, where the cranes used to unload sugar from barges in the open air so that on days when the wind was right you could taste it on your tongue a mile away. Next to the dining room, facing the factory's remains, is a separate, glassed-in workshop where the temperature and humidity are kept at consistent dough-friendly levels. There, the long noodles, etc., are rolled out and cut long before 5:30 each night, when Misi's front door is unlocked and the crowd waiting in line for walk-in seats begins to snake eagerly forward. And to be sure, if you watch Ms. Robbins and her kitchen crew at the end of one of two long dining counters, you'll see the same quick motion over and over: an almost surreptitiously quick trip of hand to mouth, a sharp bite and an appraising chew to decide if that batch of pasta is ready to be pulled from the water. Some chefs show their mastery over pasta by pressing it thinner than a screen protector for an iPhone. Ms. Robbins likes hers to have body and heft, and the chew test is the most reliable way to tell when thick pasta like that is ready. You are very unlikely to get a piece that is undercooked at its core, or one that doesn't fight back enough to let you know it is still alive. You get this just-in-between texture in the stubs of mezze rigatoni with a simple, glossy, ripe tomato sauce that's been stewed with whole garlic cloves -- 30 to a batch, according to the menu. You get it again in the corzetti, discs about the diameter of a Red Bull can that are pressed with a wooden stamp to give them a target pattern. In October, Misi served these ridged coins with another tomato sauce, this one barely cooked, just some Sungold tomatoes warmed until they broke open and their yellow pulp spilled out. Fresh basil, thyme and chervil were scattered over the top, as good an illustration as any of how Ms. Robbins makes her food stand out without deviating from an Italian reliance on simple, unmanipulated ingredients. But to call Misi a pasta restaurant would be to overlook its highly impressive work with vegetables. They are the subject of the menu's other half, sneakily headlined \"antipasti.\" This is where you will find a globe eggplant roasted until it is as soft and easy to spread as cream cheese; the cut surfaces are dressed with Calabrian chiles, and the taste of lemon juice seems to have found its way to the center of the eggplant. There are fleshy and firm chanterelles, too, lightly pickled and preserved in olive oil until they're brought to the table crisscrossed with rosemary needles. Grilled runner beans with garlic and chiles have been around lately, too, in a big heap that I would have enjoyed more if a few stringy, leathery beans had not gotten past the inspectors in the kitchen. Like the pastas, Misi's vegetables tend to bring together only a few ingredients, often applied in ways you don't quite expect. I don't know where else you will taste pistachios and anchovies combined with skinny, leaf-bud-green leeks marinated in vinegar, or a kind of panzanella made with grilled bread, capers, fresh oregano and chunks of zucchini that are still tender after a quick poaching in olive oil. And though the gently roasted tomatoes won't come back to the menu until next summer, you can try imagining how their dusting of fennel seeds and cracked coriander seeds responds to a last-minute squirt of spicy honey. There are enough of these vegetables, and enough meatless pastas, that a vegetarian could eat extremely well at Misi just by watching out for things like bottarga and staying away entirely from the creamy pork sugo tossed with strangozzi. (Meat eaters, on the other hand, may find the sugo helps restore chafed nerves.) Although Misi doesn't let its kitchen range as widely as Lilia's, it is a more successful restaurant in several ways. The menu has been distilled down to essentials, and the whole enterprise seems more carefully thought through. The restaurant is on the ground floor of a new apartment building by SHoP Architects , who chose to leave a hole in the middle that you could fly a helicopter through. The developer, Two Trees , recruited Ms. Robbins and her business partner, Sean Feeney, and gave them a chance to build the virgin space to their needs. The acoustics are better than at Lilia, and traffic between tables flows more smoothly. The interior is unusually good, with narrow horizontal wall tiles in white and nooks for stacked plates that make them part of the décor. As at Lilia, the wine list practically begs you to take something new for a whirl: a catarratto from Sicily, a Corsican niellucciu, or a croatina-ughetta blend from Lombardy softened with some uva rara. Of course, you could stick to a $45 Lambrusco, or get a $250 Champagne from David Léclapart, after which you can try flying through the hole in the building yourself. If we are striving for total accuracy, though, we need to call Misi a pasta-vegetables-and-gelato restaurant. Its gelato is made in house; there are about six kinds at any given moment. The flavors open up right away, in part because Misi serves them just below the melting point and in part because the ingredients are used prodigally. There are a lot of almonds in the almond, and the espresso could keep you up an extra hour. But even the unflavored fior di latte, made with milk, cream and sugar, comes at you in a rush. There are no desserts other than gelato. The only decision to make at the end of the night is which one you're going to have.

{"id": 80, "data": " Something has been missing from New York's current Indian restaurant scene, but I wasn't sure what it was until I ate the kaleji masala at Adda Indian Canteen in Long Island City, Queens. Modernization is the theme unifying many of the Indian restaurants that have taken root around the city over the past few years. At the rarefied end of the spectrum, we have Indian Accent bringing the cuisine into line with the intricate techniques and plating that can land restaurants on the itineraries of list-clutching gastrotourists. At the populist end, we've seen Indian cooking gastro-pubbed by Babu Ji and other new places that try to make non-desis feel at home with house-party vibes, beer in a self-service fridge, and dishes like naan pizzas and samosa burgers. New York hasn't seen nearly as many recently opened restaurants devoted to the pure, original stuff that is getting modernized. The snacks pitched together in a blur by hawkers at folding tables and rolling carts by the side of the road; the gravy-soaked stews and sauceless dry curries patiently made from 25 or so vegetables and seasonings, all of them chopped, ground, fried and simmered at home by those keepers of the culinary flame known collectively as the aunties -- we've seen interpretations of this food, squeezed from eyedroppers and prepared for their photo shoots with edible flowers. But new places cooking the genuine article have been scarce. There is a problem of missing context here; twists on tradition don't really resonate when tradition is hard to find in its untwisted form. And for anyone who truly loves Indian cooking, there is a more pressing problem of missing flavor. Five dots of tandoori-spice oil just won't land on the taste buds with the impact of a full plate of charred and steaming tandoori chicken, no matter how evenly spaced those dots are. I hadn't given much thought to either problem, to tell the truth, until I made it to the out-of-the-way patch of Long Island City where Adda Indian Canteen operates. This is not the part of that neighborhood where high-rise apartments grow overnight and Amazon will soon tiptoe in with 25,000 employees. Adda is east of all that, under a National Guard recruiting office, surrounded by a thicket of railroad tracks and highway overpasses. Unless you are looking for it, you are not likely to end up in the small dining room, in which Indian tabloids have been upcycled as wallpaper. Once I'd found it, one of the first things I ate was the kaleji masala, chicken livers in a dark gravy seasoned with fresh ginger and garam masala. Right away I realized that this was the kind of Indian food the city has been hungry for, or at least the kind that I'd been hungry for: made with care but no pretense; seasoned for people who love the interplay of spices; presented without apology in all its brown, lumpy glory; and complex in ways that demand full attention. Adda (ah DAH) Indian Canteen was opened in September by Roni Mazumdar, who owns it, and Chintan Pandya, who is the chef. The two men already run Rahi , in Greenwich Village, perhaps the best of the casual, modernizing Indian restaurants, where Mr. Pandya serves original notions like tandoori skate and sends almost everything out of the kitchen decorated with edible flowers. They've taken another angle at Adda, mining family recipes and the lessons Mr. Pandya absorbed from civilian cooks around India. The menu travels beyond the standard north Indian dishes most New Yorkers already know, but even those dishes, when they appear, are prepared so emphatically that they don't resemble anything else in town. Adda is a lusty, full-throated defense of traditional cooking. Saag paneer, the grayest of old gray mares in many Indian restaurants, is coltishly energetic at Adda. The cheese is made in the kitchen, and it's gorgeously soft, while the saag is a tart and peppery mix of wilted arugula, sorrel, spinach and mustard greens. Mr. Pandya does very well by the class of sidewalk treats called chaat. Each delivers the messy riot you'd hope for, busy with crunchy hieroglyphs of fried noodles and splattered with yogurt and tamarind sauce. One chaat is anchored by a big kale fritter, another by several smaller chips of battered, spiced lentil cakes, and a third by fried smashed potatoes and chickpeas. But discerning chaat lovers should probably go directly to the dahi batata puri, soft potato packed into hollow globes of fried dough that you can pick up and eat with your fingers, like chocolates. Anything that passes through Adda's tandoor is worth investigating. Seekh kebabs, made with lamb that's coarsely ground by hand, come out of the tandoor juicier and pinker than the usual; Mumbai-style tandoori macchi, a skewered pompano rubbed with ground mustard seeds and cilantro, is lightly charred and smoky after roasting, but still moist; bhatti da murgh, a double-marinated chicken thigh and drumstick, is so thickly crusted with coriander and cumin that it crunches when you bite it. My server expressed an enthusiasm about the poussin -- plunged into the tandoor in one piece after marinating in vinegar, yogurt, fresh red chiles and kala namak, the sulfurous black salt of India -- that you typically find in new converts to a cult. After tasting it, I was ready to join. He was enthusiastic about almost everything, as it turned out; the service at Adda is nothing if not eager to talk up the food. (Getting your water glass refilled is another story.) Placing a dish of yogurt and pomegranate seeds next to the goat biryani that is steamed under a lid of dough, he said, \"This is going to be your best friend when the spice in the biryani starts to hit you.\" It was, in fact, one of the fiercest biryanis I've ever met, and the yogurt tamed it so that I could taste the tender goat meat and crisp, bittersweet fried onions. Few things on the menu are quite as chile-drenched as the biryani, but Mr. Pandya definitely favors India's more intense flavors. Adda is not big on soft-spoken cream sauces; the coconut milk in the Malvani prawn curry from the South Konkan coast, for instance, has a pronounced kick. (It's very good if you get it on a night when the prawns are firm and not spongy.) And while Adda does serve some vegetables, it would not make my list of the 20 best local Indian restaurants for vegetarians. It would, however, be the place I'd send you if you want to know how good Delhi butter chicken can be. Or if you don't yet believe that rara gosht, chunks of lamb stewed on the bone with spiced minced lamb, is not redundant but luxurious. And Adda is the first restaurant I'd tell you about if you woke up one morning hungry for bheja fry, goat brains cooked with onions, ginger and a considerable number of fresh green chiles. \"Like soft scrambled eggs,\" our server said, accurately. I might point out that a typical Indian bheja fry is drier, with a higher ratio of brains to sauce. But I would not necessarily mean that as a complaint.

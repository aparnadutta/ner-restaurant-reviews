Nothing _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
appearance _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Cornish _ _ B-CUISINE
game _ _ O
hen _ _ O
at _ _ O
Blue _ _ B-EST
Smoke _ _ I-EST
screams, _ _ O
"I _ _ O
am _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
thing _ _ O
you _ _ O
will _ _ O
eat _ _ O
today!" _ _ O
It _ _ O
looks _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
deflated _ _ O
football _ _ O
that _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
punctured _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
pair _ _ O
of _ _ O
sticks _ _ O
and _ _ O
dragged _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
mud. _ _ O
In _ _ O
fact, _ _ O
in _ _ O
Blue _ _ B-EST
Smoke's _ _ I-EST
attempt _ _ O
to _ _ O
bring _ _ O
together _ _ O
the _ _ O
barbecued _ _ B-DISH
game _ _ I-DISH
hen _ _ I-DISH
of _ _ O
Cozy _ _ B-EST
Corner _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
in _ _ O
Memphis, _ _ B-LOC
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
fried _ _ B-DISH
hot _ _ I-DISH
chicken _ _ I-DISH
of _ _ O
places _ _ O
like _ _ O
Prince's, _ _ B-EST
in _ _ O
Nashville, _ _ B-LOC
the _ _ O
bird _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
through _ _ O
a _ _ O
good _ _ O
deal _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
that. _ _ O
The _ _ O
process _ _ O
goes _ _ O
like _ _ O
this, _ _ O
approximately _ _ O
: _ _ O
spatchcocked, _ _ O
brined, _ _ O
rubbed _ _ O
with _ _ O
spices, _ _ B-FOOD
smoked, _ _ O
chilled, _ _ O
dunked _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
frothy _ _ O
batter, _ _ B-FOOD
tossed _ _ O
in _ _ O
seasoned _ _ B-FOOD
flour, _ _ I-FOOD
deep _ _ O
fried, _ _ O
dipped _ _ O
in _ _ O
spicy _ _ B-FOOD
oil _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
sprinkled _ _ O
with _ _ O
four _ _ O
kinds _ _ O
of _ _ O
ground _ _ O
pepper. _ _ B-FOOD
"Just _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
pop-pop _ _ O
dust _ _ O
right _ _ O
on _ _ O
top" _ _ O
is _ _ O
how _ _ O
Jean-Paul _ _ O
Bourgeois, _ _ O
Blue _ _ B-EST
Smoke's _ _ I-EST
chef, _ _ O
describes _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
step. _ _ O
"That _ _ O
introduction _ _ O
of _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
chile _ _ B-FOOD
onto _ _ O
that _ _ O
fried _ _ B-FOOD
chicken, _ _ I-FOOD
it _ _ O
just _ _ O
brings _ _ O
the _ _ O
zing." _ _ O
Then _ _ O
came _ _ O
one _ _ O
final _ _ O
touch, _ _ O
he _ _ O
said: _ _ O
"a _ _ O
little _ _ O
swirlybird _ _ O
of _ _ O
Tabasco _ _ B-FOOD
hot _ _ I-FOOD
honey." _ _ I-FOOD
Handily, _ _ O
this _ _ O
can _ _ O
all _ _ O
be _ _ O
shortened _ _ O
to _ _ O
smoked, _ _ B-DISH
fried _ _ I-DISH
hen _ _ I-DISH
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
order _ _ O

But _ _ O
you'll _ _ O
know _ _ O
there's _ _ O
more _ _ O
to _ _ O
it _ _ O
when _ _ O
your _ _ O
jaw _ _ O
smashes _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
dark _ _ O
crust _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
sonic _ _ O
boom; _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
particular _ _ O
forms _ _ O
of _ _ O
heat _ _ O
contributed _ _ O
by _ _ O
habanero, _ _ B-FOOD
black _ _ B-FOOD

Sichuan _ _ B-FOOD
peppercorn, _ _ I-FOOD
Aleppo _ _ B-FOOD
pepper, _ _ I-FOOD
cayenne _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
Tabasco _ _ B-FOOD

all _ _ O
start _ _ O
to _ _ O
pile _ _ O
up _ _ O
and _ _ O
reverberate _ _ O
like _ _ O
My _ _ O
Bloody _ _ O
Valentine _ _ O
guitar _ _ O
chords _ _ O
; _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
meat _ _ B-FOOD
gives _ _ O
up _ _ O
juices _ _ O
that _ _ O
swirl _ _ O
with _ _ O

Lately _ _ O
I _ _ O
have _ _ O
fallen _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
spell _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
East _ _ B-LOC
Village _ _ I-LOC
restaurant _ _ O
called _ _ O
Foxface _ _ B-EST
. _ _ O
The _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
pin _ _ O
down, _ _ O
geographically. _ _ O
Stopping _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
weeks _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
I _ _ O
ate _ _ O
Low _ _ B-DISH
Countryish _ _ I-DISH
wild _ _ I-DISH
red _ _ I-DISH
shrimp _ _ I-DISH
on _ _ I-DISH
grits, _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ O
sweet _ _ B-FOOD
corn _ _ I-FOOD
off _ _ I-FOOD
the _ _ I-FOOD
cob _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
potent _ _ O
saffron-lobster _ _ B-FOOD
sauce. _ _ I-FOOD
More _ _ O
recently, _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
skinless _ _ B-DISH
pork _ _ I-DISH
sausage _ _ I-DISH
inspired _ _ O
by _ _ O
sai _ _ B-DISH
ua, _ _ I-DISH
the _ _ O
spicy _ _ O
and _ _ O
tangy _ _ O
specialty _ _ O
identified _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
northern _ _ O
Thai _ _ O
city _ _ O
of _ _ O
Chiang _ _ B-LOC
Mai. _ _ I-LOC
The _ _ O
soft _ _ B-DISH
tripe _ _ I-DISH
I _ _ O
enjoyed _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
weekend _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
simmered _ _ O
with _ _ O
'nduja, _ _ O
the _ _ O
fiery _ _ O
and _ _ O
malleable _ _ O
Calabrian _ _ O
sausage, _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
covered _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
thin _ _ O
shingles _ _ O
of _ _ O
shaved _ _ O
pecorino. _ _ O
If _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
started _ _ O
hanging _ _ O
around _ _ O
at _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
sooner, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
during _ _ O
the _ _ O
cold _ _ O
months _ _ O
after _ _ O
its _ _ O
opening, _ _ O
in _ _ O
February, _ _ O
I _ _ O
might _ _ O
have _ _ O
run _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
wider _ _ O
variety _ _ O
of _ _ O
cuisines _ _ O
and _ _ O
main _ _ O
ingredients. _ _ O
I _ _ O
did _ _ O
manage _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
elk _ _ O
osso _ _ O
buco _ _ O
while _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
still _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
I _ _ O
never _ _ O
got _ _ O
to _ _ O
try _ _ O
the _ _ O
wild _ _ O
hare, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
stewed _ _ O
in _ _ O
red _ _ O
wine _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
of _ _ O
chocolate _ _ O
and _ _ O
thickened _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O
own _ _ O
blood, _ _ O
a _ _ O
formula _ _ O
that _ _ O
students _ _ O
of _ _ O
very _ _ O
old-guard _ _ O
French _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
will _ _ O
recognize _ _ O
as _ _ O
lièvre _ _ O
à _ _ O
la _ _ O
royale. _ _ O
Nor _ _ O
did _ _ O
I _ _ O
make _ _ O
it _ _ O
in _ _ O
time _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
venison, _ _ O
left _ _ O
to _ _ O
bubble _ _ O
for _ _ O
hours _ _ O
in _ _ O
white _ _ O
wine _ _ O
with _ _ O
mushrooms _ _ O
and _ _ O
dark _ _ O
juniper _ _ O
berries. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
dish _ _ O
I _ _ O
may _ _ O
never _ _ O
forgive _ _ O
myself _ _ O
for _ _ O
missing, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
kebabs _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
preserved _ _ O
lemons _ _ O
and _ _ O
tahini, _ _ O
because _ _ O
the _ _ O
kebabs _ _ O
were _ _ O
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
ground _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
and _ _ O
camel. _ _ O
Although _ _ O
these _ _ O
foods _ _ O
may _ _ O
lack _ _ O
any _ _ O
unifying _ _ O
cultural _ _ O
background, _ _ O
they _ _ O
did _ _ O
have _ _ O
one _ _ O
thing _ _ O
in _ _ O
common: _ _ O
They _ _ O
were _ _ O
all _ _ O
served _ _ O
on _ _ O
rolls. _ _ O
Apart _ _ O
from _ _ O
an _ _ O
occasional _ _ O
salad _ _ O
or _ _ O
soup, _ _ O
everything _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
at _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
arrives _ _ O
in _ _ O
sandwich _ _ O
form. _ _ O
And _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
exception _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
muffuletta _ _ O
that _ _ O
briefly _ _ O
manifested _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
months _ _ O
back, _ _ O
every _ _ O
sandwich _ _ O
at _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
is _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
hot, _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
meat _ _ O
or _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
or _ _ O
vegetables. _ _ O
In _ _ O
Mexico, _ _ O
certain _ _ O
taco _ _ O
stands _ _ O
specialize _ _ O
in _ _ O
tacos _ _ O
de _ _ O
guisado, _ _ O
tortillas _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
one _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
stew _ _ O
or _ _ O
another. _ _ O
Most _ _ O
of _ _ O
Foxface's _ _ O
offerings _ _ O
are, _ _ O
in _ _ O
effect, _ _ O
sandwiches _ _ O
de _ _ O
guisado. _ _ O
Which _ _ O
reminds _ _ O
me _ _ O
of _ _ O
another _ _ O
impressive _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
sandwich, _ _ O
a _ _ O
magenta _ _ O
and _ _ O
green _ _ O
tangle _ _ O
of _ _ O
cilantro _ _ O
stems _ _ O
and _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
onions _ _ O
pressed _ _ O
into _ _ O
an _ _ O
engagingly _ _ O
tart _ _ O
pile _ _ O
of _ _ O
pork, _ _ O
marinated _ _ O
in _ _ O
sour _ _ O
orange _ _ O
juice _ _ O
and _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
very _ _ O
slowly _ _ O
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
banana _ _ O
leaf _ _ O
in _ _ O
emulation _ _ O
of _ _ O
cochinita _ _ O
pibil _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
Yucatán. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
guarantee _ _ O
that _ _ O
any _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O
items _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
available _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
go _ _ O
to _ _ O
Foxface. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
printed _ _ O
daily _ _ O
and _ _ O
taped _ _ O
up _ _ O
next _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
window _ _ O
on _ _ O
St. _ _ O
Marks _ _ O
Place _ _ O
where _ _ O
most _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
business _ _ O
is _ _ O
transacted. _ _ O
Sometimes _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
sandwich _ _ O
appears _ _ O
after _ _ O
the _ _ O
printed _ _ O
menu _ _ O
has _ _ O
already _ _ O
been _ _ O
posted, _ _ O
so _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
written _ _ O
out _ _ O
by _ _ O
hand _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
card _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
upper _ _ O
left _ _ O
corner _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
logo, _ _ O
a _ _ O
drawing _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
elegant _ _ O
fox _ _ O
in _ _ O
cat's-eye _ _ O
glasses _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
cigarette _ _ O
holder _ _ O
in _ _ O
one _ _ O
gloved _ _ O
hand. _ _ O
The _ _ O
sandwiches _ _ O
have _ _ O
names _ _ O
like _ _ O
It's _ _ O
What's _ _ O
'Nside _ _ O
(for _ _ O
the _ _ O
tripe _ _ O
with _ _ O
'nduja) _ _ O
or _ _ O
120 _ _ O
BPM _ _ O
(bison _ _ O
heart _ _ O
with _ _ O
tahini _ _ O
and _ _ O
"many _ _ O
spices"). _ _ O
The _ _ O
Smoking _ _ O
Fox _ _ O
is _ _ O
sold _ _ O
every _ _ O
day. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
smoked _ _ O
pork _ _ O
rib _ _ O
the _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
dry _ _ O
rosé, _ _ O
separated _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
bones _ _ O
and _ _ O
covered _ _ O
with _ _ O
coleslaw, _ _ O
pickles _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
splashes _ _ O
of _ _ O
habanero-orange _ _ O
vinegar. _ _ O
Your _ _ O
mind, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
goes _ _ O
either _ _ O
to _ _ O
Memphis _ _ O
or _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
McRib _ _ O
, _ _ O
and _ _ O
neither _ _ O
is _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
wrong, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
meat _ _ O
is _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
superior _ _ O
grade _ _ O
and _ _ O
is _ _ O
smoked _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
attention _ _ O
to _ _ O
timing _ _ O
and _ _ O
nuance _ _ O
that _ _ O
characterizes _ _ O
Foxface's _ _ O
cooking. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
a _ _ O
great _ _ O
sandwich. _ _ O
To _ _ O
place _ _ O
an _ _ O
order, _ _ O
you _ _ O
lean _ _ O
in _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
window _ _ O
and _ _ O
speak _ _ O
with _ _ O
Sivan _ _ O
Lahat, _ _ O
who _ _ O
owns _ _ O
and _ _ O
runs _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
with _ _ O
Ori _ _ O
Kushnir, _ _ O
her _ _ O
partner _ _ O
in _ _ O
life _ _ O
and _ _ O
in _ _ O
sandwiches. _ _ O
They _ _ O
immigrated _ _ O
to _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
from _ _ O
Israel _ _ O
almost _ _ O
20 _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago _ _ O
and _ _ O
have _ _ O
lived _ _ O
here _ _ O
ever _ _ O
since, _ _ O
apart _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
brief _ _ O
flirtation _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
Midwest _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
longer _ _ O
experimental _ _ O
period _ _ O
in _ _ O
Tokyo. _ _ O
While _ _ O
they _ _ O
were _ _ O
in _ _ O
Japan, _ _ O
they _ _ O
operated _ _ O
a _ _ O
pop-up _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
closest _ _ O
either _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
came _ _ O
to _ _ O
running _ _ O
a _ _ O
food _ _ O
business _ _ O
before _ _ O
opening _ _ O
Foxface. _ _ O
Like _ _ O
the _ _ O
fox _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
logo, _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Lahat _ _ O
has _ _ O
coppery _ _ O
hair _ _ O
and _ _ O
wears _ _ O
cat's-eye _ _ O
glasses. _ _ O
She _ _ O
prepares _ _ O
the _ _ O
orders _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
room _ _ O
behind _ _ O
the _ _ O
window, _ _ O
which _ _ O
measures _ _ O
48 _ _ O
square _ _ O
feet. _ _ O
Inside _ _ O
the _ _ O
building, _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
stairs, _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
second _ _ O
room. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Kushnir _ _ O
thinks _ _ O
it _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
as _ _ O
large _ _ O
as _ _ O
14 _ _ O
square _ _ O
feet. _ _ O
A _ _ O
variety _ _ O
of _ _ O
equipment _ _ O
is _ _ O
stowed _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O
rooms, _ _ O
including _ _ O
three _ _ O
induction _ _ O
burners, _ _ O
a _ _ O
roaster, _ _ O
a _ _ O
smoker _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
dishwasher. _ _ O
After _ _ O
business _ _ O
hours, _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
comes _ _ O
out _ _ O
as _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Kushnir _ _ O
supervises _ _ O
the _ _ O
more _ _ O
time-consuming _ _ O
roasts _ _ O
and _ _ O
stews. _ _ O
He _ _ O
describes _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
and _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Lahat _ _ O
cook _ _ O
as _ _ O
"dishes _ _ O
we _ _ O
like _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat, _ _ O
reimagined _ _ O
as _ _ O
sandwiches." _ _ O
I _ _ O
like _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
dishes, _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
happens, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
come _ _ O
by _ _ O
lately, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
those _ _ O
shapeless _ _ O
brown _ _ O
stews _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
so _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
style. _ _ O
Following _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
world's _ _ O
most _ _ O
influential _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
and _ _ O
shamed, _ _ O
perhaps, _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
unflattering _ _ O
lenses _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
million _ _ O
amateur _ _ O
photographers, _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
have _ _ O
shifted _ _ O
away _ _ O
from _ _ O
plain _ _ O
and _ _ O
plain-looking _ _ O
cooking. _ _ O
The _ _ O
subtlety _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
thrill _ _ O
of _ _ O
plain _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
comes _ _ O
from _ _ O
searing, _ _ O
simmering, _ _ O
reducing, _ _ O
skimming _ _ O
and _ _ O
so _ _ O
on. _ _ O
All _ _ O
the _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
own _ _ O
Instant _ _ O
Pots _ _ O
know _ _ O
this, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
segment _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
scene _ _ O
with _ _ O
artistic _ _ O
leanings _ _ O
has _ _ O
forgotten _ _ O
it, _ _ O
focusing _ _ O
instead _ _ O
on _ _ O
plating, _ _ O
arranging _ _ O
six _ _ O
or _ _ O
seven _ _ O
things _ _ O
in _ _ O
some _ _ O
photogenic _ _ O
design _ _ O
and _ _ O
hoping _ _ O
they _ _ O
will _ _ O
cohere. _ _ O
Slapping _ _ O
a _ _ O
roll _ _ O
on _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
a _ _ O
shapeless _ _ O
brown _ _ O
stew _ _ O
ready _ _ O
for _ _ O
its _ _ O
close-up, _ _ O
although _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
said _ _ O
that _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
mean _ _ O
streets _ _ O
of _ _ O
Instagram, _ _ O
an _ _ O
elk _ _ O
osso _ _ O
buco _ _ O
sandwich _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
match _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
rainbow _ _ O
unicorn _ _ O
ice _ _ O
cream _ _ O
sundae. _ _ O
Because _ _ O
space _ _ O
is _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
premium, _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
room _ _ O
to _ _ O
sit _ _ O
and _ _ O
eat _ _ O
your _ _ O
Smoking _ _ O
Fox _ _ O
at _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
itself. _ _ O
You _ _ O
can, _ _ O
however, _ _ O
take _ _ O
it _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
table _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
steps _ _ O
away _ _ O
inside _ _ O
an _ _ O
adjoining _ _ O
business _ _ O
called _ _ O
the _ _ O
William _ _ O
Barnacle _ _ O
Tavern _ _ O
. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
reassuringly _ _ O
gloomy _ _ O
bar _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
said _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
originated _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
speakeasy. _ _ O
Model _ _ O
ships _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
nautical _ _ O
paraphernalia _ _ O
are _ _ O
strewn _ _ O
about, _ _ O
references _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
rumrunning _ _ O
operation _ _ O
a _ _ O
former _ _ O
owner _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
building _ _ O
presided _ _ O
over _ _ O
during _ _ O
Prohibition. _ _ O
(The _ _ O
stairs _ _ O
that _ _ O
Foxface's _ _ O
dishwasher _ _ O
is _ _ O
housed _ _ O
below _ _ O
lead _ _ O
to _ _ O
an _ _ O
exhibition _ _ O
space _ _ O
called _ _ O
the _ _ O
Museum _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
American _ _ O
Gangster _ _ O
.) _ _ O
The _ _ O
bar's _ _ O
current _ _ O
owner _ _ O
has _ _ O
resisted _ _ O
some _ _ O
modern _ _ O
conveniences. _ _ O
Most _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
lighting _ _ O
at _ _ O
night _ _ O
comes _ _ O
from _ _ O
small _ _ O
candles, _ _ O
and _ _ O
all _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
music _ _ O
is _ _ O
provided _ _ O
by _ _ O
old _ _ O
films _ _ O
-- _ _ O
of _ _ O
Irish _ _ O
folk _ _ O
recitals, _ _ O
Cab _ _ O
Calloway _ _ O
concerts _ _ O
-- _ _ O
that _ _ O
run _ _ O
in _ _ O
looping, _ _ O
watery _ _ O
projections _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
back _ _ O
wall. _ _ O
All _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
sandwiches _ _ O
are _ _ O
presented _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
trim _ _ O
little _ _ O
white _ _ O
box _ _ O
that _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
unfolded _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
place _ _ O
mat. _ _ O
You _ _ O
can _ _ O
purchase _ _ O
an _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
fruit _ _ O
soda _ _ O
for _ _ O
$3 _ _ O
from _ _ O
Foxface, _ _ O
or _ _ O
buy _ _ O
alcohol _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
tavern. _ _ O
The _ _ O
beer _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
expensive, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
specialty _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
house _ _ O
is _ _ O
absinthe. _ _ O
Most _ _ O
patrons _ _ O
drink _ _ O
theirs _ _ O
diluted _ _ O
with _ _ O
ice _ _ O
water _ _ O
poured _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
four-spigot _ _ O
absinthe _ _ O
fountain _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
bar. _ _ O
The _ _ O
bartender _ _ O
will _ _ O
make _ _ O
absinthe _ _ O
cocktails, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
including _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
Ernest _ _ O
Hemingway _ _ O
supposedly _ _ O
invented _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
just _ _ O
absinthe _ _ O
and _ _ O
Champagne _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
big _ _ O
glass _ _ O
. _ _ O
He _ _ O
called _ _ O
it _ _ O
Death _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Afternoon, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
what _ _ O
I _ _ O
intend _ _ O
to _ _ O
drink _ _ O
if _ _ O
I _ _ O
ever _ _ O
get _ _ O
my _ _ O
hands _ _ O
on _ _ O
that _ _ O
camel _ _ O

I'm _ _ O
starting _ _ O
to _ _ O
think _ _ O
the _ _ O
American _ _ O
cult _ _ O
of _ _ O
chef _ _ O
worship _ _ O
may _ _ O
really _ _ O
be _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
out. _ _ O
At _ _ O
the _ _ O
very _ _ O
least, _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
paused _ _ O
to _ _ O
catch _ _ O
its _ _ O
breath. _ _ O
Since _ _ O
the _ _ O
seven-story _ _ O
food _ _ O
court _ _ O
in _ _ O
Hudson _ _ B-LOC
Yards _ _ I-LOC
was _ _ O
unveiled _ _ O
last _ _ O
month, _ _ O
the _ _ O
public _ _ O
reaction _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
somewhere _ _ O
between _ _ O
shrug _ _ O
and _ _ O
ugh. _ _ O
Attitudes _ _ O
may _ _ O
improve _ _ O
as _ _ O
visitors _ _ O
eat _ _ O
their _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
top _ _ O
floor. _ _ O
So _ _ O
far, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
the _ _ O
response _ _ O
hasn't _ _ O
come _ _ O
close _ _ O
to _ _ O
matching _ _ O
the _ _ O
greeting _ _ O
bestowed _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
at _ _ O
Time _ _ B-FOOD
Warner _ _ I-FOOD
Center _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
2004, _ _ O
even _ _ O
though _ _ O
the _ _ O
project _ _ O
represents _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
basic _ _ O
idea _ _ O
executed _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
developer _ _ O
with _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
chefs, _ _ O
Thomas _ _ O
Keller _ _ O
. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
more _ _ O
striking _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
the _ _ O
low-key _ _ O
reception _ _ O
to _ _ O
Rocco _ _ O
DiSpirito's _ _ O
return. _ _ O
Late _ _ O
last _ _ O
year _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
DiSpirito _ _ O
took _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
at _ _ O
Standard _ _ B-EST
Grill _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
meatpacking _ _ B-LOC
district. _ _ I-LOC
At _ _ O
one _ _ O
point, _ _ O
when _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
at _ _ O
both _ _ O
Union _ _ B-EST
Pacific _ _ I-EST
and _ _ O
Rocco's _ _ B-EST
on _ _ I-EST
22nd _ _ I-EST
while _ _ O
starring _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
television _ _ O
show, _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
arguably _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
famous _ _ O
chef _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
country. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
both _ _ O
places _ _ O
closed, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
show _ _ O
was _ _ O
canceled. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
DiSpirito _ _ O
has _ _ O
not _ _ O
been _ _ O
in _ _ O
charge _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
since _ _ O
George _ _ O
W. _ _ O
Bush _ _ O
was _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
White _ _ O
House. _ _ O
For _ _ O
that _ _ O
matter, _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
some _ _ O
years _ _ O
since _ _ O
Standard _ _ B-EST
Grill _ _ I-EST
itself _ _ O
has _ _ O
done _ _ O
anything _ _ O
noteworthy. _ _ O
In _ _ O
2009, _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
new _ _ O
and _ _ O
Dan _ _ O
Silverman _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
I _ _ O
reviewed _ _ O
it, _ _ O
gave _ _ O
it _ _ O
one _ _ O
star _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
lost _ _ O
track _ _ O
of _ _ O
it. _ _ O
In _ _ O
other _ _ O
words, _ _ O
the _ _ O
selection _ _ O
of _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
DiSpirito _ _ O
did _ _ O
not _ _ O
just _ _ O
come _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
left _ _ O
field. _ _ O
It _ _ O
came _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
weeds _ _ O
across _ _ O
the _ _ O
street _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
parking _ _ O
lot _ _ O
behind _ _ O
left _ _ O
field. _ _ O
For _ _ O
surprise _ _ O
value _ _ O
alone, _ _ O
it _ _ O
should _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
year's _ _ O
most _ _ O
buzzed-about _ _ O
news _ _ O
items. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
trumpets _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
muted, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
back _ _ O
handsprings _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
lack _ _ O
a _ _ O
certain _ _ O
bounce. _ _ O
This, _ _ O
at _ _ O
least, _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
view _ _ O
from _ _ O
outside _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
Once _ _ O
you're _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
at _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
tables _ _ O
-- _ _ O
newly _ _ O
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
leather _ _ O
pads _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
major _ _ O
retrofitting _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
made _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
look _ _ O
like _ _ O
an _ _ O
expensive _ _ O
cabaret, _ _ O
blue _ _ O
velvet _ _ O
and _ _ O
all _ _ O
-- _ _ O
you _ _ O
will _ _ O
hear _ _ O
quite _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
talk _ _ O
about _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
DiSpirito, _ _ O
or _ _ O
as _ _ O
they _ _ O
call _ _ O
him _ _ O
here, _ _ O
Chef _ _ O
Rocco. _ _ O
Chef _ _ O
Rocco, _ _ O
you _ _ O
learn, _ _ O
conceived _ _ O
each _ _ O
dish _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
so _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
eaten _ _ O
by _ _ O
one _ _ O
person _ _ O
or _ _ O
shared _ _ O
with _ _ O
others. _ _ O
No, _ _ O
I _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
believe _ _ O
it _ _ O
at _ _ O
first, _ _ O
either, _ _ O
but _ _ O
apparently _ _ O
it's _ _ O
true: _ _ O
Rocco _ _ O
DiSpirito _ _ O
invented _ _ O
food. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
something _ _ O
that _ _ O
servers _ _ O
call _ _ O
Chef _ _ B-DISH
Rocco's _ _ I-DISH
Game _ _ I-DISH
Changing _ _ I-DISH
Toast, _ _ I-DISH
although _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
they _ _ O
shorten _ _ O
it _ _ O
to _ _ O
Rocco's _ _ B-DISH
Game _ _ I-DISH
Changing _ _ I-DISH
or _ _ O
simply _ _ O
Game _ _ B-DISH
Changing, _ _ I-DISH
as _ _ O
in _ _ O
"Here's _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
more _ _ O
Game _ _ B-DISH
Changing _ _ I-DISH
for _ _ O
you." _ _ O
The _ _ O
item _ _ O
in _ _ O
question _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
toasted, _ _ O
cracker-thin _ _ O
slice _ _ O
of _ _ O
bread _ _ B-FOOD
made _ _ O
of _ _ O
nuts, _ _ B-FOOD
oats, _ _ B-FOOD
seeds _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
psyllium-seed _ _ B-FOOD
husks _ _ I-FOOD
held _ _ O
together _ _ O
without _ _ O
benefit _ _ O
of _ _ O
wheat _ _ B-FOOD
flour. _ _ I-FOOD
Like _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
everything _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
free _ _ B-DIET
of _ _ I-DIET
gluten. _ _ I-DIET
Being _ _ O
mostly _ _ O
made _ _ O
of _ _ O
browned _ _ B-FOOD
nuts, _ _ I-FOOD
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
delicious. _ _ O
Whether _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
truly _ _ O
Rocco's _ _ O
is _ _ O
up _ _ O
for _ _ O
debate. _ _ O
It _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
strongly _ _ O
resemble _ _ O
the _ _ O
Life-Changing _ _ B-DISH
Loaf _ _ I-DISH
of _ _ I-DISH
Bread _ _ I-DISH
recipe _ _ O
that _ _ O
Sarah _ _ O
Britton _ _ O
published _ _ O
on _ _ O
her _ _ O
blog, _ _ O
"My _ _ O
New _ _ O
Roots," _ _ O
in _ _ O
2013, _ _ O
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
appeared _ _ O
on _ _ O
another _ _ O
blog _ _ O
two _ _ O
years _ _ O
later, _ _ O
with _ _ O
minor _ _ O
changes, _ _ O
as _ _ O
Game _ _ B-DISH
Changing _ _ I-DISH
Nut _ _ I-DISH
& _ _ I-DISH
Seed _ _ I-DISH
Bread _ _ I-DISH
. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
items _ _ O
that _ _ O
reflect _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
DiSpirito's _ _ O
recent _ _ O
obsession _ _ O
with _ _ O
nutrient-dense _ _ O
dietary _ _ O
supplements _ _ O
, _ _ O
although _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
it _ _ O
keeps _ _ O
coming _ _ O
up _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
servers' _ _ O
patter _ _ O
makes _ _ O
you _ _ O
wonder _ _ O
if _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
DiSpirito _ _ O
spent _ _ O
too _ _ O
much _ _ O
time _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
QVC _ _ O
pitchman. _ _ O
Anyway, _ _ O
somebody-or-other's _ _ O
toast _ _ B-FOOD
sits _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
smoked _ _ B-FOOD
gravlax, _ _ I-FOOD
red _ _ O
with _ _ O
beet _ _ B-FOOD
juice _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
very _ _ O
silky _ _ O
on _ _ O
its _ _ O
bed _ _ O
of _ _ O
coconut _ _ B-FOOD
crème _ _ I-FOOD
fraîche, _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
DiSpirito _ _ O
sends _ _ O
out _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
amuse. _ _ O
A _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
toast _ _ B-FOOD
will _ _ O
also _ _ O
appear _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
order _ _ O
the _ _ O
platter _ _ O
of _ _ O
acorn-fed, _ _ B-DISH
hand-sliced _ _ I-DISH
Ibérico _ _ I-DISH
ham _ _ I-DISH
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
chilled _ _ B-DISH
Maine _ _ I-DISH
sea _ _ I-DISH
urchins _ _ I-DISH
served _ _ I-DISH
on _ _ I-DISH
the _ _ I-DISH
spiky _ _ I-DISH
half-shell. _ _ I-DISH
Either _ _ O
one _ _ O
will _ _ O
convince _ _ O
you _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
DiSpirito _ _ O
knows _ _ O
how _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
his _ _ O
hands _ _ O
on _ _ O
raw _ _ O
materials _ _ O
that _ _ O
can _ _ O
stun _ _ O
with _ _ O
almost _ _ O
no _ _ O
assistance. _ _ O
The _ _ O
best _ _ O
things _ _ O
at _ _ O
Standard _ _ B-EST
Grill, _ _ I-EST
and _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
quite _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
them, _ _ O
depend _ _ O
on _ _ O
very _ _ O
good _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
touched _ _ O
as _ _ O
little _ _ O
as _ _ O
possible. _ _ O
Back _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Union _ _ B-EST
Pacific _ _ I-EST
days, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
DiSpirito's _ _ O
interest _ _ O
in _ _ O
East _ _ B-CUISINE
Asian _ _ I-CUISINE
cuisines _ _ O
came _ _ O
out _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
form _ _ O
of _ _ O
complex _ _ O
preparations, _ _ O
arcane _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
and _ _ O
out-of-nowhere _ _ O
juxtapositions. _ _ O
Now _ _ O
he _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
moved _ _ O
on _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
luxury _ _ O
minimalism _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
omakase _ _ O
sushi _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
a _ _ O
style _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
foreshadowed _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
only _ _ O
Union _ _ B-EST
Pacific _ _ I-EST
dish _ _ O
he's _ _ O
brought _ _ O
back, _ _ O
bay _ _ B-DISH
scallops _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ I-DISH
sea _ _ I-DISH
urchin _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
throat-searing _ _ O
drops _ _ O
of _ _ O
mustard _ _ B-FOOD
oil. _ _ I-FOOD
Standard _ _ B-EST
Grill's _ _ I-EST
ice-cold _ _ O
cubes _ _ O
of _ _ O
bluefin _ _ B-DISH
chu-toro _ _ I-DISH
stirred _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
golden _ _ I-DISH
osetra _ _ I-DISH
caviar, _ _ I-DISH
meanwhile, _ _ O
could _ _ O
have _ _ O
come _ _ O
straight _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
Masa _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
while _ _ O
the _ _ O
yellowfin _ _ B-DISH
tartare, _ _ I-DISH
barely _ _ O
dressed _ _ O
with _ _ O
crushed _ _ O
macadamias _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
freshly _ _ O
grated _ _ O
wasabi, _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
like _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
better _ _ O
items _ _ O
at _ _ O
Tetsu _ _ B-EST
. _ _ O
Each _ _ O
night _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
half _ _ O
a _ _ O
dozen _ _ O
or _ _ O
so _ _ O
skewers _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
over _ _ O
Japanese _ _ O
charcoal _ _ O
and _ _ O
wheeled _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
mini-grill _ _ O
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
toaster _ _ O
oven. _ _ O
Speared _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
stick _ _ O
might _ _ O
be _ _ O
fantastic _ _ O
small _ _ O
scallops _ _ B-FOOD
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
Peconic _ _ B-LOC
Bay; _ _ I-LOC
a _ _ O
feathery _ _ O
mop _ _ O
of _ _ O
maitake _ _ B-FOOD
mushrooms; _ _ I-FOOD
buttery _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-FOOD
livers _ _ I-FOOD
with _ _ O
barely _ _ O
a _ _ O
hint _ _ O
of _ _ O
bitterness; _ _ O
or _ _ O
firefly _ _ B-FOOD
squid, _ _ I-FOOD
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
bigger _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
fava _ _ B-FOOD
bean _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
whole _ _ O
so _ _ O
they _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
swallowed _ _ O
guts _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
all. _ _ O
Again, _ _ O
the _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
are _ _ O
exceptional. _ _ O
The _ _ O
skewers _ _ O
look _ _ O
simple _ _ O
enough, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
all, _ _ O
you _ _ O
learn, _ _ O
brushed _ _ O
with _ _ O
"a _ _ O
little _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
Chef _ _ O
Rocco _ _ O
came _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
to _ _ O
complement _ _ O
the _ _ O
charcoal." _ _ O
The _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
for _ _ O
seafood _ _ B-FOOD
involves _ _ O
coconut _ _ B-FOOD
nectar _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
lemongrass, _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
what _ _ O
it _ _ O
actually _ _ O
does _ _ O
is _ _ O
put _ _ O
you, _ _ O
vaguely _ _ O
and _ _ O
pleasantly, _ _ O
in _ _ O
mind _ _ O
of _ _ O
Thailand. _ _ B-LOC
While _ _ O
I _ _ O
am _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
those _ _ O
increasingly _ _ O
stooped _ _ O
and _ _ O
wizened _ _ O
diners _ _ O
who _ _ O
remembers, _ _ O
in _ _ O
detail, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
DiSpirito's _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
at _ _ O
Union _ _ B-EST
Pacific, _ _ I-EST
far _ _ O
more _ _ O
people _ _ O
recall _ _ O
him _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O

of _ _ O
"The _ _ O

may _ _ O
be _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O

knows _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
what _ _ O
he _ _ O
is _ _ O

is _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole _ _ O
point _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O

which _ _ O
is _ _ O
first _ _ O

to _ _ O

He _ _ O
has _ _ O
also _ _ O
designed _ _ O
a _ _ O

so _ _ O
straightforward _ _ O
that _ _ O
if, _ _ O
after _ _ O
a _ _ O
respectable _ _ O
period _ _ O
of _ _ O
time, _ _ O
he _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
longer _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O

not _ _ O

the _ _ O

entirely _ _ O

Looking _ _ O
around _ _ O
Haenyeo's _ _ B-EST
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
one _ _ O
night _ _ O
in _ _ O
early _ _ O
March, _ _ O
I _ _ O
thought _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
Jenny _ _ O
Kwak's _ _ O
time _ _ O
has _ _ O
finally _ _ O
come. _ _ O
Her _ _ O
third _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
Haenyeo _ _ B-EST
was _ _ O
about _ _ O
three _ _ O
months _ _ O
old _ _ O
and _ _ O
already _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
looked _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
they'd _ _ O
been _ _ O
going _ _ O
there _ _ O
for _ _ O
years. _ _ O
It _ _ O
sits _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
prime _ _ O
corner _ _ O
lot, _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
stretch _ _ O
of _ _ O
Fifth _ _ B-LOC
Avenue _ _ I-LOC
in _ _ O
Park _ _ B-LOC
Slope, _ _ I-LOC
Brooklyn, _ _ I-LOC
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
rich _ _ O
in _ _ O
local _ _ O
minichains _ _ B-TYPE
serving _ _ O
banh _ _ B-FOOD
mi, _ _ I-FOOD
burritos, _ _ B-FOOD
lobster _ _ B-FOOD
rolls _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
so _ _ O
on, _ _ O
to _ _ O
take _ _ O
out _ _ O
or _ _ O
eat _ _ O
in. _ _ O
Intimidating _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
don't _ _ O
tend _ _ O
to _ _ O
prosper _ _ O
here. _ _ O
Very _ _ O
few _ _ O
people _ _ O
inside _ _ O
Haenyeo _ _ O
look _ _ O
the _ _ O
least _ _ O
bit _ _ O
intimidated _ _ O
as _ _ O
they _ _ O
lift _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
oysters _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
shell _ _ O
to _ _ O
pour _ _ O
the _ _ O
dregs _ _ O
of _ _ O
hot _ _ O
seaweed _ _ O
butter _ _ O
over _ _ O
toast; _ _ O
or _ _ O
carve _ _ O
wedges _ _ O
of _ _ O
zucchini-scallion _ _ O
pancakes _ _ O
fried _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark _ _ O
and _ _ O
satisfyingly _ _ O
rich _ _ O
brown; _ _ O
or _ _ O
stir _ _ O
mushrooms, _ _ O
squid, _ _ O
bean _ _ O
sprouts, _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
spinach _ _ O
and _ _ O
cabbage _ _ O
kimchi _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
just-cracked _ _ O
egg _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
bibimbap _ _ O
whose _ _ O
bottom _ _ O
layer _ _ O
of _ _ O
rice _ _ O
is _ _ O
golden _ _ O
and _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
where _ _ O
it _ _ O
meets _ _ O
the _ _ O
hot _ _ O
stone _ _ O
bowl. _ _ O
The _ _ O
customers _ _ O
at _ _ O
Haenyeo _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
an _ _ O
easy _ _ O
familiarity _ _ O
with _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
food. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
of _ _ O
them, _ _ O
at _ _ O
least, _ _ O
can _ _ O
probably _ _ O
thank _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Kwak _ _ O
for _ _ O
that. _ _ O
In _ _ O
1992, _ _ O
when _ _ O
she _ _ O
began _ _ O
serving _ _ O
the _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
East _ _ O
Village _ _ O
at _ _ O
her _ _ O
first _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
Dok _ _ O
Suni's, _ _ O
the _ _ O
words _ _ O
tteokbokki _ _ O
and _ _ O
seolleongtang _ _ O
and _ _ O
jajangmyeon _ _ O
did _ _ O
not _ _ O
roll _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
tongues _ _ O
of _ _ O
most _ _ O
non-Koreans. _ _ O
But _ _ O
that's _ _ O
who _ _ O
she _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
to _ _ O
lure _ _ O
in _ _ O
with _ _ O
American _ _ O
music, _ _ O
date-night _ _ O
décor _ _ O
and _ _ O
Western-style _ _ O
service. _ _ O
Once _ _ O
she _ _ O
had _ _ O
them, _ _ O
she _ _ O
would _ _ O
tempt, _ _ O
teach, _ _ O
turn _ _ O
them _ _ O
on _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
she'd _ _ O
grown _ _ O
up _ _ O
with. _ _ O
Her _ _ O
mother, _ _ O
Myung _ _ O
Ja _ _ O
Kwak, _ _ O
shared _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
duties. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Kwak's _ _ O
was _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
take-it-or-leave-it _ _ O
approach _ _ O
of _ _ O
32nd _ _ O
Street, _ _ O
and _ _ O
she _ _ O
kept _ _ O
at _ _ O
it. _ _ O
She _ _ O
wrote _ _ O
"Dok _ _ O
Suni: _ _ O
Recipes _ _ O
From _ _ O
My _ _ O
Mother's _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
Kitchen," _ _ O
which _ _ O
was _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
few _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
cookbooks _ _ O
in _ _ O
English _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
came _ _ O
out, _ _ O
in _ _ O
1998. _ _ O
At _ _ O
her _ _ O
second _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
Do _ _ O
Hwa, _ _ O
she _ _ O
and _ _ O
her _ _ O
mother _ _ O
led _ _ O
customers _ _ O
deeper _ _ O
into _ _ O
unfamiliar _ _ O
ground. _ _ O
Each _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
stayed _ _ O
open _ _ O
for _ _ O
about _ _ O
two _ _ O
decades, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
very _ _ O
long _ _ O
time _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ O
York. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
want _ _ O
a _ _ O
metaphor _ _ O
for _ _ O
how _ _ O
effectively _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Kwak _ _ O
paved _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
for _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
like _ _ O
Atoboy _ _ O
, _ _ O
Soogil, _ _ O
Danji _ _ O
and _ _ O
others _ _ O
whose _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
weave _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
into _ _ O
new _ _ O
patterns, _ _ O
consider _ _ O
that _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
them, _ _ O
Oiji, _ _ O
moved _ _ O
into _ _ O
its _ _ O
address _ _ O
on _ _ O
First _ _ O
Avenue _ _ O
right _ _ O
after _ _ O
Dok _ _ O
Suni's _ _ O
moved _ _ O
out. _ _ O
What _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Kwak _ _ O
is _ _ O
doing _ _ O
in _ _ O
Park _ _ O
Slope _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
all _ _ O
that _ _ O
different _ _ O
from _ _ O
what _ _ O
she _ _ O
has _ _ O
done _ _ O
all _ _ O
her _ _ O
career, _ _ O
except _ _ O
that _ _ O
by _ _ O
now _ _ O
South _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
comfort _ _ O
food _ _ O
has _ _ O
become _ _ O
comfort _ _ O
food _ _ O
for _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
in _ _ O
general. _ _ O
Haenyeo _ _ O
does _ _ O
pay _ _ O
more _ _ O
attention _ _ O
to _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
than _ _ O
Dok _ _ O
Suni _ _ O
or _ _ O
Do _ _ O
Hwa _ _ O
did, _ _ O
though. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Kwak _ _ O
hasn't _ _ O
gone _ _ O
pescatarian _ _ O
on _ _ O
us. _ _ O
She _ _ O
still _ _ O
serves _ _ O
impressive _ _ O
pork _ _ O
and _ _ O
beef _ _ O
bulgogis _ _ O
with _ _ O
ssamjang _ _ O
and _ _ O
lettuce, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
pan-fried _ _ O
dumplings _ _ O
are _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
high-fat _ _ O
ground _ _ O
beef _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
with _ _ O
kimchi, _ _ O
garlic _ _ O
and _ _ O
soy. _ _ O
But _ _ O
her _ _ O
menu's _ _ O
orientation _ _ O
has _ _ O
shifted _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
toward _ _ O
the _ _ O
ocean. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
good _ _ O
news, _ _ O
because _ _ O
the _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
at _ _ O
Haenyeo _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
sparkle _ _ O
and _ _ O
sweetness _ _ O
you _ _ O
don't _ _ O
always _ _ O
find _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
smoke-filled _ _ O
rooms _ _ O
of _ _ O
32nd _ _ O
Street. _ _ O
A _ _ O
bibimbap _ _ O
variant _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu's _ _ O
sleeper _ _ O
dish, _ _ O
partly _ _ O
because _ _ O
it _ _ O
starts _ _ O
out _ _ O
looking _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
lunch _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
from _ _ O
Sweetgreen. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
hwe _ _ O
dup _ _ O
bap. _ _ O
At _ _ O
first _ _ O
you _ _ O
just _ _ O
see _ _ O
raw _ _ O
tuna, _ _ O
shredded _ _ O
romaine _ _ O
and _ _ O
perilla _ _ O
leaves, _ _ O
grated _ _ O
carrots _ _ O
and _ _ O
cucumber, _ _ O
and _ _ O
strips _ _ O
of _ _ O
seaweed. _ _ O
Hidden _ _ O
underneath _ _ O
is _ _ O
warm _ _ O
rice. _ _ O
But _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
pink _ _ O
mound _ _ O
of _ _ O
spicy _ _ O
cod _ _ O
roe _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
bowl, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
with _ _ O
cured _ _ O
salmon _ _ O
eggs _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
lobes _ _ O
of _ _ O
sea _ _ O
urchin. _ _ O
Both _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
will _ _ O
break _ _ O
apart _ _ O
as _ _ O
you _ _ O
stir, _ _ O
bringing _ _ O
their _ _ O
distinct _ _ O
saltwater _ _ O
intonations _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
rice _ _ O
and _ _ O
vegetables. _ _ O
What _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
calls _ _ O
"white _ _ O
fish _ _ O
fillets" _ _ O
-- _ _ O
pan-fried _ _ O
cod _ _ O
with _ _ O
rings _ _ O
of _ _ O
scallion _ _ O
showing _ _ O
through _ _ O
their _ _ O
thin _ _ O
gold _ _ O
sheet _ _ O
of _ _ O
egg _ _ O
batter, _ _ O
otherwise _ _ O
known _ _ O
as _ _ O
saeng _ _ O
seon _ _ O
jeon _ _ O
-- _ _ O
is _ _ O
so _ _ O
modestly _ _ O
named _ _ O
it _ _ O
might _ _ O
get _ _ O
overlooked; _ _ O
it _ _ O
shouldn't. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu _ _ O
plays _ _ O
Don't _ _ O
Mind _ _ O
Me _ _ O
again _ _ O
with _ _ O
"mackerel, _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
or _ _ O
braised." _ _ O
Just _ _ O
get _ _ O
the _ _ O
mackerel, _ _ O
because _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
knows _ _ O
how _ _ O
to _ _ O
cook _ _ O
it, _ _ O
whether _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
flame _ _ O
or _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark, _ _ O
smoky _ _ O
pan _ _ O
of _ _ O
garlic _ _ O
and _ _ O
gochujang. _ _ O
In _ _ O
truth, _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
know _ _ O
how _ _ O
to _ _ O
cook _ _ O
every _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
seafood, _ _ O
although _ _ O
perhaps _ _ O
it _ _ O
could _ _ O
come _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
better _ _ O
partner _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
fried _ _ O
scallops _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweet, _ _ O
yellowish _ _ O
tartar _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
with _ _ O
corn _ _ O
in _ _ O
it. _ _ O
The _ _ O
walls _ _ O
are _ _ O
hung _ _ O
with _ _ O
photographs _ _ O
of _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
women _ _ O
in _ _ O
wet _ _ O
suits. _ _ O
These _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
haenyeo _ _ O
of _ _ O
Jeju _ _ O
island _ _ O
, _ _ O
who _ _ O
dive _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
30 _ _ O
feet _ _ O
deep _ _ O
for _ _ O
conch, _ _ O
abalone _ _ O
and _ _ O
seaweed _ _ O
while _ _ O
holding _ _ O
their _ _ O
breath _ _ O
for _ _ O
several _ _ O
minutes _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
time. _ _ O
The _ _ O
money _ _ O
they _ _ O
made _ _ O
diving _ _ O
is _ _ O
probably _ _ O
the _ _ O
reason _ _ O
parts _ _ O
of _ _ O
Jeju _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
matriarchal _ _ O
family _ _ O
structure. _ _ O
Naming _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
after _ _ O
them, _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Kwak _ _ O
continues _ _ O
a _ _ O
theme _ _ O
started _ _ O
with _ _ O
Dok _ _ O
Suni's, _ _ O
which _ _ O
means _ _ O
"strong _ _ O
women's." _ _ O
One _ _ O
dish _ _ O
that _ _ O
seems _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
place _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
revival _ _ O
of _ _ O
Dok _ _ O
Suni's _ _ O
fried _ _ O
chicken. _ _ O
Was _ _ O
the _ _ O
batter _ _ O
always _ _ O
so _ _ O
pasty _ _ O
and _ _ O
airless? _ _ O
That's _ _ O
not _ _ O
how _ _ O
I _ _ O
remember _ _ O
it, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it's _ _ O
possible _ _ O
my _ _ O
standards _ _ O
have _ _ O
changed _ _ O
as _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
fried _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
has _ _ O
infiltrated _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
every _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
town _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
decade. _ _ O
In _ _ O
any _ _ O
case, _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O

In _ _ O
2012 _ _ O
and _ _ O
2013, _ _ O
when _ _ O
people _ _ O
were _ _ O
lining _ _ O
up _ _ O
at _ _ O
Smorgasburg _ _ B-EST
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
second _ _ O
floor _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Houston _ _ B-LOC
Street _ _ I-LOC
Whole _ _ B-LOC
Foods _ _ I-LOC
Market _ _ I-LOC
for _ _ O
biodegradable _ _ O
bowls _ _ O
of _ _ O
Yuji _ _ O
Haraguchi's _ _ O
mazemen _ _ B-DISH
-- _ _ O
noodles _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
might _ _ O
be _ _ O
dressed _ _ O
with _ _ O
crisped _ _ O
twigs _ _ O
of _ _ O
bacon _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
jiggling _ _ O
onsen _ _ B-FOOD
egg, _ _ I-FOOD
say, _ _ O
or _ _ O
yuzu-cured _ _ B-FOOD
salmon _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
some _ _ O
Camembert _ _ B-FOOD
soft _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
transform _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
-- _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
sure _ _ O
the _ _ O
crowds _ _ O
would _ _ O
multiply _ _ O
and _ _ O
fan _ _ O
out, _ _ O
demanding _ _ O
more _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
strange _ _ O
brothless _ _ O
ramen. _ _ B-FOOD
And _ _ O
they _ _ O
did, _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
sense. _ _ O
Soon _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Haraguchi _ _ O
had _ _ O
established _ _ O
his _ _ O
own _ _ O
free-standing _ _ O
establishment, _ _ O
Yuji _ _ B-EST
Ramen _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
Williamsburg, _ _ B-LOC
Brooklyn, _ _ I-LOC
where _ _ O
he _ _ O
serves _ _ O
that _ _ O
bacon-and-egg _ _ B-DISH
mazemen _ _ I-DISH
along _ _ O
with _ _ O
his _ _ O
possibly _ _ O
visionary _ _ O
"tunakotsu" _ _ B-DISH
ramen. _ _ I-DISH
In _ _ O
2014, _ _ O
when _ _ O
Ivan _ _ O
Orkin _ _ O
came _ _ O
to _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
, _ _ O
he _ _ O
brought _ _ O
along _ _ O
his _ _ O
own _ _ O
mazemen _ _ B-DISH
recipes. _ _ O
Over _ _ O
the _ _ O
next _ _ O
few _ _ O
years _ _ O
mazemen _ _ B-FOOD
turned _ _ O
up _ _ O
in _ _ O
other _ _ O
restaurants, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
but _ _ O
all _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
remained _ _ O
better _ _ O
known _ _ O
for _ _ O
soup _ _ B-FOOD
ramen, _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
sold _ _ O
more _ _ O
of _ _ O
it. _ _ O
It _ _ O
began _ _ O
to _ _ O
look _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
mazemen _ _ B-FOOD
would _ _ O
never _ _ O
be _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
sideshow _ _ O
act, _ _ O
the _ _ O
one-armed _ _ O
ax-catcher _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
ramen _ _ B-FOOD
circus. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
start _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
year, _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
Shigetoshi _ _ O
Nakamura, _ _ O
who _ _ O
operates _ _ O
an _ _ O
intimate _ _ O
ramen _ _ B-TYPE
shop _ _ I-TYPE
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
Lower _ _ B-LOC
East _ _ I-LOC
Side, _ _ I-LOC
opened _ _ O
an _ _ O
annex _ _ O
next _ _ O
door _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
dedicated _ _ O
to _ _ O
mazemen. _ _ B-FOOD
All _ _ O
the _ _ O
seating _ _ O
at _ _ O
this _ _ O
new _ _ O
place, _ _ O
Niche _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
is _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
dozen _ _ O
or _ _ O
so _ _ O
stools _ _ O
arranged _ _ O
around _ _ O
one _ _ O
long, _ _ O
narrow _ _ O
table. _ _ O
When _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
is _ _ O
fully _ _ O
occupied, _ _ O
the _ _ O
only _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
from _ _ O
one _ _ O
end _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
walk _ _ O
sideways _ _ O
while _ _ O
holding _ _ O
your _ _ O
breath _ _ O
and _ _ O
picking _ _ O
up _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
coats _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
knock _ _ O
off _ _ O
their _ _ O
wall _ _ O
pegs _ _ O
as _ _ O
you _ _ O
go. _ _ O
Not _ _ O
that _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
much _ _ O
reason _ _ O
to _ _ O
roam _ _ O
around. _ _ O
Orders _ _ O
are _ _ O
taken _ _ O
from _ _ O
and _ _ O
delivered _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
table, _ _ O
and _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
public _ _ O
restroom _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
premises. _ _ O
As _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
case _ _ O
next _ _ O
door _ _ O
at _ _ O
Nakamura, _ _ B-EST
seats _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
window _ _ O
offer _ _ O
a _ _ O
close-up _ _ O
view _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
stone _ _ O
walls _ _ O
that _ _ O
support _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
few _ _ O
yards _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Williamsburg _ _ O
Bridge _ _ O
before _ _ O
it _ _ O
empties _ _ O
onto _ _ O
Delancey _ _ B-LOC
Street. _ _ I-LOC
Before _ _ O
he _ _ O
came _ _ O
to _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York, _ _ I-LOC
Mr. _ _ O
Nakamura _ _ O
was _ _ O
already _ _ O
well _ _ O
known _ _ O
in _ _ O
Tokyo, _ _ B-LOC
where _ _ O
he _ _ O
proved _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
theatrical _ _ O
streak. _ _ O
Before _ _ O
filling _ _ O
a _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
with _ _ O
noodles, _ _ B-FOOD
he _ _ O
would _ _ O
yank _ _ O
them _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
boiling _ _ O
water _ _ O
with _ _ O
his _ _ O
left _ _ O
hand _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
hold _ _ O
them _ _ O
high _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
air _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
seconds, _ _ O
letting _ _ O
them _ _ O
drain _ _ O
while _ _ O
standing _ _ O
completely _ _ O
motionless. _ _ O
Suddenly _ _ O
he _ _ O
would _ _ O
drop _ _ O
his _ _ O
arm _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
basket _ _ O
would _ _ O
plunge _ _ O
toward _ _ O
the _ _ O
water _ _ O
again, _ _ O
before _ _ O
stopping _ _ O
just _ _ O
in _ _ O
time _ _ O
and _ _ O
getting _ _ O
one _ _ O
quick, _ _ O
emphatic _ _ O
shake. _ _ O
When _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Nakamura _ _ O
was _ _ O
immortalized _ _ O
as _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
four _ _ O
"ramen _ _ O
gods" _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
set _ _ O
of _ _ O
Hello _ _ O
Kitty _ _ O
notepads _ _ O
and _ _ O
phone _ _ O
straps, _ _ O
Kitty _ _ O
was _ _ O
posed _ _ O
with _ _ O
her _ _ O
left _ _ O
paw _ _ O
raised _ _ O
high _ _ O
in _ _ O
emulation _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Nakamura _ _ O
Shake. _ _ O
If _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Nakamura _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
practicing _ _ O
his _ _ O
choreography _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
spaghetti-like, _ _ O
crinkly _ _ O
noodles _ _ B-FOOD
at _ _ O
Niche, _ _ B-EST
I _ _ O
haven't _ _ O
seen _ _ O
it _ _ O
yet. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Nakamura _ _ O
Shake _ _ O
seems _ _ O
designed _ _ O
to _ _ O
extract _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
water _ _ O
as _ _ O
quickly _ _ O
as _ _ O
possible _ _ O
before _ _ O
the _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
cool, _ _ O
and _ _ O
temperature _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
especially _ _ O
critical _ _ O
in _ _ O
mazemen. _ _ B-FOOD
The _ _ O
idea _ _ O
of _ _ O
noodle _ _ B-FOOD
soup _ _ I-FOOD
without _ _ O
the _ _ O
soup _ _ B-FOOD
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
loose _ _ O
in _ _ O
Japan _ _ B-LOC
for _ _ O
decades. _ _ O
Broth _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
expensive _ _ O
and _ _ O
labor-intensive _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
ramen; _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
1950s, _ _ O
a _ _ O
Tokyo _ _ B-LOC
noodle _ _ B-TYPE
shop, _ _ I-TYPE
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
pitiless _ _ O
logic _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
business, _ _ O
began _ _ O
omitting _ _ O
the _ _ O
broth _ _ B-FOOD
when _ _ O
ladling _ _ O
out _ _ O
noodles _ _ B-FOOD
at _ _ O
staff _ _ O
meals, _ _ O
or _ _ O
so _ _ O
the _ _ O
story _ _ O
goes. _ _ O
This _ _ O
"abura _ _ B-FOOD
soba" _ _ I-FOOD
-- _ _ O
oil _ _ B-FOOD
noodle, _ _ I-FOOD
because _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
moistened _ _ O
with _ _ O
lard _ _ B-FOOD
along _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
seasoning _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
called _ _ O
tare _ _ B-FOOD
-- _ _ O
wasn't _ _ O
half _ _ O
bad, _ _ O
so _ _ O
it _ _ O
went _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
discounted _ _ O
price. _ _ O
As _ _ O
an _ _ O
even _ _ O
cheaper _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
already _ _ O
cheap _ _ O
and _ _ O
filling _ _ O
meal, _ _ O
abura _ _ B-FOOD
soba _ _ I-FOOD
was _ _ O
quickly _ _ O
embraced, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
by _ _ O
students. _ _ O
As _ _ O
food _ _ O
ideas _ _ O
tend _ _ O
to _ _ O
do _ _ O
in _ _ O
Japan, _ _ B-LOC
it _ _ O
evolved _ _ O
rapidly. _ _ O
Today, _ _ O
abura _ _ B-FOOD
soba _ _ I-FOOD
tends _ _ O
to _ _ O
refer _ _ O
to _ _ O
dry _ _ O
soups _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
have _ _ O
more _ _ O
or _ _ O
less _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
toppings _ _ O
you'd _ _ O
find _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
normal _ _ O
ramen, _ _ B-FOOD
while _ _ O
mazemen _ _ B-FOOD
generally _ _ O
has _ _ O
toppings _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
rarely _ _ O
seen _ _ O
in _ _ O
soup _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
often _ _ O
would _ _ O
not _ _ O
respond _ _ O
well _ _ O
to _ _ O
being _ _ O
submerged _ _ O
in _ _ O
hot _ _ O
liquid. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
Italian-style _ _ B-FOOD
mazemen, _ _ I-FOOD
with _ _ O
anchovies, _ _ O
salami, _ _ O
olives _ _ O
and _ _ O
tomatoes. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
mazemen _ _ B-FOOD
shops _ _ O
specialize _ _ O
in _ _ O
fried _ _ B-DISH
beef _ _ I-DISH
cutlets. _ _ I-DISH
At _ _ O
a _ _ O
Tokyo _ _ B-LOC
restaurant _ _ O
called _ _ O
Beefst _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
the _ _ O
centerpiece _ _ O
of _ _ O
each _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
is _ _ O
sliced _ _ B-FOOD
roast _ _ I-FOOD
beef, _ _ I-FOOD
served _ _ O
rare. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Nakamura _ _ O
has _ _ O
an _ _ O
answer _ _ O
to _ _ O
that: _ _ O
steak _ _ B-DISH
mazemen. _ _ I-DISH
The _ _ O
steak _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
rib-eye, _ _ O
in _ _ O
cubes _ _ O
that _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
browned _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
torch. _ _ O
When _ _ O
you _ _ O
stir _ _ O
them _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
noodles _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
smooth, _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
spoonful _ _ O
of _ _ O
something _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
simply _ _ O
calls _ _ O
"pork _ _ B-FOOD
sauce," _ _ I-FOOD
their _ _ O
juices _ _ O
and _ _ O
flecks _ _ O
of _ _ O
char _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole _ _ O
bowl. _ _ O
Plain _ _ O
spinach _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
fermented _ _ B-FOOD
bamboo, _ _ I-FOOD
meanwhile, _ _ O
keep _ _ O
the _ _ O
total _ _ O
effect _ _ O
from _ _ O
being _ _ O
queasy-making. _ _ O
Novel, _ _ O
straightforward, _ _ O
refined, _ _ O
unruly _ _ O
and _ _ O
impure _ _ O
of _ _ O
heart, _ _ O
steak _ _ B-DISH
mazemen _ _ I-DISH
has _ _ O
the _ _ O
makings _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
classic _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
dish. _ _ O
So _ _ O
does _ _ O
the _ _ O
duck, _ _ B-DISH
a _ _ O
common _ _ O
special. _ _ O
A _ _ O
sliced _ _ O
breast _ _ B-FOOD
of _ _ O
moulard _ _ B-FOOD
duck _ _ I-FOOD
cooked _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
deep _ _ O
violet-pink, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
bright, _ _ O
focused _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
built _ _ O
on _ _ O
soy _ _ O
and _ _ O
enough _ _ O
warm _ _ O
duck _ _ O
juices _ _ O
to _ _ O
lubricate _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole-wheat _ _ O
noodles. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
an _ _ O
austere _ _ O
dish _ _ O
by _ _ O
any _ _ O
means, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
balanced _ _ O
and _ _ O
restrained. _ _ O
The _ _ O
same _ _ O
cannot _ _ O
be _ _ O
said _ _ O
for _ _ O
another _ _ O
special _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
always _ _ O
offered _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
nights: _ _ O
a _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
liquefied _ _ O
foie _ _ O
gras _ _ O
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
pistachios _ _ O
and _ _ O
truffle _ _ O
oil. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
clear _ _ O
what _ _ O
will _ _ O
happen _ _ O
to _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
who _ _ O
tries _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat _ _ O
this _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
spoon, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
prognosis _ _ O
does _ _ O
not _ _ O
seem _ _ O
good. _ _ O
Instead, _ _ O
everybody _ _ O
orders _ _ O
it _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
duck _ _ O
mazemen _ _ O
and _ _ O
dips _ _ O
the _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
foie _ _ O
gras, _ _ O
after _ _ O
which _ _ O
conscious _ _ O
thought _ _ O
tends _ _ O
to _ _ O
stop _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
minute _ _ O
or _ _ O
two. _ _ O
When _ _ O
cerebral _ _ O
activity _ _ O
resumes, _ _ O
you _ _ O
might _ _ O
wonder _ _ O
why _ _ O
the _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
come _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O
own _ _ O
noodles. _ _ O
No _ _ O
other _ _ O
mazemen _ _ O
is _ _ O
such _ _ O
a _ _ O
joy _ _ O
ride, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
vaguely _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
one _ _ O
with _ _ O
tomatoes, _ _ O
mushrooms, _ _ O
kombu _ _ O
and _ _ O
an _ _ O
angry _ _ O
red _ _ O
soak _ _ O
of _ _ O
chile _ _ O
oil _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
thing _ _ O
you _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
turn _ _ O
your _ _ O
back _ _ O
on. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
the _ _ O
tribute _ _ O
to _ _ O
Russ _ _ O
& _ _ O
Daughters _ _ O
, _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
are _ _ O
coated _ _ O
with _ _ O
spicy _ _ O
cod _ _ O
roe _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
topping _ _ O
is _ _ O
sliced _ _ O
smoked _ _ O
salmon, _ _ O
can _ _ O
sneak _ _ O
up _ _ O
on _ _ O
you. _ _ O
Niche _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
few _ _ O
ramen-yas _ _ O
in _ _ O

where _ _ O
the _ _ O

worth _ _ O
noticing. _ _ O
Sea _ _ O
urchin _ _ O
perched _ _ O
on _ _ O
tiny _ _ O
corners _ _ O
of _ _ O

is _ _ O
a _ _ O

affair, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O

the _ _ O
avocado _ _ O
salad _ _ O
showered _ _ O
with _ _ O
tempura _ _ O
flakes. _ _ O
Should _ _ O
fries _ _ O
be _ _ O
an _ _ O
appetizer? _ _ O
Maybe _ _ O
not, _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
Niche's _ _ O
"umami _ _ O
kombu _ _ O
fries," _ _ O
which _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
sprinkled _ _ O
with _ _ O
powdered _ _ O
shio _ _ O
kombu _ _ O
until _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
almost _ _ O
subliminally _ _ O
green. _ _ O
Apart _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
color, _ _ O
they _ _ O
look _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
fries _ _ O
at _ _ O
McDonald's. _ _ O
The _ _ O
difference _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
shio _ _ O
kombu _ _ O
makes _ _ O
them _ _ O
almost _ _ O
diabolically _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
stop _ _ O
eating. _ _ O
And _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
don't _ _ O
eat _ _ O
them _ _ O
before _ _ O
the _ _ O
mazemen _ _ O
arrives, _ _ O
then _ _ O
when _ _ O
will _ _ O
you? _ _ O

If _ _ O
you _ _ O
ate _ _ O
at _ _ O
Spice _ _ B-EST
Market _ _ I-EST
before _ _ O
it _ _ O
closed _ _ O
two _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
you _ _ O
may _ _ O
experience _ _ O
low-key _ _ O
but _ _ O
persistent _ _ O
flashbacks _ _ O
at _ _ O
Wayan _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
which _ _ O
set _ _ O
up _ _ O
shop _ _ O
in _ _ O
February _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
east _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
Spring _ _ B-LOC
Street _ _ I-LOC
in _ _ O
NoLIta. _ _ B-LOC
Again _ _ O
the _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
come _ _ O
from _ _ O
Asia _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
methods, _ _ O
generally, _ _ O
from _ _ O
France. _ _ B-LOC
Again _ _ O
the _ _ O
far-off _ _ O
tropics _ _ O
are _ _ O
evoked _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
play _ _ O
of _ _ O
indirect, _ _ O
dappled _ _ O
light, _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
filtered _ _ O
through _ _ O
jungle _ _ O
foliage _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
carved _ _ O
wooden _ _ O
screen. _ _ O
Again _ _ O
the _ _ O
presiding _ _ O
culinary _ _ O
sensibility _ _ O
belongs _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
Vongerichten. _ _ O
Jean-Georges _ _ O
Vongerichten _ _ O
put _ _ O
together _ _ O
Spice _ _ B-EST
Market _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
2004, _ _ O
a _ _ O
confection _ _ O
of _ _ O
teak, _ _ O
silk, _ _ O
vodka, _ _ B-FOOD
peanut _ _ B-FOOD
sauce _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
high _ _ O
heels _ _ O
that _ _ O
brought _ _ O
the _ _ O
Asian _ _ B-TYPE
Party _ _ I-TYPE
Temple _ _ I-TYPE
restaurant _ _ O
genre _ _ O
to _ _ O
its _ _ O
apotheosis. _ _ O
All _ _ O
the _ _ O
earlier _ _ O
examples _ _ O
suddenly _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
fumbling _ _ O
and _ _ O
unsophisticated, _ _ O
and _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
possible _ _ O
exception _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Spice _ _ B-EST
Market _ _ I-EST
spinoffs _ _ O
in _ _ O
Qatar _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
Mexico, _ _ B-LOC
the _ _ O
ones _ _ O
that _ _ O
would _ _ O
follow _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
increasingly _ _ O
mindless _ _ O
and _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
touch. _ _ O
Interior _ _ O
design _ _ O
that _ _ O
rummages _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
musty _ _ O
old _ _ O
trunks _ _ O
of _ _ O
Orientalism _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
look _ _ O
as _ _ O
alluring _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
did _ _ O
15 _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
and _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
that _ _ O
filters _ _ O
Asian _ _ B-CUISINE
flavors _ _ O
through _ _ O
a _ _ O
Western _ _ O
sensibility _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
automatically _ _ O
met _ _ O
with _ _ O
gales _ _ O
of _ _ O
excitement. _ _ O
Wayan, _ _ B-EST
where _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Vongerichten's _ _ O
son, _ _ O
Cédric, _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
avoids _ _ O
both _ _ O
traps, _ _ O
I _ _ O
think. _ _ O
The _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
tribute _ _ O
to _ _ O
Indonesia, _ _ B-LOC
the _ _ O
home _ _ O
of _ _ O
his _ _ O
wife _ _ O
and _ _ O
business _ _ O
partner, _ _ O
Ochi _ _ O
Vongerichten, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
site _ _ O
of _ _ O
two _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
opened _ _ O
recently. _ _ O
(He _ _ O
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
of _ _ O
Perry _ _ B-EST
St. _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
Manhattan, _ _ B-LOC
which _ _ O
his _ _ O
father _ _ O
owns.) _ _ O
The _ _ O
scale _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
personal _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
cultural _ _ O
references _ _ O
are _ _ O
more _ _ O
specific _ _ O
at _ _ O
Wayan _ _ B-EST
than _ _ O
at _ _ O
Spice _ _ B-EST
Market _ _ I-EST
and _ _ O
its _ _ O
kind. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
far _ _ O
from _ _ O
encyclopedic, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
clear _ _ O
that _ _ O
Indonesia's _ _ B-LOC
cuisine _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
given _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
quick _ _ O
glance _ _ O
that _ _ O
informs _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
Asian _ _ B-CUISINE
fusion. _ _ I-CUISINE
Ms. _ _ O
Vongerichten _ _ O
works _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room, _ _ O
stopping _ _ O
by _ _ O
tables _ _ O
to _ _ O
offer _ _ O
explanations _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
and _ _ O
how _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
differs _ _ O
from _ _ O
that _ _ O
at _ _ O
some _ _ O
other _ _ O
Indonesian _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurants _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York, _ _ I-LOC
which _ _ O
she _ _ O
cheerfully _ _ O
calls _ _ O
"more _ _ O
authentic." _ _ O
More _ _ O
than _ _ O
any _ _ O
other _ _ O
factor, _ _ O
she _ _ O
helps _ _ O
keep _ _ O
Wayan _ _ B-EST
from _ _ O
turning _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
junior _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
her _ _ O
father-in-law's _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
-- _ _ O
Young _ _ O
Vongerichtenstein. _ _ O
Servers _ _ O
will _ _ O
tell _ _ O
you _ _ O
to _ _ O
start _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
stick _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
of _ _ O
satay. _ _ O
You _ _ O
can, _ _ O
although _ _ O
the _ _ O
skewers _ _ O
are _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
flattop _ _ O
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
grill, _ _ O
and _ _ O
inconsistency _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
issue. _ _ O
The _ _ O
pork _ _ B-DISH
skewers _ _ I-DISH
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
so _ _ O
appealingly _ _ O
juicy _ _ O
and _ _ O
savory _ _ O
with _ _ O
sweet _ _ B-FOOD
soy _ _ I-FOOD
one _ _ O
week _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
scorched _ _ O
and _ _ O
bitter _ _ O
the _ _ O
next _ _ O
time _ _ O
you _ _ O
see _ _ O
them, _ _ O
and _ _ O
just _ _ O
ordinary _ _ O
the _ _ O
following _ _ O
week. _ _ O
(The _ _ O
pickled _ _ B-FOOD
watermelon _ _ I-FOOD
radishes _ _ I-FOOD
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
side, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
are _ _ O
always _ _ O
terrific; _ _ O
they're _ _ O
brined _ _ O
with _ _ O
lime _ _ B-FOOD
leaf.) _ _ I-FOOD
The _ _ O
peanut _ _ B-FOOD
sauce _ _ I-FOOD
on _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-DISH
satay _ _ I-DISH
may _ _ O
hum _ _ O
with _ _ O
red _ _ B-FOOD
curry _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
chiles, _ _ B-FOOD
or _ _ O
may _ _ O
present _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
sweet, _ _ O
inert _ _ O
blob. _ _ O
A _ _ O
more _ _ O
promising _ _ O
opening _ _ O
move, _ _ O
and _ _ O
one _ _ O
that _ _ O
will _ _ O
help _ _ O
place _ _ O
Cédric _ _ O
and _ _ O
Ochi _ _ O
Vongerichten's _ _ O
mental _ _ O
map _ _ O
of _ _ O
Indonesia _ _ B-LOC
in _ _ O
perspective, _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
Jimbaran-style _ _ B-DISH
clams. _ _ I-DISH
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
likely _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
stirred _ _ O
by _ _ O
generations _ _ O
of _ _ O
sainted _ _ O
grandmothers _ _ O
since _ _ O
the _ _ O
dawn _ _ O
of _ _ O
time. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is, _ _ O
in _ _ O
fact, _ _ O
a _ _ O
specialty _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
seafood _ _ B-FOOD
vendors _ _ O
who _ _ O
sprang _ _ O
up _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
stretch _ _ O
of _ _ O
Balinese _ _ O
beach _ _ O
where _ _ O
resorts _ _ O
first _ _ O
began _ _ O
to _ _ O
appear _ _ O
sometime _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
birth _ _ O
of _ _ O
Taylor _ _ O
Swift. _ _ O
Littlenecks, _ _ B-FOOD
flavored _ _ O
with _ _ O
soy _ _ B-FOOD
sauce _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
garlic _ _ B-FOOD
paste, _ _ I-FOOD
are _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
under _ _ O
flakes _ _ O
of _ _ O
coconut, _ _ B-FOOD
which _ _ O
form _ _ O
the _ _ O
golden _ _ O
crust _ _ O
that _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
provided _ _ O
by _ _ O
bread _ _ B-FOOD
crumbs _ _ I-FOOD
if _ _ O
these _ _ O
were _ _ O
clams _ _ B-DISH
oreganata. _ _ I-DISH
A _ _ O
slice _ _ O
of _ _ O
pickled _ _ B-FOOD
red _ _ I-FOOD
chile _ _ I-FOOD
sits _ _ O
on _ _ O
each _ _ O
one, _ _ O
waiting. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
were _ _ O
on _ _ O
vacation, _ _ O
you _ _ O
would _ _ O
order _ _ O
tray _ _ O
after _ _ O
tray _ _ O
of _ _ O
these. _ _ O
Here _ _ O
on _ _ O
Spring _ _ B-LOC
Street, _ _ I-LOC
other _ _ O
things _ _ O
will _ _ O
keep _ _ O
you _ _ O
distracted. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
hearts-of-palm _ _ B-DISH
salad, _ _ I-DISH
sweet _ _ O
and _ _ O
sour _ _ O
are _ _ O
carefully _ _ O
pitted _ _ O
against _ _ O
each _ _ O
other _ _ O
by _ _ O
means _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
mango _ _ B-FOOD
vinaigrette, _ _ I-FOOD
a _ _ O
lime-and-fish-sauce _ _ B-FOOD
dressing _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
neon _ _ O
coat _ _ O
of _ _ O
passion-fruit _ _ B-FOOD
pulp. _ _ I-FOOD
The _ _ O
crab _ _ B-DISH
cake _ _ I-DISH
is, _ _ O
despite _ _ O
its _ _ O
sweet _ _ B-FOOD
chile _ _ I-FOOD
sauce, _ _ I-FOOD
about _ _ O
as _ _ O
Indonesian _ _ B-CUISINE
as _ _ O
Betty _ _ O
White, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
and _ _ O
fluffy _ _ O
and _ _ O
not _ _ O
worth _ _ O
arguing _ _ O
about. _ _ O
Wayan's _ _ B-EST
rendition _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
street _ _ O
snack _ _ O
bakwan _ _ B-DISH

a _ _ O
golden _ _ O
agglomeration _ _ O
of _ _ O
corn _ _ B-FOOD
kernels _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
shallots _ _ B-FOOD
fried _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
flat, _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
disc. _ _ O
There _ _ O
had _ _ O
better _ _ O
be _ _ O
nasi _ _ B-DISH

at _ _ O
any _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
even _ _ O
playing _ _ O
at _ _ O
being _ _ O
Indonesian. _ _ B-CUISINE
There _ _ O
is, _ _ O
the _ _ O
rice _ _ B-FOOD
fried _ _ O
just _ _ O
until _ _ O
it _ _ O
crackles _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
between _ _ O
your _ _ O
teeth. _ _ O
It _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
gentle _ _ O
but _ _ O
genuine _ _ O
spice _ _ O
undercurrent _ _ O
that _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
welcome _ _ O
in _ _ O
more _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooking. _ _ O
Of _ _ O
course _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
gado _ _ B-DISH
gado, _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
this _ _ O
being _ _ O
2019, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course _ _ O
the _ _ O
main _ _ O
ingredient _ _ O
is _ _ O
avocado; _ _ B-FOOD
the _ _ O
hard-cooked _ _ O
eggs _ _ B-FOOD
belong _ _ O
to _ _ O
quail. _ _ O
This _ _ O
time _ _ O
the _ _ O
peanut _ _ B-FOOD
dressing _ _ I-FOOD
isn't _ _ O
cloying _ _ O
or _ _ O
clumpy. _ _ O
As _ _ O
the _ _ O
plates _ _ O
get _ _ O
larger, _ _ O
few _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
really _ _ O
come _ _ O
forward _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
knockout _ _ O
that _ _ O
everybody _ _ O
will _ _ O
talk _ _ O
about _ _ O
later. _ _ O
The _ _ O
closest _ _ O
contender _ _ O
must _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
lobster _ _ B-DISH
and _ _ I-DISH
basil _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
wavy _ _ I-DISH
noodles _ _ I-DISH
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
containing, _ _ O
among _ _ O
other _ _ O
things, _ _ O
sweet _ _ B-FOOD
soy _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
melted _ _ B-FOOD
butter _ _ I-FOOD
-- _ _ O
a _ _ O
combination _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
senior _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Vongerichten _ _ O
has _ _ O
used _ _ O
so _ _ O
successfully _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
his _ _ O
son's _ _ O
inheritance. _ _ O
Should _ _ O
the _ _ O
calamansi _ _ B-FOOD
vinaigrette _ _ I-FOOD
poured _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
steamed _ _ B-DISH
black _ _ I-DISH
sea _ _ I-DISH
bass _ _ I-DISH
be _ _ O
more _ _ O
sour _ _ O
and _ _ O
spicy? _ _ O
Probably. _ _ O
But _ _ O
if _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
few _ _ O
stars _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
table, _ _ O
the _ _ O
contrast _ _ O
of _ _ O
flavors, _ _ O
colors, _ _ O
textures _ _ O
and _ _ O
techniques _ _ O
makes _ _ O
the _ _ O
meal _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
memorable _ _ O
ensemble _ _ O
piece. _ _ O
The _ _ O
drumsticks _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
yellow _ _ B-DISH
chicken _ _ I-DISH
are _ _ O
crunchy, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
thighs _ _ B-FOOD
are _ _ O
tender; _ _ O
both _ _ O
are _ _ O
mellow _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
yellow _ _ B-FOOD
curry _ _ I-FOOD
seasoned _ _ O
by _ _ O
lemongrass _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
ginger. _ _ B-FOOD
The _ _ O
tomato-chile _ _ B-FOOD
sambal _ _ I-FOOD
pressed _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
surface _ _ O
of _ _ O
cod _ _ B-DISH
"bilindango" _ _ I-DISH
is _ _ O
potent _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
carry _ _ O
over _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
spears _ _ O
of _ _ O
asparagus _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
fiddlehead _ _ B-FOOD
ferns _ _ I-FOOD
sprawled _ _ O
alongside. _ _ O
All _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
looks _ _ O
very _ _ O
come-hither _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room, _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
Rockwell _ _ O
Group _ _ O
has _ _ O
abandoned _ _ O
stadium-size _ _ O
props, _ _ O
building _ _ O
atmospheric _ _ O
effects _ _ O
instead _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
contrasting _ _ O
textures _ _ O
and _ _ O
light _ _ O
values _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
movement _ _ O
of _ _ O
shadows. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
visual _ _ O
language _ _ O
of _ _ O
expensive _ _ O
tropical _ _ O
resorts, _ _ O
and _ _ O
Wayan _ _ B-EST
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
give _ _ O
people _ _ O
the _ _ O
feeling _ _ O
they're _ _ O
on _ _ O
vacation. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
necessarily _ _ O
a _ _ O
loud _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
but _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
are _ _ O
a _ _ O
loud _ _ O
people, _ _ O
and _ _ O
around _ _ O
10 _ _ O
the _ _ O
noise _ _ O
can _ _ O
start _ _ O
to _ _ O
press _ _ O
down. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
good _ _ O
time _ _ O
to _ _ O
call _ _ O
for _ _ O
dessert. _ _ O
The _ _ O
purple-yam _ _ B-DISH
ice _ _ I-DISH
cream _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
banana _ _ I-DISH
cake _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ I-DISH
caramelized _ _ I-DISH
bananas _ _ I-DISH
is _ _ O
good _ _ O
if _ _ O
sundaes _ _ B-FOOD
are _ _ O
your _ _ O
thing. _ _ O
The _ _ O
pandan _ _ B-DISH
custard _ _ I-DISH
under _ _ I-DISH
passion-fruit _ _ I-DISH
pulp _ _ I-DISH
gets _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
mileage _ _ O
from _ _ O
just _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
flavors. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
that _ _ O
sounds _ _ O
too _ _ O
boring _ _ O
to _ _ O
bother _ _ O
with _ _ O
("assorted _ _ B-DISH
exotic _ _ I-DISH
fruit?") _ _ I-DISH
is _ _ O
worth _ _ O
a _ _ O
second _ _ O
look. _ _ O
Lychee, _ _ B-FOOD
mango, _ _ B-FOOD
pineapple _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
dragon _ _ B-FOOD
fruit _ _ I-FOOD
may _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
exotic, _ _ O
but _ _ O
a _ _ O
dip _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
dunk _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark, _ _ O
spicy _ _ B-FOOD
syrup _ _ I-FOOD

It _ _ O
is _ _ O
true _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
bacalaitos _ _ B-DISH
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
Freakin _ _ B-EST
Rican _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
Astoria, _ _ B-LOC
Queens, _ _ I-LOC
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
quite _ _ O
as _ _ O
big _ _ O
around _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
ones _ _ O
you _ _ O
will _ _ O
see _ _ O
browning _ _ O
in _ _ O
veritable _ _ O
caldrons _ _ O
of _ _ O
oil _ _ O
over _ _ O
wood _ _ O
fires _ _ O
at _ _ O
kiosks _ _ O
scattered _ _ O
along _ _ O
the _ _ O
beach _ _ O
road _ _ O
in _ _ O
Piñones, _ _ B-LOC
outside _ _ O
San _ _ B-LOC
Juan. _ _ I-LOC
These _ _ O
flattened _ _ B-DISH
cod _ _ I-DISH
fritters _ _ I-DISH
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
of _ _ O
pie _ _ O
plates _ _ O
in _ _ O
Puerto _ _ B-LOC
Rico, _ _ I-LOC
while _ _ O
in _ _ O
Queens _ _ B-LOC
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
roughly _ _ O
the _ _ O
diameter _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
coffee _ _ O
can. _ _ O
Dimensions _ _ O
aside, _ _ O
they _ _ O
give _ _ O
off _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
right _ _ O
signals. _ _ O
They _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
corn _ _ B-FOOD
muffin, _ _ I-FOOD
with _ _ O
green _ _ O
specks _ _ O
of _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
cilantro _ _ B-FOOD
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
surface _ _ O
that _ _ O
let _ _ O
you _ _ O
know _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
Goya's _ _ B-FOOD
mix. _ _ I-FOOD
They _ _ O
don't _ _ O
leave _ _ O
your _ _ O
fingertips _ _ O
entirely _ _ O
free _ _ O
of _ _ O
grease, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
come _ _ O
close. _ _ O
They _ _ O
have _ _ O
an _ _ O
exterior _ _ O
crunch _ _ O
that _ _ O
surrenders _ _ O
quickly _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
firm, _ _ O
chewy _ _ O
interior _ _ O
of _ _ O
mashed _ _ B-FOOD
salt _ _ I-FOOD
cod; _ _ I-FOOD
the _ _ O
texture _ _ O
is _ _ O
less _ _ O

You _ _ O
could _ _ O
start _ _ O
to _ _ O
build _ _ O
a _ _ O
business _ _ O
around _ _ O
bacalaitos _ _ O
like _ _ O
these. _ _ O
That, _ _ O
in _ _ O
fact, _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
Derick _ _ O
López's _ _ O
plan _ _ O
for _ _ O
some _ _ O
time _ _ O
now. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
López, _ _ O
who _ _ O
was _ _ O
born _ _ O
in _ _ O
Puerto _ _ O
Rico _ _ O
and _ _ O
raised _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
South _ _ O
Bronx, _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
Freakin _ _ O
Rican's _ _ O
chef _ _ O
and, _ _ O
with _ _ O
his _ _ O
husband, _ _ O
Victor _ _ O
Vargas, _ _ O
its _ _ O
owner. _ _ O
About _ _ O
four _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
armed _ _ O
with _ _ O
picnic _ _ O
coolers _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
couple _ _ O
of _ _ O
folding _ _ O
tables, _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O
men _ _ O
began _ _ O
selling _ _ O
a _ _ O
short _ _ O
menu _ _ O
of _ _ O
Puerto _ _ O
Rican _ _ O
staples _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
street _ _ O
fairs _ _ O
that _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
infiltrate _ _ O
a _ _ O
different _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
thoroughfare _ _ O
each _ _ O
weekend. _ _ O
As _ _ O
they _ _ O
promoted _ _ O
the _ _ O
Freakin _ _ O
Rican _ _ O
catering _ _ O
operation, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Freakin _ _ O
Rican _ _ O
product _ _ O
line, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Freakin _ _ O
Rican _ _ O
Facebook _ _ O
page _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
Freakin _ _ O
Rican _ _ O
YouTube _ _ O
channel, _ _ O
they _ _ O
saved _ _ O
their _ _ O
earnings _ _ O
so _ _ O
they _ _ O
could _ _ O
found _ _ O
the _ _ O
Freakin _ _ O
Rican _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
After _ _ O
a _ _ O
false _ _ O
start _ _ O
in _ _ O
another _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
Queens, _ _ O
it _ _ O
opened _ _ O
a _ _ O
short _ _ O
distance _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
Museum _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Moving _ _ O
Image _ _ O
one _ _ O
year _ _ O
ago _ _ O
this _ _ O
month. _ _ O
The _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
has _ _ O
19 _ _ O
seats. _ _ O
The _ _ O
banana-plant _ _ O
wallpaper _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
left _ _ O
wall _ _ O
is _ _ O
reflected _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
mirrors _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
right. _ _ O
In _ _ O
between _ _ O
are _ _ O
some _ _ O
metal _ _ O
chickens _ _ O
and _ _ O
bright-green _ _ O
figurines _ _ O
of _ _ O
coquís, _ _ O
the _ _ O
little _ _ O
frogs _ _ O
that _ _ O
chirp _ _ O
from _ _ O
every _ _ O
Puerto _ _ O
Rican _ _ O
tree. _ _ O
Diners _ _ O

on _ _ O
tropical-fruit _ _ O
shakes _ _ O
or _ _ O
bottles _ _ O
of _ _ O
Kola _ _ O
Champagne, _ _ O
Coco _ _ O

and _ _ O
Malta _ _ O
India, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Harry, _ _ O
Ron _ _ O
and _ _ O
Hermione _ _ O
of _ _ O
Puerto _ _ O
Rican _ _ O
soft _ _ O
drinks. _ _ O
Héctor _ _ O
Lavoe _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
playing _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
speakers, _ _ O
or _ _ O
Víctor _ _ O
Manuelle, _ _ O
not _ _ O
so _ _ O
loudly _ _ O
that _ _ O
they _ _ O
can't _ _ O
be _ _ O
drowned _ _ O
out _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
sounds _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
employees _ _ O
singing _ _ O
"Happy _ _ O
Birthday" _ _ O
while _ _ O
wielding _ _ O
a _ _ O
tambourine _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
pair _ _ O
of _ _ O
maracas. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
spent _ _ O
any _ _ O
time _ _ O
at _ _ O
all _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
trail _ _ O
of _ _ O
chicharrones, _ _ O
mofongo, _ _ O
sancocho _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
wonders _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Puerto _ _ O
Rican _ _ O
kitchen, _ _ O
you _ _ O
know _ _ O
that _ _ O
Astoria _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
a _ _ O
primary _ _ O
hunting _ _ O
ground _ _ O
for _ _ O
any _ _ O
of _ _ O
them. _ _ O
You _ _ O
also _ _ O
know, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
that _ _ O
blinking-light _ _ O
cuchifritos _ _ O
parlors _ _ O
and _ _ O
family-run _ _ O
cocina _ _ O
criolla _ _ O
luncheonettes _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
disappearing _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
Bronx, _ _ O
East _ _ O
Harlem _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
Lower _ _ O
East _ _ O
Side _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
few _ _ O
decades, _ _ O
along _ _ O
with _ _ O
many _ _ O
of _ _ O
their _ _ O
customers. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Puerto _ _ O
Rican _ _ O
population _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
peaked _ _ O
around _ _ O
1990, _ _ O
when _ _ O
residents _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
old _ _ O
barrios _ _ O
began _ _ O
to _ _ O
flow _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
suburbs _ _ O
in _ _ O
large _ _ O
numbers, _ _ O
according _ _ O
to _ _ O
Laird _ _ O
W. _ _ O
Bergad _ _ O
, _ _ O
the _ _ O
director _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Center _ _ O
for _ _ O
Latin _ _ O
American, _ _ O
Caribbean _ _ O
and _ _ O
Latino _ _ O
Studies _ _ O
at _ _ O
City _ _ O
University _ _ O
of _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
Graduate _ _ O
Center. _ _ O
Beacons _ _ O
of _ _ O
Puerto _ _ O
Rican _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
still _ _ O
survive; _ _ O
Casa _ _ O
Adela, _ _ O
for _ _ O
instance, _ _ O
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
busily _ _ O
dispensing _ _ O
chickens _ _ O
from _ _ O
its _ _ O
venerable _ _ O
lemon-yellow _ _ O
rotisserie _ _ O
on _ _ O
Avenue _ _ O
C, _ _ O
despite _ _ O
the _ _ O
death _ _ O
last _ _ O
year _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
founder, _ _ O
Adela _ _ O
Fargas. _ _ O
But _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
so _ _ O
many _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O
places _ _ O
left _ _ O
that _ _ O
we _ _ O
can _ _ O
take _ _ O
an _ _ O
unlimited _ _ O
supply _ _ O
of _ _ O
tostones _ _ O
and _ _ O
mojo _ _ O
de _ _ O
ajo _ _ O
for _ _ O
granted, _ _ O
either. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Freakin _ _ O
Rican _ _ O
developed _ _ O
its _ _ O
act _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
street-fair _ _ O
circuit, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
applied _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
tactics _ _ O
that _ _ O
succeed _ _ O
at _ _ O
Smorgasburg _ _ O
and _ _ O
similar _ _ O
urban _ _ O
foraging _ _ O
grounds, _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
ideal _ _ O
dish _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
held _ _ O
in _ _ O
one _ _ O
hand, _ _ O
gets _ _ O
immediate _ _ O
attention, _ _ O
costs _ _ O
under _ _ O
$10 _ _ O
and _ _ O
can _ _ O
serve _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
plank _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
branding _ _ O
platform. _ _ O
This _ _ O
may _ _ O
explain _ _ O
why _ _ O
appetizers _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
strong _ _ O
suit _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
Freakin _ _ O
Rican _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
The _ _ O
sorullitos, _ _ O
Puerto _ _ O
Rico's _ _ O
answer _ _ O
to _ _ O
hush _ _ O
puppies, _ _ O
are _ _ O
an _ _ O
exception; _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
dense _ _ O
and _ _ O
dry, _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
cornmeal _ _ O
hadn't _ _ O
absorbed _ _ O
enough _ _ O
water. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
López's _ _ O
alcapurrias, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
are _ _ O
very _ _ O
good, _ _ O
even _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
picadillo _ _ O
that _ _ O
runs _ _ O
down _ _ O
the _ _ O
middle _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
tube _ _ O
of _ _ O
mashed _ _ O
fried _ _ O
plantains _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
graphite _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
pencil _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
more _ _ O
forcefully. _ _ O
And _ _ O
his _ _ O
pasteles _ _ O
are _ _ O
exceptional. _ _ O
Pasteles _ _ O
are _ _ O
structured _ _ O
like _ _ O
tamales. _ _ O
Where _ _ O
the _ _ O
masa _ _ O
would _ _ O
be, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
López _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
sweet, _ _ O
enjoyably _ _ O
gummy _ _ O
mash _ _ O
of _ _ O
green _ _ O
plantains, _ _ O
taro _ _ O
root _ _ O
and _ _ O
kabocha _ _ O
squash. _ _ O
The _ _ O
filling _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
soft, _ _ O
rich _ _ O
vein _ _ O
of _ _ O
stewed _ _ O
pork _ _ O
shoulder _ _ O
with _ _ O
ham, _ _ O
bacon, _ _ O
red _ _ O
peppers _ _ O
and _ _ O
green _ _ O
olives. _ _ O
Rolled _ _ O
up _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
banana _ _ O
leaf, _ _ O
these _ _ O
pasteles _ _ O
probably _ _ O
deserve _ _ O
their _ _ O
own _ _ O
float _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Puerto _ _ O
Rican _ _ O
Day _ _ O
Parade. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
López _ _ O
fries _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
in _ _ O
two _ _ O
styles. _ _ O
One, _ _ O
the _ _ O
chicharrones _ _ O
de _ _ O
pollo, _ _ O
is _ _ O
traditional. _ _ O
The _ _ O
other, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Freakin _ _ O
Crispy _ _ O
Wings, _ _ O
is _ _ O
not. _ _ O
Each _ _ O
has _ _ O
its _ _ O
rewards. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chicharrones, _ _ O
hacked _ _ O
into _ _ O
three-bite _ _ O
hunks, _ _ O
taste _ _ O
of _ _ O
cider _ _ O
vinegar _ _ O
and _ _ O
garlic _ _ O
powder _ _ O
and _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
smooth, _ _ O
achiote-tinted _ _ O
buttermilk _ _ O
crust _ _ O
that _ _ O
breaks _ _ O
open _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
pleasing _ _ O
crackle. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Freakin _ _ O
Crispy _ _ O
Wings _ _ O
are _ _ O
spicier, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
shell _ _ O
is _ _ O
thicker _ _ O
and _ _ O
more _ _ O
deeply _ _ O
crevassed. _ _ O
These _ _ O
wings _ _ O
may _ _ O
owe _ _ O
more _ _ O
to _ _ O
Atlanta _ _ O
than _ _ O
to _ _ O
Mayagüez, _ _ O
although _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
get _ _ O
them _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
guava _ _ O
barbecue _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
that's _ _ O
reasonably _ _ O
tropical. _ _ O
Leave _ _ O
behind _ _ O
these _ _ O
appetizers, _ _ O
the _ _ O
core _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
street-fair _ _ O
business, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
can _ _ O
start _ _ O
to _ _ O
appear _ _ O
unsteady. _ _ O
At _ _ O
dinner, _ _ O
the _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses _ _ O
tend _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
fairly _ _ O
plain _ _ O
fried _ _ O
or _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
meat. _ _ O
Grilled _ _ O
pork _ _ O
chops _ _ O
splashed _ _ O
with _ _ O
mojo _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
dry _ _ O
and _ _ O
dull, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
breasts _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
much _ _ O
more _ _ O
interesting. _ _ O
Baked _ _ O
pork _ _ O
ribs _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
barbecue _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
are _ _ O
tender _ _ O
enough, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
aren't _ _ O
very _ _ O
persuasive. _ _ O
On _ _ O
several _ _ O
nights, _ _ O
I _ _ O
found _ _ O
myself _ _ O
gazing _ _ O
longingly _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
lunch _ _ O
specials _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
back _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu, _ _ O
wondering _ _ O
why _ _ O
I _ _ O
couldn't _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
brick _ _ O
of _ _ O
pastelón _ _ O
for _ _ O
dinner. _ _ O
(I _ _ O
came _ _ O
back _ _ O
for _ _ O
it _ _ O
one _ _ O
Thursday _ _ O
afternoon, _ _ O
and _ _ O
was _ _ O
glad _ _ O
I _ _ O
did.) _ _ O
Until _ _ O
more _ _ O
long-cooked _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
like _ _ O
it _ _ O
appear _ _ O
at _ _ O
dinnertime, _ _ O
consider _ _ O
a _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
sancocho. _ _ O
Listed _ _ O
as _ _ O
"vegetable _ _ O
root _ _ O
soup" _ _ O
for _ _ O
$7, _ _ O
it _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
sound _ _ O
like _ _ O
much _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
meal. _ _ O
But _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
grab _ _ O
bag _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
stew _ _ O
with _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
two _ _ O
kinds _ _ O
of _ _ O
meat, _ _ O
great _ _ O
hunks _ _ O
of _ _ O
taro _ _ O
and _ _ O
yuca, _ _ O
a _ _ O
couple _ _ O
of _ _ O
inches _ _ O
of _ _ O
corn _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
cob _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
magical _ _ O
squash _ _ O
broth _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
the _ _ O
consistency _ _ O
of _ _ O
heavy _ _ O
cream _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
very _ _ O
ripe _ _ O
mango. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
unlikely _ _ O
event _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
finish _ _ O
it _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
rice _ _ O
that _ _ O
comes _ _ O
with _ _ O
it _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
cry _ _ O
out _ _ O
for _ _ O
more, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Freakin _ _ O
Rican _ _ O
has _ _ O
just _ _ O
the _ _ O
thing _ _ O
for _ _ O
you: _ _ O
mofongo. _ _ O
A _ _ O
dome _ _ O
of _ _ O
mashed _ _ O
plantains _ _ O
possessed _ _ O
by _ _ O
garlic, _ _ O
the _ _ O
mofongo _ _ O
is _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
to _ _ O
order _ _ O
to _ _ O
keep _ _ O
the _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
bits _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole _ _ O
thing _ _ O
from _ _ O
getting _ _ O
boggy. _ _ O
You _ _ O
can _ _ O
have _ _ O
it _ _ O
with _ _ O
chicharrones _ _ O
or _ _ O
sliced _ _ O
roast _ _ O
pork, _ _ O
which _ _ O
leaves _ _ O
behind _ _ O
a _ _ O
happy _ _ O
impression _ _ O
of _ _ O
garlic, _ _ O
oregano _ _ O
and _ _ O
salt. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
come _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
birthday, _ _ O
a _ _ O

stuck _ _ O
in _ _ O

tres _ _ O
leches _ _ O
cake _ _ O
is _ _ O
probably _ _ O
in _ _ O
your _ _ O
future. _ _ O
If _ _ O
not, _ _ O

More _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
year _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
verge _ _ O
of _ _ O
reviewing _ _ O
Del _ _ B-EST
Posto _ _ I-EST
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
news _ _ O
intervened. _ _ O
The _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
had _ _ O
changed _ _ O
significantly _ _ O
since _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
time _ _ O
it _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
evaluated _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
Times _ _ O
critic: _ _ O
Sam _ _ O
Sifton _ _ O
promoted _ _ O
it _ _ O
from _ _ O
three _ _ O
stars _ _ O
to _ _ O
four _ _ O
in _ _ O
2010, _ _ O
when _ _ O
Mark _ _ O
Ladner _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
executive _ _ O
chef _ _ O
and _ _ O
Brooks _ _ O
Headley _ _ O
was _ _ O
running _ _ O
the _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
kitchen. _ _ O
First, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Headley _ _ O
had _ _ O
quit _ _ O
this _ _ O
stately, _ _ O
expensive _ _ O
Italian _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
Chelsea _ _ B-LOC
so _ _ O
he _ _ O
could _ _ O
sell _ _ O
fast, _ _ O
cheap _ _ O
vegetarian _ _ B-DIET
burgers _ _ B-FOOD
. _ _ O
Next, _ _ O
Del _ _ B-EST
Posto _ _ I-EST
had _ _ O
spent _ _ O
about _ _ O
$1 _ _ O
million _ _ O
on _ _ O
crystal _ _ O
candle _ _ O
vases, _ _ O
white _ _ O
leather _ _ O
chairs _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
luxurious _ _ O
fittings _ _ O
that _ _ O
made _ _ O
it _ _ O
even _ _ O
more _ _ O
stately _ _ O
and _ _ O
expensive. _ _ O
Finally, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Ladner _ _ O
had _ _ O
left _ _ O
to _ _ O
sell _ _ O
fast, _ _ O
cheap _ _ O
pasta. _ _ B-FOOD
A _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
review _ _ O
was _ _ O
clearly _ _ O
in _ _ O
order. _ _ O
Before _ _ O
I _ _ O
could _ _ O
write _ _ O
it, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
a _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
women _ _ O
who _ _ O
had _ _ O
worked _ _ O
for _ _ O
Mario _ _ O
Batali, _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
owners, _ _ O
started _ _ O
talking _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
sexual _ _ O
harassment _ _ O
and _ _ O
abuse _ _ O
that _ _ O
they _ _ O
say _ _ O
he _ _ O
had _ _ O
doled _ _ O
out. _ _ O
Suddenly _ _ O
there _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
more _ _ O
important _ _ O
questions _ _ O
than _ _ O
whether _ _ O
the _ _ O
braised-rabbit _ _ O
agnolotti _ _ O
were _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
al _ _ O
dente. _ _ O
Negotiations _ _ O
took _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
year, _ _ O
but _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Batali _ _ O
no _ _ O
longer _ _ O
profits _ _ O
from _ _ O
Del _ _ O
Posto, _ _ O
having _ _ O
sold _ _ O
his _ _ O
stake _ _ O
in _ _ O
March _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
group _ _ O
led _ _ O
by _ _ O
his _ _ O
former _ _ O
partner, _ _ O
Joe _ _ O
Bastianich _ _ O
. _ _ O
Employees _ _ O
have _ _ O
said _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Bastianich _ _ O
himself _ _ O
helped, _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
minimum, _ _ O
to _ _ O
build _ _ O
the _ _ O
sexist _ _ O
and _ _ O
disrespectful _ _ O
environment _ _ O
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Batali _ _ O
operated. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Bastianich _ _ O
has _ _ O
apologized, _ _ O
saying _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
had _ _ O
heard _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Batali _ _ O
speak _ _ O
inappropriately _ _ O
to _ _ O
employees, _ _ O
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
should _ _ O
have _ _ O
done _ _ O
more _ _ O
to _ _ O
stop _ _ O
the _ _ O
sexual _ _ O
harassment. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
diners _ _ O
will _ _ O
stay _ _ O
away, _ _ O
feeling _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Bastianich _ _ O
has _ _ O
not _ _ O
sufficiently _ _ O
atoned. _ _ O
I _ _ O
understand _ _ O
this, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
am _ _ O
also _ _ O
interested _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
employees _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
treated _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
now _ _ O
and _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
future. _ _ O
Here, _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
reason _ _ O
to _ _ O
hope. _ _ O
Among _ _ O
other _ _ O
human-resources _ _ O
reforms, _ _ O
employees _ _ O
can _ _ O
now _ _ O
report _ _ O
complaints _ _ O
about _ _ O
owners _ _ O
or _ _ O
corporate _ _ O
officers _ _ O
to _ _ O
an _ _ O
independent _ _ O
investigative _ _ O
firm _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
power _ _ O
to _ _ O
refer _ _ O
cases _ _ O
to _ _ O
outside _ _ O
counsel. _ _ O
As _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
restructuring, _ _ O
Melissa _ _ O
Rodriguez, _ _ O
who _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
the _ _ O
executive _ _ O
chef _ _ O
of _ _ O
Del _ _ O
Posto _ _ O
since _ _ O
2017, _ _ O
was _ _ O
made _ _ O
a _ _ O
partner _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
along _ _ O
with _ _ O
Jeff _ _ O
Katz, _ _ O
now _ _ O
the _ _ O
managing _ _ O
partner. _ _ O
A _ _ O
new _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Georgia _ _ O
Wodder, _ _ O
was _ _ O
appointed _ _ O
last _ _ O
spring. _ _ O
Del _ _ O
Posto _ _ O
is, _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
possible _ _ O
exception _ _ O
of _ _ O
Aquavit _ _ O
, _ _ O
the _ _ O
grandest _ _ O
and _ _ O
most _ _ O
expensive _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
where _ _ O
women _ _ O
are _ _ O
in _ _ O
charge _ _ O
of _ _ O
everything _ _ O
you _ _ O
eat, _ _ O
starting _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
miniature _ _ O
saffron _ _ O
waffle _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
cannoli _ _ O
and _ _ O
stuffed _ _ O
at _ _ O
one _ _ O
tiny _ _ O
end _ _ O
with _ _ O
taleggio _ _ O
and _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
with _ _ O
fennel _ _ O
pesto, _ _ O
and _ _ O
ending _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
prosecco _ _ O
marshmallow _ _ O
tucked _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
wooden _ _ O
drawer _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
custom-made _ _ O
cheese _ _ O
grater. _ _ O
The _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
subdued _ _ O
now. _ _ O
The _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
seen _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
beacon _ _ O
of _ _ O
innovation _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
it _ _ O
used _ _ O
to _ _ O
be, _ _ O
perhaps _ _ O
because _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Rodriguez _ _ O
is _ _ O
less _ _ O
interested _ _ O
than _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Ladner _ _ O
was _ _ O
in _ _ O
feats _ _ O
of _ _ O
technical _ _ O
derring-do _ _ O
like _ _ O
100-layer _ _ O
lasagnas _ _ O
. _ _ O
She _ _ O
gets _ _ O
her _ _ O
effects _ _ O
by _ _ O
following _ _ O
old _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
templates _ _ O
and _ _ O
putting _ _ O
them _ _ O
together _ _ O
so _ _ O
elegantly _ _ O
that _ _ O
they _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
light _ _ O
up _ _ O
from _ _ O
inside. _ _ O
There's _ _ O
an _ _ O
honesty _ _ O
to _ _ O
her _ _ O
approach _ _ O
-- _ _ O
she _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
try _ _ O
to _ _ O
shoot _ _ O
out _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
lights _ _ O
by _ _ O
supercharging _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
with _ _ O
fat _ _ O
-- _ _ O
but _ _ O
it's _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
peasant _ _ O
simplicity _ _ O
people _ _ O
usually _ _ O
mean _ _ O
when _ _ O
they _ _ O
talk _ _ O
about _ _ O
honesty _ _ O
in _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
food. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
a _ _ O
sophisticated _ _ O
honesty. _ _ O
You _ _ O
know _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
cacciatore, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Rodriguez's _ _ O
version _ _ O
is _ _ O
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
guinea _ _ O
hen _ _ O
breast, _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
until _ _ O
the _ _ O
skin _ _ O
crackles _ _ O
like _ _ O
parchment. _ _ O
What _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
body _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
stew _ _ O
is _ _ O
now _ _ O
a _ _ O
sauce; _ _ O
the _ _ O
tomato, _ _ O
celery _ _ O
and _ _ O
onion _ _ O
in _ _ O
it _ _ O
come _ _ O
through _ _ O
distinctly. _ _ O
Occupying _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
sidecar _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
pressed _ _ O
puck _ _ O
of _ _ O
braised _ _ O
leg _ _ O
meat _ _ O
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
single, _ _ O
Roman-style _ _ O
gnocco, _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
featherbed _ _ O
of _ _ O
semolina _ _ O
held _ _ O
together _ _ O
by _ _ O
eggs, _ _ O
milk _ _ O
and _ _ O
cheese. _ _ O
One _ _ O
side _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
broiled _ _ O
so _ _ O
hard _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
burned, _ _ O
which _ _ O
seems _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
mistake _ _ O
at _ _ O
first, _ _ O
but _ _ O
turns _ _ O
out _ _ O
to _ _ O
supply _ _ O
the _ _ O
bit _ _ O
of _ _ O
campfire _ _ O
that _ _ O
this _ _ O
hunter's _ _ O
stew _ _ O
needs. _ _ O
It _ _ O
has _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
far _ _ O
more _ _ O
complicated _ _ O
to _ _ O
prepare _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
cacciatore _ _ O
at _ _ O
your _ _ O
neighborhood _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
seems _ _ O
simpler, _ _ O
pared _ _ O
to _ _ O
essentials, _ _ O
and _ _ O
wonderful _ _ O
in _ _ O
every _ _ O
bite. _ _ O
I've _ _ O
never _ _ O
seen _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
wring _ _ O
as _ _ O
much _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
salsify _ _ O
as _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Rodriguez _ _ O
does. _ _ O
Sliced _ _ O
transparently _ _ O
thin _ _ O
and _ _ O
fried, _ _ O
it _ _ O
makes _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
brown _ _ O
chips _ _ O
about _ _ O
half _ _ O
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
M&M. _ _ O
These _ _ O
decorate _ _ O
the _ _ O
top _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
grilled-salsify _ _ O
pudding _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
the _ _ O
refreshing _ _ O
bittersweetness _ _ O
of _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
those _ _ O
plant-based _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
aperitifs. _ _ O
If _ _ O
it _ _ O
were _ _ O
not _ _ O
garnished _ _ O
with _ _ O
streaky _ _ O
leaves _ _ O
of _ _ O
radicchio, _ _ O
it _ _ O
could _ _ O
pass _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
dessert. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu _ _ O
structure _ _ O
has _ _ O
not _ _ O
changed, _ _ O
although _ _ O
the _ _ O
prices _ _ O
have. _ _ O
Everything _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
had _ _ O
à _ _ O
la _ _ O
carte. _ _ O
Lunch _ _ O
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
a _ _ O
relative _ _ O
bargain, _ _ O
though _ _ O
the _ _ O
price _ _ O
has _ _ O
shimmied _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
$59 _ _ O
for _ _ O
three _ _ O
courses. _ _ O
For _ _ O
a _ _ O
blowout _ _ O
$194 _ _ O
dinner, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Captain's _ _ O
Menu _ _ O
yields _ _ O
eight _ _ O
courses _ _ O
or _ _ O
so. _ _ O
Most _ _ O
people, _ _ O
however, _ _ O
go _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
$164, _ _ O
five-course _ _ O
Menu _ _ O
del _ _ O
Posto. _ _ O
The _ _ O
primary _ _ O
argument _ _ O
in _ _ O
favor _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
strategy _ _ O
is, _ _ O
to _ _ O
me, _ _ O
an _ _ O
overwhelming _ _ O
one: _ _ O
Two _ _ O
of _ _ O
those _ _ O
five _ _ O
courses _ _ O
are _ _ O
pasta. _ _ O
Del _ _ O
Posto's _ _ O
pastas _ _ O
are _ _ O
worth _ _ O
doubling _ _ O
up _ _ O
on. _ _ O
They _ _ O
can _ _ O
come _ _ O
in _ _ O
many _ _ O
forms. _ _ O
Delicate _ _ O
conical _ _ O
tortellini _ _ O
have _ _ O
hidden _ _ O
pockets _ _ O
of _ _ O
nettles _ _ O
and _ _ O
spring _ _ O
peas; _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
half-submerged _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
light _ _ O
spring-vegetable _ _ O
brodo _ _ O
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
Parmigiano-Reggiano _ _ O
rinds _ _ O
once _ _ O
bobbed _ _ O
like _ _ O
bay _ _ O
leaves. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
spring _ _ O
minestrone. _ _ O
A _ _ O
single, _ _ O
plate-spanning _ _ O
raviolo, _ _ O
called _ _ O
a _ _ O
fazzoletto, _ _ O
is _ _ O
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
poached _ _ O
mussels _ _ O
and _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
spinach _ _ O
and _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
herbs _ _ O
-- _ _ O
not _ _ O
a _ _ O
lawnmower-mulch _ _ O
of _ _ O
greenery _ _ O
but _ _ O
a _ _ O
layer _ _ O
of _ _ O
emulsion _ _ O
as _ _ O
thin _ _ O
and _ _ O
velvety _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
dough _ _ O
that _ _ O
envelops _ _ O
it. _ _ O
The _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
of _ _ O
mussel _ _ O
juices, _ _ O
white _ _ O
wine, _ _ O
butter _ _ O
and _ _ O
saffron _ _ O
makes _ _ O
this _ _ O
the _ _ O
only _ _ O
convincing _ _ O
mussel _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
I've _ _ O
ever _ _ O
had. _ _ O
The _ _ O
range _ _ O
of _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Wodder _ _ O
commands _ _ O
in _ _ O
her _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
seems _ _ O
unnecessarily _ _ O
limited _ _ O
to _ _ O
me, _ _ O
although _ _ O
I _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
unfairly _ _ O
comparing _ _ O
her _ _ O
desserts _ _ O
with _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Headley's, _ _ O
which _ _ O
roamed _ _ O
all _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
place. _ _ O
Individually, _ _ O
her _ _ O
desserts _ _ O
are _ _ O
soothing, _ _ O
often _ _ O
showcasing _ _ O
the _ _ O
comforts _ _ O
of _ _ O
dairy. _ _ O
More _ _ O
emphasis, _ _ O
some _ _ O
extra _ _ O
acidity _ _ O
or _ _ O
bitterness, _ _ O
might _ _ O
have _ _ O
brought _ _ O
an _ _ O
assemblage _ _ O
of _ _ O
quince _ _ O
paste, _ _ O
brown-butter _ _ O
gelato _ _ O
and _ _ O
griddled _ _ O
brioche _ _ O
into _ _ O
relief. _ _ O
But _ _ O
I _ _ O
appreciated _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
winter _ _ O
squash _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
batter _ _ O
modified _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweetness _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
olive _ _ O
oil-orange _ _ O
cake, _ _ O
and _ _ O
I _ _ O
enjoyed _ _ O
the _ _ O
moody _ _ O
sulkiness _ _ O
that _ _ O
amaro _ _ O
lent _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
citrus _ _ O
salad _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
cake. _ _ O
Del _ _ O
Posto _ _ O
has _ _ O
in _ _ O
recent _ _ O
years _ _ O
picked _ _ O
up _ _ O
a _ _ O
reputation _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
for _ _ O
one-percenters. _ _ O
It _ _ O
rarely _ _ O
gives _ _ O
that _ _ O
impression _ _ O
once _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
inside, _ _ O
where _ _ O
servers _ _ O
solemnly _ _ O
accommodate _ _ O
just _ _ O
about _ _ O
anyone. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
vegan _ _ O
menu _ _ O
at _ _ O
Del _ _ O
Posto. _ _ O
A _ _ O
vegetarian _ _ O
meal _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
put _ _ O
together _ _ O
easily, _ _ O
and _ _ O
almost _ _ O
everything _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
made _ _ O
without _ _ O
gluten, _ _ O
including _ _ O
the _ _ O
pasta. _ _ O
Yes, _ _ O
the _ _ O
stockpile _ _ O
of _ _ O
Champagnes _ _ O
includes _ _ O
some _ _ O
lock-and-key _ _ O
stuff, _ _ O
and _ _ O
should _ _ O
you _ _ O
require _ _ O
a _ _ O
Barolo _ _ O
costing _ _ O
between _ _ O
$2,000 _ _ O
and _ _ O
$4,000, _ _ O
one _ _ O
will _ _ O
quickly _ _ O
be _ _ O
added _ _ O
to _ _ O
your _ _ O
bill. _ _ O
But _ _ O
among _ _ O
the _ _ O
3,100 _ _ O
or _ _ O
so _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
labels _ _ O
superintended _ _ O
by _ _ O
Evan _ _ O
Clagnaz, _ _ O
the _ _ O
wine _ _ O
director, _ _ O
are _ _ O
more _ _ O
marked _ _ O
from _ _ O
$60 _ _ O
to _ _ O
$75 _ _ O
than _ _ O
I _ _ O
can _ _ O
count. _ _ O
Piemonte _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
place _ _ O
to _ _ O
hunt, _ _ O
and _ _ O
Friuli, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
Valle _ _ O
d'Aosta, _ _ O
for _ _ O
starters. _ _ O
Though _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
exclusively _ _ O
for _ _ O
rich _ _ O
people, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
explicitly _ _ O
for _ _ O
occasions. _ _ O
Once, _ _ O
when _ _ O
a _ _ O
reservationist _ _ O
called _ _ O
to _ _ O
confirm _ _ O
and _ _ O
asked _ _ O
whether _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
celebrating _ _ O
anything _ _ O
special, _ _ O
I _ _ O
said _ _ O
no, _ _ O
and _ _ O
was _ _ O
gently _ _ O
laughed _ _ O
at: _ _ O
"Just _ _ O
a _ _ O
normal _ _ O
Tuesday _ _ O
night _ _ O
at _ _ O
Del _ _ O
Posto?" _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
little _ _ O
danger _ _ O
that _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
will _ _ O
mistake _ _ O
a _ _ O
night _ _ O
at _ _ O
Del _ _ O
Posto _ _ O
for _ _ O
normal. _ _ O
If _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
else, _ _ O
the _ _ O
napkins _ _ O
and _ _ O
towels _ _ O
are _ _ O
a _ _ O
tip-off. _ _ O
First, _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
hot _ _ O
linen _ _ O
napkin _ _ O
scented _ _ O
with _ _ O
tomato-vine _ _ O
oil, _ _ O
to _ _ O
wipe _ _ O
the _ _ O
dust _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
outside _ _ O
world _ _ O
from _ _ O
your _ _ O
hands. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
a _ _ O
large _ _ O
white _ _ O
linen _ _ O
napkin, _ _ O
followed _ _ O
just _ _ O
before _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
yellow _ _ O
one. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
given _ _ O
to _ _ O
you, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
white _ _ O
one _ _ O
is _ _ O
taken _ _ O
away, _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
server _ _ O
using _ _ O
a _ _ O
large _ _ O
fork _ _ O
and _ _ O
spoon _ _ O
as _ _ O
tongs. _ _ O
When _ _ O
you _ _ O
go _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
restrooms, _ _ O
you _ _ O
may _ _ O
encounter _ _ O
an _ _ O
attendant _ _ O
who _ _ O
has _ _ O
just _ _ O
restocked _ _ O
the _ _ O
hand _ _ O
towels _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
large _ _ O
basket _ _ O
she _ _ O
carries _ _ O
on _ _ O
one _ _ O
arm, _ _ O
like _ _ O
Heidi _ _ O
out _ _ O
gathering _ _ O
wildflowers _ _ O
for _ _ O
Grandfather. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
little _ _ O
ceremonies _ _ O
like _ _ O
this _ _ O
from _ _ O
start _ _ O
to _ _ O
finish; _ _ O
I _ _ O
don't _ _ O
know _ _ O
of _ _ O
any _ _ O
other _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
performs _ _ O
quite _ _ O
so _ _ O
many _ _ O
tasks _ _ O
whose _ _ O
only _ _ O
real _ _ O
purpose _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
draw _ _ O
attention _ _ O
to _ _ O
themselves. _ _ O
And _ _ O
these _ _ O
things _ _ O
are _ _ O
rarely _ _ O
done _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
smile; _ _ O
employees _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
directed _ _ O
to _ _ O
keep _ _ O
a _ _ O
respectful, _ _ O
formal _ _ O
distance _ _ O
as _ _ O
they _ _ O
carry _ _ O
out _ _ O
your _ _ O
requests _ _ O
and _ _ O
perform _ _ O
other _ _ O
services _ _ O
you'd _ _ O
never _ _ O
think _ _ O
of _ _ O
requesting. _ _ O
They _ _ O
rarely _ _ O
seem _ _ O
comfortable. _ _ O
Their _ _ O
solemnity _ _ O
is _ _ O
underlined _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
sepulchral _ _ O
lighting _ _ O
at _ _ O
night, _ _ O
so _ _ O
gloomy _ _ O
it _ _ O
makes _ _ O
the _ _ O
crypt _ _ O
of _ _ O
Grant's _ _ O
tomb _ _ O
look _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
tiki _ _ O
bar. _ _ O
A _ _ O
good _ _ O
deal _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
service _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
attentive, _ _ O
helpful _ _ O
kind _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
really _ _ O
want, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
rest _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
seems _ _ O
designed _ _ O
only _ _ O
to _ _ O
give _ _ O
customers _ _ O
the _ _ O
sensation _ _ O
of _ _ O
temporary _ _ O
power _ _ O
over _ _ O
other _ _ O
people. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
people _ _ O
may _ _ O
love _ _ O
this, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
reflects _ _ O
a _ _ O
serious _ _ O
lack _ _ O
of _ _ O
imagination _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
think _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
ways _ _ O
the _ _ O
service _ _ O
at _ _ O
Blue _ _ O
Hill _ _ O
at _ _ O
Stone _ _ O
Barns _ _ O
or _ _ O
Noma _ _ O
, _ _ O
for _ _ O
instance, _ _ O
is _ _ O
integrated _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
experience. _ _ O
Is _ _ O
it _ _ O
stretching _ _ O
a _ _ O
point _ _ O
to _ _ O
ask _ _ O
if _ _ O
enshrining _ _ O
subservience, _ _ O
as _ _ O
Del _ _ O
Posto _ _ O
does, _ _ O
reflects _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
twisted _ _ O
sense _ _ O
of _ _ O
priorities _ _ O
that _ _ O
allowed _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Batali _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
away _ _ O
with _ _ O
abusing _ _ O
his _ _ O
own _ _ O
power _ _ O
for _ _ O
so _ _ O
long? _ _ O
(And _ _ O
is _ _ O
it _ _ O
a _ _ O
coincidence _ _ O
that _ _ O
far _ _ O
more _ _ O
men _ _ O
than _ _ O
women _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
work _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room, _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
upper _ _ O
ranks?) _ _ O
Now _ _ O
that _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Rodriguez _ _ O
owns _ _ O
a _ _ O
piece _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
perhaps _ _ O
she _ _ O
can _ _ O
lead _ _ O
a _ _ O
reconsideration _ _ O
of _ _ O
priorities _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
front _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
house, _ _ O
and _ _ O
find _ _ O
a _ _ O
tone _ _ O
that _ _ O
more _ _ O
closely _ _ O
matches _ _ O
her _ _ O
philosophy _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
back. _ _ O
She _ _ O
shouldn't _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
clean _ _ O
up _ _ O
the _ _ O
messes _ _ O
men _ _ O
made. _ _ O
But _ _ O
having _ _ O
worked _ _ O
her _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
top _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
always _ _ O
aspired _ _ O
to _ _ O
provide _ _ O
luxury, _ _ O
she _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
chance _ _ O
to _ _ O
decide _ _ O
what, _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
in _ _ O
2019, _ _ O
that _ _ O
word _ _ O
might _ _ O
mean. _ _ O

Hanon, _ _ B-LOC
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
udon _ _ B-TYPE
shop _ _ I-TYPE
in _ _ O
Williamsburg, _ _ B-LOC
Brooklyn, _ _ I-LOC
was _ _ O
produced _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
union _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
Tokyo _ _ B-LOC
video-production _ _ O
company _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
Japanese _ _ O
manufacturer _ _ O
of _ _ O
unusually _ _ O
thin _ _ O
condoms. _ _ O
The _ _ O
condoms _ _ O
became _ _ O
the _ _ O
subject _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
series _ _ O
of _ _ O
advertisements _ _ O
on _ _ O
which _ _ O
the _ _ O
production _ _ O
company _ _ O
worked; _ _ O
in _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
them, _ _ O
called _ _ O
"Acts _ _ O
of _ _ O
Love," _ _ O
dancers _ _ O
in _ _ O
London _ _ B-LOC
re-enact, _ _ O
with _ _ O
surprising _ _ O
grace _ _ O
and _ _ O
dignity, _ _ O
the _ _ O
mating _ _ O
rituals _ _ O
of _ _ O
blue-footed _ _ O
boobies, _ _ O
fiddler _ _ O
crabs _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
animals. _ _ O
Well, _ _ O
kids, _ _ O
when _ _ O
two _ _ O
companies _ _ O
like _ _ O
each _ _ O
other _ _ O
very _ _ O
much, _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
they _ _ O
decide _ _ O
to _ _ O
create _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
company _ _ O
together. _ _ O
That _ _ O
is _ _ O
what _ _ O
happened _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
production _ _ O
firm _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
prophylactics _ _ O
people _ _ O
when, _ _ O
for _ _ O
reasons _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
perhaps _ _ O
best _ _ O
not _ _ O
to _ _ O
question, _ _ O
they _ _ O
hit _ _ O
upon _ _ O
the _ _ O
idea _ _ O
of _ _ O
expanding _ _ O
their _ _ O
product _ _ O
line _ _ O
from _ _ O
condoms _ _ O
into _ _ O
noodles. _ _ B-FOOD
The _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
lies _ _ O
across _ _ O
Union _ _ B-LOC
Avenue _ _ I-LOC
from _ _ O
Kellogg's _ _ B-EST
Diner. _ _ I-EST
Its _ _ O
door _ _ O
is _ _ O
marked _ _ O
during _ _ O
business _ _ O
hours _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
fluttering _ _ O
white _ _ O
noren _ _ O
curtains. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
second _ _ O
Hanon _ _ B-EST
location. _ _ O
The _ _ O
first _ _ O
is _ _ O
about _ _ O
6,700 _ _ O
miles _ _ O
away, _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
of _ _ O
Kamakura, _ _ B-LOC
which _ _ O
lies _ _ O
south _ _ O
of _ _ O
Tokyo _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
is _ _ O
known _ _ O
for _ _ O
soba, _ _ B-FOOD
not _ _ O
udon. _ _ B-FOOD
This _ _ O
gave _ _ O
Hanon _ _ B-EST
the _ _ O
advantage _ _ O
of _ _ O
not _ _ O
competing _ _ O
against _ _ O
any _ _ O
of _ _ O
Japan's _ _ B-LOC
established _ _ O
udon _ _ B-FOOD
styles, _ _ O
leaving _ _ O
its _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Takahiro _ _ O
Yanagisawa, _ _ O
free _ _ O
to _ _ O
come _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
his _ _ O
own. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Yanagisawa, _ _ O
who _ _ O
had _ _ O
spent _ _ O
25 _ _ O
years _ _ O
making _ _ O
sushi _ _ B-FOOD
before _ _ O
turning _ _ O
to _ _ O
noodles, _ _ B-FOOD
focused _ _ O
his _ _ O
innovative _ _ O
urges _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
dough. _ _ B-FOOD
He _ _ O
began _ _ O
by _ _ O
adding _ _ O
wheat _ _ B-FOOD
germ _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
bran _ _ B-FOOD
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
white _ _ B-FOOD
flour _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
in _ _ O
udon _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
typically _ _ O
used _ _ O
alone. _ _ O
The _ _ O
resulting _ _ O
noodle _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
called _ _ O
zenryufun _ _ B-FOOD
or _ _ O
whole _ _ B-FOOD
wheat. _ _ I-FOOD
The _ _ O
bran _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
germ _ _ B-FOOD
are _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Yanagisawa's _ _ O
attempts _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
a _ _ O
more _ _ O
healthful _ _ O
udon, _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
also _ _ O
add _ _ O
flavor, _ _ O
a _ _ O
mottled _ _ O
color _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
rough _ _ O
texture _ _ O
that _ _ O
holds _ _ O
on _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
dashi-based _ _ B-FOOD
broth. _ _ I-FOOD
This _ _ O
dough _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
made _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
green _ _ O
noodle, _ _ B-FOOD
called _ _ O
sasauchi, _ _ O
by _ _ O
mixing _ _ O
in _ _ O
powdered _ _ O
barley _ _ O
shoots _ _ O
and _ _ O
leaves _ _ O
of _ _ O
kuma-zasa, _ _ O
a _ _ O
bamboo _ _ O
variety _ _ O
that _ _ O
pandas _ _ O
dote _ _ O
on _ _ O
. _ _ O
To _ _ O
the _ _ O
human _ _ O
palate, _ _ O
or _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
this _ _ O
human's _ _ O
palate, _ _ O
sasa _ _ O
tastes _ _ O
something _ _ O
like _ _ O
green _ _ O
tea. _ _ O
Both _ _ O
the _ _ O
speckled _ _ O
zenryufun _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
green _ _ O
sasauchi _ _ O
are _ _ O
flat _ _ O
noodles, _ _ O
resembling _ _ O
fettuccine _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
working _ _ O
out. _ _ O
Avoiding _ _ O
extremes, _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
moderately _ _ O
chewy _ _ O
and _ _ O
reasonably _ _ O
springy. _ _ O
Either _ _ O
flavor, _ _ O
or _ _ O
both, _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
ordered _ _ O
cold _ _ O
and _ _ O
spread _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
bamboo _ _ O
mat _ _ O
for _ _ O
dunking _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
sauce, _ _ O
either _ _ O
a _ _ O
peanut-buttery _ _ O
sesame _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
dashi-based _ _ O
dipping _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
For _ _ O
larger _ _ O
or _ _ O
more _ _ O
curious _ _ O
appetites, _ _ O
these _ _ O
dipping _ _ O
noodles, _ _ O
called _ _ O
seiro _ _ O
udon, _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
dangled _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
hot _ _ O
duck _ _ O
soup _ _ O
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
hunks _ _ O
of _ _ O
well-boiled _ _ O
duck _ _ O
meat _ _ O
swim. _ _ O
The _ _ O
cold _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
can _ _ O
also _ _ O
be _ _ O
accessorized _ _ O
with _ _ O
whipped _ _ O
mountain _ _ O
yam _ _ O
or _ _ O
tempura _ _ O
or _ _ O
both. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
had _ _ O
stumbled _ _ O
into _ _ O
Hanon _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
impression _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
another _ _ O
generic _ _ O
Williamsburg _ _ O
noodle _ _ O
mill, _ _ O
the _ _ O
tempura _ _ O
would _ _ O
set _ _ O
you _ _ O
straight. _ _ O
The _ _ O
crust _ _ O
is _ _ O
engineered _ _ O
for _ _ O
udon, _ _ O
thick _ _ O
and _ _ O
substantial _ _ O
enough _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
not _ _ O
dissolve _ _ O
and _ _ O
float _ _ O
away _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
soup, _ _ O
yet _ _ O
somehow _ _ O
not _ _ O
oily _ _ O
or _ _ O
clunky. _ _ O
The _ _ O
tempura _ _ O
is _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
sea _ _ O
salt, _ _ O
which _ _ O
will _ _ O
not _ _ O
only _ _ O
season _ _ O
the _ _ O
fried _ _ O
blowfish _ _ O
tails, _ _ O
shrimp, _ _ O
mushroom _ _ O
and _ _ O
vegetables, _ _ O
but _ _ O
will _ _ O
also _ _ O
do _ _ O
very _ _ O
good _ _ O
things _ _ O
to _ _ O
any _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
it _ _ O
happens _ _ O
to _ _ O
meet. _ _ O
With _ _ O
the _ _ O
hot _ _ O
soups, _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
choice _ _ O
of _ _ O
noodles. _ _ O
All _ _ O
are _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
zenryufun. _ _ O
The _ _ O
plain _ _ O
broth, _ _ O
a _ _ O
dashi _ _ O
augmented _ _ O
by _ _ O
white _ _ O
soy _ _ O
sauce, _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
so _ _ O
salty _ _ O
or _ _ O
concentrated _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
drink _ _ O
it _ _ O
all. _ _ O
It _ _ O
also _ _ O
performs _ _ O
well _ _ O
made _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
thick-but-not-sludgy _ _ O
curry _ _ O
soup _ _ O
with _ _ O
thin _ _ O
pink _ _ O
slices _ _ O
of _ _ O
washugyu _ _ O
beef; _ _ O
a _ _ O
shaggy, _ _ O
mossy, _ _ O
salty-sour _ _ O
mass _ _ O
of _ _ O
ume _ _ O
and _ _ O
kombu; _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
soup _ _ O
of _ _ O
shaved _ _ O
beef _ _ O
and _ _ O
onions _ _ O
that _ _ O
tastes _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
deeper, _ _ O
stronger _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
French _ _ O
dip _ _ O
jus _ _ O
and _ _ O
is _ _ O
blitzed _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
grated _ _ O
yuzu _ _ O
peel _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
end. _ _ O
A _ _ O
few _ _ O
near-relatives _ _ O
of _ _ O
udon _ _ O
make _ _ O
it _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
as _ _ O
well. _ _ O
The _ _ O
beef-and-onion _ _ O
combination _ _ O
can _ _ O
also _ _ O
be _ _ O
had _ _ O
over _ _ O
rice. _ _ O
Creamy, _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
spicy _ _ O
cod _ _ O
roe _ _ O
is _ _ O
tossed _ _ O
with _ _ O
zenryufun _ _ O
for _ _ O
an _ _ O
excellent _ _ O
mentaiko _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
that, _ _ O
for _ _ O
once, _ _ O
relies _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
roe _ _ O
rather _ _ O
than _ _ O
Kewpie _ _ O
mayonnaise _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
an _ _ O
impression. _ _ O
The _ _ O
eventual _ _ O
plan _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
sell _ _ O
both _ _ O
colors _ _ O
of _ _ O
noodle _ _ O
to _ _ O
grocery _ _ O
stores _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
-- _ _ O
to _ _ O
become, _ _ O
in _ _ O
essence, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Sun _ _ O
Noodle _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
udonisphere. _ _ O
This _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
gain _ _ O
for _ _ O
New _ _ O
York, _ _ O
but _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
moment _ _ O
Hanon's _ _ O
udon _ _ O
is _ _ O
found _ _ O
only _ _ O
at _ _ O
Hanon, _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
are _ _ O
made _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
each _ _ O
day. _ _ O
Any _ _ O
plan _ _ O
for _ _ O
world _ _ O
domination _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
hinted _ _ O
at _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
Facebook _ _ O
page _ _ O
, _ _ O
which _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
its _ _ O
home _ _ O
base _ _ O
online, _ _ O
though _ _ O
nobody _ _ O
has _ _ O
bothered _ _ O
to _ _ O
post _ _ O
a _ _ O
menu _ _ O
there _ _ O
yet. _ _ O
Nor _ _ O
does _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
suggest _ _ O
a _ _ O
budding _ _ O
global _ _ O
chain. _ _ O
Atmospheric _ _ O
and _ _ O
presumably _ _ O
expensive _ _ O
prints _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
photographers _ _ O
Takashi _ _ O
Homma _ _ O
and _ _ O
Nobuyoshi _ _ O
Araki _ _ O
hang _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
tables, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
signed _ _ O
Cy _ _ O
Twombly _ _ O
lithograph _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
placed _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
door _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
backyard. _ _ O
The _ _ O
music _ _ O
-- _ _ O
torch _ _ O
songs, _ _ O
jazz _ _ O
piano _ _ O
-- _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
coming _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
radio _ _ O
tuned _ _ O
to _ _ O
another _ _ O
decade. _ _ O
A _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
cocktail _ _ O
music _ _ O
will _ _ O
make _ _ O
more _ _ O
sense _ _ O
once _ _ O
the _ _ O
liquor _ _ O
license _ _ O
comes _ _ O
through. _ _ O
Hanon _ _ O
is _ _ O
getting _ _ O
set _ _ O
to _ _ O
offer _ _ O
sake, _ _ O
shochu _ _ O
and _ _ O
wines _ _ O
chosen _ _ O
by _ _ O
Jorge _ _ O
Riera, _ _ O
who _ _ O
built _ _ O
the _ _ O
list _ _ O
at _ _ O
Frenchette _ _ O
and _ _ O
has _ _ O
turned _ _ O
countless _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
on _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
fizzy, _ _ O
fuzzy _ _ O
and _ _ O
furry _ _ O
delights _ _ O
of _ _ O
natural _ _ O
wines. _ _ O
The _ _ O
idea _ _ O
of _ _ O
Hanon _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
to _ _ O
slurp _ _ O
and _ _ O
slide _ _ O
out, _ _ O
but _ _ O
to _ _ O
stay _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
meal: _ _ O
a _ _ O
chilled _ _ O
French _ _ O
red _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
fried _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
and _ _ O
Japanese _ _ O
omelet, _ _ O
maybe, _ _ O
and _ _ O
something _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
brawnier _ _ O
with _ _ O
curry _ _ O
soup. _ _ O
Dessert _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
tofu _ _ O
blancmange, _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
and _ _ O
white _ _ O
and _ _ O
somewhat _ _ O
sweet, _ _ O
but _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
satisfaction _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
grainy, _ _ O
earthy _ _ O
bricks _ _ O
of _ _ O
red _ _ O
bean _ _ O
paste. _ _ O
The _ _ O
meal _ _ O
might _ _ O
end _ _ O
with _ _ O
tea, _ _ O
to _ _ O
which _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
takes _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
unhurried _ _ O
approach _ _ O
it _ _ O
applies _ _ O
to _ _ O
everything _ _ O
else. _ _ O
The _ _ O
iced _ _ O
oolong _ _ O
is _ _ O
slowly _ _ O
cold-brewed; _ _ O
a _ _ O
bamboo _ _ O
whisk _ _ O
and _ _ O
ceramic _ _ O
chawan _ _ O
are _ _ O
kept _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
counter _ _ O
for _ _ O
painstakingly _ _ O
whipping _ _ O
up _ _ O
bowls _ _ O
of _ _ O
matcha; _ _ O
an _ _ O
appliance _ _ O
imported _ _ O
from _ _ O
Taiwan _ _ O
will _ _ O
transform _ _ O
freshly _ _ O
steeped _ _ O
hojicha _ _ O
and _ _ O
ice _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
tan _ _ O
froth, _ _ O
a _ _ O
process _ _ O
that _ _ O
takes _ _ O
about _ _ O
five _ _ O
minutes. _ _ O
This _ _ O
foam _ _ O
tea _ _ O
is _ _ O
dairy-free, _ _ O
unlike _ _ O
Taiwan's _ _ O
infamous _ _ O
cheese _ _ O
tea. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
served _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
wine _ _ O
glass, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
experience _ _ O
of _ _ O
drinking _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
similar _ _ O
to _ _ O
tackling _ _ O
a _ _ O
pint _ _ O
of _ _ O
Guinness _ _ O
before _ _ O
the _ _ O
head _ _ O
has _ _ O
settled _ _ O
down. _ _ O

One _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
ways _ _ O
people _ _ O
pretend _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
sophisticated _ _ O
about _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
these _ _ O
days _ _ O
is _ _ O
by _ _ O
claiming _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
City _ _ I-LOC
dining _ _ O
scene _ _ O
has _ _ O
lost _ _ O
its _ _ O
edge. _ _ O
The _ _ O
sheer _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
-- _ _ O
about _ _ O
27,000, _ _ O
according _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
health _ _ O
inspectors _ _ O
-- _ _ O
makes _ _ O
the _ _ O
argument _ _ O
absurd. _ _ O
How _ _ O
many _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
are _ _ O
slipping? _ _ O
All _ _ O
of _ _ O
them? _ _ O
Just _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
20,000 _ _ O
or _ _ O
so? _ _ O
In _ _ O
reality, _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
gripe _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
state _ _ O
of _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
restaurants _ _ I-LOC
are _ _ O
usually _ _ O
talking _ _ O
about _ _ O
a _ _ O
sliver _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
slice _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
fraction, _ _ O
probably _ _ O
around _ _ O
50 _ _ O
places _ _ O
whose _ _ O
names _ _ O
are _ _ O
in _ _ O
steady _ _ O
circulation, _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
newest _ _ O
weighing _ _ O
most _ _ O
heavily _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
results. _ _ O
The _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
really _ _ O
good _ _ O
ones _ _ O
is _ _ O
higher _ _ O
than _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
can _ _ O
count. _ _ O
Places _ _ O
that _ _ O
other _ _ O
cities _ _ O
would _ _ O
brag _ _ O
about _ _ O
get _ _ O
lost _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
crowd _ _ O
here. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chef _ _ O
Günther _ _ O
Seeger, _ _ O
for _ _ O
instance, _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
national _ _ O
star _ _ O
when _ _ O
he _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
in _ _ O
Atlanta. _ _ B-LOC
The _ _ O
tasting-menu _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
he _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
West _ _ B-LOC
Village _ _ I-LOC
three _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago _ _ O
should _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
a _ _ O
major _ _ O
destination, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
after _ _ O
he _ _ O
dropped _ _ O
the _ _ O
prices. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Seeger _ _ O
can _ _ O
make _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
bend _ _ O
to _ _ O
his _ _ O
will _ _ O
almost _ _ O
without _ _ O
touching _ _ O
them. _ _ O
His _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
outshone _ _ O
that _ _ O
of _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
city's _ _ O
more _ _ O
famous _ _ O
chefs, _ _ O
who _ _ O
whip _ _ O
their _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
harder _ _ O
with _ _ O
far _ _ O
less _ _ O
payoff. _ _ O
Yet _ _ O
he _ _ O
struggled _ _ O
to _ _ O
put _ _ O
Günther _ _ B-EST
Seeger _ _ I-EST
NY _ _ I-EST
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
map. _ _ O
I _ _ O
reviewed _ _ O
it, _ _ O
but _ _ O
some _ _ O
other _ _ O
critics _ _ O
didn't, _ _ O
and _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
it _ _ O
closed, _ _ O
last _ _ O
month, _ _ O
Chris _ _ O
Crowley _ _ O
of _ _ O
Grub _ _ B-EST
Street _ _ I-EST
wrote _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
"it _ _ O
wasn't _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
you _ _ O
heard _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
food _ _ O
geeks _ _ O
talk _ _ O
about." _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Seeger _ _ O
complained _ _ O
to _ _ O
one _ _ O
acquaintance _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
couldn't _ _ O
even _ _ O
get _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
list _ _ O
of _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York's _ _ I-LOC
100 _ _ O
best _ _ O
restaurants. _ _ O
Of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
good _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
fail _ _ O
everywhere, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it's _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
imagine _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Seeger _ _ O
vanishing _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
crowd _ _ O
in _ _ O
San _ _ B-LOC
Francisco, _ _ I-LOC
Chicago _ _ B-LOC
or _ _ O
Los _ _ B-LOC
Angeles. _ _ I-LOC
Considered _ _ O
and _ _ O
rejected, _ _ O
maybe. _ _ O
But _ _ O
overlooked? _ _ O
Not _ _ O
likely. _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
not _ _ O
sure _ _ O
that _ _ O
any _ _ O
words _ _ O
of _ _ O
mine _ _ O
could _ _ O
have _ _ O
persuaded _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
to _ _ O
cuddle _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Seeger, _ _ O
who _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
cuddly. _ _ O
But _ _ O
I _ _ O
wish _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
found _ _ O
ways _ _ O
to _ _ O
remind _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
that _ _ O
his _ _ O
breathtakingly _ _ O
pure _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
was _ _ O
there _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
enjoyed _ _ O
while _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
still _ _ O
true. _ _ O
Which _ _ O
brings _ _ O
us, _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
circuitous _ _ O
and _ _ O
not _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
well-paved _ _ O
route, _ _ O
to _ _ O
Anthony _ _ O
Mangieri _ _ O
of _ _ O
Una _ _ B-EST
Pizza _ _ I-EST
Napoletana _ _ I-EST
. _ _ O
Using _ _ O
naturally _ _ O
leavened _ _ O
dough _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
short _ _ O
shopping _ _ O
list _ _ O
of _ _ O
ingredients, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri _ _ O
makes _ _ O
what _ _ O
is _ _ O
unmistakably _ _ O
the _ _ O
finest _ _ O
sit-down _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
five _ _ O
boroughs. _ _ O
(I _ _ O
doubt _ _ O
he _ _ O
has _ _ O
any _ _ O
rivals _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
stand-up _ _ O
joints, _ _ O
either, _ _ O
but _ _ O
slice _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
different _ _ O
game.) _ _ O
Two _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
I _ _ O
posited _ _ O
that _ _ O
Razza, _ _ O
a _ _ O
pizzeria _ _ O
in _ _ O
Jersey _ _ O
City, _ _ O
made _ _ O
"the _ _ O
best _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ O
York." _ _ O
I _ _ O
don't _ _ O
regret _ _ O
writing _ _ O
that, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
would _ _ O
like _ _ O
to _ _ O
point _ _ O
out _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri _ _ O
was _ _ O
not _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
Razza's _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Dan _ _ O
Richer, _ _ O
has _ _ O
said _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
began _ _ O
taking _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
seriously _ _ O
only _ _ O
after _ _ O
he _ _ O
met _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri. _ _ O
Una _ _ O
Pizza _ _ O
Napoletana _ _ O
saw _ _ O
a _ _ O
rush _ _ O
of _ _ O
curious _ _ O
pie-eaters _ _ O
after _ _ O
it _ _ O
opened _ _ O
on _ _ O
Orchard _ _ O
Street _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
year _ _ O
ago. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
few _ _ O
times _ _ O
I've _ _ O
gone, _ _ O
there _ _ O
were _ _ O
too _ _ O
many _ _ O
unclaimed _ _ O
chairs _ _ O
and _ _ O
bar _ _ O
stools. _ _ O
When _ _ O
Anthony _ _ O
Mangieri _ _ O
is _ _ O
making _ _ O
pizza, _ _ O
the _ _ O
right _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
empty _ _ O
seats _ _ O
is _ _ O
zero, _ _ O
as _ _ O
any _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorker _ _ O
who _ _ O
waited _ _ O
in _ _ O
line _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
old _ _ O
Una _ _ O
Pizza _ _ O
Napoletana, _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
East _ _ O
Village _ _ O
from _ _ O
2004 _ _ O
to _ _ O
2009, _ _ O
could _ _ O
tell _ _ O
you. _ _ O
Press _ _ O
interest _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
new _ _ O
place _ _ O
has _ _ O
died _ _ O
down, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
So _ _ O
when _ _ O
I _ _ O
heard _ _ O
a _ _ O
rumor _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri _ _ O
was _ _ O
thinking _ _ O
of _ _ O
leaving _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
and _ _ O
taking _ _ O
his _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
with _ _ O
him, _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
unnerved, _ _ O
to _ _ O
put _ _ O
it _ _ O
mildly. _ _ O
Asked _ _ O
about _ _ O
it, _ _ O
he _ _ O
told _ _ O
me _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
considering _ _ O
it _ _ O
but _ _ O
hadn't _ _ O
made _ _ O
up _ _ O
his _ _ O
mind. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri _ _ O
has _ _ O
left _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
before, _ _ O
and _ _ O
I _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
like _ _ O
it _ _ O
then, _ _ O
either. _ _ O
This _ _ O
time, _ _ O
I _ _ O
wasn't _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
let _ _ O
him _ _ O
get _ _ O
away _ _ O
without _ _ O
a _ _ O
fight. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
true _ _ O
that _ _ O
my _ _ O
review _ _ O
of _ _ O
Una _ _ O
Pizza _ _ O
Napoletana _ _ O
last _ _ O
year _ _ O
was _ _ O
decidedly _ _ O
mixed. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
true, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
that _ _ O
almost _ _ O
every _ _ O
criticism _ _ O
I _ _ O
made _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
addressed. _ _ O
It _ _ O
has _ _ O
gone _ _ O
from _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
confounding _ _ O
pizzerias _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
to _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
enjoyable. _ _ O
The _ _ O
problem _ _ O
with _ _ O
Una _ _ O
Pizza _ _ O
a _ _ O
year _ _ O
ago _ _ O
was _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
trying _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
two _ _ O
things _ _ O
at _ _ O
once. _ _ O
It _ _ O
was, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
a _ _ O
Neapolitan _ _ O
pizzeria, _ _ O
serving _ _ O
classic, _ _ O
unadorned _ _ O
pies _ _ O
baked _ _ O
for _ _ O
about _ _ O
two _ _ O
minutes _ _ O
inside _ _ O
a _ _ O
wood-burning _ _ O
oven _ _ O
shaped _ _ O
like _ _ O
an _ _ O
igloo. _ _ O
But _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
also _ _ O
a _ _ O
cutting-edge _ _ O
Lower _ _ O
East _ _ O
Side _ _ O
experiment. _ _ O
At _ _ O
the _ _ O
instigation _ _ O
of _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri's _ _ O
partners, _ _ O
the _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
Fabian _ _ O
von _ _ O
Hauske _ _ O
Valtierra _ _ O
and _ _ O
Jeremiah _ _ O
Stone, _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
brought _ _ O
forth _ _ O
appetizers _ _ O
that _ _ O
had _ _ O
rarely _ _ O
if _ _ O
ever _ _ O
been _ _ O
asked _ _ O
to _ _ O
live _ _ O
under _ _ O
one _ _ O
roof _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
pizza. _ _ O
There _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
jellylike _ _ O
mass _ _ O
of _ _ O
raw _ _ O
lobster _ _ O
inside _ _ O
a _ _ O
ring _ _ O
of _ _ O
chickpeas, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
rust-colored _ _ O
puddle _ _ O
of _ _ O
'nduja _ _ O
under _ _ O
raw _ _ O
turnips _ _ O
and _ _ O
nasturtium _ _ O
leaves. _ _ O
The _ _ O
wine _ _ O
list _ _ O
was _ _ O
virtually _ _ O
a _ _ O
treatise _ _ O
on _ _ O
natural _ _ O
wines, _ _ O
a _ _ O
long _ _ O
document _ _ O
full _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
names _ _ O
of _ _ O
eccentric _ _ O
producers _ _ O
and _ _ O
obscure _ _ O
European _ _ O
villages. _ _ O
In _ _ O
another _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
all _ _ O
this _ _ O
would _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
the _ _ O
departure _ _ O
point _ _ O
for _ _ O
some _ _ O
adventurous _ _ O
evenings. _ _ O
But _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
pizzeria _ _ O
it _ _ O
led _ _ O
to _ _ O
some _ _ O
peculiar _ _ O
pairings, _ _ O
made _ _ O
the _ _ O
check _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
higher _ _ O
than _ _ O
you _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
and _ _ O
resulted _ _ O
in _ _ O
long _ _ O
waits _ _ O
before _ _ O
you _ _ O
were _ _ O
finally _ _ O
allowed _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat _ _ O
the _ _ O
delicious _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
you'd _ _ O
come _ _ O
for. _ _ O
Over _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
year, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
von _ _ O
Hauske _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Stone _ _ O
have _ _ O
stepped _ _ O
aside, _ _ O
letting _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri _ _ O
call _ _ O
the _ _ O
shots. _ _ O
The _ _ O
wines _ _ O
on _ _ O
offer _ _ O
now _ _ O
number _ _ O
about _ _ O
15. _ _ O
They _ _ O
are _ _ O
still _ _ O
a _ _ O
likably _ _ O
eccentric _ _ O
lot, _ _ O
but _ _ O
picking _ _ O
one _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
feel _ _ O
like _ _ O
studying _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
master _ _ O
sommelier _ _ O
exam. _ _ O
The _ _ O
appetizers _ _ O
are _ _ O
simpler _ _ O
and _ _ O
less _ _ O
expensive: _ _ O
a _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
marinated _ _ O
white _ _ O
anchovies, _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish _ _ O
of _ _ O
warm _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
olives _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
Little _ _ O
Gem _ _ O
lettuce _ _ O
with _ _ O
sunflower _ _ O
seeds _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
Caesarish _ _ O
dressing. _ _ O
I _ _ O
do _ _ O
miss _ _ O
the _ _ O
tiramisù _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
opening _ _ O
menu, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
new _ _ O
cannoli _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
ricotta _ _ O
-- _ _ O
a _ _ O
blend _ _ O
of _ _ O
domestic _ _ O
cow's _ _ O
milk _ _ O
and _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
sheep's _ _ O
milk _ _ O
-- _ _ O
are _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
as _ _ O
good. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
common _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
to _ _ O
trim _ _ O
its _ _ O
sails, _ _ O
but _ _ O
this _ _ O
one _ _ O
has _ _ O
trimmed _ _ O
its _ _ O
prices, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
beginning _ _ O
the _ _ O
five _ _ O
regular _ _ O
pizzas _ _ O
were _ _ O
all _ _ O
$25; _ _ O
now _ _ O
they _ _ O
range _ _ O
from _ _ O
$19 _ _ O
to _ _ O
$25, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O
extra-complicated _ _ O
Friday _ _ O
and _ _ O
Saturday _ _ O
pizzas _ _ O
are _ _ O
priced _ _ O
at _ _ O
$26. _ _ O
I _ _ O
liked _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri's _ _ O
pies _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
East _ _ O
Village, _ _ O
I _ _ O
liked _ _ O
them _ _ O
more _ _ O
when _ _ O
he _ _ O
came _ _ O
back _ _ O
to _ _ O
town, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it's _ _ O
possible, _ _ O
just _ _ O
possible, _ _ O
that _ _ O
they've _ _ O
improved _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
year. _ _ O
He _ _ O
is, _ _ O
like _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Seeger, _ _ O
a _ _ O
minimalist. _ _ O
He _ _ O
lets _ _ O
you _ _ O
notice _ _ O
each _ _ O
ingredient: _ _ O
the _ _ O
little _ _ O
ping _ _ O
of _ _ O
sourness _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Campanian _ _ O
buffalo _ _ O
mozzarella, _ _ O
for _ _ O
instance. _ _ O
Or _ _ O
the _ _ O
unruly, _ _ O
windswept-hillside _ _ O
aroma _ _ O
of _ _ O
dried _ _ O
Sicilian _ _ O
oregano. _ _ O
The _ _ O
precise _ _ O
crunch _ _ O
of _ _ O
each _ _ O
unrefined _ _ O
Trapani _ _ O
sea-salt _ _ O
crystal _ _ O
waiting _ _ O
to _ _ O
dissolve. _ _ O
The _ _ O
crust _ _ O
is _ _ O
so _ _ O
tender _ _ O
it _ _ O
barely _ _ O
fights _ _ O
fork, _ _ O
knife _ _ O
or _ _ O
teeth. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
diners _ _ O
will _ _ O
wish _ _ O
it _ _ O
put _ _ O
up _ _ O
more _ _ O
crackly _ _ O
resistance. _ _ O
You _ _ O
inhale _ _ O
it _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
as _ _ O
much _ _ O
as _ _ O
you _ _ O
eat _ _ O
it. _ _ O
When _ _ O
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
finished, _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
popular _ _ O
pizzas _ _ O
in _ _ O
town _ _ O
will _ _ O
seem _ _ O
tough, _ _ O
leathery, _ _ O
overworked. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
if _ _ O
this _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
style _ _ O
you _ _ O
crave, _ _ O
you'll _ _ O
know _ _ O
that _ _ O
it's _ _ O
the _ _ O
work _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
baker _ _ O
who _ _ O
has _ _ O
spent _ _ O
years _ _ O
listening _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
dough. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
place _ _ O
for _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
are _ _ O
as _ _ O
obsessed _ _ O
with _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
as _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri, _ _ O

the _ _ O

You _ _ O
will _ _ O
find _ _ O
Kawi _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
the _ _ O
latest _ _ O
Momofuku _ _ B-EST
restaurant, _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
fifth _ _ O
floor _ _ O
of _ _ O
20 _ _ B-LOC
Hudson _ _ I-LOC
Yards, _ _ I-LOC
assuming _ _ O
you _ _ O
stay _ _ O
determined _ _ O
and _ _ O
swallow _ _ O
back _ _ O
the _ _ O
urge _ _ O
to _ _ O
run _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
exits _ _ O
that _ _ O
may _ _ O
grip _ _ O
you _ _ O
as _ _ O
you _ _ O
negotiate _ _ O
escalators _ _ O
that _ _ O
don't _ _ O
connect _ _ O
to _ _ O
one _ _ O
another, _ _ O
elevators _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
hidden _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
sight _ _ O
like _ _ O
somebody's _ _ O
crazy _ _ O
grandfather _ _ O
and _ _ O
shiny _ _ O
retail _ _ O
windows _ _ O
that _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
trying _ _ O
to _ _ O
provoke _ _ O
a _ _ O
class _ _ O
war. _ _ O
By _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
people _ _ O
reach _ _ O
Kawi _ _ B-EST
they _ _ O
tend _ _ O
to _ _ O
look _ _ O
rattled; _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
who _ _ O
will _ _ O
easily _ _ O
weave _ _ O
their _ _ O
way _ _ O
around _ _ O
broken _ _ O
sidewalks, _ _ O
potholes, _ _ O
garbage _ _ O
piles _ _ O
and _ _ O
al _ _ O
fresco _ _ O
rat _ _ O
conventions _ _ O
come _ _ O
undone _ _ O
when _ _ O
faced _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
interior _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
shopping _ _ O
mall. _ _ O
Kawi, _ _ B-EST
now _ _ O
two _ _ O
months _ _ O
old, _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
disorienting _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
own _ _ O
way, _ _ O
but _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
seat _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
drink _ _ O
while _ _ O
you _ _ O
get _ _ O
your _ _ O
bearings. _ _ O
Space _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
used, _ _ O
or _ _ O
not _ _ O
used, _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
in _ _ O
Las _ _ B-LOC
Vegas. _ _ I-LOC
There's _ _ O
a _ _ O
very _ _ O
long _ _ O
bar _ _ O
behind _ _ O
a _ _ O
line _ _ O
of _ _ O
black, _ _ O
geometric _ _ O
bar _ _ O
stools _ _ O
receding _ _ O
toward _ _ O
the _ _ O
vanishing _ _ O
point; _ _ O
low _ _ O
lounge _ _ O
tables; _ _ O
taller, _ _ O
square _ _ O
wood _ _ O
tables; _ _ O
round _ _ O
wood _ _ O
tables; _ _ O
black-leather _ _ O
booths; _ _ O
red-leather _ _ O
booths; _ _ O
red-leather _ _ O
banquettes; _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
row _ _ O
of _ _ O
chairs _ _ O
facing _ _ O
a _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
counter. _ _ O
Between _ _ O
all _ _ O
this _ _ O
furniture _ _ O
are _ _ O
aisles _ _ O
wide _ _ O
enough _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
Zamboni. _ _ O
All _ _ O
those _ _ O
seats _ _ O
have _ _ O
backs, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
Kawi _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
loaded _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
comforts _ _ O
and _ _ O
accommodations _ _ O
that _ _ O
critics, _ _ O
including _ _ O
me, _ _ O
were _ _ O
begging _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chang _ _ O
to _ _ O
pay _ _ O
more _ _ O
attention _ _ O
to _ _ O
as _ _ O
recently _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
opening _ _ O
of _ _ O
Nishi _ _ B-EST
three _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago. _ _ O
Has _ _ O
anybody _ _ O
complained _ _ O
before _ _ O
that _ _ O
a _ _ O
David _ _ O
Chang _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
was _ _ O
too _ _ O
quiet? _ _ O
They're _ _ O
saying _ _ O
it _ _ O
about _ _ O
Kawi. _ _ B-EST
If _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
anybody _ _ O
left _ _ O
who _ _ O
still _ _ O
thinks _ _ O
of _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chang _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
downtown _ _ O
punk, _ _ O
Kawi _ _ B-EST
will _ _ O
clear _ _ O
up _ _ O
that _ _ O
misconception. _ _ O
The _ _ O
early _ _ O
Momofuku _ _ B-EST
restaurants _ _ O
were _ _ O
skateboards; _ _ O
Kawi _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
minivan _ _ O
with _ _ O
sliding _ _ O
doors, _ _ O
armrests, _ _ O
cupholders _ _ O
and _ _ O
Don _ _ O
Henley _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
stereo. _ _ O
The _ _ O
ride _ _ O
may _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
as _ _ O
fast, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it's _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
smoother. _ _ O
Kawi _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
Momofuku _ _ B-EST
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
to _ _ I-LOC
address _ _ O
Korean _ _ B-CUISINE
cuisine _ _ O
head _ _ O
on _ _ O
and _ _ O
at _ _ O
length. _ _ O
Majordomo _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
which _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
Los _ _ B-LOC
Angeles _ _ I-LOC
last _ _ O
year, _ _ O
is _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
half _ _ O
Korean, _ _ B-CUISINE
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
loaded _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
other _ _ O
stuff, _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
big _ _ O
and _ _ O
showy _ _ O
and _ _ O
seemingly _ _ O
designed _ _ O
to _ _ O
dazzle _ _ O
the _ _ O
high _ _ O
rollers. _ _ O
It _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
remember _ _ O
you're _ _ O
eating _ _ O
galbi-jjim _ _ B-DISH
after _ _ I-DISH
a _ _ O
server _ _ O
buries _ _ O
it _ _ O
beneath _ _ O
a _ _ O
tableside _ _ O
avalanche _ _ O
of _ _ O
shaved _ _ O
raclette. _ _ B-FOOD
Eunjo _ _ O
Park, _ _ O
Kawi's _ _ B-EST
executive _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
avoids _ _ O
this _ _ O
type _ _ O
of _ _ O
distraction. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
lucky, _ _ O
because _ _ O
she _ _ O
makes _ _ O
food _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
concentrate _ _ O
on. _ _ O
Before _ _ O
joining _ _ O
the _ _ O
Momofuku _ _ B-EST
stable, _ _ O
she _ _ O
worked _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
formal _ _ O
and _ _ O
highly _ _ O
fastidious _ _ O
kitchens _ _ O
of _ _ O
Daniel _ _ O
, _ _ O
Le _ _ B-EST
Bec-Fin _ _ I-EST
and _ _ O
Per _ _ B-EST
Se _ _ I-EST
. _ _ O
She _ _ O
later _ _ O
returned _ _ O
to _ _ O
South _ _ B-LOC
Korea, _ _ I-LOC
where _ _ O
she _ _ O
had _ _ O
lived _ _ O
until _ _ O
she _ _ O
was _ _ O
12, _ _ O
for _ _ O
advanced _ _ O
studies _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
Seoul _ _ B-LOC
restaurant _ _ O
Gaon _ _ B-EST
and _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Chunjinam _ _ B-EST
hermitage, _ _ O
presided _ _ O
over _ _ O
by _ _ O
Jeong _ _ O
Kwan _ _ O
, _ _ O
certainly _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
celebrated _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
Zen _ _ O
nun _ _ O
in _ _ O
her _ _ O
country. _ _ O
A _ _ O
strong _ _ O
interest _ _ O
in _ _ O
tradition _ _ O
marks _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Park's _ _ O
food _ _ O
at _ _ O
Kawi. _ _ B-EST
Her _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
are _ _ O
set _ _ O
apart _ _ O
from _ _ O
versions _ _ O
you _ _ O
may _ _ O
have _ _ O
had _ _ O
before _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
exactitude _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
technique _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
ingredients. _ _ O
One _ _ O
section _ _ O
of _ _ O
her _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
turned _ _ O
over _ _ O
to _ _ O
kimbap, _ _ B-FOOD
those _ _ O
wide, _ _ O
nori-wrapped _ _ B-FOOD
sushi _ _ B-FOOD
rolls _ _ I-FOOD
often _ _ O
spotted _ _ O
at _ _ O
salad _ _ O
bars, _ _ O
languishing _ _ O
under _ _ O
plastic _ _ O
wrap. _ _ O
Most _ _ O
kimbap _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
designed _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
portable, _ _ O
filling _ _ O
and _ _ O
inexpensive. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Park's _ _ O
kimbap, _ _ B-FOOD
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
hand, _ _ O
is _ _ O
built _ _ O
for _ _ O
pleasure. _ _ O
She _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
pickled _ _ B-DISH
vegetable _ _ I-DISH
kimbap _ _ I-DISH
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
lunch _ _ O
menu _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
truly _ _ O
exciting; _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
meant _ _ O
to _ _ O
dip _ _ O
it _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark _ _ O
liquid _ _ O
that _ _ O
tastes _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
like _ _ O
soy _ _ B-FOOD
sauce _ _ I-FOOD
but _ _ O
is _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
beets. _ _ B-FOOD
The _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
menu _ _ O
brings _ _ O
kimbap _ _ B-DISH
filled _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
chives, _ _ I-DISH
pickled _ _ I-DISH
daikon, _ _ I-DISH
citrus _ _ I-DISH

buttery _ _ I-DISH
pink _ _ I-DISH
vein _ _ I-DISH
of _ _ I-DISH
foie _ _ I-DISH
gras _ _ I-DISH

Has _ _ O
this _ _ O
really _ _ O
never _ _ O
been _ _ O
done _ _ O
before, _ _ O
you _ _ O
wonder _ _ O
as _ _ O
you _ _ O
eat _ _ O
it, _ _ O
and _ _ O
if _ _ O
not, _ _ O
why _ _ O
not? _ _ O
Among _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
gussied-up _ _ O
raw _ _ O
fish _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
expect _ _ O
in _ _ O
Momofukuland, _ _ B-EST
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
refreshing _ _ O
if _ _ O
somewhat _ _ O
staid _ _ O
madai _ _ B-DISH
tartare, _ _ I-DISH
are _ _ O
some _ _ O
dime-size _ _ O
clams _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
chile _ _ B-FOOD
sauce _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
an _ _ O
elegant, _ _ O
inspired _ _ O
interpretation _ _ O
of _ _ O

Blue _ _ B-FOOD
crab _ _ I-FOOD
legs _ _ I-FOOD

a _ _ O
three-day _ _ O
soak _ _ O
in _ _ O
soy _ _ B-FOOD
sauce, _ _ I-FOOD
among _ _ O
other _ _ O
things, _ _ O
which _ _ O
gives _ _ O
them _ _ O
an _ _ O
impressive _ _ O
amount _ _ O
of _ _ O
flavor. _ _ O
Then, _ _ O
in _ _ O
case _ _ O
you _ _ O
haven't _ _ O
noticed _ _ O
that _ _ O
you're _ _ O
dealing _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
real _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Park _ _ O
stirs _ _ O
the _ _ O
crab's _ _ B-FOOD

At _ _ O
moments _ _ O
like _ _ O
this, _ _ O
or _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
hwedupbap _ _ B-DISH
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
raw _ _ O

as _ _ O

good _ _ O
as _ _ O
any _ _ O
you'll _ _ O

as _ _ O
"yesterday's _ _ B-DISH

and _ _ O
manages _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
homespun _ _ O
and _ _ O
polished _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
time, _ _ O
it's _ _ O
possible _ _ O
to _ _ O
see _ _ O
Kawi _ _ B-EST
as _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Park's _ _ O
response _ _ O
to _ _ O
Atomix _ _ B-EST
. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
she _ _ O
had _ _ O
looked _ _ O
at _ _ O
Junghyun _ _ O
Park's _ _ O
dazzlingly _ _ O
complex _ _ O
compositions _ _ O
at _ _ O
his _ _ O
year-old _ _ O
modern _ _ O
Korean _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurant _ _ O
and _ _ O
decided _ _ O
that _ _ O
she _ _ O
could _ _ O
cook _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
style _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
every _ _ O
bit _ _ O
as _ _ O
modern _ _ O
and _ _ O
painstaking, _ _ O
but _ _ O
that _ _ O
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
turning _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
into _ _ O
tasting-menu _ _ O
food _ _ O
she _ _ O
would _ _ O
keep _ _ O
the _ _ O
old _ _ O
forms _ _ O
and _ _ O
innovate _ _ O
inside _ _ O
them. _ _ O
With _ _ O
her _ _ O
tidy, _ _ O
refined, _ _ O
French-influenced _ _ B-FOOD
neo-traditionalism, _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Park _ _ O
could _ _ O
become _ _ O
something _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
Alain _ _ O
Ducasse _ _ O
of _ _ O
Korean _ _ B-CUISINE
cooking. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
not _ _ O
obvious, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
that _ _ O
Kawi _ _ B-EST
needs _ _ O
an _ _ O
Alain _ _ O
Ducasse. _ _ O
Certain _ _ O
appetizers _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
belong _ _ O
on _ _ O
another _ _ O
planet, _ _ O
more _ _ O
beautiful _ _ O
and _ _ O
gentle _ _ O
than _ _ O
ours, _ _ O
such _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
soft _ _ B-DISH
tofu _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
soy _ _ I-DISH
syrup _ _ I-DISH
that, _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
shattering _ _ O
thin _ _ O
crust _ _ B-FOOD
of _ _ I-FOOD
caramelized _ _ I-FOOD
sugar, _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
savory _ _ O
crème _ _ B-DISH
brûlée _ _ I-DISH
by _ _ O
way _ _ O
of _ _ O
Seoul. _ _ B-LOC
And _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
others, _ _ O
such _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
sticks _ _ O
of _ _ O
fried _ _ B-FOOD
cod _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ I-FOOD
a _ _ O
server _ _ O
pointlessly _ _ O
snips _ _ O
in _ _ O
half _ _ O
with _ _ O
scissors _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
spritzes _ _ O
with _ _ O
atomized _ _ O
yuzu _ _ B-FOOD
juice, _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
right _ _ O
at _ _ O
home _ _ O
at _ _ O
Hudson _ _ B-LOC
Yards. _ _ I-LOC
The _ _ O
presentation _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
forced. _ _ O
That _ _ O
could _ _ O
also _ _ O
describe _ _ O
the _ _ O
boiled _ _ B-DISH
chicken _ _ I-DISH
dish, _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu's _ _ O
showiest _ _ O
items _ _ O
and, _ _ O
at _ _ O
$64, _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
most _ _ O
expensive. _ _ O
The _ _ O
whole _ _ O
bird _ _ O
is _ _ O
steamed, _ _ O
then _ _ O
the _ _ O
breast _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
sliced _ _ O
and _ _ O
served _ _ O
plain _ _ O
while _ _ O
the _ _ O
dark _ _ B-FOOD
meat _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
fried _ _ O
and _ _ O
coated _ _ O
with _ _ O
spices. _ _ B-FOOD
Neither _ _ O
is _ _ O
spectacular _ _ O
on _ _ O
its _ _ O
own, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
combination _ _ O
is _ _ O
bizarre. _ _ O
More _ _ O
successful _ _ O
versions _ _ O
of _ _ O
elaborate, _ _ O
oversize, _ _ O
multicomponent _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
are _ _ O
proven _ _ O
moneymakers _ _ O
elsewhere _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Momofuku _ _ B-EST
republic. _ _ O
But _ _ O
arm-waving _ _ O
platters _ _ O
like _ _ O
that _ _ O
seem _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
place _ _ O
at _ _ O
Kawi, _ _ B-EST
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
least _ _ O
Momofukian _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Momofukus. _ _ B-EST
The _ _ O
most _ _ O
uncharacteristic _ _ O
thing _ _ O
of _ _ O
all _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
has _ _ O
never _ _ O
been _ _ O
operating _ _ O
at _ _ O
anything _ _ O
close _ _ O
to _ _ O
capacity, _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
when _ _ O
I've _ _ O
been _ _ O
there. _ _ O
Maybe _ _ O
tables _ _ O
are _ _ O
being _ _ O
kept _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
reservation _ _ O
books _ _ O
to _ _ O
give _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooks _ _ O
time _ _ O
to _ _ O
learn _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
spice _ _ O
cabinet _ _ O
is. _ _ O
Or _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
the _ _ O
fans _ _ O
who _ _ O
are _ _ O
so _ _ O
devoted _ _ O
to _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O

Good _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
don't _ _ O
rain _ _ O
down _ _ O
from _ _ O
nowhere, _ _ O
but _ _ O
Crown _ _ B-EST
Shy _ _ I-EST
came _ _ O
close. _ _ O
No _ _ O
doubt _ _ O
it _ _ O
went _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
birth _ _ O
pangs _ _ O
as _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
others. _ _ O
As _ _ O
far _ _ O
as _ _ O
I _ _ O
can _ _ O
tell, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
it _ _ O
simply _ _ O
materialized _ _ O
one _ _ O
morning _ _ O
this _ _ O
March _ _ O
at _ _ O
70 _ _ B-LOC
Pine _ _ I-LOC
Street, _ _ I-LOC
and _ _ O
was _ _ O
open _ _ O
for _ _ O
business _ _ O
that _ _ O
afternoon _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
the _ _ O
financial _ _ B-LOC
district's _ _ I-LOC
elevators _ _ O
began _ _ O
disgorging _ _ O
traders, _ _ O
bankers _ _ O
and _ _ O
analysts _ _ O
in _ _ O
search _ _ O
of _ _ O
5-o'clock _ _ O
refreshment. _ _ O
One _ _ O
reason _ _ O
it _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
crept _ _ O
up _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
it's _ _ O
a _ _ O
large, _ _ O
well-capitalized, _ _ O
big-time _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
kind _ _ O
that _ _ O
only _ _ O
established _ _ O
groups _ _ O
seem _ _ O
able _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
ground _ _ O
these _ _ O
days. _ _ O
Yet _ _ O
Crown _ _ B-EST
Shy _ _ I-EST
doesn't _ _ O
come _ _ O
from _ _ O
Danny _ _ O
Meyer, _ _ O
Andrew _ _ O
Carmellini _ _ O
or _ _ O
any _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
usual _ _ O
suspects. _ _ O
Its _ _ O
two _ _ O
main _ _ O
players _ _ O
were _ _ O
recruited _ _ O
after _ _ O
talks _ _ O
among _ _ O
April _ _ O
Bloomfield, _ _ O
Ken _ _ O
Friedman _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
building's _ _ O
developer _ _ O
fell _ _ O
apart _ _ O
in _ _ O
2016, _ _ O
before _ _ O
accusations _ _ O
of _ _ O
sexual _ _ O
harassment _ _ O
engulfed _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Friedman. _ _ O
Crown _ _ B-EST
Shy's _ _ I-EST
chef, _ _ O
James _ _ O
Kent, _ _ O
used _ _ O
to _ _ O
run _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
NoMad _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
and _ _ O
his _ _ O
partner, _ _ O
Jeff _ _ O
Katz, _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
managing _ _ O
partner _ _ O
at _ _ O
Del _ _ B-EST
Posto _ _ I-EST
. _ _ O
Neither _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
fell _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
turnip _ _ O
truck _ _ O
last _ _ O
week. _ _ O
As _ _ O
a _ _ O
team, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
they're _ _ O
unproven, _ _ O
and _ _ O
as _ _ O
they _ _ O
went _ _ O
through _ _ O
construction _ _ O
and _ _ O
hiring, _ _ O
the _ _ O
drumbeat _ _ O
of _ _ O
publicity _ _ O
was _ _ O
more _ _ O
muted _ _ O
than _ _ O
it _ _ O
might _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
if _ _ O
marquee _ _ O
names _ _ O
had _ _ O
led _ _ O
the _ _ O
project. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
Crown _ _ B-EST
Shy's _ _ I-EST
location, _ _ O
a _ _ O
sprawling, _ _ O
soaring, _ _ O
street-level _ _ O
space _ _ O
that, _ _ O
as _ _ O
far _ _ O
as _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
recalls, _ _ O
has _ _ O
never _ _ O
held _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
before. _ _ O
Many _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
have _ _ O
seen _ _ O
the _ _ O
1932 _ _ O
building's _ _ O
distinctive, _ _ O
hulking, _ _ O
pyramidal _ _ O
silhouette _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
skyline, _ _ O
but _ _ O
until _ _ O
recently, _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
offices _ _ O
on _ _ O
its _ _ O
67 _ _ O
stories _ _ O
were _ _ O
repurposed _ _ O
as _ _ O
expensive _ _ O
apartments _ _ O
and _ _ O
hotel _ _ O
rooms, _ _ O
not _ _ O
many _ _ O
had _ _ O
encountered _ _ O
the _ _ O
frenzied _ _ O
exuberance _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
lobby, _ _ O
which _ _ O
makes _ _ O
use _ _ O
of _ _ O
polished _ _ O
marble _ _ O
in _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
five _ _ O
contrasting _ _ O
colors. _ _ O
It _ _ O
looks _ _ O
like _ _ O
something _ _ O
Bernini _ _ O
would _ _ O
have _ _ O
designed _ _ O
if _ _ O
he'd _ _ O
lived _ _ O
to _ _ O
see _ _ O
the _ _ O
Jazz _ _ O
Age. _ _ O
Depending _ _ O
on _ _ O
which _ _ O
entrance _ _ O
you _ _ O
use _ _ O
-- _ _ O
the _ _ O
revolving _ _ O
doors _ _ O
are _ _ O
crowned _ _ O
with _ _ O
aluminum _ _ O
reliefs _ _ O
of _ _ O
Art _ _ O
Deco _ _ O
flowers _ _ O
being _ _ O
pollinated _ _ O
by _ _ O
elongated _ _ O
stylized _ _ O
butterflies _ _ O
-- _ _ O
you _ _ O
may _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
allow _ _ O
an _ _ O
extra _ _ O
five _ _ O
or _ _ O
10 _ _ O
minutes _ _ O
to _ _ O
take _ _ O
it _ _ O
all _ _ O
in _ _ O
before _ _ O
you _ _ O
eat. _ _ O
Above _ _ O
all, _ _ O
it's _ _ O
the _ _ O
extent _ _ O
to _ _ O
which _ _ O
Crown _ _ B-EST
Shy _ _ I-EST
already _ _ O
has _ _ O
its _ _ O
act _ _ O
together _ _ O
that _ _ O
makes _ _ O
you _ _ O
ask: _ _ O
Where _ _ O
did _ _ O
this _ _ O
place _ _ O
come _ _ O
from? _ _ O
The _ _ O
whole _ _ O
operation _ _ O
radiates _ _ O
confidence _ _ O
from _ _ O
start _ _ O
to _ _ O
finish. _ _ O
The _ _ O
finish _ _ O
brings _ _ O
real _ _ O
desserts _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
real _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Renata _ _ O
Ameni. _ _ O
She _ _ O
comes _ _ O
to _ _ O
Crown _ _ O
Shy _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
from _ _ O
Manresa, _ _ B-EST
in _ _ O
Los _ _ B-LOC
Gatos, _ _ I-LOC
Calif _ _ I-LOC
., _ _ I-LOC
and _ _ O
before _ _ O
that, _ _ O
she _ _ O
put _ _ O
in _ _ O
half _ _ O
a _ _ O
decade _ _ O
at _ _ O
Eleven _ _ B-EST
Madison _ _ I-EST
Park _ _ I-EST
. _ _ O
Her _ _ O
desserts _ _ O
at _ _ O
Crown _ _ B-EST
Shy _ _ I-EST
look _ _ O
uncomplicated, _ _ O
and _ _ O
you _ _ O
don't _ _ O
realize _ _ O
how _ _ O
intelligently _ _ O
they've _ _ O
been _ _ O
put _ _ O
together _ _ O
until _ _ O
you _ _ O
start _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat _ _ O
one. _ _ O
There's _ _ O
a _ _ O
milky-white _ _ O
yogurt _ _ B-DISH
cheesecake _ _ I-DISH
under _ _ O
tender _ _ O
spring _ _ O
strawberries, _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
strawberry _ _ B-FOOD
sorbet _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
center _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
pistachio _ _ B-FOOD
crumble _ _ I-FOOD
sprinkled _ _ O
over _ _ O
that. _ _ O
Her _ _ O
chocolate _ _ B-DISH
tart _ _ I-DISH
gives _ _ O
her _ _ O
a _ _ O
chance _ _ O
to _ _ O
show _ _ O
off _ _ O
about _ _ O
half _ _ O
a _ _ O
dozen _ _ O
different _ _ O
effects _ _ O
she _ _ O
can _ _ O
work _ _ O
with _ _ O
chocolate, _ _ B-FOOD
starting _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
crunchy, _ _ O
crumbly, _ _ O
almost _ _ O
salty _ _ O
chocolate _ _ B-FOOD
crust, _ _ I-FOOD
moving _ _ O
on _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
soft, _ _ O
soufflé-like _ _ O
filling _ _ O
and _ _ O
ending _ _ O
with _ _ O
curls _ _ O
of _ _ O
dark _ _ B-FOOD
chocolate. _ _ I-FOOD
Ms. _ _ O
Ameni's _ _ O
side _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
responsible _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
savory _ _ B-DISH
churros _ _ I-DISH
filled _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
Gruyère _ _ I-DISH
sauce _ _ I-DISH
-- _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
calls _ _ O
them _ _ O
fritters, _ _ B-DISH
they _ _ O
taste _ _ O
like _ _ O
gougères _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
texture _ _ O
is _ _ O
something _ _ O
else _ _ O
entirely. _ _ O
Also _ _ O
her _ _ O
work: _ _ O
the _ _ O
miniature _ _ O
loaf _ _ O
of _ _ O
pull-apart _ _ B-DISH
bread _ _ I-DISH
that _ _ O
appears _ _ O
after _ _ O
you _ _ O
order. _ _ O
With _ _ O
dried _ _ B-FOOD
olives _ _ I-FOOD
on _ _ O
top _ _ O
and _ _ O
olive _ _ B-FOOD
tapenade _ _ I-FOOD
between _ _ O
every _ _ O
skinny _ _ O
slice, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
memorable _ _ O
parts _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
meal. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
the _ _ O
obligatory _ _ O
scoops _ _ O
of _ _ O
ice _ _ B-FOOD
cream _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
seem _ _ O
required _ _ O
to _ _ O
offer _ _ O
aren't _ _ O
allowed _ _ O
to _ _ O
leave _ _ O
her _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
station _ _ O
until _ _ O
they've _ _ O
been _ _ O
turned _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
composed _ _ O
dessert, _ _ O
and _ _ O
not _ _ O
some _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
slapdash _ _ O
sundae _ _ B-FOOD
, _ _ O
either. _ _ O
Satsuma _ _ B-DISH
ice _ _ I-DISH

gets _ _ O
to _ _ O
wear _ _ O
a _ _ O
toasted _ _ O
turban _ _ O
of _ _ O
marshmallowy _ _ B-FOOD
meringue _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
some _ _ O
cracked _ _ O
honeycomb _ _ B-FOOD
candy _ _ I-FOOD
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
side. _ _ O
The _ _ O
effect _ _ O
is _ _ O
witty _ _ O
and _ _ O
delicious, _ _ O
progressing _ _ O
from _ _ O
purely _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
to _ _ O
bittersweet _ _ O
to _ _ O
tart _ _ O
and _ _ O
bittersweet. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Kent's _ _ O
savory _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
pursue _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
strategy. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
say, _ _ O
they _ _ O
regularly _ _ O
over-deliver, _ _ O
starting _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
iced _ _ B-DISH
Wellfleet _ _ I-DISH
oysters _ _ I-DISH
dressed _ _ O
with _ _ O
cucumber _ _ B-FOOD
jelly, _ _ I-FOOD
diced _ _ O
cucumbers, _ _ B-FOOD
grains _ _ O
of _ _ O
jalapeño _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
microleaves _ _ B-FOOD
of _ _ I-FOOD
purple _ _ I-FOOD

An _ _ O
almost _ _ O
absurdly _ _ O
creamy _ _ O

of _ _ O
white _ _ B-FOOD
bean _ _ I-FOOD
hummus _ _ I-FOOD
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
fiery _ _ O
red _ _ O
slick _ _ O
of _ _ O
melted _ _ B-FOOD
'nduja _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
probably _ _ O
meant _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
shared, _ _ O
but _ _ O
as _ _ O
soon _ _ O
as _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
tasted _ _ O
it _ _ O
I _ _ O
came _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
other _ _ O
ideas, _ _ O
as _ _ O
my _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
guests _ _ O
will _ _ O
testify. _ _ O
Two _ _ O
tartares _ _ B-DISH
show _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Kent's _ _ O
talent _ _ O
for _ _ O
carrying _ _ O
bright _ _ O
new _ _ O
ideas _ _ O
with _ _ O
him _ _ O
into _ _ O
well-traveled _ _ O
territory. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
first, _ _ O
he _ _ O
laces _ _ O
hand-chopped _ _ B-FOOD
raw _ _ I-FOOD
beef _ _ I-FOOD
with _ _ O
toasted _ _ B-FOOD
walnuts _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
earthy _ _ O
rye _ _ B-FOOD
croutons; _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
other, _ _ O
chopped _ _ B-FOOD
raw _ _ I-FOOD
snapper _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
sprinkled _ _ O
with _ _ O
individual _ _ O
juice-filled _ _ O
vesicles _ _ O
of _ _ O
grapefruit, _ _ B-FOOD
lime, _ _ B-FOOD
lemon _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
orange _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
pop _ _ O
between _ _ O
your _ _ O
teeth, _ _ O
a _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
instant, _ _ O
interactive _ _ O
ceviche. _ _ B-FOOD
Maybe _ _ O
one _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
ideas _ _ O
should _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
left _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
side _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
road. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-DISH
liver _ _ I-DISH
ragù _ _ I-DISH
tossed _ _ O
with _ _ O
housemade _ _ O
cavatelli _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
need _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
so _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
with _ _ O
sherry; _ _ O
a _ _ O
rough _ _ O
pesto _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
fine _ _ O
use _ _ O
for _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
chickpeas, _ _ O
but _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
there _ _ O
a _ _ O
better _ _ O
partner _ _ O
for _ _ O
it _ _ O
than _ _ O
shaved _ _ O
jicama? _ _ O
All _ _ O
is _ _ O
forgiven _ _ O
when _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Kent _ _ O
turns _ _ O
a _ _ O
mainstay _ _ O
like _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
main _ _ O
course _ _ O
as _ _ O
exciting _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
at _ _ O
Crown _ _ O
Shy, _ _ O
which _ _ O
keeps _ _ O
the _ _ O
sunshine _ _ O
brightness _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
citrus _ _ O
marinade, _ _ O
and _ _ O
is _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
purée-slash-hot _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
of _ _ O
fermented _ _ O
hot _ _ O
and _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
peppers. _ _ O
The _ _ O
vivid _ _ O
orange _ _ O
of _ _ O
that _ _ O
hot _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
almost _ _ O
matches _ _ O
the _ _ O
marble _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
lobby. _ _ O
But _ _ O
Crown _ _ O
Shy's _ _ O
two _ _ O
big _ _ O
dining _ _ O
rooms _ _ O
and _ _ O
extended _ _ O
bar _ _ O
are _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
more _ _ O
restrained, _ _ O
dominated _ _ O
by _ _ O
cream _ _ O
tones, _ _ O
blond _ _ O
wood _ _ O
tables, _ _ O
and _ _ O
chairs _ _ O
with _ _ O
saddle-brown _ _ O
leather _ _ O
seats _ _ O
and _ _ O
backs. _ _ O
The _ _ O
only _ _ O
echoes _ _ O
of _ _ O
grandeur _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
enormous _ _ O
windows _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
ceiling _ _ O
high _ _ O
up _ _ O
overhead. _ _ O
The _ _ O
wine _ _ O
list _ _ O

yes, _ _ O
it _ _ O

Obviously _ _ O
that _ _ O

to _ _ O
the _ _ O

any _ _ O

in _ _ O

Each _ _ O

you _ _ O
realize _ _ O
fairly _ _ O
quickly _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
essentially _ _ O
two _ _ O
choices: _ _ O
You _ _ O
can _ _ O
use _ _ O
a _ _ O
spoon, _ _ O
or _ _ O
hold _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
to _ _ O
your _ _ O
mouth _ _ O
and _ _ O

it _ _ O
up _ _ O
while _ _ O

your _ _ O

back, _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
doing _ _ O
a _ _ O
Jell-O _ _ B-DISH

If _ _ O
you _ _ O
go _ _ O
the _ _ O
Jell-O _ _ B-DISH
shot _ _ I-DISH
route, _ _ O
it _ _ O
may _ _ O
help _ _ O
to _ _ O
bring _ _ O
a _ _ O
pair _ _ O
of _ _ O
chopsticks _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
fingertip _ _ O
into _ _ O
play _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O

minute _ _ O
to _ _ O
encourage _ _ O
the _ _ O
banh _ _ B-DISH
beo _ _ I-DISH
to _ _ O
leave _ _ O
the _ _ O
nest. _ _ O
You _ _ O
have _ _ O
now _ _ O
transferred _ _ O
to _ _ O
your _ _ O
mouth _ _ O
a _ _ O
warm _ _ O
divot _ _ O
of _ _ O
steamed _ _ B-FOOD
rice _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ I-FOOD
tapioca _ _ I-FOOD
flours _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
consistency _ _ O
like _ _ O
panna _ _ B-DISH

and _ _ O
a _ _ O
negligible _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
on _ _ O
its _ _ O
own. _ _ O
All _ _ O
the _ _ O
action _ _ O
is _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O

these _ _ O
include _ _ O
a _ _ O

of _ _ O

scallions _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
green _ _ B-FOOD
oil _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
they _ _ O
were _ _ O
sizzled, _ _ O
red _ _ O
rings _ _ O
of _ _ O
fresh _ _ O

some _ _ O

in _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
pork _ _ B-FOOD
rinds _ _ I-FOOD
a _ _ O
banh _ _ B-FOOD
beo _ _ I-FOOD
vendor _ _ O
in _ _ O
Hue _ _ B-LOC
would _ _ O
use. _ _ O
The _ _ O
divot _ _ O
of _ _ O
rice _ _ B-FOOD
cake _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
warm, _ _ O
which _ _ O
helps _ _ O
the _ _ O
aromas _ _ O
drive _ _ O
their _ _ O
way _ _ O
into _ _ O
your _ _ O
head. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
over _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
minute. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you're _ _ O
lucky, _ _ O
there _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
another _ _ O
banh _ _ B-DISH
beo _ _ I-DISH
on _ _ O
the _ _ O

you _ _ O

who _ _ O

in _ _ O

by _ _ O

Ms. _ _ O
Wong _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef. _ _ O
Though _ _ O
she _ _ O
has _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
at _ _ O
Gramercy _ _ B-EST
Tavern _ _ I-EST
and _ _ O
Battersby _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
her _ _ O
background _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
of _ _ O
Vietnam _ _ B-LOC
before _ _ O
Van _ _ B-EST
Da _ _ I-EST
was _ _ O
more _ _ O
or _ _ O
less _ _ O
confined _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
roughly _ _ O
two _ _ O
weeks _ _ O
she _ _ O
spent _ _ O
traveling _ _ O
there _ _ O
while _ _ O
living _ _ O
in _ _ O
Hong _ _ B-LOC
Kong _ _ I-LOC
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
Fulbright _ _ O
grant _ _ O
a _ _ O
decade _ _ O
ago. _ _ O
Nevertheless, _ _ O
she _ _ O
has _ _ O
put _ _ O
together _ _ O
a _ _ O
trenchant, _ _ O
concise _ _ O
and _ _ O
pleasure-focused _ _ O
menu _ _ O
of _ _ O
Vietnamese _ _ B-CUISINE
dishes. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
she _ _ O
learned _ _ O
directly _ _ O
from _ _ O
her _ _ O
boss, _ _ O
and _ _ O
on _ _ O
those _ _ O
recipes _ _ O
she _ _ O
was _ _ O
apparently _ _ O
discouraged _ _ O
from _ _ O
drawing _ _ O
outside _ _ O
the _ _ O
lines. _ _ O
Others _ _ O
are _ _ O
more _ _ O
freely _ _ O
interpreted. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
a _ _ O
credit _ _ O
to _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Wong's _ _ O
sensitivity _ _ O
that _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
don't _ _ O
already _ _ O
know _ _ O
the _ _ O
original _ _ O
templates, _ _ O
it _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
tell _ _ O
where _ _ O
they _ _ O
end _ _ O
and _ _ O
her _ _ O
imagination _ _ O
begins. _ _ O
Banh _ _ B-FOOD

and _ _ O
the _ _ O

Ms. _ _ O
Wong _ _ O
get _ _ O
their _ _ O
own _ _ O
berth _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
As _ _ O
you'd _ _ O

very _ _ O
good. _ _ O

In _ _ O
Vietnam, _ _ B-LOC
the _ _ O
cups _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
shrimp. _ _ B-FOOD
Ms. _ _ O
Wong _ _ O
instead _ _ O
spoons _ _ O
sautéed _ _ B-FOOD
mushrooms _ _ I-FOOD
into _ _ O
hers, _ _ O
along _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
crisscrossing _ _ O
of _ _ O
fresh _ _ B-FOOD
herbs _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
spill _ _ O
of _ _ O
coconut _ _ O

Ms. _ _ O
Wong _ _ O
makes _ _ O
an _ _ O
effort _ _ O
to _ _ O
bring _ _ O
out _ _ O
regional _ _ O
differences _ _ O
in _ _ O
Vietnamese _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
by _ _ O
devoting _ _ O
sections _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
to _ _ O
Saigon _ _ O
and _ _ O
Hanoi, _ _ O
hundreds _ _ O
of _ _ O
miles _ _ O
apart, _ _ O
as _ _ O
well _ _ O
as _ _ O
Hue, _ _ O
somewhere _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
middle. _ _ O
She _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
have _ _ O
quite _ _ O
enough _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
from _ _ O
any _ _ O
one _ _ O
place _ _ O
to _ _ O
paint _ _ O
a _ _ O
full _ _ O
picture, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
project _ _ O
is _ _ O
intriguing. _ _ O
Like _ _ O
other _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
chefs, _ _ O
she _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
caught _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
tractor _ _ O
beam _ _ O
of _ _ O
cha _ _ O
ca _ _ O
la _ _ O
Vong _ _ O
, _ _ O
the _ _ O
turmeric-and _ _ O
dill-scented _ _ O
fish _ _ O
dish _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
specialty _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
100-year-old _ _ O
Hanoi _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
name. _ _ O
Her _ _ O
version, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
supplies _ _ O
less _ _ O
dill, _ _ O
less _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
and _ _ O
less _ _ O
satisfaction _ _ O
than _ _ O
some _ _ O
others. _ _ O
Her _ _ O
two _ _ O
improvisations _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
theme _ _ O
of _ _ O
Hanoi's _ _ O
best-known _ _ O
contribution _ _ O
to _ _ O
gastronomy, _ _ O
pho, _ _ O
are _ _ O
more _ _ O
effective. _ _ O
One _ _ O
gives _ _ O
you _ _ O
the _ _ O
soup _ _ O
without _ _ O
the _ _ O
noodles; _ _ O
floating _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
rich _ _ O
and _ _ O
cloudy _ _ O
broth _ _ O
are _ _ O
ghostly _ _ O
white, _ _ O
billowing _ _ O
won _ _ O
tons _ _ O
that _ _ O
contain _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
beef _ _ O
fillet _ _ O
freely _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
with _ _ O
black _ _ O
pepper. _ _ O
The _ _ O
other _ _ O
dish _ _ O
is, _ _ O
humbly _ _ O
enough, _ _ O
a _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
soupless _ _ O
pho _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
stir-fried _ _ O
with _ _ O
springy _ _ O
mushrooms, _ _ O
bitter _ _ O
greens _ _ O
and _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
scallions. _ _ O
Its _ _ O
simplicity _ _ O
makes _ _ O
the _ _ O
impact _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
explain _ _ O
until _ _ O
you _ _ O
learn _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
showered _ _ O
with _ _ O
Maggi _ _ O
Seasoning _ _ O
, _ _ O
a _ _ O
soylike _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
invisible _ _ O
secret _ _ O
of _ _ O
many _ _ O
Vietnamese _ _ O
dishes. _ _ O
Nodding _ _ O
toward _ _ O
Saigon, _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Wong _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
rendition _ _ O
of _ _ O
shaking _ _ O
beef _ _ O
by _ _ O
stir-frying _ _ O
tender _ _ O
and _ _ O
chewy _ _ O
marinated _ _ O
hanger _ _ O
steak _ _ O
with _ _ O
potatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
throwing _ _ O
a _ _ O
fistful _ _ O
of _ _ O
watercress _ _ O
at _ _ O
it. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
think _ _ O
that _ _ O
sounds _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
French _ _ O
bistro _ _ O
plate, _ _ O
then _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
starting _ _ O
to _ _ O
understand _ _ O
how _ _ O
her _ _ O
mind _ _ O
works. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Wong _ _ O
cooks _ _ O
skillfully, _ _ O
with _ _ O
an _ _ O
appreciation _ _ O
for _ _ O
nuance, _ _ O
and _ _ O
she _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
abuse _ _ O
her _ _ O
freedom _ _ O
by _ _ O
innovating _ _ O
pointlessly. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
possible, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
that _ _ O
she _ _ O
could _ _ O
stand _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
less _ _ O
shy _ _ O
with _ _ O
chiles _ _ O
and _ _ O
herbs. _ _ O
The _ _ O
table _ _ O
salad _ _ O
of _ _ O
greenery _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
wrapped _ _ O
around _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
offers _ _ O
no _ _ O
herbs _ _ O
other _ _ O
than _ _ O
mint _ _ O
and _ _ O
basil, _ _ O
and _ _ O
you'll _ _ O
run _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
lettuce _ _ O
before _ _ O
the _ _ O
fourth _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
dressed. _ _ O
The _ _ O
green _ _ O
papaya _ _ O
salad _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
too _ _ O
innocuous, _ _ O
and _ _ O
while _ _ O
her _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
street _ _ O
snack _ _ O
of _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
corn _ _ O
in _ _ O
fish _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
real _ _ O
success, _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
chiles _ _ O
would _ _ O
have _ _ O
more _ _ O
impact _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
chile _ _ O
threads _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Wong _ _ O
balances _ _ O
on _ _ O
top. _ _ O
(Incidentally, _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
at _ _ O
Van _ _ O
Da _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
fine _ _ O
hot _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
milder _ _ O
and _ _ O
less _ _ O
acidic _ _ O
Sriracha, _ _ O
but _ _ O
servers _ _ O
never _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
remember _ _ O
to _ _ O
mention _ _ O
it _ _ O
until _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
meal.) _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
just _ _ O
three _ _ O
desserts. _ _ O
By _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
you _ _ O
order, _ _ O
one _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
may _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
86ed. _ _ O
With _ _ O
luck, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
the _ _ O
che _ _ O
will _ _ O
have _ _ O
survived. _ _ O
In _ _ O
Vietnam, _ _ O
che _ _ O
is _ _ O
thought _ _ O
of _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
drink _ _ O
even _ _ O
though _ _ O
it _ _ O
can _ _ O
take _ _ O
the _ _ O
form _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
pudding, _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
does _ _ O
here, _ _ O
where _ _ O
warm _ _ O
pearls _ _ O
and _ _ O
threads _ _ O
of _ _ O
tapioca _ _ O
are _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
in _ _ O
coconut _ _ O
milk _ _ O
with _ _ O
cubes _ _ O
of _ _ O
soft _ _ O
taro. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
just _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
qualify _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
dessert. _ _ O
A _ _ O
black _ _ O
dust _ _ O
darkens _ _ O
the _ _ O
surface: _ _ O
black-sesame _ _ O
brittle, _ _ O
ground _ _ O
to _ _ O
powder. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
a _ _ O
single _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
qualifies _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
impressive _ _ O
feat _ _ O
inside _ _ O
Van _ _ O
Da's _ _ O
tight _ _ O
quarters. _ _ O
Through _ _ O
the _ _ O
miracle _ _ O
of _ _ O
careful _ _ O

almost _ _ O
never _ _ O

this _ _ O

In _ _ O

Talking _ _ O
about _ _ O
how _ _ O
good _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
Thomas _ _ O
Keller's _ _ O
new _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
is _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
easier _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
weren't _ _ O
also _ _ O
painfully _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
step _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
city's _ _ O
mood. _ _ O
TAK _ _ B-EST
Room _ _ I-EST
is _ _ O
so _ _ O
determined _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
"timeless," _ _ O
as _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Keller _ _ O
has _ _ O
often _ _ O
called _ _ O
it, _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
seems _ _ O
clueless. _ _ O
TAK _ _ B-EST
Room _ _ I-EST
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
March, _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
11 _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
inside _ _ O
the _ _ O
720,000-square-foot _ _ O
mall _ _ O
at _ _ O
20 _ _ B-LOC
Hudson _ _ I-LOC
Yards. _ _ I-LOC
Parts _ _ O
of _ _ O
Hudson _ _ B-LOC
Yards _ _ I-LOC
are _ _ O
still _ _ O
under _ _ O
construction, _ _ O
but _ _ O
enough _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
finished _ _ O
for _ _ O
most _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
to _ _ O
figure _ _ O
out _ _ O
that _ _ O
this _ _ O
fistful _ _ O
of _ _ O
glass _ _ O
needles _ _ O
stabbed _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
West _ _ B-LOC
Side _ _ I-LOC
wasn't _ _ O
built _ _ O
for _ _ O
them. _ _ O
Just _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
helipad _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
offered _ _ O
to _ _ O
build _ _ O
for _ _ O
Amazon _ _ O
crystallized _ _ O
anger _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
cruddy _ _ O
state _ _ O
of _ _ O
our _ _ O
subways, _ _ O
the _ _ O
glittering _ _ O
new _ _ O
home _ _ O
on _ _ O
10th _ _ B-LOC
Avenue _ _ I-LOC
for _ _ O
global _ _ O
luxury _ _ O
brands, _ _ O
investment _ _ O
funds, _ _ O
law _ _ O
firms, _ _ O
business _ _ O
travelers _ _ O
and _ _ O
hunters _ _ O
of _ _ O
seven- _ _ O
or _ _ O
eight-figure _ _ O
apartments _ _ O
spurred _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
to _ _ O
ask, _ _ O
What's _ _ O
in _ _ O
it _ _ O
for _ _ O
us? _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Keller's _ _ O
answer _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
looks _ _ O
and _ _ O
acts _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
millionaire's _ _ O
hangout _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
old _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorker _ _ O
cartoon. _ _ O
It _ _ O
charges _ _ O
like _ _ O
one, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
with _ _ O
adjustments _ _ O
for _ _ O
inflation. _ _ O
An _ _ O
eggplant _ _ B-DISH
Parmesan _ _ I-DISH
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
least _ _ O
expensive _ _ O
main _ _ O
course, _ _ O
at _ _ O
$30, _ _ O
followed _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
New _ _ B-DISH
Zealand _ _ I-DISH
salmon _ _ I-DISH
for _ _ O
$42. _ _ O
After _ _ O
that, _ _ O
please _ _ O
turn _ _ O
off _ _ O
all _ _ O
electronic _ _ O
devices _ _ O
and _ _ O
place _ _ O
your _ _ O
tray _ _ O
tables _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
upright, _ _ O
locked _ _ O
position, _ _ O
because _ _ O
we _ _ O
are _ _ O
going _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
$66 _ _ O
and _ _ O
$75 _ _ O
before _ _ O
reaching _ _ O
a _ _ O
cruising _ _ O
altitude _ _ O
of _ _ O
$85. _ _ O
Look _ _ O
down _ _ O
there _ _ O
-- _ _ O
don't _ _ O
the _ _ O
people _ _ O
look _ _ O
just _ _ O
like _ _ O
ants? _ _ O
TAK _ _ B-EST
Room's _ _ I-EST
timing _ _ O
is _ _ O
off _ _ O
in _ _ O
other _ _ O
ways, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
Hudson _ _ B-LOC
Yards _ _ I-LOC
has _ _ O
stirred _ _ O
up _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers' _ _ O
latent _ _ O
resentment _ _ O
of _ _ O
chain _ _ O
stores _ _ O
from _ _ O
beyond _ _ O
the _ _ O
Hudson, _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
what _ _ O
does _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Keller _ _ O
offer _ _ O
them _ _ O
but _ _ O
a _ _ O
clone _ _ O
of _ _ O
his _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
Florida, _ _ B-LOC
the _ _ O
Surf _ _ B-EST
Club _ _ I-EST
? _ _ O
The _ _ O
name _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
changed, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
menus _ _ O
are _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
identical; _ _ O
they _ _ O
glorify _ _ O
the _ _ O
strait-laced, _ _ O
spice-free _ _ O
food _ _ O
that _ _ O
rich _ _ O
white _ _ O
Americans _ _ O
used _ _ O
to _ _ O
feed _ _ O
on _ _ O
when _ _ O
nobody _ _ O
was _ _ O
shaming _ _ O
them _ _ O
into _ _ O
being _ _ O
adventurous. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
of _ _ O
"21," _ _ O
of _ _ O
three-martini _ _ O
lunches, _ _ O
steakhouses _ _ B-DIET
and _ _ O
country _ _ O
clubs: _ _ O
prime _ _ B-DISH
rib _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ I-DISH
Dover _ _ I-DISH
sole, _ _ I-DISH
iceberg _ _ B-DISH
lettuce _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ I-DISH
oysters _ _ I-DISH
Rockefeller. _ _ I-DISH
Of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
being _ _ O
a _ _ O
Thomas _ _ O
Keller _ _ O
production, _ _ O
TAK _ _ B-EST
Room _ _ I-EST
serves _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
refined, _ _ O
meticulous _ _ O
country _ _ O
club _ _ O
food _ _ O
you've _ _ O
ever _ _ O
seen. _ _ O
Most _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
very _ _ O
good, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
things _ _ O
are _ _ O
so _ _ O
inexplicably _ _ O
delicious _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
the _ _ O
sensation _ _ O
of _ _ O
slipping _ _ O
the _ _ O
knots _ _ O
of _ _ O
gravity _ _ O
and _ _ O
floating _ _ O
an _ _ O
inch _ _ O
or _ _ O
so _ _ O
above _ _ O
your _ _ O
seat. _ _ O
The _ _ O
entrance _ _ O
is _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
fifth _ _ O
floor, _ _ O
just _ _ O
past _ _ O
Neiman _ _ O
Marcus. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
action _ _ O
is _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
sixth _ _ O
floor, _ _ O
up _ _ O
a _ _ O
Deco-cubist _ _ O
staircase _ _ O
so _ _ O
grand _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
may _ _ O
feel _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
underdressed _ _ O
unless _ _ O
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
Carole _ _ O
Lombard _ _ O
on _ _ O
one _ _ O
arm. _ _ O
(There _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
dress _ _ O
code.) _ _ O
At _ _ O
the _ _ O
top, _ _ O
you _ _ O
find _ _ O
yourself _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
lounge _ _ O
where _ _ O
a _ _ O
pianist _ _ O
and _ _ O
upright _ _ O
bassist _ _ O
glide _ _ O
through _ _ O
satiny _ _ O
jazz _ _ O
standards. _ _ O
Bartenders _ _ O
whip _ _ O
up _ _ O
streamlined, _ _ O
uncomplicated _ _ O
drinks _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
either _ _ O
genuine _ _ O
classics, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
Pendennis _ _ B-DISH
Club, _ _ I-DISH
or _ _ O
modern _ _ O
drinks _ _ O
built _ _ O
along _ _ O
classic _ _ O
proportions, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
Tritter _ _ B-DISH
rickey, _ _ I-DISH
a _ _ O
tall, _ _ O
fizzy _ _ O
gin _ _ O
number _ _ O
that _ _ O
shimmies _ _ O
with _ _ O
absinthe. _ _ O
Around _ _ O
sunset, _ _ O
when _ _ O
pink _ _ O
light _ _ O
trickles _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
western _ _ O
windows, _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
pleasant _ _ O
room _ _ O
within _ _ O
a _ _ O
mile _ _ O
for _ _ O
fighting _ _ O
vainly _ _ O
the _ _ O
old _ _ O
ennui _ _ O
. _ _ O
They _ _ O
let _ _ O
people _ _ O
eat _ _ O
in _ _ O
this _ _ O
room, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
tempting. _ _ O
But _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
to _ _ O
see, _ _ O
room _ _ O
after _ _ O
room, _ _ O
all _ _ O
laid _ _ O
out _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
London _ _ O
interior-design _ _ O
firm _ _ O
David _ _ O
Collins _ _ O
Studio. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
leather _ _ O
banquettes _ _ O
deep _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
lose _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
child _ _ O
in. _ _ O
Facing _ _ O
them _ _ O
are _ _ O
mohair-velvet _ _ O
chairs _ _ O
that _ _ O
swivel _ _ O
so _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
quietly _ _ O
surveil _ _ O
the _ _ O
room _ _ O
without _ _ O
craning _ _ O
your _ _ O
neck. _ _ O
Each _ _ O
table _ _ O
gets _ _ O
a _ _ O
white _ _ O
linen _ _ O
cloth _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
flickering _ _ O
oil _ _ O
lamp _ _ O
behind _ _ O
a _ _ O
white _ _ O
porcelain _ _ O
shade. _ _ O
The _ _ O
other _ _ O
colors _ _ O
are _ _ O
black _ _ O
walnut, _ _ O
midnight _ _ O
blue _ _ O
and _ _ O
law-firm _ _ O
green. _ _ O
At _ _ O
some _ _ O
point _ _ O
a _ _ O
captain _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
crisply _ _ O
tailored _ _ O
suit _ _ O
will _ _ O
deposit _ _ O
the _ _ O
wine _ _ O
list. _ _ O
It _ _ O
mostly _ _ O
avoids _ _ O
the _ _ O
latest _ _ O
fashions, _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
croquet _ _ O
party _ _ O
on _ _ O
Nantucket. _ _ O
Later _ _ O
there _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
preamble _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
Under _ _ O
the _ _ O
day-to-day _ _ O
care _ _ O
of _ _ O
Jarrod _ _ O
Huth, _ _ O
TAK _ _ O
Room's _ _ O
chef _ _ O
de _ _ O
cuisine, _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
continental _ _ O
theme _ _ O
and _ _ O
an _ _ O
à _ _ O
la _ _ O
carte _ _ O
format. _ _ O
Highlights _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
pointed _ _ O
out, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
prime _ _ O
rib _ _ O
will _ _ O
certainly _ _ O
be _ _ O
mentioned, _ _ O
as _ _ O
will _ _ O
the _ _ O
restored _ _ O
1930s _ _ O
silver _ _ O
trolley _ _ O
on _ _ O
which _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
ferried _ _ O
from _ _ O
table _ _ O
to _ _ O
table. _ _ O
Here _ _ O
comes _ _ O
a _ _ O
French _ _ O
onion _ _ O
dip _ _ O
surrounded _ _ O
by _ _ O
newly _ _ O
fried _ _ O
potato _ _ O
chips _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
dark _ _ O
without _ _ O
a _ _ O
hint _ _ O
of _ _ O
charring. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
TAK _ _ O
Room _ _ O
in _ _ O
one _ _ O
extremely _ _ O
crunchy, _ _ O
lusciously _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
bite: _ _ O
an _ _ O
hors _ _ O
d'oeuvre _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
age _ _ O
of _ _ O
Naugahyde _ _ O
and _ _ O
polyester, _ _ O
transformed _ _ O
into _ _ O
something _ _ O
so _ _ O
good _ _ O
and _ _ O
pure _ _ O
it's _ _ O
beyond _ _ O
reproach. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Parker _ _ O
House _ _ O
rolls _ _ O
are _ _ O
gravity-defying _ _ O
orbs _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
soft _ _ O
cultured _ _ O
butter _ _ O
that, _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
evening's _ _ O
best _ _ O
magic _ _ O
trick, _ _ O
rises _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
custom-made _ _ O
dish _ _ O
in _ _ O
six _ _ O
identical _ _ O
ridged _ _ O
curls _ _ O
, _ _ O
like _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
performing _ _ O
a _ _ O
Busby _ _ O
Berkeley _ _ O
routine. _ _ O
Bespoke _ _ O
flourishes _ _ O
like _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
a _ _ O
TAK _ _ O
Room _ _ O
hallmark; _ _ O
see _ _ O
also _ _ O
the _ _ O
oyster _ _ O
crackers, _ _ O
like _ _ O
down _ _ O
pillows _ _ O
shrunk _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
of _ _ O
Chiclets, _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
silk-smooth _ _ O
New _ _ O
England _ _ O
clam _ _ O
chowder _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
likable _ _ O
appetizers _ _ O
and, _ _ O
at _ _ O
$16, _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
value. _ _ O
Another _ _ O
hallmark, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
is _ _ O
unevenness. _ _ O
Avocado _ _ O
Louie _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
bouquet _ _ O
of _ _ O
other _ _ O
vegetables _ _ O
is _ _ O
thrillingly _ _ O
right, _ _ O
thanks _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
Thousand _ _ O
Island _ _ O
dressing _ _ O
that _ _ O
crackles _ _ O
with _ _ O
energy; _ _ O
the _ _ O
Caesar _ _ O
salad, _ _ O
made _ _ O
while _ _ O
you _ _ O
watch, _ _ O
has _ _ O
almost _ _ O
no _ _ O
personality. _ _ O
Grated _ _ O
Parmesan _ _ O
and _ _ O
anchovies _ _ O
vanish _ _ O
into _ _ O
it _ _ O
without _ _ O
a _ _ O
trace, _ _ O
along _ _ O
with _ _ O
dull _ _ O
croutons _ _ O
that _ _ O
could _ _ O
take _ _ O
some _ _ O
pointers _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
oyster _ _ O
crackers. _ _ O
Something _ _ O
called _ _ O
"warm _ _ O
soft _ _ O
boiled _ _ O
egg" _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
quietly _ _ O
joyous _ _ O
celebration _ _ O
of _ _ O
luxurious _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
and _ _ O
textures, _ _ O
the _ _ O
yolk _ _ O
running _ _ O
like _ _ O
lava _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
buckwheat _ _ O
blin _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
heap _ _ O
of _ _ O
warm _ _ O
osetra _ _ O
caviar _ _ O
in _ _ O
crème _ _ O
fraîche. _ _ O
(Yes, _ _ O
warm. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
wonderful.) _ _ O
And _ _ O
the _ _ O
chilled _ _ O
prawn _ _ O
cocktail _ _ O
is _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
my _ _ O
platonic _ _ O
ideal _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
from _ _ O
now _ _ O
on. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
crab _ _ O
cake _ _ O
had _ _ O
very _ _ O
little _ _ O
crab _ _ O
flavor, _ _ O
on _ _ O
two _ _ O
different _ _ O
nights, _ _ O
although _ _ O
it _ _ O
contained _ _ O
almost _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
else. _ _ O
Lobster _ _ O
thermidor _ _ O
(now _ _ O
there's _ _ O
a _ _ O
name _ _ O
I've _ _ O
not _ _ O
heard _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
long, _ _ O
long _ _ O
time) _ _ O
is _ _ O
so _ _ O
tender, _ _ O
its _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
so _ _ O
fluffy _ _ O
and _ _ O
rich, _ _ O
that _ _ O
eating _ _ O
it _ _ O
becomes _ _ O
an _ _ O
intimate _ _ O
act. _ _ O
Dover _ _ O
sole _ _ O
meunière, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
has _ _ O
neither _ _ O
the _ _ O
crisped _ _ O
skin _ _ O
nor _ _ O
the _ _ O
juicy _ _ O
flesh _ _ O
that _ _ O
can _ _ O
make _ _ O
this _ _ O
fish _ _ O
so _ _ O
alluring. _ _ O
Yes, _ _ O
life _ _ O
cannot _ _ O
be _ _ O
one _ _ O
giant _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
dancing _ _ O
butter-shrimp. _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
the _ _ O
gap _ _ O
between _ _ O
great _ _ O
and _ _ O
non-great _ _ O
items _ _ O
-- _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
comes _ _ O
close _ _ O
to _ _ O
bad _ _ O
-- _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
too _ _ O
wide _ _ O
and _ _ O
comes _ _ O
into _ _ O
view _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
too _ _ O
often. _ _ O
Regulars _ _ O
will _ _ O
learn _ _ O
to _ _ O
work _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
golfers _ _ O
learn _ _ O
their _ _ O
way _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
eighth _ _ O
hole _ _ O
at _ _ O
Pebble _ _ O
Beach. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
will _ _ O
love _ _ O
the _ _ O
prime _ _ O
rib, _ _ O
which _ _ O
could _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
any _ _ O
more _ _ O
moist _ _ O
without _ _ O
breaking _ _ O
several _ _ O
laws _ _ O
of _ _ O
chemistry. _ _ O
Others _ _ O
will _ _ O
wish _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
had _ _ O
more _ _ O
concentrated _ _ O
beef _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
flaps _ _ O
and _ _ O
handles _ _ O
had _ _ O
not _ _ O
been _ _ O
trimmed _ _ O
off, _ _ O
perhaps _ _ O
in _ _ O
pursuit _ _ O
of _ _ O
some _ _ O
Kellerian _ _ O
quest _ _ O
for _ _ O
bovine _ _ O
symmetry. _ _ O
A _ _ O
large _ _ O
number _ _ O
will _ _ O
settle _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
roast _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
for _ _ O
two. _ _ O
The _ _ O
meat _ _ O
is _ _ O
juicy _ _ O
but _ _ O
not _ _ O
gushy, _ _ O
the _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
full _ _ O
but _ _ O
not _ _ O
salty, _ _ O
the _ _ O
jus _ _ O
dark _ _ O
but _ _ O
not _ _ O
over-reduced. _ _ O
After _ _ O
the _ _ O
chicken, _ _ O
the _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Alex _ _ O
McClenaghan, _ _ O
can _ _ O
offer _ _ O
a _ _ O
highly _ _ O
refined _ _ O
coconut _ _ O
cake _ _ O
or _ _ O
an _ _ O
urbane _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
meringue _ _ O
tart, _ _ O
but _ _ O
you'd _ _ O
almost _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
insane _ _ O
not _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
the _ _ O
chocolate _ _ O
cake. _ _ O
Certainly _ _ O
a _ _ O
close _ _ O
relative _ _ O
of _ _ O
devil's _ _ O

cake, _ _ O
his _ _ O
version _ _ O
weaves _ _ O
dark-chocolate _ _ O
cremeux _ _ O
between _ _ O
its _ _ O
many, _ _ O
many _ _ O
layers, _ _ O
all _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
wrapped _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark-chocolate _ _ O
frosting. _ _ O
And _ _ O
there _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
regulars, _ _ O
because _ _ O
the _ _ O

if _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
find _ _ O
them _ _ O

for _ _ O
them, _ _ O
are _ _ O
as _ _ O
intense _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
chocolate _ _ O
in _ _ O
that _ _ O
cake. _ _ O
The _ _ O

"Does _ _ O
the _ _ O
sheep's _ _ B-DISH
head _ _ I-DISH
soup _ _ I-DISH
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
stuff _ _ O
in _ _ O
it?" _ _ O
I _ _ O
asked _ _ O
my _ _ O
server. _ _ O
Realizing _ _ O
that _ _ O
this _ _ O
was _ _ O
somewhat _ _ O
ambiguous, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
applied _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish _ _ O
as _ _ O
laden _ _ O
with _ _ O
stuff _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
brew _ _ O
of _ _ O
lambs' _ _ B-FOOD
snouts, _ _ I-FOOD
ears, _ _ B-FOOD
tongues, _ _ B-FOOD
cheeks _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
eyeballs _ _ B-FOOD
known _ _ O
in _ _ O
Turkey _ _ B-LOC
as _ _ O
kelle _ _ B-DISH
paca, _ _ I-DISH
I _ _ O
tried _ _ O
again. _ _ O
"Is _ _ O
it _ _ O
very _ _ O
filling, _ _ O
I _ _ O
mean?" _ _ O
My _ _ O
concern _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
familiar _ _ O
one, _ _ O
to _ _ O
me _ _ O
at _ _ O
least. _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
in _ _ O
Queens, _ _ B-LOC
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
Turkish _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
Astoria _ _ B-LOC
called _ _ O
Lokanta _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
was _ _ O
so _ _ O
appealing _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
to _ _ O
try _ _ O
it _ _ O
all. _ _ O
Already _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
set _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
bourekas, _ _ B-DISH
some _ _ O
labneh, _ _ B-DISH
the _ _ O
fava _ _ B-DISH
dip _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
some _ _ O
form _ _ O
of _ _ O
braised _ _ B-FOOD
lamb _ _ I-FOOD
over _ _ O
eggplant. _ _ B-FOOD
I'd _ _ O
spotted _ _ O
another _ _ O
three _ _ O
or _ _ O
four _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
probably _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
tack _ _ O
on _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
my _ _ O
order, _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
by _ _ O
afterthought. _ _ O
I _ _ O
suspected _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
could _ _ O
add _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
kelle _ _ B-DISH
paca _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
still _ _ O
eat _ _ O
everything _ _ O
else. _ _ O
But _ _ O
a _ _ O
big _ _ O
bowl, _ _ O
one _ _ O
so _ _ O
thick _ _ O
with _ _ O
bits _ _ O
formerly _ _ O
affixed _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
sheep's _ _ O
skull _ _ O
that _ _ O
a _ _ O
spoon _ _ O
would _ _ O
stand _ _ O
up _ _ O
in _ _ O
it, _ _ O
might _ _ O
tip _ _ O
the _ _ O
scale. _ _ O
The _ _ O
server _ _ O
pondered _ _ O
this _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
while _ _ O
until _ _ O
a _ _ O
wiry _ _ O
man _ _ O
got _ _ O
up _ _ O
from _ _ O
his _ _ O
marble-topped _ _ O
table _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
corner _ _ O
and _ _ O
conferred _ _ O
with _ _ O
her. _ _ O
Wearing _ _ O
baggy _ _ O
jeans, _ _ O
a _ _ O
white _ _ O
T-shirt _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
baseball _ _ O
cap _ _ O
that _ _ O
kept _ _ O
his _ _ O
zinc-colored _ _ O
ponytail _ _ O
in _ _ O
place, _ _ O
he _ _ O
looked _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
contractor, _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
a _ _ O
painter _ _ O
who'd _ _ O
come _ _ O
by _ _ O
to _ _ O
touch _ _ O
up _ _ O
the _ _ O
moldings _ _ O
and _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
invited _ _ O
to _ _ O
stay _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
Turkish _ _ B-FOOD
coffee. _ _ I-FOOD
Then _ _ O
he _ _ O
spoke _ _ O
to _ _ O
us _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
sheep's _ _ B-DISH
head _ _ I-DISH
soup. _ _ I-DISH
"I _ _ O
am _ _ O
a _ _ O
genius," _ _ O
he _ _ O
began. _ _ O
"And _ _ O
even _ _ O
I _ _ O
don't _ _ O
know _ _ O
how _ _ O
to _ _ O
answer _ _ O
this _ _ O
question. _ _ O
I _ _ O
think _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
question _ _ O
must _ _ O
be _ _ O
wrong." _ _ O
As _ _ O
those _ _ O
who _ _ O
chase _ _ O
the _ _ O
scent _ _ O
of _ _ O
lamb _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
charred _ _ B-FOOD
eggplant _ _ I-FOOD
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
have _ _ O
probably _ _ O
guessed, _ _ O
this _ _ O
was _ _ O
no _ _ O
contractor. _ _ O
This _ _ O
was _ _ O
Orhan _ _ O
Yegen, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Turkish-born _ _ O
chef _ _ O
and _ _ O
restaurateur _ _ O
who _ _ O
has _ _ O
opened _ _ O
close _ _ O
to _ _ O
20 _ _ O
Turkish _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
two _ _ O
decades _ _ O
or _ _ O
so _ _ O
while _ _ O
keeping _ _ O
up _ _ O
a _ _ O
running _ _ O
monologue _ _ O
that _ _ O
made _ _ O
him _ _ O
a _ _ O
favorite _ _ O
of _ _ O
food _ _ O
writers _ _ O
. _ _ O
In _ _ O
2004, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Yegen _ _ O
opened _ _ O
Sip _ _ B-EST
Sak _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
Turtle _ _ B-LOC
Bay, _ _ I-LOC
then _ _ O
proceeded _ _ O
to _ _ O
surprise _ _ O
those _ _ O
who _ _ O
had _ _ O
charted _ _ O
his _ _ O
career _ _ O
by _ _ O
embarking _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
long, _ _ O
stable _ _ O
period _ _ O
. _ _ O
All _ _ O
was _ _ O
quiet, _ _ O
relatively _ _ O
speaking, _ _ O
until _ _ O
April, _ _ O
when _ _ O
Lokanta _ _ B-EST
arrived _ _ O
in _ _ O
Astoria _ _ B-LOC
to _ _ O
supplement _ _ O
the _ _ O
Greek _ _ B-CUISINE
and _ _ O
Cypriot _ _ B-CUISINE
menus _ _ O
along _ _ O
its _ _ O
stretch _ _ O
of _ _ O
Broadway, _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Yegen _ _ O
arrived _ _ O
to _ _ O
tell _ _ O
customers _ _ O
that _ _ O
their _ _ O
questions _ _ O
were _ _ O
wrong. _ _ O
The _ _ O
kelle _ _ B-DISH
paca _ _ I-DISH
colloquy _ _ O
ended _ _ O
when _ _ O
I _ _ O
agreed _ _ O
to _ _ O
order _ _ O
it. _ _ O
After _ _ O
hours _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
stove, _ _ O
the _ _ O
meat _ _ B-FOOD
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
head _ _ O
had _ _ O
fallen _ _ O
away _ _ O
into _ _ O
about _ _ O
eight _ _ O
different _ _ O
textures, _ _ O
from _ _ O
frilly _ _ O
to _ _ O
ropy _ _ O
to _ _ O
collagenously _ _ O
chewy _ _ O
to _ _ O
tender _ _ O
and _ _ O
lean. _ _ O
All _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
suspended _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
slippery, _ _ O
almost _ _ O
sticky _ _ O
broth _ _ B-FOOD
the _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
cappuccino. _ _ B-FOOD
And _ _ O
no, _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
not _ _ O
too _ _ O
filling. _ _ O
Soups, _ _ B-FOOD
braises, _ _ B-FOOD
stews _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
recipes _ _ O
requiring _ _ O
plenty _ _ O
of _ _ O
time _ _ O
and _ _ O
even _ _ O
more _ _ O
olive _ _ B-FOOD
oil _ _ I-FOOD
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
basis _ _ O
of _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Yegen's _ _ O
reputation. _ _ O
They _ _ O
set _ _ O
his _ _ O
menus _ _ O
apart _ _ O
from _ _ O
those _ _ O
at _ _ O
other _ _ O
Turkish _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurants _ _ O
around _ _ O
town, _ _ O
which _ _ O
tend _ _ O
to _ _ O
revolve _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
grill. _ _ O
Lokanta _ _ B-EST
makes _ _ O
very _ _ O
fine _ _ O
kofte, _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
full _ _ O
medley _ _ O
of _ _ O
minced _ _ O
and _ _ O
skewered _ _ O
meats, _ _ B-FOOD
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
better _ _ O
off _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
swaying _ _ O
chandeliers _ _ O
of _ _ O
Taci's _ _ B-EST
Beyti _ _ I-EST
on _ _ O
Coney _ _ B-LOC
Island _ _ I-LOC
Avenue _ _ I-LOC
in _ _ O
Brooklyn. _ _ B-LOC
Lokanta _ _ B-EST
will _ _ O
grill _ _ O
or _ _ O
roast _ _ O
a _ _ O
whole _ _ O
fish, _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
all _ _ O
that _ _ O
different _ _ O
from _ _ O
what _ _ O
might _ _ O
be _ _ O
served _ _ O
in _ _ O
Brooklyn _ _ B-LOC
at _ _ O
Liman _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
where _ _ O
your _ _ O
bass _ _ B-FOOD
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
filleted _ _ O
within _ _ O
view _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
fishing _ _ O
boats _ _ O
and _ _ O
swans _ _ O
of _ _ O
Sheepshead _ _ B-LOC
Bay. _ _ I-LOC
Diners _ _ O
in _ _ O
Lokanta's _ _ B-EST
custody _ _ O
have _ _ O
signed _ _ O
on _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
more _ _ O
nuanced _ _ O
view _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Turkish _ _ B-CUISINE
kitchen. _ _ O
Take, _ _ O
for _ _ O
instance, _ _ O
the _ _ O
shadings _ _ O
that _ _ O
lamb _ _ B-FOOD
takes _ _ O
on. _ _ O
In _ _ O
hunkar _ _ B-DISH
begendi, _ _ I-DISH
chunks _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
are _ _ O
stewed _ _ O
in _ _ O
tomatoes _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
peppers _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
ladled _ _ O
over _ _ O
an _ _ O
eggplant _ _ B-FOOD
mash _ _ I-FOOD
beaten _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
memorable _ _ O
richness _ _ O
with _ _ O
cheese _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
milk. _ _ B-FOOD
Ali _ _ B-DISH
nazik _ _ I-DISH
is, _ _ O
in _ _ O
schematic _ _ O
form, _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
thing, _ _ O
built _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
foundation _ _ O
of _ _ O
milky _ _ O
eggplant, _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
in _ _ O
Lokanta's _ _ B-EST
version _ _ O
the _ _ O
lamb _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
ground _ _ O
and _ _ O
simmered _ _ O
with _ _ O
onions _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
red _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ I-FOOD
green _ _ I-FOOD
peppers; _ _ I-FOOD
somehow _ _ O
it _ _ O
achieves _ _ O
a _ _ O
rich, _ _ O
unctuous _ _ O
consistency _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
amplified _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
eggplant _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
scoop _ _ O
of _ _ O
strained _ _ O
yogurt _ _ O
dropped _ _ O
on _ _ O
top. _ _ O
Lokanta's _ _ O
"roasted _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
and _ _ O
rice" _ _ O
is _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
pilaf _ _ O
family, _ _ O
which _ _ O
means _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
rice _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
just _ _ O
a _ _ O
side _ _ O
dish _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
heart _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
recipe, _ _ O
baked _ _ O
until _ _ O
alluringly _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
with _ _ O
currants, _ _ O
allspice _ _ O
and _ _ O
cinnamon, _ _ O
then _ _ O
sprinkled _ _ O
with _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
dill _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
minute. _ _ O
The _ _ O
lamb's _ _ O
job _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
obligingly _ _ O
tender, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
succeeds, _ _ O
one _ _ O
reason _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
is _ _ O
requested _ _ O
by _ _ O
so _ _ O
many _ _ O
tables. _ _ O
To _ _ O
fend _ _ O
off _ _ O
boredom, _ _ O
I _ _ O
imagine, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Yegen _ _ O
fills _ _ O
his _ _ O
manti _ _ O
with _ _ O
both _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
and _ _ O
beef. _ _ O
Each _ _ O
little _ _ O
dumpling _ _ O
is _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
by _ _ O
fingertip _ _ O
and _ _ O
is _ _ O
roughly _ _ O
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
of _ _ O
one. _ _ O
The _ _ O
meat _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
just _ _ O
forcefully _ _ O
enough _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
announce _ _ O
itself, _ _ O
politely _ _ O
but _ _ O
clearly, _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
breaks _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
dough. _ _ O
It _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
possible _ _ O
to _ _ O
sit _ _ O
down _ _ O
in _ _ O
front _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
these, _ _ O
spooning _ _ O
them _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
their _ _ O
warm _ _ O
yogurt _ _ O
and _ _ O
chile _ _ O
oil _ _ O
and _ _ O
dried _ _ O
mint, _ _ O
and _ _ O
call _ _ O
for _ _ O
another _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
a _ _ O
minute _ _ O
later. _ _ O
Of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
the _ _ O
meal _ _ O
should _ _ O
begin _ _ O
with _ _ O
strips _ _ O
of _ _ O
nigella-dotted _ _ O
Turkish _ _ O
bread _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
spread _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
-- _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
memorably _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
purée _ _ O
of _ _ O
dried _ _ O
favas; _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
roughly _ _ O
mashed _ _ O
eggplant, _ _ O
smoky _ _ O
without _ _ O
a _ _ O
trace _ _ O
of _ _ O
bitterness; _ _ O
and _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
strained-yogurt _ _ O
dips, _ _ O
either _ _ O
the _ _ O
tangy _ _ O
cacik, _ _ O
laced _ _ O
with _ _ O
minced _ _ O
cucumbers, _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
labneh, _ _ O
as _ _ O
firm _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
mattress. _ _ O
Either _ _ O
will _ _ O
prove _ _ O
useful _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
meal _ _ O
goes _ _ O
on. _ _ O
So _ _ O
will _ _ O
a _ _ O
simple _ _ O
salad, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
with _ _ O
white _ _ O
beans _ _ O
and _ _ O
purple _ _ O
onions. _ _ O
The _ _ O
tightly _ _ O
rolled, _ _ O
golden _ _ O
bourekas _ _ O
are _ _ O
like _ _ O
skinny _ _ O
Turkish _ _ O
spring _ _ O
rolls _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
dill _ _ O
and _ _ O
melting _ _ O
feta. _ _ O
Cold _ _ O
poached _ _ O
leeks, _ _ O
a _ _ O
frequent _ _ O
special, _ _ O
are _ _ O
more _ _ O
appealing _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
cold _ _ O
poached _ _ O
artichokes _ _ O
that _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
permanent _ _ O
spot _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
If _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Yegen _ _ O
tells _ _ O
you _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
octopus _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
city, _ _ O
keep _ _ O
in _ _ O
mind _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
rarely _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
leave _ _ O
his _ _ O
own _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
quite _ _ O
good, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
fugitive _ _ O
sweetness _ _ O
that _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
supplied _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
tomatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
purple _ _ O
onions. _ _ O
Desserts _ _ O
run _ _ O
toward _ _ O
milky _ _ O
white _ _ O
puddings, _ _ O
nice _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
looking _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
mild _ _ O
sedative. _ _ O
The _ _ O
baklava, _ _ O
imported _ _ O
from _ _ O
Turkey, _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
treat _ _ O
for _ _ O
those _ _ O
of _ _ O
us _ _ O
who _ _ O
like _ _ O
pistachios _ _ O
and _ _ O
think _ _ O
sugar _ _ O
syrup _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
better _ _ O
baklava _ _ O
sweetener _ _ O
than _ _ O
honey. _ _ O
The _ _ O
unlikely _ _ O
champion, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
butternut _ _ O
squash _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
languorously _ _ O
baked _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
own _ _ O
juices _ _ O
with _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
but _ _ O
sugar. _ _ O
The _ _ O
technique _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
those _ _ O
small _ _ O
tricks _ _ O
that _ _ O
helps _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Yegen's _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
stand _ _ O
out, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
perfume _ _ O
of _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
peel _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O

Lokanta _ _ O

Some _ _ O

it _ _ O

The _ _ O
high _ _ O
cost _ _ O
of _ _ O
doing _ _ O
business _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
takes _ _ O
a _ _ O
toll _ _ O
on _ _ O
many _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
long _ _ O
run, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
can _ _ O
also _ _ O
lead _ _ O
to _ _ O
compromises _ _ O
whose _ _ O
shortcomings _ _ O
become _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
fun _ _ O
-- _ _ O
for _ _ O
diners, _ _ O
at _ _ O
least. _ _ O
If _ _ O
Darryl _ _ O
and _ _ O
Melissa _ _ O
Burnette _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
able _ _ O
to _ _ O
afford _ _ O
to _ _ O
rent _ _ O
a _ _ O
space _ _ O
bigger _ _ O
than _ _ O
275 _ _ O
square _ _ O
feet _ _ O
for _ _ O
their _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
Belle _ _ B-EST
Harlem _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Burnette _ _ O
might _ _ O
do _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
behind _ _ O
a _ _ O
wall _ _ O
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
behind _ _ O
a _ _ O
counter. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Burnette, _ _ O
his _ _ O
wife _ _ O
and _ _ O
business _ _ O
partner, _ _ O
might _ _ O
spend _ _ O
all _ _ O
night _ _ O
going _ _ O
in _ _ O
and _ _ O
out _ _ O
a _ _ O
swinging _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
door _ _ O
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
paying _ _ O
attention _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
customers _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
12 _ _ O
seats _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
single _ _ O
room. _ _ O
At _ _ O
this _ _ O
point, _ _ O
after _ _ O
three _ _ O
years _ _ O
in _ _ O
business, _ _ O
Belle _ _ B-EST
Harlem _ _ I-EST
might _ _ O
be _ _ O
run _ _ O
by _ _ O
employees, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
Burnettes _ _ O
might _ _ O
come _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
times _ _ O
a _ _ O
week _ _ O
to _ _ O
keep _ _ O
an _ _ O
eye _ _ O
on _ _ O
things. _ _ O
Instead _ _ O
they _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
paid _ _ O
staff _ _ O
of _ _ O
one. _ _ O
His _ _ O
name _ _ O
is _ _ O
Alex _ _ O
Geudelekian. _ _ O
He _ _ O
was _ _ O
eating _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
there _ _ O
one _ _ O
night, _ _ O
noticed _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
weeds _ _ O
were _ _ O
growing _ _ O
up _ _ O
around _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Burnette's _ _ O
ankles, _ _ O
asked _ _ O
if _ _ O
he _ _ O
needed _ _ O
help, _ _ O
and _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
the _ _ O
sous-chef _ _ O
ever _ _ O
since. _ _ O

being _ _ O

on _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
three _ _ O

Adam _ _ B-LOC

You _ _ O
might _ _ O
not _ _ O
hear _ _ O
the _ _ O
hiss _ _ O
of _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-FOOD
being _ _ O
fried _ _ O
inside _ _ O
buttermilk _ _ B-FOOD
batter _ _ I-FOOD
before _ _ O
it _ _ O

of _ _ O

tied _ _ O

an _ _ O

of _ _ O
truffled _ _ B-FOOD
maple _ _ I-FOOD

warmed _ _ O
with _ _ O
jalapeños _ _ B-FOOD

If _ _ O
you _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
hear _ _ O
the _ _ O
low _ _ O
roar _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
Searzall _ _ O
torch _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
warms _ _ O
a _ _ O
plate _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
melts _ _ O
and _ _ O
browns _ _ O
a _ _ O
patch _ _ O
of _ _ O
Cheddar, _ _ B-FOOD
you _ _ O
might _ _ O
not _ _ O
know _ _ O
that _ _ O
you're _ _ O
about _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
served _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Burnette's _ _ O
cheese-steak _ _ B-DISH
crostini. _ _ I-DISH
(These _ _ O
are _ _ O
small _ _ O
toasts _ _ B-FOOD
stacked _ _ O
with _ _ O
seared _ _ B-FOOD
filet _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
melted _ _ B-FOOD

until _ _ O
they're _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O

The _ _ O

would _ _ O
cause _ _ O
every _ _ O
Philadelphian _ _ O
who _ _ O
lives _ _ O
within _ _ O
10 _ _ O
blocks _ _ O
of _ _ O
East _ _ B-LOC
Passyunk _ _ I-LOC
Avenue _ _ I-LOC
to _ _ O
pick _ _ O
up _ _ O
the _ _ O
nearest _ _ O
blunt _ _ O
object, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
certain _ _ O
amount _ _ O
of _ _ O
sense _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
taste _ _ O
it.) _ _ O
Some _ _ O
of _ _ O
Belle _ _ B-EST
Harlem's _ _ I-EST
space _ _ O
limitations _ _ O
are, _ _ O
in _ _ O
fact, _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
constricting. _ _ O
When _ _ O
the _ _ O
place _ _ O
is _ _ O
full, _ _ O
some _ _ O
customers _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
ride _ _ O
sidesaddle, _ _ O
their _ _ O
knees _ _ O
angled _ _ O
away _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
counter, _ _ O
because _ _ O
if _ _ O
they _ _ O
faced _ _ O
it _ _ O
head-on _ _ O
they'd _ _ O
cut _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
narrow _ _ O
path _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
restroom _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
back. _ _ O
But _ _ O
275 _ _ O
square _ _ O
feet _ _ O
are _ _ O
what _ _ O
the _ _ O
Burnettes _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
work _ _ O
with, _ _ O
and _ _ O
they _ _ O
have _ _ O
made _ _ O
this _ _ O
shallow _ _ O
sliver _ _ O
into _ _ O
something _ _ O
rare _ _ O
not _ _ O
just _ _ O
in _ _ O
Harlem _ _ B-LOC
but _ _ O
in _ _ O
all _ _ O
Manhattan. _ _ B-LOC
One _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
peculiarities _ _ O
of _ _ O
dining _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
city, _ _ O
circa _ _ O
2019, _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
more _ _ O
high-functioning _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
is, _ _ O
the _ _ O
less _ _ O
likely _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
to _ _ O
encounter _ _ O
a _ _ O
proprietor. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
exceptions, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
but _ _ O
often _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
successful _ _ O
restaurateurs _ _ O
are _ _ O
very _ _ O
busy _ _ O
people, _ _ O
so _ _ O
they _ _ O
leave _ _ O
their _ _ O
dining _ _ O
rooms _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
hands _ _ O
of _ _ O
professional _ _ O
managers. _ _ O
Proprietors _ _ O
aren't _ _ O
always _ _ O
as _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
as _ _ O
professionals, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
as _ _ O
attuned _ _ O
to _ _ O
what _ _ O
goes _ _ O
on _ _ O
in _ _ O
their _ _ O
dining _ _ O
rooms _ _ O
as _ _ O
new _ _ O
parents _ _ O
are _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
noises _ _ O
coming _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
bassinet. _ _ O
I _ _ O
never _ _ O
quite _ _ O
felt _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
I _ _ O
were _ _ O
attending _ _ O
a _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
party _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Burnettes' _ _ O
apartment, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
feeling _ _ O
they _ _ O
say _ _ O
they're _ _ O
going _ _ O
for, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
always _ _ O
knew _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
place _ _ O
that _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
cared _ _ O
about. _ _ O
Their _ _ O
original _ _ O
plan _ _ O
was _ _ O
to _ _ O
feed _ _ O
everyone _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
meal _ _ O
-- _ _ O
a _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
"We _ _ O
found _ _ O
out _ _ O
pretty _ _ O
quickly _ _ O
Harlem _ _ B-LOC
wasn't _ _ O
ready," _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Burnette _ _ O
said _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
interview. _ _ O
How _ _ O
quickly? _ _ O
"We _ _ O
tried _ _ O
one _ _ O
night." _ _ O
Belle _ _ B-EST
Harlem _ _ I-EST
rolled _ _ O
out _ _ O
an _ _ O
à _ _ O
la _ _ O
carte _ _ O
menu _ _ O
the _ _ O
next _ _ O
day. _ _ O
It _ _ O
stuck. _ _ O
The _ _ O
first _ _ O
half _ _ O
is _ _ O
given _ _ O
to _ _ O
smaller _ _ O
plates, _ _ O
although _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
hallmarks _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
Burnettes _ _ O
don't _ _ O
serve _ _ O
anything _ _ O
truly _ _ O
small. _ _ O
They _ _ O
want _ _ O
you _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat. _ _ O
Two _ _ O
people _ _ O
could _ _ O
get _ _ O
away _ _ O
with _ _ O
ordering _ _ O
one _ _ O
main _ _ O
course _ _ O
and _ _ O
two _ _ O
appetizers, _ _ O
though _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
urge _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
Belle _ _ B-EST
Harlem _ _ I-EST
not _ _ O
to _ _ O
overlook _ _ O
dessert. _ _ O
These _ _ O
introductory _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
are _ _ O
where _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Burnette _ _ O
takes _ _ O
casual _ _ O
American _ _ B-CUISINE
vernacular _ _ O
food _ _ O
like _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-DISH
and _ _ I-DISH
waffles _ _ I-DISH
out _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
stroll. _ _ O
His _ _ O
fried _ _ B-DISH
chicken _ _ I-DISH
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
convoluted, _ _ O
frilly _ _ O
crust, _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
plenty _ _ O
of _ _ O
golden _ _ O
surface _ _ O
area _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
jalapeño-banana _ _ B-FOOD
syrup _ _ I-FOOD
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
lost _ _ O
in. _ _ O
The _ _ O
pizzelles _ _ B-DISH
are _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
idea _ _ O
of _ _ O
his, _ _ O
replacing _ _ O
the _ _ O
regular _ _ O
waffles _ _ B-FOOD
he _ _ O
used _ _ O
to _ _ O
make, _ _ O
and _ _ O
they _ _ O
work _ _ O
best _ _ O
when _ _ O
he _ _ O
cooks _ _ O
them _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark _ _ O
crisp. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
where _ _ O
you'll _ _ O
find _ _ O
the _ _ O
cheese-steak _ _ B-DISH
crostini, _ _ I-DISH
as _ _ O
well _ _ O
as _ _ O
spring _ _ B-DISH
rolls _ _ I-DISH
stuffed _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
macaroni _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ I-DISH
cheese _ _ I-DISH
-- _ _ O
kid _ _ O
food _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
fried _ _ B-FOOD
shell, _ _ I-FOOD
yes, _ _ O
but _ _ O
a _ _ O
bacon _ _ B-FOOD
marmalade _ _ I-FOOD
with _ _ O
fresh _ _ B-FOOD
dill _ _ I-FOOD
makes _ _ O
it _ _ O
unexpectedly _ _ O
complex, _ _ O
a _ _ O
chef's _ _ O
dish. _ _ O
The _ _ O
bottom _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
substantial: _ _ O
The _ _ O
pan-seared, _ _ B-DISH
smoked _ _ I-DISH
pork _ _ I-DISH
tenderloin, _ _ I-DISH
for _ _ O
instance, _ _ O
is _ _ O
bigger _ _ O
than _ _ O
what _ _ O
usually _ _ O
crosses _ _ O
a _ _ O
12-seat _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
counter. _ _ O
This _ _ O
month, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Burnette _ _ O
is _ _ O
laying _ _ O
the _ _ O
barrels _ _ O
of _ _ O
pork _ _ B-DISH
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
cherry _ _ B-DISH
compote _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ O
basil _ _ B-DISH
leaves, _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
snap _ _ O
peas _ _ O
for _ _ O
added _ _ O
sweetness. _ _ O
He _ _ O
brings _ _ O
a _ _ O
keen _ _ O
sense _ _ O
of _ _ O
what _ _ O
to _ _ O
do _ _ O
with _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
as _ _ O
they _ _ O
come _ _ O
into _ _ O
season _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
vegetables _ _ O
he _ _ O
grows _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
roof _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Burnettes' _ _ O
apartment _ _ O
building, _ _ O
a _ _ O
block _ _ O
away. _ _ O
The _ _ O
tiny _ _ O
yields _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
urban _ _ O
garden _ _ O
wouldn't _ _ O
satisfy _ _ O
a _ _ O
larger _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
can _ _ O
shuffle _ _ O
right _ _ O
onto _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
at _ _ O
Belle _ _ O
Harlem, _ _ O
and _ _ O
shuffle _ _ O
off _ _ O
again _ _ O
when _ _ O
they're _ _ O
all _ _ O
gone. _ _ O
This _ _ O
month, _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
thin _ _ O
bands _ _ O
of _ _ O
zucchini _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
beef _ _ O
tenderloin, _ _ O
and _ _ O
young, _ _ O
soft _ _ O
favas _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
lobster _ _ O
salad. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
more _ _ O
favas _ _ O
over _ _ O
pan-seared _ _ O
dorade _ _ O
and _ _ O
garden _ _ O
chives, _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
almost _ _ O
transparently _ _ O
thin _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
tossed _ _ O
with _ _ O
butter _ _ O
and _ _ O
cream _ _ O
and _ _ O
tucked _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
fish _ _ O
fillet. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Burnette, _ _ O
who _ _ O
is _ _ O
black _ _ O
and _ _ O
who _ _ O
grew _ _ O
up _ _ O
in _ _ O
rural _ _ O
southwestern _ _ O
Virginia, _ _ O
has _ _ O
said _ _ O
he _ _ O
worked _ _ O
up _ _ O
the _ _ O
nerve _ _ O
to _ _ O
move _ _ O
north _ _ O
for _ _ O
culinary _ _ O
school _ _ O
after _ _ O
seeing _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
Marcus _ _ O
Samuelsson _ _ O
on _ _ O
television _ _ O
. _ _ O
("I _ _ O
thought, _ _ O
hell, _ _ O
if _ _ O
he _ _ O
could _ _ O
do _ _ O
it, _ _ O
I _ _ O
could _ _ O
do _ _ O
it, _ _ O
too.") _ _ O
Sometimes _ _ O
today, _ _ O
in _ _ O
his _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
less _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
mile _ _ O
away _ _ O
from _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Samuelsson's _ _ O
Red _ _ O
Rooster _ _ O
Harlem _ _ O
, _ _ O
he _ _ O
reaches _ _ O
back _ _ O
to _ _ O
his _ _ O
childhood _ _ O
for _ _ O
ideas. _ _ O
A _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
glass _ _ O
called _ _ O
the _ _ O
Triflin' _ _ O
Ho-Ho _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
acknowledged _ _ O
homage _ _ O
to _ _ O
Hostess _ _ O
cakes, _ _ O
although _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
English _ _ O
trifle _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
mix, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
as _ _ O
well _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
trace _ _ O
of _ _ O
Spice _ _ O
Market _ _ O
, _ _ O
where _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Burnette _ _ O
once _ _ O
worked. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chocolate _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
broken _ _ O
shards _ _ O
of _ _ O
cake _ _ O
pulses, _ _ O
intriguingly, _ _ O
with _ _ O
Urfa _ _ O
pepper; _ _ O
its _ _ O
heat _ _ O
rubs _ _ O
up _ _ O
against _ _ O
the _ _ O
passion-fruit _ _ O
cream, _ _ O
brandied _ _ O
cherries _ _ O
and _ _ O
whipped _ _ O
cream _ _ O
that _ _ O
fill _ _ O
the _ _ O
glass. _ _ O
A _ _ O
year _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
Belle _ _ O
Harlem _ _ O
eliminated _ _ O
tips _ _ O
and _ _ O
raised _ _ O
prices. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
take _ _ O
that _ _ O
into _ _ O
account, _ _ O
check _ _ O
totals _ _ O
can _ _ O
still _ _ O
seem _ _ O
high, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
happen _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
served _ _ O
pale, _ _ O
limp _ _ O
housemade _ _ O
potato _ _ O
chips _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
$42 _ _ O
duck _ _ O
breast _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
bitter _ _ O
arugula _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
poached _ _ O
pear _ _ O
that _ _ O
tastes _ _ O
like _ _ O
alcohol. _ _ O
The _ _ O
margins _ _ O
must _ _ O
be _ _ O
tight. _ _ O
At _ _ O
times _ _ O
you _ _ O
almost _ _ O
hear _ _ O
them _ _ O
squeak, _ _ O
as _ _ O
when _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Burnette _ _ O
anxiously _ _ O
reminds _ _ O
you _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
were _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
minutes _ _ O
late _ _ O
and _ _ O
suggests _ _ O
you _ _ O
order _ _ O
quickly _ _ O
so _ _ O
she _ _ O
can _ _ O
turn _ _ O
the _ _ O
seat _ _ O
in _ _ O
time _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O

A _ _ O
professional _ _ O
manager _ _ O
might _ _ O
have _ _ O
brought _ _ O
a _ _ O
more _ _ O
soothing _ _ O
manner _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
exchange. _ _ O
But _ _ O
a _ _ O
manager _ _ O
might _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
as _ _ O
genuinely _ _ O
happy _ _ O
to _ _ O
see _ _ O
a _ _ O
party _ _ O
of _ _ O
three _ _ O
walk _ _ O
in _ _ O
without _ _ O
a _ _ O
reservation _ _ O
just _ _ O
when _ _ O
three _ _ O
seats _ _ O
had _ _ O
opened _ _ O
up, _ _ O
and _ _ O
might _ _ O
not _ _ O
smile _ _ O
as _ _ O
widely _ _ O
when _ _ O
told _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
sparkling _ _ O
rosé _ _ O
is _ _ O
fantastic _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
lobster _ _ O
salad, _ _ O
and _ _ O
would _ _ O
she _ _ O
mind _ _ O
pouring _ _ O
another _ _ O
glass? _ _ O
No, _ _ O
she _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O

all. _ _ O

The _ _ O
chef _ _ O
John _ _ O
Fraser's _ _ O
new _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
blandly _ _ O
corporate _ _ O
name, _ _ O
701West _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
that _ _ O
tells _ _ O
you _ _ O
less _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
place _ _ O
than _ _ O
simply _ _ O
walking _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room. _ _ O
One _ _ O
of _ _ O
several _ _ O
operations _ _ O
he _ _ O
is _ _ O
running _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
new _ _ O
Times _ _ B-LOC
Square _ _ I-LOC
Edition _ _ I-LOC
hotel, _ _ I-LOC
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
clad _ _ O
in _ _ O
paneling _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
walls _ _ O
and _ _ O
ceilings. _ _ O
Velvet _ _ O
curtains _ _ O
and _ _ O
banquettes _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
alarming _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
blue _ _ O
macaw's _ _ O
tail _ _ O
feathers. _ _ O
Wooden _ _ O
blinds _ _ O
are _ _ O
usually _ _ O
snapped _ _ O
shut _ _ O
against _ _ O
the _ _ O
strobes _ _ O
of _ _ O
47th _ _ B-LOC
Street _ _ I-LOC
and _ _ O
Seventh _ _ B-LOC
Avenue. _ _ I-LOC
To _ _ O
get _ _ O
to _ _ O
your _ _ O
table, _ _ O
you _ _ O
must _ _ O
first _ _ O
pass _ _ O
between _ _ O
two _ _ O
identical _ _ O
Champagne _ _ O
trolleys. _ _ O
An _ _ O
iced _ _ O
reservoir _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
center _ _ O
of _ _ O
each _ _ O
is _ _ O
loaded _ _ O
with _ _ O
about _ _ O
half _ _ O
a _ _ O
dozen _ _ O
bottles _ _ O
that _ _ O
range _ _ O
in _ _ O
price _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
Blanquette _ _ B-DISH
de _ _ I-DISH
Limoux _ _ I-DISH
for _ _ O
$26 _ _ O
a _ _ O
glass _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
2006 _ _ O
brut _ _ O
from _ _ O
Dom _ _ B-DISH
Pérignon _ _ I-DISH
for _ _ O
$66 _ _ O
a _ _ O
glass. _ _ O
Before _ _ O
you _ _ O
sit _ _ O
down, _ _ O
you've _ _ O
already _ _ O
learned _ _ O
that _ _ O
wine _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
front _ _ O
and _ _ O
center, _ _ O
literally _ _ O
and _ _ O
figuratively; _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
likely _ _ O
to _ _ O
come _ _ O
from _ _ O
classic, _ _ O
mannerly _ _ O
European _ _ O
estates _ _ O
than, _ _ O
say, _ _ O
Macedonian _ _ O
villages _ _ O
still _ _ O
using _ _ O
amphoras _ _ O
that _ _ O
Odysseus _ _ O
drank _ _ O
from; _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
ideal _ _ O
customer _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
likely _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
up _ _ O
and _ _ O
walk _ _ O
out _ _ O
upon _ _ O
being _ _ O
offered _ _ O
a _ _ O
$66 _ _ O
aperitif; _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
expects _ _ O
to _ _ O
attract _ _ O
so _ _ O
many _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O
customers _ _ O
that _ _ O
a _ _ O
single _ _ O
Champagne _ _ O
trolley _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
enough. _ _ O
Which _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
say _ _ O
that _ _ O
Marriott _ _ O
International _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
hotelier _ _ O
Ian _ _ O
Schrager _ _ O
installed _ _ O
701West _ _ B-EST
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
11th _ _ O
floor _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Edition _ _ B-LOC
for _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
still _ _ O
think _ _ O
a _ _ O
leisurely, _ _ O
three-course _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
interesting _ _ O
bottles _ _ O
and _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
customary _ _ O
niceties _ _ O
is _ _ O
worth _ _ O
spending _ _ O
money _ _ O
on. _ _ O
It _ _ O
belongs _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
species _ _ O
of _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
longer _ _ O
in _ _ O
great _ _ O
supply _ _ O
in _ _ O
Manhattan, _ _ B-LOC
let _ _ O
alone _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
intersection _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
green _ _ O
neon _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Olive _ _ B-DISH
Garden _ _ I-DISH
faces _ _ O
off _ _ O
across _ _ O
Seventh _ _ B-LOC
Avenue _ _ I-LOC
against _ _ I-LOC
the _ _ O
giant _ _ O
candy _ _ B-FOOD
bars _ _ I-FOOD
of _ _ O
Hershey's _ _ B-LOC
Chocolate _ _ I-LOC
World. _ _ I-LOC
It _ _ O
also _ _ O
marks _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Fraser's _ _ O
first _ _ O
arabesques _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
stage _ _ O
of _ _ O
formal _ _ O
dining _ _ O
since _ _ O
Dovetail _ _ B-EST
closed _ _ O
last _ _ O
year. _ _ O
These _ _ O
are _ _ O
early _ _ O
days _ _ O
for _ _ O
701West, _ _ B-EST
but _ _ O
so _ _ O
far _ _ O
I've _ _ O
found _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
more _ _ O
original _ _ O
and _ _ O
appealing _ _ O
than _ _ O
Dovetail's _ _ B-EST
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
final _ _ O
phase. _ _ O
As _ _ O
you _ _ O
know _ _ O
if _ _ O
you've _ _ O
tried _ _ O
the _ _ O
fried-cauliflower _ _ B-DISH
buns _ _ I-DISH
at _ _ O
Nix, _ _ B-EST
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
ramen-style _ _ B-DISH
boiled _ _ I-DISH
eggs _ _ I-DISH
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
Loyal _ _ B-EST
whose _ _ O
yolks _ _ B-FOOD
are _ _ O
red _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
film _ _ O
of _ _ O
jellied _ _ B-FOOD
chile _ _ I-FOOD
oil, _ _ I-FOOD
Mr. _ _ O
Fraser _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
playful, _ _ O
imaginative _ _ O
streak. _ _ O
He _ _ O
needs _ _ O
it _ _ O
at _ _ O
701West, _ _ B-EST
where _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
real _ _ O
theme _ _ O
beyond _ _ O
wine _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
style. _ _ O
But _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
enough _ _ O
creativity _ _ O
across _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu, _ _ O
on _ _ O
which _ _ O
he _ _ O
collaborates _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
de _ _ O
cuisine, _ _ O
Rob _ _ O
Lawson, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Sébastien _ _ O
Rouxel, _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
the _ _ O
engaging, _ _ O
somewhat _ _ O
eccentric _ _ O
experience _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
clearly _ _ O
meant _ _ O
to _ _ O
be. _ _ O
Before _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
courses _ _ O
appear, _ _ O
for _ _ O
example, _ _ O
there _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
"cauliflower _ _ B-DISH
mille-feuille," _ _ I-DISH
the _ _ O
raw _ _ O
vegetable _ _ B-FOOD
shaved _ _ O
into _ _ O
white _ _ O
sheets _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
softened _ _ O
by _ _ O
chilled _ _ O
mezcal _ _ B-FOOD
cream _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
sturgeon _ _ B-FOOD
caviar. _ _ I-FOOD
It's _ _ O
enticingly _ _ O
off-kilter, _ _ O
and _ _ O
another _ _ O
frequent _ _ O
amuse _ _ O
manages _ _ O
to _ _ O
outdo _ _ O
it: _ _ O
a _ _ O
spoonful _ _ O
or _ _ O
so _ _ O
of _ _ O
white-asparagus _ _ B-DISH
foam _ _ I-DISH
above _ _ I-DISH
a _ _ I-DISH
warm _ _ I-DISH
custard _ _ I-DISH
of _ _ I-DISH
sunflower-seed _ _ I-DISH
butter, _ _ I-DISH
dense _ _ O
and _ _ O
nutty _ _ O
and _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
drops _ _ O
of _ _ O
honey. _ _ B-FOOD
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
luxury _ _ O
dining _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
way, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
predictable _ _ O
way. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu _ _ O
proposes _ _ O
three _ _ O
courses _ _ O
for _ _ O
$98, _ _ O
but _ _ O
a _ _ O
server _ _ O
informed _ _ O
me _ _ O
that _ _ O
"we _ _ O
also _ _ O
have _ _ O
à _ _ O
la _ _ O
carte, _ _ O
if _ _ O
that's _ _ O
more _ _ O
your _ _ O
rhythm _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
evening." _ _ O
Frequently _ _ O
the _ _ O
surprises _ _ O
come _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
form _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
unexpected _ _ O
tweak _ _ O
dealt _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
vegetable. _ _ B-FOOD
Slowly _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
in _ _ O
beet _ _ B-FOOD
juice, _ _ I-FOOD
a _ _ O
whole _ _ O
beet _ _ B-FOOD
takes _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
glistening _ _ O
ruby _ _ O
intensity _ _ O
of _ _ O
raw _ _ B-FOOD
bluefin _ _ I-FOOD
tuna. _ _ I-FOOD
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
appetizer _ _ O
of _ _ O
actual _ _ O
bluefin _ _ B-FOOD
as _ _ O
well, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
the _ _ O
precise, _ _ O
Japanese-informed _ _ O
minimalism _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish _ _ O
you'd _ _ O
get _ _ O
at _ _ O
Jean-Georges, _ _ B-EST
with _ _ O
tiny _ _ O
spring _ _ B-FOOD
peas _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
young _ _ B-FOOD
turnip _ _ I-FOOD
greens _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
an _ _ O
electrifying _ _ O
white _ _ O
cloud _ _ O
of _ _ O
grated _ _ O
horseradish. _ _ B-FOOD
In _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish _ _ O
of _ _ O
fava _ _ B-DISH
agnolotti, _ _ I-DISH
the _ _ O
X _ _ O
factor _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
bright, _ _ O
almost _ _ O
effervescent _ _ O
sparkle _ _ O
of _ _ O
vinegar-marinated _ _ O
tomatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
their _ _ O
juices _ _ O
stirred _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
Parmesan-rind _ _ O
broth. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
mystifying _ _ O
appetizer _ _ O
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
the _ _ O
dueling _ _ O
tidal _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
of _ _ O
sea _ _ O
urchin _ _ O
and _ _ O
squid-ink _ _ O
risotto _ _ O
are _ _ O
allowed _ _ O
to _ _ O
cancel _ _ O
each _ _ O
other _ _ O
out. _ _ O
For _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
part, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
the _ _ O
plates _ _ O
don't _ _ O
overreach, _ _ O
for _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
inventiveness _ _ O
on _ _ O
display. _ _ O
Asparagus _ _ O
dipped _ _ O
in _ _ O
aioli _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
good _ _ O
idea, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
but _ _ O
what _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
asparagus _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
inside _ _ O
a _ _ O
wrapper _ _ O
of _ _ O
thinly _ _ O
shaved _ _ O
cedar _ _ O
until _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
as _ _ O
smoky _ _ O
as _ _ O
country _ _ O
bacon? _ _ O
And _ _ O
what _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
aioli _ _ O
is _ _ O
enhanced _ _ O
by _ _ O
truffles? _ _ O
It _ _ O
may _ _ O
sound _ _ O
overworked, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
such _ _ O
a _ _ O
thrill _ _ O
that _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
my _ _ O
guests _ _ O
asked _ _ O
for _ _ O
another _ _ O
plate _ _ O
before _ _ O
we _ _ O
could _ _ O
move _ _ O
on _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses, _ _ O
throwing _ _ O
the _ _ O
rhythm _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
evening _ _ O
right _ _ O
out _ _ O
the _ _ O
window. _ _ O
The _ _ O
night _ _ O
will _ _ O
pause _ _ O
again _ _ O
if _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
potato, _ _ O
as _ _ O
everyone _ _ O
tries _ _ O
to _ _ O
figure _ _ O
out _ _ O
where _ _ O
it _ _ O
got _ _ O
its _ _ O
creaminess _ _ O
and _ _ O
savory _ _ O
depth. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
once _ _ O
you _ _ O
know _ _ O
it's _ _ O
been _ _ O
sealed _ _ O
up _ _ O
and _ _ O
baked _ _ O
inside _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
coffin _ _ O
of _ _ O
sourdough _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
streaked _ _ O
with _ _ O
green _ _ O
threads _ _ O
of _ _ O
wakame _ _ O
seaweed, _ _ O
you _ _ O
still _ _ O
can't _ _ O
quite _ _ O
believe _ _ O
that _ _ O
all _ _ O
this _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
achieved _ _ O
with _ _ O
an _ _ O
ordinary _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
potato. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
large _ _ O
pieces _ _ O
of _ _ O
fish _ _ O
and _ _ O
meat _ _ O
are _ _ O
showstoppers _ _ O
on _ _ O
their _ _ O
own, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
lobster _ _ O
that _ _ O
rests _ _ O
for _ _ O
four _ _ O
days _ _ O
in _ _ O
aged-beef _ _ O
fat _ _ O
before _ _ O
being _ _ O
broiled _ _ O
and _ _ O
set _ _ O
over _ _ O
some _ _ O
jammy _ _ O
ratatouille. _ _ O
When _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
not, _ _ O
something _ _ O
else _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
plate _ _ O
usually _ _ O
is. _ _ O
The _ _ O
long _ _ O
slab _ _ O
of _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
duck _ _ O
breast _ _ O
dredged _ _ O
in _ _ O
powdered _ _ O
herbes _ _ O
de _ _ O
Provence _ _ O
would _ _ O
keep _ _ O
my _ _ O
attention _ _ O
even _ _ O
without _ _ O
its _ _ O
sidekick, _ _ O
a _ _ O
curiously _ _ O
likable _ _ O
risotto _ _ O
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
pine _ _ O
nuts. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
case _ _ O
of _ _ O
lamb, _ _ O
the _ _ O
firecracker _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
cocotte _ _ O
of _ _ O
fresh, _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
cranberry _ _ O
beans. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Rouxel, _ _ O
recently _ _ O
of _ _ O
Upland _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
Clocktower, _ _ O
brings _ _ O
a _ _ O
lighter-than-air _ _ O
quality _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
desserts. _ _ O
Hovering _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
buckwheat _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
crust _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
wavy _ _ O
sea _ _ O
of _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
cream _ _ O
infused _ _ O
with _ _ O
parsnips. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
earthy _ _ O
and _ _ O
ethereal _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
time. _ _ O
He _ _ O
even _ _ O
knows _ _ O
what _ _ O
to _ _ O
do _ _ O
with _ _ O
white _ _ O
chocolate, _ _ O
aerating _ _ O
it _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
mousse _ _ O
to _ _ O
frost _ _ O
an _ _ O
English-pea _ _ O
sponge _ _ O
cake, _ _ O
and _ _ O
giving _ _ O
it _ _ O
a _ _ O
piercing _ _ O
sour-cherry _ _ O
sorbet _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
foil. _ _ O
All _ _ O
seven _ _ O
captains _ _ O
working _ _ O
at _ _ O
701West _ _ O
are _ _ O
sommeliers, _ _ O
listed _ _ O
by _ _ O
name _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu; _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
assisted _ _ O
by _ _ O
back _ _ O
servers _ _ O
who _ _ O
are _ _ O
sommeliers _ _ O
in _ _ O
training. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
those _ _ O
innovations _ _ O
in _ _ O
service _ _ O
that _ _ O
seems _ _ O
obvious _ _ O
now _ _ O
that _ _ O
somebody's _ _ O
actually _ _ O
doing _ _ O
it. _ _ O
The _ _ O
meal _ _ O
can _ _ O
become _ _ O
an _ _ O
evening-long _ _ O
conversation _ _ O
about _ _ O
wine; _ _ O
the _ _ O
sommeliers _ _ O
even _ _ O
invite _ _ O
you _ _ O
to _ _ O
play _ _ O
the _ _ O
wine-insiders' _ _ O
game _ _ O
of _ _ O
guessing _ _ O
the _ _ O
identity _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
mystery _ _ O
pour _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
black _ _ O
glass. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
incredible _ _ O
that _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
tries _ _ O
so _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
give _ _ O
wine _ _ O
equal _ _ O
status _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
does _ _ O
not _ _ O
have _ _ O
more _ _ O
bottles _ _ O
for _ _ O
under _ _ O
$80. _ _ O
That _ _ O
said, _ _ O
the _ _ O
ones _ _ O
it _ _ O
does _ _ O
have _ _ O
tend _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
very _ _ O
good _ _ O
and _ _ O
fairly _ _ O
priced. _ _ O
Besides _ _ O
701West, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Fraser _ _ O
is _ _ O
in _ _ O
charge _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
deep-dish _ _ O
focaccia, _ _ O
carrot _ _ O
Bolognese _ _ O
and _ _ O
"billboard _ _ O
burger" _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
Terrace _ _ O
and _ _ O
Outdoor _ _ O
Gardens, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
open _ _ O
all _ _ O
day _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
ninth _ _ O
floor. _ _ O
He _ _ O
also _ _ O
oversees _ _ O
the _ _ O
dinner-theater _ _ O
menus _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
Paradise _ _ O
Club _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
seventh _ _ O
floor, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
currently _ _ O
staging _ _ O
"The _ _ O
Devouring," _ _ O
a _ _ O
neo-Burlesque _ _ O
extravaganza _ _ O
(juggling, _ _ O
sword _ _ O
swallowing, _ _ O
aerial _ _ O
acrobatics) _ _ O
purportedly _ _ O
inspired _ _ O
by _ _ O
William _ _ O

I _ _ O
nearly _ _ O

Dressed _ _ O
in _ _ O

along _ _ O

of _ _ O
us _ _ O
who _ _ O

the _ _ O

reach _ _ O
a _ _ O
point _ _ O
where _ _ O
our _ _ O
memories _ _ O
can't _ _ O
keep _ _ O
up. _ _ O
The _ _ O
tuna _ _ B-DISH
tartares _ _ I-DISH
start _ _ O
to _ _ O
run _ _ O
together; _ _ O
we _ _ O
can't _ _ O
recall _ _ O
whether _ _ O
it's _ _ O
served _ _ O
in _ _ O

with _ _ O
threads _ _ O
of _ _ O

at _ _ O
Perry _ _ B-EST
St. _ _ I-EST
or _ _ O
at _ _ O
JoJo _ _ B-EST
. _ _ O
At _ _ O
some _ _ O
point _ _ O
it's _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
recall _ _ O
what _ _ O
makes _ _ O
the _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-FOOD

inside _ _ O
a _ _ O
resoundingly _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O

different _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O

at _ _ O
the _ _ O
Mark. _ _ B-EST
With _ _ O
his _ _ O
partner, _ _ O
Phil _ _ O
Suarez, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Vongerichten _ _ O
has _ _ O
founded _ _ O
scores _ _ O
of _ _ O
new _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
world. _ _ O
Nearly _ _ O
40 _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
are _ _ O
still _ _ O
up _ _ O
and _ _ O
running, _ _ O
15 _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York. _ _ I-LOC
Devising _ _ O
menus _ _ O
for _ _ O
each _ _ O
new _ _ O
place, _ _ O
he _ _ O
repeats _ _ O
himself _ _ O
occasionally, _ _ O
but _ _ O
more _ _ O
often _ _ O
he _ _ O
rearranges _ _ O
old _ _ O
patterns. _ _ O
Lime _ _ B-FOOD
juice _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
traded _ _ O
for _ _ O
yuzu, _ _ B-FOOD
cherry _ _ B-FOOD
vinegar _ _ I-FOOD
comes _ _ O
in _ _ O
for _ _ O
balsamic. _ _ B-FOOD
Almost _ _ O
always, _ _ O
the _ _ O
result _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
similar _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
his _ _ O
past _ _ O
work _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
recognizably _ _ O
Vongerichtenesque _ _ O
but _ _ O
different _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
seem _ _ O
fresh. _ _ O
Maybe _ _ O
he _ _ O
can _ _ O
keep _ _ O
track _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
in _ _ O
his _ _ O
head, _ _ O
but _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
rest _ _ O
of _ _ O
us _ _ O
it _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
really _ _ O
useful _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
family _ _ O
tree _ _ O
of _ _ O
every _ _ O
dish _ _ O
he _ _ O
ever _ _ O
invented, _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O
parentage _ _ O
and _ _ O
offspring. _ _ O
Something _ _ O
like _ _ O
23andMe _ _ O
, _ _ O
it _ _ O
could _ _ O
tell _ _ O
you _ _ O
which _ _ O

This _ _ O
service _ _ O
would _ _ O
come _ _ O
in _ _ O
handy _ _ O
in _ _ O
times _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
present, _ _ O
when _ _ O
critics _ _ O
and _ _ O
superfans _ _ O
are _ _ O
trying _ _ O
to _ _ O
metabolize _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Vongerichten _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
City _ _ I-LOC
during _ _ O
a _ _ O
single _ _ O
week _ _ O
in _ _ O
May. _ _ O
One _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
Paris _ _ B-EST
Café _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
a _ _ O
casual, _ _ O
all-day _ _ O
proposition _ _ O
inside _ _ O
Eero _ _ O
Saarinen's _ _ O
T.W.A. _ _ B-LOC
terminal _ _ I-LOC
at _ _ I-LOC
Kennedy _ _ I-LOC
International _ _ I-LOC
Airport, _ _ I-LOC
now _ _ O
gloriously _ _ O
resurrected _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
TWA _ _ B-LOC
Hotel. _ _ I-LOC
The _ _ O
second _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
polished _ _ O
seafood _ _ B-TYPE
house _ _ I-TYPE
that _ _ O
sits _ _ O
out _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
East _ _ B-LOC
River _ _ I-LOC
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
Pier _ _ B-LOC
17, _ _ I-LOC
next _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
wreck _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
old _ _ O
Fulton _ _ B-EST
Fish _ _ I-EST
Market; _ _ I-EST
it's _ _ O
called _ _ O
the _ _ O
Fulton _ _ B-EST
. _ _ O
Because _ _ O
I've _ _ O
been _ _ O
to _ _ O
both _ _ O
so _ _ O
recently, _ _ O
I _ _ O
can _ _ O
report _ _ O
confidently _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
Fulton _ _ B-EST
slices _ _ O
deep-red _ _ O
strawberries _ _ B-FOOD
over _ _ O
strawberry _ _ B-FOOD
ice _ _ I-FOOD
cream _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
sorbet _ _ B-FOOD
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
strawberries _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
red _ _ B-FOOD
wine _ _ I-FOOD
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
its _ _ O
strawberry _ _ B-DISH
sundae, _ _ I-DISH
while _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
Paris _ _ B-EST
Café _ _ I-EST
substitutes _ _ O
dried _ _ B-FOOD
strawberries. _ _ I-FOOD
That _ _ O
version _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
bad, _ _ O
but _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
undeniable _ _ O
difference _ _ O
between _ _ O
fresh _ _ B-FOOD
summer _ _ I-FOOD
berries _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
dehydrated _ _ O
ones, _ _ O
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
difference _ _ O
suggests _ _ O
the _ _ O
quality _ _ O
gap _ _ O
between _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O
restaurants. _ _ O
The _ _ O
best _ _ O
reasons _ _ O
to _ _ O
go _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
Paris _ _ B-EST
Café _ _ I-EST
are _ _ O
Saarinen's _ _ O
glass _ _ O
walls, _ _ O
gliding _ _ O
curves _ _ O
and _ _ O
suspended _ _ O
catwalk, _ _ O
although _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
areas _ _ O
are _ _ O
swell, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
smartly _ _ O
evoking _ _ O
Raymond _ _ O
Loewy's _ _ O
original _ _ O
design _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
space, _ _ O
which _ _ O
looked _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
coffee _ _ B-DIET
shop _ _ I-DIET
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
moon. _ _ O
The _ _ O
place _ _ O
has _ _ O
some _ _ O
likable _ _ O
pizzas _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
salads, _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
vaults _ _ O
clear _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
airport. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
recipes _ _ O
seem _ _ O
designed _ _ O
not _ _ O
to _ _ O
push _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
too _ _ O
hard, _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
even _ _ O
more _ _ O
Vongerichtenesque _ _ O
than _ _ O
usual, _ _ O
and _ _ O
any _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
involving _ _ O
fruits _ _ B-FOOD
or _ _ O
vegetables _ _ B-FOOD
will _ _ O
make _ _ O
you _ _ O
wonder _ _ O
whether _ _ O
the _ _ O
produce _ _ O
truck _ _ O
drove _ _ O
to _ _ O
La _ _ B-LOC
Guardia _ _ I-LOC
instead. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Fulton, _ _ B-EST
though, _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
grown-up _ _ O
production. _ _ O
Under _ _ O
the _ _ O
day-to-day _ _ O
command _ _ O
of _ _ O
Noah _ _ O
Poses, _ _ O
the _ _ O
executive _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
easily _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
to _ _ O
open _ _ O
in _ _ O
Manhattan _ _ B-LOC
since _ _ O
the _ _ O
Pool _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
and _ _ O
easier _ _ O
to _ _ O
afford. _ _ O
Yes, _ _ O
a _ _ O
handful _ _ O
of _ _ O
items _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
have _ _ O
that _ _ O
glassy-eyed _ _ O
stare, _ _ O
but _ _ O
almost _ _ O
everything _ _ O
else _ _ O
comes _ _ O
through. _ _ O
To _ _ O
get _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
Fulton, _ _ B-EST
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
walk _ _ O
almost _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
pier, _ _ O
where _ _ O
some _ _ O
tall _ _ O
planters _ _ O
cordon _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
Fulton's _ _ B-EST
outdoor _ _ O
tables. _ _ O
All _ _ O
the _ _ O
tables, _ _ O
indoors _ _ O
and _ _ O
out, _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
view _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Brooklyn _ _ B-LOC
Bridge, _ _ I-LOC
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
backdrops _ _ O
are _ _ O
inside _ _ O
and _ _ O
upstairs, _ _ O
where _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
see _ _ O
that _ _ O
you're _ _ O
surrounded _ _ O
by _ _ O
water. _ _ O
Mentioning _ _ O
the _ _ O
view _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
selling _ _ O
point _ _ O
will _ _ O
make _ _ O
some _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
cringe. _ _ O
But _ _ O
Pier _ _ B-LOC
17's _ _ I-LOC
developer, _ _ O
clearly _ _ O
hoping _ _ O
to _ _ O
erase _ _ O
the _ _ O
stigma, _ _ O
has _ _ O
recruited _ _ O
David _ _ O
Chang, _ _ O
Andrew _ _ O
Carmellini _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Vongerichten. _ _ O
Day _ _ O
trippers _ _ O
and _ _ O
tourists _ _ O
will _ _ O
love _ _ O
the _ _ O
Fulton, _ _ B-EST
in _ _ O
any _ _ O
case, _ _ O
and _ _ O
they _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
right. _ _ O
True, _ _ O
the _ _ O
outdoor _ _ O
patio _ _ O
feels _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
beachside _ _ O
bar _ _ O
of _ _ O
some _ _ O
island _ _ O
resort, _ _ O
with _ _ O
soft-core _ _ O
club _ _ O
music _ _ O
playing _ _ O
and _ _ O
servers _ _ O
carrying _ _ O
too-small _ _ O
trays _ _ O
slinking _ _ O
around _ _ O
in _ _ O
long _ _ O
skirts. _ _ O
Once _ _ O
you _ _ O
get _ _ O
inside, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
the _ _ O
tension _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
open _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
lets _ _ O
you _ _ O
know _ _ O
this _ _ O
is, _ _ O
in _ _ O
fact, _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York. _ _ I-LOC
Running _ _ O
a _ _ O
seafood _ _ B-DIET
house _ _ I-DIET
gives _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Vongerichten _ _ O
an _ _ O
opening _ _ O
to _ _ O
lead _ _ O
with _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
his _ _ O
strong _ _ O
suits, _ _ O
raw _ _ B-FOOD
fish. _ _ I-FOOD
The _ _ O
sea _ _ B-DISH
trout _ _ I-DISH
tartare _ _ I-DISH
is _ _ O
stirred _ _ O
with _ _ O
raw _ _ O
oysters _ _ O
and _ _ O
horseradish, _ _ O
which _ _ O
creates _ _ O
the _ _ O
uncanny _ _ O
momentary _ _ O
illusion _ _ O
that _ _ O
you're _ _ O
eating _ _ O
beef. _ _ O
White _ _ O
ponzu, _ _ O
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
white _ _ O
soy _ _ O
sauce, _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
centerpiece _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
platter _ _ O
of _ _ O
iced _ _ O
sashimi. _ _ O
Local _ _ O
fluke, _ _ O
taking _ _ O
a _ _ O
bath _ _ O
in _ _ O
habanero _ _ O
vinaigrette, _ _ O
is _ _ O
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
mint _ _ O
and _ _ O
Sichuan _ _ O
buttons; _ _ O
even _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
know _ _ O
what's _ _ O
coming _ _ O
-- _ _ O
Sichuan _ _ O
buttons _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
flower _ _ O
buds _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
toothache _ _ O
plant, _ _ O
which _ _ O
when _ _ O
chewed, _ _ O
produce _ _ O
a _ _ O
numbing _ _ O
and _ _ O
cooling _ _ O
sensation _ _ O
-- _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
surprise. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Fulton's _ _ O
Manhattan _ _ O
clam _ _ O
chowder _ _ O
is _ _ O
spicy, _ _ O
thick _ _ O
with _ _ O
potatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
healthy _ _ O
portion _ _ O
of _ _ O
clams. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
the _ _ O
rare _ _ O
version _ _ O
that _ _ O
tastes _ _ O
as _ _ O
good _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
sounds, _ _ O
although _ _ O
purists _ _ O
will _ _ O
deduct _ _ O
one _ _ O
point _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
absence _ _ O
of _ _ O
oyster _ _ O
crackers. _ _ O
There's _ _ O
a _ _ O
very _ _ O
intriguing _ _ O
sesame-poppy _ _ O
crust _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
soft-shell _ _ O
crabs; _ _ O
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
just _ _ O
enough _ _ O
time _ _ O
to _ _ O
register _ _ O
the _ _ O
seeds _ _ O
before _ _ O
a _ _ O
potent _ _ O
green _ _ O
salsa _ _ O
of _ _ O
coriander _ _ O
and _ _ O
jalapeño _ _ O
kicks _ _ O
in. _ _ O
Few _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
are _ _ O
as _ _ O
skilled _ _ O
at _ _ O
using _ _ O
acidity, _ _ O
heat _ _ O
and _ _ O
salt _ _ O
to _ _ O
bring _ _ O
definition _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish. _ _ O
So _ _ O
it's _ _ O
a _ _ O
surprise _ _ O
to _ _ O
realize _ _ O
how _ _ O
generic _ _ O
the _ _ O
Fulton's _ _ O
fish _ _ O
stew _ _ O
is, _ _ O
or _ _ O
to _ _ O
wonder _ _ O
what _ _ O
the _ _ O
ingredient _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
throws _ _ O
the _ _ O
red _ _ O
snapper _ _ O
ceviche _ _ O
in _ _ O
watermelon _ _ O
juice _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
whack. _ _ O
A _ _ O
separate _ _ O
menu _ _ O
card _ _ O
lets _ _ O
you _ _ O
know _ _ O
that _ _ O
most _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
ordered _ _ O
"simply _ _ O
cooked." _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
never _ _ O
curious _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
try _ _ O
it, _ _ O
being _ _ O
too _ _ O
distracted _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
salmon _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
cumin-coriander _ _ O
seed _ _ O
crust _ _ O
so _ _ O
fragrant _ _ O
it _ _ O
turns _ _ O
heads; _ _ O
the _ _ O
sea _ _ O
bass _ _ O
and _ _ O
carrots _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
life-affirming _ _ O
pool _ _ O
of _ _ O
lemon-turmeric _ _ O
sauce; _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
detailed-oriented _ _ O
fish _ _ O
and _ _ O
crisps, _ _ O
a _ _ O
brick _ _ O
of _ _ O
flounder _ _ O
kept _ _ O
at _ _ O
scalding _ _ O
temperature _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
leakproof _ _ O
and _ _ O
supernaturally _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
buckwheat _ _ O
batter. _ _ O
Served _ _ O
with _ _ O
mashed _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
peas, _ _ O
it _ _ O
could _ _ O
almost _ _ O
pass _ _ O
for _ _ O
English _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
come _ _ O
with _ _ O
saffron _ _ O
aioli. _ _ O
Most _ _ O
distracting _ _ O
of _ _ O
all _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole _ _ O
black _ _ O
bass _ _ O
baked _ _ O
inside _ _ O
a _ _ O
fish-shaped _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
lavishly _ _ O
decorated _ _ O
with _ _ O
golden _ _ O
scales, _ _ O
fins, _ _ O
gills _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
parts _ _ O
the _ _ O
bass _ _ O
itself _ _ O
won't _ _ O
be _ _ O
needing _ _ O
anymore. _ _ O
It _ _ O
takes _ _ O
a _ _ O
good _ _ O
10 _ _ O
minutes _ _ O
to _ _ O
unveil _ _ O
it, _ _ O
fillet _ _ O
it _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
plate _ _ O
it _ _ O
together _ _ O
with _ _ O
slices _ _ O
of _ _ O
crust, _ _ O
some _ _ O
tomato _ _ O
concassé _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
choron, _ _ O
and _ _ O
I _ _ O
doubt _ _ O
many _ _ O
movies _ _ O
playing _ _ O
in _ _ O
theaters _ _ O
now _ _ O
can _ _ O
rival _ _ O
it _ _ O
for _ _ O
entertainment. _ _ O
Wonderful _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
see _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
showpieces _ _ O
of _ _ O
pre-nouvelle _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
given _ _ O
so _ _ O
much _ _ O
attention, _ _ O
you _ _ O
could _ _ O
ask _ _ O
whether _ _ O
whole _ _ O
fish _ _ O
en _ _ O
croute _ _ O
really _ _ O
makes _ _ O
sense _ _ O
after, _ _ O
say, _ _ O
kale _ _ O
salad. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Vongerichten's _ _ O
technical _ _ O
approach _ _ O
may _ _ O
let _ _ O
him _ _ O
generate _ _ O
a _ _ O
menu _ _ O
full _ _ O
of _ _ O
smart, _ _ O
reliably _ _ O
pleasurable _ _ O
food, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
guarantee _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
all _ _ O
hang _ _ O
together. _ _ O
The _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
menu _ _ O
does, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
by _ _ O
sneakily _ _ O
staying _ _ O
true _ _ O
to _ _ O
classic _ _ O
American _ _ O
desserts. _ _ O
What's _ _ O
sold _ _ O
as _ _ O
Meyer _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
pudding _ _ O
turns _ _ O
out _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
more _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
meringue _ _ O
tart _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
quick, _ _ O
pulsing _ _ O

Some _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
push _ _ O
their _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
menus. _ _ O
Rezdôra _ _ B-DIET
doesn't. _ _ O
A _ _ O
few _ _ O
steps _ _ O
down _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
sidewalk, _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
block _ _ O
of _ _ O
East _ _ B-LOC
20th _ _ I-LOC
Street _ _ I-LOC
as _ _ O
Gramercy _ _ B-EST
Tavern _ _ I-EST
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
brownstone _ _ O
where _ _ O
Teddy _ _ O
Roosevelt _ _ O
was _ _ O
born, _ _ O
Rezdôra _ _ B-EST
lists _ _ O
a _ _ O
"regional _ _ B-DISH
pasta _ _ I-DISH
tasting" _ _ I-DISH
for _ _ O
$90 _ _ O
on _ _ O
its _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
The _ _ O
region _ _ O
in _ _ O
question _ _ O
is _ _ O
Emilia-Romagna, _ _ B-LOC
whose _ _ O
refinements _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
art _ _ O
of _ _ O
rolling _ _ O
and _ _ O
saucing _ _ O
noodles _ _ B-FOOD
are _ _ O
admired _ _ O
even _ _ O
by _ _ O
Italians _ _ O
from _ _ O
other _ _ O
parts _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
country. _ _ O
Chances _ _ O
are _ _ O
that _ _ O
most _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
five _ _ O
pastas _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
are _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
the _ _ O
ones _ _ O
you _ _ O
picture _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
think _ _ O
about _ _ O
Emilia-Romagna, _ _ B-DISH
starting _ _ O
with _ _ O
tortellini _ _ B-DISH
in _ _ I-DISH
brodo. _ _ I-DISH
This _ _ O
would _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
it _ _ O
an _ _ O
easy _ _ O
sell, _ _ O
and _ _ O
yet _ _ O
servers _ _ O
at _ _ O
Rezdôra _ _ B-EST
never _ _ O
tried _ _ O
to _ _ O
sell _ _ O
me _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
tasting. _ _ O
Until _ _ O
I _ _ O
asked _ _ O
about _ _ O
it _ _ O
one _ _ O
night, _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
never _ _ O
seen _ _ O
the _ _ O
separate _ _ O
menu _ _ O
card _ _ O
that _ _ O
describes _ _ O
each _ _ O
course. _ _ O
With _ _ O
some _ _ O
hesitation, _ _ O
I _ _ O
ordered _ _ O
it. _ _ O
Every _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
pastas _ _ B-FOOD
was _ _ O
excellent, _ _ O
and _ _ O
one _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
worth _ _ O
walking _ _ O
a _ _ O
long _ _ O
distance _ _ O
for. _ _ O
After _ _ O
the _ _ O
fifth _ _ O
course _ _ O
was _ _ O
gone, _ _ O
it _ _ O
slowly _ _ O
dawned _ _ O
on _ _ O
me _ _ O
that _ _ O
Stefano _ _ O
Secchi, _ _ O
Rezdôra's _ _ B-FOOD
chef _ _ O
and _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
owners, _ _ O
had _ _ O
just _ _ O
laid _ _ O
down _ _ O
a _ _ O
straight _ _ O
flush. _ _ O
The _ _ O
tortellini _ _ B-FOOD
were _ _ O
penny-size _ _ O
hoops _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
around _ _ O
minced _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ I-FOOD
blended _ _ I-FOOD
pork _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
parcel _ _ O
just _ _ O
big _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
suggest _ _ O
the _ _ O
idea _ _ O
of _ _ O
meat. _ _ B-FOOD
"This _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
special _ _ O
broth _ _ B-FOOD
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
older _ _ O
chickens," _ _ B-FOOD
a _ _ O
server _ _ O
said _ _ O
as _ _ O
he _ _ O
poured _ _ O
a _ _ O
steaming _ _ O
liquid _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
kettle _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
tortellini. _ _ B-FOOD
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
turkey _ _ B-FOOD
gravy. _ _ I-FOOD
The _ _ O
broth _ _ B-FOOD
spent _ _ O
about _ _ O
half _ _ O
a _ _ O
day _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
burner; _ _ O
drew _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
power _ _ O
from _ _ O
melted _ _ B-FOOD
Parmigiano-Reggiano; _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
was _ _ O
more _ _ O
intense _ _ O
than _ _ O
canned _ _ B-FOOD
chicken _ _ I-FOOD
broth _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
roughly _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
way _ _ O
that _ _ O
a _ _ O
dry-aged _ _ B-FOOD
rib-eye _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
intense _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
McDonald's _ _ B-EST
all-beef _ _ B-FOOD
patty. _ _ I-FOOD
This _ _ O
was _ _ O
followed _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
smooth, _ _ O
almost _ _ O
fluffy _ _ O
tomato-basil _ _ B-FOOD
sauce _ _ I-FOOD
over _ _ O
maccheroni _ _ B-FOOD
al _ _ I-FOOD
pettine, _ _ I-FOOD
delicate _ _ O
tubes _ _ O
with _ _ O
ridges _ _ O
they _ _ O
get _ _ O
from _ _ O
being _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
by _ _ O
hand _ _ O
along _ _ O
a _ _ O
comb _ _ O
made _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
job. _ _ O
Three _ _ O
straw-colored _ _ O
blobs _ _ O
that _ _ O
looked _ _ O
like _ _ O
melted _ _ B-FOOD
Brie _ _ I-FOOD
turned _ _ O
out _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
glossy _ _ O
and _ _ O
wonderful _ _ O
fonduta _ _ B-DISH
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
Parmigiano-Reggiano. _ _ B-FOOD
From _ _ O
there _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
on _ _ O
to _ _ O
tortelloni, _ _ O
each _ _ O
about _ _ O
three _ _ O
bites _ _ O
big, _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
plush _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
ricotta _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
shiny _ _ O
with _ _ O
melted _ _ B-FOOD
brown _ _ I-FOOD
butter _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
sage _ _ B-FOOD
leaves _ _ I-FOOD
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
bubbled. _ _ O
If _ _ O
we _ _ O
are _ _ O
talking _ _ O
about _ _ O
Emilia-Romagna _ _ B-LOC
we _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
talk _ _ O
about _ _ O
ragù, _ _ B-DISH
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
next _ _ O
course, _ _ O
tossed _ _ O
with _ _ O
slim _ _ O
ribbons _ _ O
of _ _ O
tagliolini. _ _ B-FOOD
Some _ _ O
people _ _ O
will _ _ O
find _ _ O
the _ _ O
ragù _ _ B-DISH
saltier _ _ O
than _ _ O
they _ _ O
like. _ _ O
Almost _ _ O
everyone _ _ O
will _ _ O
find _ _ O
it _ _ O
more _ _ O
tender _ _ O
and _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
20 _ _ O
or _ _ O
30 _ _ O
ragús _ _ B-FOOD
they _ _ O
ate. _ _ O
The _ _ O
tour _ _ O
winds _ _ O
down _ _ O
with _ _ O
round, _ _ O
meat-filled _ _ B-DISH
anolini, _ _ I-DISH
a _ _ O
branch _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
ravioli _ _ B-FOOD
family _ _ O
that _ _ O
resides _ _ O
in _ _ O
Parma. _ _ B-LOC
They _ _ O
are _ _ O
served _ _ O
in _ _ O
something _ _ O
called _ _ O
crema _ _ B-FOOD
di _ _ I-FOOD
Parmigiano; _ _ I-FOOD
you _ _ O
will _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
far _ _ O
off _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
imagine _ _ O
an _ _ O
Alfredo _ _ B-FOOD
sauce _ _ I-FOOD
cooked _ _ O
for _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
more _ _ O
sybaritic _ _ O
Roman _ _ O
emperors. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
Rome, _ _ B-LOC
though, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
gets _ _ O
the _ _ O
tart _ _ O
counterpoint _ _ O
it _ _ O
needs _ _ O
from _ _ O
an _ _ O
inky, _ _ O
25-year-old _ _ O
balsamic _ _ B-FOOD
vinegar _ _ I-FOOD
poured _ _ O
straight _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
bottle. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Secchi _ _ O
blew _ _ O
into _ _ O
town _ _ O
in _ _ O
May _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
gust _ _ O
of _ _ O
publicity _ _ O
whipped _ _ O
up _ _ O
over _ _ O
his _ _ O
time _ _ O
at _ _ O
Osteria _ _ B-EST
Francescana _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Modena _ _ B-EST
workshop _ _ O
where _ _ O
Massimo _ _ O
Bottura _ _ O
reconfigures _ _ O
the _ _ O
touchstone _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
region _ _ O
in _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
with _ _ O
names _ _ O
like _ _ O
"memories _ _ B-DISH
of _ _ I-DISH
a _ _ I-DISH
mortadella _ _ I-DISH
sandwich." _ _ I-DISH
Mr. _ _ O
Bottura's _ _ O
approach _ _ O
to _ _ O
menu _ _ O
writing _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
rubbed _ _ O
off _ _ O
on _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Secchi _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
his _ _ O
experimental _ _ O
urges _ _ O
did. _ _ O
At _ _ O
Rezdôra, _ _ B-EST
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
unlikely _ _ O
to _ _ O
catch _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
using _ _ O
any _ _ O
overtly _ _ O
modernist _ _ O
techniques, _ _ O
but _ _ O
you _ _ O
may _ _ O
well _ _ O
encounter _ _ O
"cherry _ _ B-DISH
season _ _ I-DISH
in _ _ I-DISH
Vignola," _ _ I-DISH
a _ _ O
pleasant _ _ O
if _ _ O
somewhat _ _ O
too _ _ O
soupy _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
stracciatella _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
toasted _ _ B-FOOD
almonds, _ _ I-FOOD
almond _ _ B-FOOD
milk _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
cherries _ _ B-FOOD
both _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
and _ _ O
sour; _ _ O
or _ _ O
"cow _ _ B-DISH
grazing _ _ I-DISH
in _ _ I-DISH
Emilia-Romagna," _ _ I-DISH
a _ _ O
sirloin _ _ B-FOOD
basted _ _ O
with _ _ O
butter _ _ B-FOOD
whose _ _ O
richness _ _ O
is _ _ O
modulated _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
of _ _ O
sweet _ _ B-FOOD
red _ _ I-FOOD
peppers; _ _ I-FOOD
or _ _ O
"Grandma _ _ B-DISH
walking _ _ I-DISH
through _ _ I-DISH
forest _ _ I-DISH
in _ _ I-DISH
Emilia," _ _ I-DISH
a _ _ O
transfixing _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
mushroom _ _ B-FOOD
purée, _ _ I-FOOD
slivered _ _ O
snap-pea _ _ B-FOOD
pods _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
little _ _ O
hats _ _ O
of _ _ O
spinach _ _ B-FOOD
pasta _ _ I-FOOD
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
braised _ _ B-FOOD
leeks. _ _ I-FOOD
If _ _ O
we _ _ O
are _ _ O
tracing _ _ O
influences, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Secchi's _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
at _ _ O
Rezdôra _ _ B-EST
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
molded _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
as _ _ O
deeply _ _ O
by _ _ O
his _ _ O
time _ _ O
working _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
pasta _ _ B-FOOD
station _ _ O
of _ _ O
another _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
Modena, _ _ B-LOC
Hosteria _ _ B-EST
Giusti _ _ I-EST
. _ _ O
Laura _ _ O
Galli _ _ O
Morandi, _ _ O
Giusti's _ _ B-EST
chef, _ _ O
steadfastly _ _ O
defends _ _ O
the _ _ O
style _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
local _ _ O
nonna _ _ O
tradition _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Secchi _ _ O
channels _ _ O
in _ _ O
his _ _ O
pasta _ _ B-FOOD
tasting _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
parts _ _ O
of _ _ O
his _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
Like _ _ O
a _ _ O
meal _ _ O
in _ _ O
Giusti's _ _ B-EST
four-table _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room, _ _ O
one _ _ O
at _ _ O
Rezdôra _ _ B-EST
can _ _ O
and _ _ O
probably _ _ O
should _ _ O
start _ _ O
with _ _ O
prosciutto _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
manifestations _ _ O
of _ _ O
salted _ _ B-FOOD
pork _ _ I-FOOD
draped _ _ O
over _ _ O
warm _ _ O
pillows _ _ O
of _ _ O
fried _ _ B-FOOD
dough _ _ I-FOOD
called _ _ O
gnocchi _ _ O
fritti. _ _ O
Before _ _ O
leaving _ _ O
Italy, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Secchi _ _ O
also _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
at _ _ O
Antica _ _ O
Moka _ _ O
in _ _ O
Modena _ _ O
and _ _ O
All'Enoteca _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Piedmont; _ _ O
after _ _ O
coming _ _ O
back _ _ O
home _ _ O
to _ _ O
Dallas, _ _ O
where _ _ O
he _ _ O
grew _ _ O
up, _ _ O
he _ _ O
ran _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchens _ _ O
of _ _ O
two _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
his _ _ O
parents _ _ O
own _ _ O
there. _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
I _ _ O
suspect _ _ O
the _ _ O
Bottura _ _ O
connection _ _ O
is _ _ O
responsible _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
speed _ _ O
with _ _ O
which _ _ O
the _ _ O
bar _ _ O
stools _ _ O
fill _ _ O
up _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
opens _ _ O
at _ _ O
5:30 _ _ O
each _ _ O
night, _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
difficulty _ _ O
of _ _ O
reserving _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
48 _ _ O
seats, _ _ O
and _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
would-be _ _ O
customers _ _ O
collect _ _ O
in _ _ O
eddies _ _ O
outside _ _ O
the _ _ O
door _ _ O
to _ _ O
strategize. _ _ O
Not _ _ O
much _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
interior _ _ O
is _ _ O
likely _ _ O
to _ _ O
lure _ _ O
crowds; _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O
brick _ _ O
walls, _ _ O
timbered _ _ O
ceiling _ _ O
and _ _ O
bare _ _ O
wood _ _ O
tables, _ _ O
it _ _ O
looks _ _ O
like _ _ O
any _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
Manhattan _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
that _ _ O
emulate _ _ O
the _ _ O
trattorias, _ _ O
enotecas _ _ O
and _ _ O
osterias _ _ O
of _ _ O
Italy. _ _ O
And _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
eat _ _ O
at _ _ O
Rezdôra _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
way _ _ O
of _ _ O
becoming _ _ O
repeat _ _ O
customers. _ _ O
They _ _ O
come _ _ O
back _ _ O
even _ _ O
though _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
a _ _ O
young _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
and _ _ O
occasionally _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
young _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
mistakes. _ _ O
One _ _ O
night, _ _ O
the _ _ O
stewed _ _ O
cannellini _ _ O
beans _ _ O
placed _ _ O
alongside _ _ O
black _ _ O
sea _ _ O
bass _ _ O
and _ _ O
black _ _ O
garlic _ _ O
zabaglione _ _ O
were _ _ O
still _ _ O
crunchy; _ _ O
the _ _ O
rock _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
strozzapreti _ _ O
could _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
less _ _ O
tough _ _ O
and _ _ O
tasted _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
shrimpier. _ _ O
And _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
original _ _ O
pastas _ _ O
aren't _ _ O
quite _ _ O
as _ _ O
stunning _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
classics, _ _ O
but _ _ O
then _ _ O
every _ _ O
grandmother _ _ O
in _ _ O
Emilia-Romagna _ _ O
could _ _ O
have _ _ O
told _ _ O
you _ _ O
that. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Secchi _ _ O
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
appealing _ _ O
new _ _ O
talents _ _ O
in _ _ O
years _ _ O
to _ _ O
enter _ _ O
the _ _ O
city's _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
scene, _ _ O
the _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
cook _ _ O
who _ _ O
can _ _ O
unite _ _ O
ordinary _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
just _ _ O
like _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O

a _ _ O

his _ _ O

of _ _ O
which _ _ O

called _ _ O
Ferrari's _ _ O

The _ _ O
first _ _ O
has _ _ O

since _ _ O
1983, _ _ O
a _ _ O
life _ _ O
span _ _ O
that _ _ O
any _ _ O

would _ _ O

The _ _ O
odds _ _ O
are _ _ O
against _ _ O

being _ _ O
around _ _ O
36 _ _ O
years _ _ O
from _ _ O

Mr. _ _ O

In _ _ O
the _ _ O
fall _ _ O
of _ _ O
1980, _ _ O
Patrick _ _ O
Clark, _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
chef _ _ O
at _ _ O
Keith _ _ O
McNally's _ _ O
first _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Odeon _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
helped _ _ O
introduce _ _ O
nouvelle _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
to _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
rage _ _ O
in _ _ O
Europe. _ _ B-LOC
Nearly _ _ O
every _ _ O
place _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
McNally _ _ O
has _ _ O
built _ _ O
since _ _ O
then _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
a _ _ O
firm _ _ O
rejection _ _ O
of _ _ O
all _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
fashionable _ _ O
in _ _ O
food, _ _ O
and _ _ O
each _ _ O
one _ _ O
has _ _ O
been, _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
first _ _ O
few _ _ O
months, _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
fashionable _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
town. _ _ O
The _ _ O
one _ _ O
he _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
early _ _ O
June _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
meatpacking _ _ B-LOC
district, _ _ I-LOC
Pastis _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
was _ _ O
assembled _ _ O
partly _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
salvaged _ _ O
bones _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
nearby _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
he _ _ O
closed _ _ O
five _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
Pastis. _ _ B-EST
(He _ _ O
salvaged _ _ O
the _ _ O
name, _ _ O
too.) _ _ O
The _ _ O
onion _ _ B-DISH
soup, _ _ I-DISH
the _ _ O
meaty _ _ B-DISH
snails _ _ I-DISH
sloshing _ _ O
around _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
divots _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
black _ _ O
iron _ _ O
snail _ _ O
pan _ _ O
with _ _ O
what _ _ O
must _ _ O
be _ _ O
half _ _ O
a _ _ O
pint _ _ O
of _ _ O
garlic _ _ B-FOOD
butter, _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
other _ _ O
old _ _ O
war _ _ O
horses _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
original _ _ O
menu _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
summoned _ _ O
for _ _ O
one _ _ O
more _ _ O
joust _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
battlefield. _ _ O
In _ _ O
short, _ _ O
the _ _ O
new _ _ O
Pastis _ _ B-EST
takes _ _ O
almost _ _ O
everything _ _ O
straight _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
old _ _ O
Pastis _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
which _ _ O
in _ _ O
turn _ _ O
took _ _ O
almost _ _ O
everything _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
stodgiest, _ _ O
least _ _ O
trend-conscious _ _ O
sort _ _ O
of _ _ O
French _ _ B-CUISINE
cafes _ _ B-TYPE
and _ _ O
brasseries. _ _ B-TYPE
Needless _ _ O
to _ _ O
say, _ _ O
reservations _ _ O
are _ _ O
harder _ _ O
to _ _ O
come _ _ O
by _ _ O
than _ _ O
at _ _ O
any _ _ O
other _ _ O
New _ _ B-EST
York _ _ I-EST
restaurant _ _ O
that's _ _ O
opened _ _ O
this _ _ O
year. _ _ O
The _ _ O
paradox _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
Pastis _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
really _ _ O
meant _ _ O
for _ _ O
those _ _ O
nights _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
decide _ _ O
to _ _ O
cancel _ _ O
your _ _ O
reservations _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
little _ _ O
nine-seat _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
counter _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
inspired _ _ O
by _ _ O
Kieslowski's _ _ O
"Decalogue." _ _ B-EST
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
for _ _ O
those _ _ O
times _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
get _ _ O
an _ _ O
urge _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat _ _ O
a _ _ O
Gruyère _ _ B-DISH
omelet _ _ I-DISH
after _ _ O
10 _ _ O
p.m., _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
medium-rare, _ _ O
flecked _ _ O
with _ _ O
herbs, _ _ B-FOOD
skillfully _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
and _ _ O
staunchly _ _ O
backed _ _ O
up _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
cold _ _ O
white _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
Savoie. _ _ O
Urges _ _ O
like _ _ O
that _ _ O
do _ _ O
not _ _ O
typically _ _ O
announce _ _ O
themselves _ _ O
three _ _ O
weeks _ _ O
in _ _ O
advance, _ _ O
and _ _ O
they _ _ O
don't _ _ O
tend _ _ O
to _ _ O
survive _ _ O
exposure _ _ O
to _ _ O
rooms _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
have _ _ O
read _ _ O
about _ _ O
Pastis _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
blogs _ _ O
but _ _ O
haven't _ _ O
yet _ _ O
figured _ _ O
out _ _ O
what _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
for. _ _ O
For _ _ O
much _ _ O
of _ _ O
his _ _ O
life, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
McNally _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
chipping, _ _ O
cracking, _ _ O
distressing _ _ O
and _ _ O
weathering _ _ O
interiors _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
architectural _ _ O
equivalent _ _ O
of _ _ O
rumpled _ _ O
sweaters _ _ O
two _ _ O
sizes _ _ O
too _ _ O
large. _ _ O
Perhaps _ _ O
the _ _ O
largest _ _ O
and _ _ O
certainly _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
rumpled _ _ O
of _ _ O
all _ _ O
is _ _ O
Pastis. _ _ O
It _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
have _ _ O
the _ _ O
corner _ _ O
entrance _ _ O
it _ _ O
had _ _ O
at _ _ O
its _ _ O
former _ _ O
address, _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
long _ _ O
communal _ _ O
table _ _ O
that _ _ O
sliced _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
front _ _ O
room _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
surfboard. _ _ O
And _ _ O
the _ _ O
shelves _ _ O
of _ _ O
cigarette _ _ O
packs _ _ O
are _ _ O
definitely _ _ O
gone. _ _ O
( _ _ O
You _ _ O
could _ _ O
still _ _ O
smoke _ _ O
in _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
in _ _ O
1999, _ _ O
when _ _ O
Pastis _ _ O
opened.) _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
magazine _ _ O
racks _ _ O
are _ _ O
back, _ _ O
along _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
overhead _ _ O
fans _ _ O
turning _ _ O
steadily _ _ O
below _ _ O
a _ _ O
stamped _ _ O
tin _ _ O
ceiling. _ _ O
Once _ _ O
again _ _ O
the _ _ O
walls _ _ O
are _ _ O
covered _ _ O
with _ _ O
chipped _ _ O
subway _ _ O
tiles, _ _ O
white, _ _ O
framed _ _ O
by _ _ O
black _ _ O
grout. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chairs _ _ O
still _ _ O
don't _ _ O
match. _ _ O
The _ _ O
ambient _ _ O
light _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
Scotch _ _ O
and _ _ O
soda _ _ O
and _ _ O
makes _ _ O
everybody _ _ O
look _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
they _ _ O
do _ _ O
after _ _ O
you've _ _ O
drunk _ _ O
one. _ _ O
On _ _ O
an _ _ O
antique _ _ O
mirror, _ _ O
or _ _ O
one _ _ O
that _ _ O
looks _ _ O
like _ _ O
an _ _ O
antique, _ _ O
someone _ _ O
has _ _ O
scrawled _ _ O
a _ _ O
menu _ _ O
of _ _ O
desserts, _ _ O
almost _ _ O
none _ _ O
of _ _ O
which _ _ O
Pastis _ _ O
actually _ _ O
serves. _ _ O
You _ _ O
can, _ _ O
however, _ _ O
get _ _ O
an _ _ O
energetically _ _ O
whisked _ _ O
dark-chocolate _ _ O
mousse _ _ O
under _ _ O
shaved _ _ O
curls _ _ O
of _ _ O
chocolate, _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
baba _ _ O
au _ _ O
rhum _ _ O
so _ _ O
drenched _ _ O
in _ _ O
booze _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
might _ _ O
spontaneously _ _ O
combust _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
weren't _ _ O
being _ _ O
restrained _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
white _ _ O
dune _ _ O
of _ _ O
whipped _ _ O
Chantilly _ _ O
cream. _ _ O
The _ _ O
most _ _ O
significant _ _ O
change _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
Pastis _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
second _ _ O
happened _ _ O
offstage. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
McNally, _ _ O
who _ _ O
had _ _ O
a _ _ O
stroke _ _ O
two _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
has _ _ O
brought _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurateur _ _ O
Stephen _ _ O
Starr _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
partner _ _ O
who, _ _ O
essentially, _ _ O
manages _ _ O
everything _ _ O
except _ _ O
the _ _ O
design. _ _ O
Familiar _ _ O
faces _ _ O
from _ _ O
La _ _ O
Mercerie _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
Starr _ _ O
enterprises _ _ O
work _ _ O
alongside _ _ O
loyal _ _ O
retainers _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
McNally _ _ O
empire. _ _ O
The _ _ O
McNally _ _ O
troops _ _ O
are _ _ O
exquisitely _ _ O
poised, _ _ O
self-assured, _ _ O
able _ _ O
to _ _ O
spot _ _ O
a _ _ O
misplaced _ _ O
butter _ _ O
knife _ _ O
from _ _ O
across _ _ O
the _ _ O
street. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Starr _ _ O
cadre _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
casual, _ _ O
and _ _ O
occasionally _ _ O
a _ _ O
server _ _ O
will _ _ O
ask _ _ O
your _ _ O
opinion _ _ O
of _ _ O
"the _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
so _ _ O
far," _ _ O
a _ _ O
question _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
surely _ _ O
never _ _ O
been _ _ O
uttered _ _ O
at _ _ O
Minetta _ _ O
Tavern _ _ O
. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Starr _ _ O
has _ _ O
oversight _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
wine _ _ O
list, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
less _ _ O
conservative _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
typical _ _ O
McNally _ _ O
lineup, _ _ O
and _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
food, _ _ O
which _ _ O
has _ _ O
not _ _ O
been _ _ O
a _ _ O
strong _ _ O
suit _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
McNally _ _ O
organization _ _ O
since _ _ O
the _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
Lee _ _ O
Hanson _ _ O
and _ _ O
Riad _ _ O
Nasr _ _ O
went _ _ O
out _ _ O
on _ _ O
their _ _ O
own. _ _ O
Pastis's _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Michael _ _ O
Abt, _ _ O
was _ _ O
until _ _ O
recently _ _ O
in _ _ O
charge _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
Washington _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
Le _ _ O
Diplomate _ _ O
, _ _ O
which _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Starr _ _ O
owns. _ _ O
Better _ _ O
qualifications _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
conjure, _ _ O
given _ _ O
that _ _ O
Le _ _ O
Diplomate _ _ O
is _ _ O
essentially _ _ O
an _ _ O
imitation _ _ O
McNally _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
Taking _ _ O
his _ _ O
cues _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
old _ _ O
days, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Abt _ _ O
is _ _ O
putting _ _ O
out _ _ O
simple, _ _ O
unadorned, _ _ O
hunger-obliterating _ _ O
French _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
drawn _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
era _ _ O
before _ _ O
supermarkets _ _ O
and _ _ O
fast _ _ O
food. _ _ O
The _ _ O
salad _ _ O
of _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
herring _ _ O
and _ _ O
carrots _ _ O
with _ _ O
boiled _ _ O
potatoes _ _ O
might _ _ O
come _ _ O
straight _ _ O
from _ _ O
Brasserie _ _ O
Lipp _ _ O
. _ _ O
The _ _ O
country _ _ O
pâté _ _ O
is _ _ O
laden _ _ O
with _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
livers _ _ O
and _ _ O
riddled _ _ O
with _ _ O
soft _ _ O
white _ _ O
pork _ _ O
fat _ _ O
in _ _ O
gobs _ _ O
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
of _ _ O
gumdrops, _ _ O
although _ _ O
it _ _ O
could _ _ O
stand _ _ O
more _ _ O
salt, _ _ O
and _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
be _ _ O
happy _ _ O
to _ _ O
trade _ _ O
the _ _ O
slab _ _ O
of _ _ O
butter _ _ O
that _ _ O
comes _ _ O
with _ _ O
it _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
pot _ _ O
of _ _ O
mustard. _ _ O
The _ _ O
pâté _ _ O
is _ _ O
made _ _ O
in _ _ O
house, _ _ O
as _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
gorgeously _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
boudin _ _ O
blanc. _ _ O
With _ _ O
the _ _ O
boudin, _ _ O
you _ _ O
want _ _ O
puréed _ _ O
potatoes _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
almost _ _ O
liquid. _ _ O
That _ _ O
is _ _ O
what _ _ O
you _ _ O
get. _ _ O
You _ _ O
might _ _ O
argue _ _ O
that, _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
offers _ _ O
chilled _ _ O
king _ _ O
crab _ _ O
legs _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
dipped _ _ O
in _ _ O
aioli, _ _ O
this _ _ O
unextravagant _ _ O
cafe _ _ O
breaks _ _ O
character. _ _ O
Does _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
apply _ _ O
to _ _ O
garnishing _ _ O
sardines _ _ O
served _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
can _ _ O
with _ _ O
an _ _ O
ingot _ _ O
of _ _ O
prized, _ _ O
costly _ _ O
butter _ _ O
made _ _ O
by _ _ O
Jean-Yves _ _ O
Bordier? _ _ O
Maybe. _ _ O
I _ _ O
thought, _ _ O
in _ _ O
any _ _ O
case, _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
sardines _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
olive _ _ O
oil _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
packed _ _ O
in _ _ O
tended _ _ O
to _ _ O
talk _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
butter. _ _ O
The _ _ O
half _ _ O
roast _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
class _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
birds _ _ O
that _ _ O
Antoine _ _ O
Westermann _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
when _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
still _ _ O
at _ _ O
Le _ _ O
Coq _ _ O
Rico _ _ O
, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
probably _ _ O
as _ _ O
good _ _ O
a _ _ O
roast _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
as _ _ O
any _ _ O
normal _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
can _ _ O
produce. _ _ O
The _ _ O
duck _ _ O
in _ _ O
olives, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
is _ _ O
misconceived; _ _ O
the _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
is _ _ O
thin, _ _ O
acrid _ _ O
and _ _ O
one-dimensional _ _ O
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
head-spinningly _ _ O
rich, _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
at _ _ O
Allard _ _ O
in _ _ O
Paris _ _ O
. _ _ O
The _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
-- _ _ O
the _ _ O
trout _ _ O
amandine _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O
sautéed _ _ O
skin _ _ O
taut _ _ O
beneath _ _ O
its _ _ O
armor _ _ O
of _ _ O
toasted _ _ O
almonds; _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
mussels _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
broth _ _ O
that's _ _ O
satiny _ _ O
with _ _ O
melted _ _ O
butter; _ _ O
an _ _ O
entire _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
branzino _ _ O
with _ _ O
enough _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
summer _ _ O
vegetables _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
a _ _ O
salad _ _ O
-- _ _ O
is _ _ O
very _ _ O
appealing, _ _ O
though _ _ O
that _ _ O
won't _ _ O
stop _ _ O
the _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
are _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
steak _ _ O
frites _ _ O
without _ _ O
even _ _ O
a _ _ O
glance _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
Those _ _ O
people _ _ O
may _ _ O
get _ _ O
fries _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
and _ _ O
golden, _ _ O
or _ _ O
they _ _ O
might _ _ O
end _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
limp, _ _ O
oily _ _ O
batch, _ _ O
or _ _ O
they _ _ O
may _ _ O
get _ _ O
both _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
night, _ _ O
as _ _ O
I _ _ O
did. _ _ O
At _ _ O
the _ _ O
length _ _ O
of _ _ O
20 _ _ O
years, _ _ O
memories _ _ O
are _ _ O
untrustworthy, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
reasonably _ _ O
sure _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
at _ _ O
Pastis _ _ O
is _ _ O
better _ _ O
than _ _ O
it _ _ O
used _ _ O
to _ _ O
be. _ _ O
The _ _ O
wine _ _ O
is _ _ O
certainly _ _ O
more _ _ O
interesting. _ _ O
What's _ _ O
gone, _ _ O
and _ _ O
won't _ _ O
be _ _ O
back _ _ O
now _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O

addresses _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
taken _ _ O
over _ _ O
by _ _ O
shops _ _ O
like _ _ O
Loro _ _ O
Piana, _ _ O
Sephora, _ _ O

and _ _ O

a _ _ O

the _ _ O
other _ _ O
moles _ _ B-FOOD
-- _ _ O
Oaxaca's _ _ B-LOC
mole _ _ B-DISH
verde, _ _ I-DISH
say, _ _ O
which _ _ O
gets _ _ O
its _ _ O
green _ _ O
color _ _ O
from _ _ O
pumpkin _ _ B-FOOD
seeds, _ _ I-FOOD
tomatillos _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
fresh _ _ B-FOOD
herbs _ _ I-FOOD
-- _ _ O
were _ _ O
about _ _ O
as _ _ O
rare _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
mandarin _ _ O
duck _ _ O
in _ _ O
Central _ _ O
Park. _ _ O
In _ _ O
recent _ _ O
years, _ _ O
as _ _ O
these _ _ O
once-exotic _ _ O
species _ _ O
have _ _ O
become _ _ O
regular _ _ O
features _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
menus _ _ O
at _ _ O
Cosme _ _ O
, _ _ O
Empellón _ _ O
, _ _ O
Claro _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
restaurants, _ _ O
mole _ _ O
poblano _ _ O
has _ _ O
become _ _ O
something _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
pigeon _ _ O
of _ _ O
Mexican _ _ O
sauces, _ _ O
too _ _ O
common _ _ O
and _ _ O
familiar _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
worth _ _ O
noticing. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
share _ _ O
this _ _ O
low _ _ O
view _ _ O
of _ _ O
mole _ _ O
poblano, _ _ O
you _ _ O
owe _ _ O
it _ _ O
to _ _ O
yourself _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
at _ _ O
Casa _ _ O
Enrique _ _ O
. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Cosme _ _ O
Aguilar, _ _ O
calls _ _ O
it _ _ O
mole _ _ O
de _ _ O
Piaxtla, _ _ O
after _ _ O
the _ _ O
Pueblan _ _ O
town _ _ O
where _ _ O
his _ _ O
father _ _ O
grew _ _ O
up, _ _ O
and _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
reminder _ _ O
that _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
just _ _ O
one _ _ O
mole _ _ O
poblano _ _ O
but _ _ O
many. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
have _ _ O
apple _ _ O
in _ _ O
addition _ _ O
to _ _ O
raisins. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
are _ _ O
thickened _ _ O
with _ _ O
animal _ _ O
crackers. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Aguilar _ _ O
remembers _ _ O
that _ _ O
in _ _ O
his _ _ O
childhood _ _ O
home, _ _ O
plantains _ _ O
were _ _ O
allowed _ _ O
to _ _ O
hang _ _ O
until _ _ O
they _ _ O
were _ _ O
black _ _ O
before _ _ O
they _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
pounded _ _ O
into _ _ O
mole. _ _ O
Maybe _ _ O
this _ _ O
explains _ _ O
the _ _ O
particular _ _ O
sweetness _ _ O
of _ _ O
Casa _ _ O
Enrique's _ _ O
version, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
candy-bar _ _ O
sweetness _ _ O
of _ _ O
some. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
deep _ _ O
and _ _ O
complicated. _ _ O
The _ _ O
character _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
mole _ _ O
de _ _ O
Piaxtla _ _ O
unfurls _ _ O
as _ _ O
you _ _ O
eat, _ _ O
whether _ _ O
the _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
soaked _ _ O
into _ _ O
enchiladas _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
or _ _ O
simply _ _ O
pooled _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
plate _ _ O
over _ _ O
and _ _ O
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
quartered _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
and _ _ O
yellow _ _ O
rice _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
with _ _ O
peas. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Aguilar _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
frying, _ _ O
blending _ _ O
and _ _ O
stirring _ _ O
mole _ _ O
de _ _ O
Piaxtla _ _ O
since _ _ O
Casa _ _ O
Enrique _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
2012, _ _ O
just _ _ O
off _ _ O
Vernon _ _ O
Boulevard, _ _ O
in _ _ O
Long _ _ O
Island _ _ O
City, _ _ O
Queens. _ _ O
In _ _ O
fact, _ _ O
he _ _ O
has _ _ O
barely _ _ O
changed _ _ O
his _ _ O
menu _ _ O
since _ _ O
our _ _ O
Hungry _ _ O
City _ _ O
critic, _ _ O
Ligaya _ _ O
Mishan, _ _ O
reviewed _ _ O
it _ _ O
the _ _ O
next _ _ O
year. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Aguilar _ _ O
says _ _ O
he _ _ O
is _ _ O
emulating _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
he _ _ O
likes _ _ O
best _ _ O
in _ _ O
Mexico, _ _ O
ones _ _ O
whose _ _ O
kitchens _ _ O
make _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
year _ _ O
in _ _ O
and _ _ O
year _ _ O
out. _ _ O
Whether _ _ O
despite _ _ O
this _ _ O
or _ _ O
because _ _ O
of _ _ O
it, _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
improved _ _ O
in _ _ O
subtle _ _ O
ways. _ _ O
Acoustic _ _ O
panels _ _ O
tacked _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
ceiling _ _ O
make _ _ O
conversation _ _ O
easier. _ _ O
Servers, _ _ O
always _ _ O
welcoming, _ _ O
have _ _ O
become _ _ O
experts _ _ O
at _ _ O
anticipating _ _ O
the _ _ O
meal's _ _ O
ebb _ _ O
and _ _ O
flow. _ _ O
They'll _ _ O
step _ _ O
in _ _ O
just _ _ O
when _ _ O
you're _ _ O
ready _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
drink, _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
a _ _ O
margarita _ _ O
with _ _ O
some _ _ O
tamarind _ _ O
this _ _ O
time _ _ O
to _ _ O
offset _ _ O
the _ _ O
raw-sugar _ _ O
syrup. _ _ O
They'll _ _ O
gauge _ _ O
the _ _ O
precise _ _ O
moment _ _ O
when _ _ O
you're _ _ O
ready _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
plates _ _ O
cleared _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
room _ _ O
for _ _ O
dessert. _ _ O
Or _ _ O
they'll _ _ O
break _ _ O
away _ _ O
from _ _ O
your _ _ O
table _ _ O
just _ _ O
long _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
join _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
full-throated _ _ O
singing _ _ O
of _ _ O
"Happy _ _ O
Birthday" _ _ O
around _ _ O
a _ _ O
slice _ _ O
of _ _ O
tres _ _ O
leches _ _ O
cake _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
candle _ _ O
stuck _ _ O
in _ _ O
it _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
side _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
room. _ _ O
This _ _ O
may _ _ O
happen _ _ O
three _ _ O
or _ _ O
four _ _ O
times _ _ O
a _ _ O
night, _ _ O
probably _ _ O
not _ _ O
because _ _ O
Casa _ _ O
Enrique _ _ O
looks _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
festive _ _ O
-- _ _ O
from _ _ O
floor _ _ O
to _ _ O
ceiling, _ _ O
it's _ _ O
done _ _ O
almost _ _ O
entirely _ _ O
in _ _ O
white _ _ O
-- _ _ O
but, _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
guess, _ _ O
because _ _ O
regulars _ _ O
know _ _ O
it _ _ O
regularly _ _ O
outperforms _ _ O
any _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
other _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
that _ _ O
might _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
more _ _ O
special _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
surface _ _ O
but _ _ O
aren't, _ _ O
really. _ _ O
Also, _ _ O
the _ _ O
tres _ _ O
leches _ _ O
cake, _ _ O
if _ _ O
not _ _ O
as _ _ O
soggy _ _ O
with _ _ O
condensed _ _ O
milk _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
could _ _ O
be, _ _ O
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
pretty _ _ O
good, _ _ O
though _ _ O
I _ _ O
think _ _ O
the _ _ O
flan _ _ O
is _ _ O
almost _ _ O
mandatory, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
perfectly _ _ O
credible _ _ O
birthday-candle _ _ O
holder. _ _ O
Although _ _ O
the _ _ O
guacamole _ _ O
is _ _ O
freshly _ _ O
mashed _ _ O
and _ _ O
pleasingly _ _ O
minimalist, _ _ O
I _ _ O
tend _ _ O
to _ _ O
skip _ _ O
it _ _ O
as _ _ O
long _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
people _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
with _ _ O
don't _ _ O
mind. _ _ O
Instead _ _ O
I'll _ _ O
head _ _ O
straight _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
two-bite _ _ O
sopecitos _ _ O
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
refried _ _ O
beans _ _ O
and _ _ O
loose _ _ O
chorizo, _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
albondigas _ _ O
in _ _ O
cumin-laced _ _ O
chipotle _ _ O
sauce, _ _ O
each _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
three _ _ O
meatballs _ _ O
stuffed _ _ O
with _ _ O
hard-cooked _ _ O
eggs. _ _ O
The _ _ O
best _ _ O
Mexican _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
often _ _ O
come _ _ O
from _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
that _ _ O
specialize _ _ O
in _ _ O
them. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Aguilar, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
seems _ _ O
equally _ _ O
at _ _ O
home _ _ O
with _ _ O
fish _ _ O
and _ _ O
meat. _ _ O
The _ _ O
market _ _ O
fish _ _ O
offered _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
main _ _ O
course _ _ O
-- _ _ O
lately _ _ O
a _ _ O
black _ _ O
sea _ _ O
bass _ _ O
-- _ _ O
has _ _ O
always _ _ O
been _ _ O
seared _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
skin _ _ O
side. _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
in _ _ O
all _ _ O
these _ _ O
years _ _ O
I've _ _ O
never _ _ O
been _ _ O
convinced _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
corn _ _ O
under _ _ O
it _ _ O
compares _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
street-corner _ _ O
esquites, _ _ O
or _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
fish _ _ O
really _ _ O
add _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
whole _ _ O
dish. _ _ O
The _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
appetizers, _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
hand, _ _ O
are _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
my _ _ O
favorite _ _ O
things _ _ O
at _ _ O
Casa _ _ O
Enrique: _ _ O
the _ _ O
delicately _ _ O
fried _ _ O
oysters _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
mayonnaise _ _ O
that _ _ O
gets _ _ O
its _ _ O
tangerine _ _ O
color _ _ O
from _ _ O
ground _ _ O
chiles; _ _ O
the _ _ O
ceviche, _ _ O
freshly _ _ O
tossed _ _ O
with _ _ O
lime _ _ O
and _ _ O
herbs; _ _ O
the _ _ O
crab _ _ O
tostadas, _ _ O
loaded _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
thin _ _ O
slice _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
of _ _ O
Serrano _ _ O
chile, _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
tomato, _ _ O
leaves _ _ O
of _ _ O
cilantro, _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
avocado _ _ O
salsa _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
spoonful _ _ O
of _ _ O
crab _ _ O
meat, _ _ O
pure _ _ O
and _ _ O
clean; _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
cocktail, _ _ O
which _ _ O
gets _ _ O
its _ _ O
roundness _ _ O
and _ _ O
slight _ _ O
richness, _ _ O
I _ _ O
think, _ _ O
from _ _ O
orange _ _ O
soda, _ _ O
just _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
you'd _ _ O
hope. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Aguilar _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
those _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
who _ _ O
set _ _ O
up _ _ O
masa _ _ O
factories _ _ O
in _ _ O
their _ _ O
basements. _ _ O
Casa _ _ O
Enrique's _ _ O
corn _ _ O
tortillas _ _ O
do _ _ O
not _ _ O
have _ _ O
the _ _ O
pretty _ _ O
floral _ _ O
aromas _ _ O
of _ _ O
Cosme's, _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweet, _ _ O
focused _ _ O
corn _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
you _ _ O
taste _ _ O
in _ _ O
Claro's. _ _ O
But _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
better _ _ O
than _ _ O
you'd _ _ O
find _ _ O
almost _ _ O
anywhere _ _ O
else _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ O
York. _ _ O
They _ _ O
give _ _ O
a _ _ O
boost _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
tacos, _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
braised _ _ O
tongue _ _ O
or _ _ O
brisket; _ _ O
crumbled _ _ O
chorizo; _ _ O
or _ _ O
fried, _ _ O
battered _ _ O
fish, _ _ O
and _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
especially _ _ O
delicious _ _ O
soaked _ _ O
in _ _ O
salsa _ _ O
verde _ _ O
and _ _ O
wrapped _ _ O
around _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
poblanos _ _ O
in _ _ O
cream _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
enchiladas _ _ O
Doña _ _ O
Blanca. _ _ O
And _ _ O
while _ _ O
Cosme's _ _ O
more _ _ O
modern _ _ O
approach _ _ O
has _ _ O
soaked _ _ O
up _ _ O
more _ _ O
media _ _ O
attention, _ _ O
I've _ _ O
encountered _ _ O
more _ _ O
bloops _ _ O
and _ _ O
wobbles _ _ O
eating _ _ O
there _ _ O
than _ _ O
I _ _ O
have _ _ O
exploring _ _ O
the _ _ O
far _ _ O
more _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
menu _ _ O
at _ _ O
Casa _ _ O
Enrique. _ _ O
It _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
necessarily _ _ O
the _ _ O
more _ _ O
interesting _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it's _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
where _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
more _ _ O
confident _ _ O
that _ _ O
if _ _ O
I _ _ O
went _ _ O
there _ _ O
tonight, _ _ O
everything _ _ O
would _ _ O
taste _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
supposed _ _ O
to. _ _ O
The _ _ O
pozole _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
dark _ _ O
and _ _ O
intense, _ _ O
though _ _ O
not _ _ O
especially _ _ O
spicy, _ _ O
with _ _ O
tender _ _ O
strands _ _ O
of _ _ O
pork _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
broth _ _ O
and _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
usual _ _ O
mix-ins _ _ O
waiting _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
side. _ _ O
The _ _ O
pork _ _ O
ribs _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
slowly _ _ O
braised, _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
style _ _ O
of _ _ O
Chiapas, _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
thick _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
salsa _ _ O
built _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
foundation _ _ O
of _ _ O
guajillo _ _ O
chiles. _ _ O
These _ _ O
ribs _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
confused _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
baby _ _ O
back _ _ O
ribs, _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
even _ _ O
thicker, _ _ O
creamier _ _ O
pipian _ _ O
rojo, _ _ O
that _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
turn _ _ O
up _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
daily _ _ O
special. _ _ O
Best _ _ O
of _ _ O
all, _ _ O
perhaps, _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
chamorro _ _ O
de _ _ O
borrego, _ _ O
or _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
shank _ _ O
stewed _ _ O
with _ _ O
chickpeas; _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
very _ _ O
tender _ _ O
and _ _ O
very _ _ O
flavorful _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
rough _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
of _ _ O
pulla _ _ O
chiles _ _ O
with _ _ O
crushed _ _ O
guaje _ _ O
seeds. _ _ O
The _ _ O
name _ _ O
of _ _ O
that _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
is _ _ O
huaxmole, _ _ O
or _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
guaxmole, _ _ O
or _ _ O
even _ _ O
mole _ _ O
de _ _ O
guaje. _ _ O
Yes, _ _ O
it's _ _ O
a _ _ O
mole, _ _ O
and _ _ O
one _ _ O
that _ _ O
rarely _ _ O
flies _ _ O
as _ _ O
far _ _ O
north _ _ O
as _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
City. _ _ O
At _ _ O
Casa _ _ O
Enrique, _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
found _ _ O
a _ _ O
permanent _ _ O
perch. _ _ O

Intersect _ _ O

a _ _ O

to _ _ O

of _ _ O

a _ _ O

a _ _ O

roomy _ _ O
Scandinavian _ _ B-CUISINE
cafe _ _ B-TYPE
whose _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
was, _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
time, _ _ O
overseen _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
Fredrik _ _ O

. _ _ O
(Mr. _ _ O

is _ _ O
no _ _ O

When _ _ O
I _ _ O
ate _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
cafe, _ _ B-TYPE
shortly _ _ O
after _ _ O
A/D/O _ _ O
opened, _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
barely _ _ O
dented _ _ O
my _ _ O
consciousness, _ _ O
although _ _ O
I _ _ O
remember _ _ O
thinking _ _ O
that _ _ O
if _ _ O
I _ _ O
worked _ _ O
nearby _ _ O
I _ _ O
probably _ _ O
would _ _ O
drop _ _ O
in _ _ O
for _ _ O
lunch _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
cortado. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
way, _ _ O
if _ _ O
I _ _ O
find _ _ O
myself _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
meatpacking _ _ B-LOC
district _ _ I-LOC
by _ _ O
day, _ _ O
I _ _ O
might _ _ O
join _ _ O
the _ _ O
Wi-Fi _ _ O
philosophers _ _ O
who _ _ O
occupy _ _ O
the _ _ O
spindle-backed _ _ O
chairs _ _ O
downstairs _ _ O
at _ _ O
Intersect, _ _ B-EST
just _ _ O
so _ _ O
I _ _ O
could _ _ O
get _ _ O
a _ _ O
maple-bacon _ _ B-DISH
scone, _ _ I-DISH
a _ _ O
recipe _ _ O
imported _ _ O
from _ _ O
Frenchie _ _ B-EST
to _ _ I-EST
Go _ _ I-EST
on _ _ O
the _ _ O

in _ _ O

On _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
hand, _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
go _ _ O
well _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
my _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat _ _ O
upstairs _ _ O
at _ _ O
Intersect _ _ B-EST
again. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
not _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
three _ _ O
dimensions _ _ O
-- _ _ O
the _ _ O
service, _ _ O
while _ _ O
skilled, _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
anonymous, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
interior _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
hodgepodge _ _ O
of _ _ O
expensive, _ _ O
subtle _ _ O
design _ _ O
and _ _ O
bric-a-brac _ _ O
that _ _ O
might _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
ordered _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
catalog. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
is _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
engaging _ _ O
I've _ _ O
come _ _ O
across _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
few _ _ O
months, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
go _ _ O
away _ _ O
after _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
March, _ _ O
when _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Marchand's _ _ O
menu _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
replaced _ _ O
by _ _ O
one _ _ O
devised _ _ O
by _ _ O
another _ _ O
chef _ _ O
from _ _ O
somewhere _ _ O
else _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
world, _ _ O
chosen _ _ O
by _ _ O
representatives _ _ O
from _ _ O
Union _ _ O
Square _ _ O
Hospitality _ _ O
Group _ _ O
and _ _ O
Lexus. _ _ O
(A _ _ O
formal _ _ O
review, _ _ O
with _ _ O

would _ _ O
be _ _ O
obsolete _ _ O
almost _ _ O
as _ _ O

as _ _ O
it _ _ O

I've _ _ O
never _ _ O
made _ _ O
it _ _ O
to _ _ O

or _ _ O
its _ _ O

in _ _ O

Many _ _ O

have, _ _ O
however, _ _ O
and _ _ O
working _ _ O
my _ _ O
way _ _ O
through _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Marchand's _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
at _ _ O
Intersect _ _ B-EST
helped _ _ O
me _ _ O
understand _ _ O
what _ _ O
other _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
around _ _ O
town _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
trying _ _ O
to _ _ O
imitate: _ _ O
the _ _ O
charred _ _ B-FOOD
leaves, _ _ I-FOOD
the _ _ O
cooked _ _ B-FOOD
grains, _ _ I-FOOD
the _ _ O
gently _ _ O
swirling _ _ O
patterns _ _ O
that _ _ O
suggest _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
plating _ _ O
food _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
turntable. _ _ O
Grilled _ _ B-FOOD
baby _ _ I-FOOD
leek _ _ I-FOOD
greens _ _ I-FOOD
angled _ _ O
out _ _ O
around _ _ O
a _ _ O
pile _ _ O
of _ _ O
barley _ _ B-FOOD
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
what _ _ O
looked _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
deviled _ _ B-FOOD
egg. _ _ I-FOOD
It _ _ O
was, _ _ O
in _ _ O
fact, _ _ O
a _ _ O
smoked _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ I-FOOD
lemon-spiked _ _ I-FOOD
yolk _ _ I-FOOD
plopped _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
center _ _ O
of _ _ O
some _ _ O
"whites" _ _ O
made _ _ O
of _ _ O
Parmesan _ _ B-FOOD
sabayon. _ _ I-FOOD
Spice _ _ O
and _ _ O
crunch _ _ O
came _ _ O
from _ _ O
puffed _ _ B-FOOD
barley _ _ I-FOOD
dusted _ _ O
with _ _ O
piment _ _ B-FOOD
d'Espelette. _ _ I-FOOD
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
just _ _ O
tricky _ _ O
enough, _ _ O
this _ _ O
dish. _ _ O
And _ _ O
I _ _ O
loved _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
a _ _ O
caraway _ _ B-FOOD
brioche, _ _ I-FOOD
pickled _ _ B-FOOD
mustard _ _ I-FOOD
seeds _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
cucumbers _ _ B-FOOD
completed _ _ O
the _ _ O
deli _ _ B-TYPE
allusions _ _ O
begun _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
foie _ _ B-DISH
gras _ _ I-DISH
terrine _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ O
layers _ _ O
of _ _ O
soft, _ _ O
smoky _ _ O
pastrami. _ _ B-FOOD
There _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
very _ _ O
welcome _ _ O
spin _ _ O
on _ _ O
skate _ _ B-DISH
grenobloise _ _ I-DISH
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
the _ _ O
fish _ _ B-FOOD
was _ _ O
replaced _ _ O
by _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
white _ _ B-FOOD
halibut _ _ I-FOOD
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
golden _ _ O
bread-crumb _ _ B-FOOD
crust; _ _ I-FOOD
sea _ _ B-FOOD
beans _ _ I-FOOD
extended _ _ O
the _ _ O
briny _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
of _ _ O
capers _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
brown _ _ B-FOOD
butter _ _ I-FOOD
sauce. _ _ I-FOOD
And _ _ O
if _ _ O
this _ _ O
all _ _ O
sounds _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
cerebral, _ _ O
the _ _ O
big, _ _ O
pillowy, _ _ O
pan-seared _ _ B-DISH

with _ _ I-DISH
fried _ _ I-DISH
sweetbreads _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ I-DISH
veal-glazed _ _ I-DISH

proved _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Marchand _ _ O
knows _ _ O
the _ _ O
appeal _ _ O
of _ _ O
animal _ _ O
instincts. _ _ O
What _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
of _ _ O
those _ _ O
few _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
that _ _ O
did _ _ O
not _ _ O
come _ _ O
together _ _ O
-- _ _ O
the _ _ O
pebbles _ _ O
of _ _ O
cauliflower _ _ B-FOOD
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
layer _ _ O
of _ _ O
seeds _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
nuts _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
looked _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
had _ _ O
spilled _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
bird _ _ O
feeder, _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
lukewarm _ _ O
chocolate _ _ B-DISH
mousse _ _ I-DISH
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
bottom _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
deep _ _ O
bowl? _ _ O
Was _ _ O
the _ _ O
problem _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Marchand's _ _ O
recipes? _ _ O
The _ _ O
way _ _ O
the _ _ O
Union _ _ O
Square _ _ O
Hospitality _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
crew, _ _ O
led _ _ O
by _ _ O
Nickolas _ _ O
Martinez, _ _ O
had _ _ O
carried _ _ O
them _ _ O
out? _ _ O
The _ _ O
local _ _ O
terroir? _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Martinez _ _ O
and _ _ O
Dylan _ _ O
Shipsey, _ _ O
the _ _ O
general _ _ O
manager, _ _ O
say _ _ O
they _ _ O
want _ _ O
customers _ _ O
to _ _ O
feel _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
walking _ _ O
into _ _ O
Frenchie _ _ B-EST
in _ _ O
Paris. _ _ B-LOC
Intersect _ _ B-EST
does _ _ O
not _ _ O
have _ _ O
the _ _ O
premodern _ _ O
limestone _ _ O
wall _ _ O
and _ _ O
ceiling _ _ O
timbers _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Rue _ _ B-LOC
du _ _ I-LOC
Nil, _ _ I-LOC
but _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Marchand _ _ O
tried _ _ O
to _ _ O
sprinkle _ _ O
some _ _ O
Right _ _ B-LOC
Bank _ _ I-LOC
pixie _ _ O
dust _ _ O
on _ _ O
West _ _ B-LOC
14th _ _ I-LOC
Street _ _ I-LOC
by _ _ O
choosing _ _ O
the _ _ O
plates _ _ O
and _ _ O
bowls, _ _ O
consulting _ _ O
on _ _ O
flower _ _ O
arrangements _ _ O
and _ _ O
sharing _ _ O
his _ _ O
Spotify _ _ O
playlists. _ _ O
Maybe _ _ O
those _ _ O
things _ _ O
help. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room, _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
design _ _ O
firm _ _ O
Wonderwall _ _ O
, _ _ O
mostly _ _ O
looks _ _ O
like _ _ O
money _ _ O
to _ _ O
me, _ _ O
apart _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
shelves _ _ O
half-filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
coffee-table _ _ O
books, _ _ O
black _ _ O
crow _ _ O
figurines _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
eerily _ _ O
generic _ _ O
knickknacks. _ _ O
At _ _ O
least _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
had _ _ O
the _ _ O
good _ _ O
sense _ _ O
to _ _ O
keep _ _ O
the _ _ O
car _ _ O
downstairs, _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
restrooms, _ _ O
before _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
out _ _ O
last _ _ O
weekend _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
room _ _ O
for _ _ O
another _ _ O
temporary _ _ O
exhibition. _ _ O
In _ _ O
what _ _ O
may _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
good _ _ O
sign _ _ O
for _ _ O
Lexus, _ _ O
nobody _ _ O
paid _ _ O
much _ _ O
attention _ _ O
to _ _ O
it _ _ O
when _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
there, _ _ O
but _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
was _ _ O
always _ _ O
marveling _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
toilets, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Japanese _ _ O
kind _ _ O
that _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
know _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
what _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
do _ _ O
before _ _ O
you _ _ O
do. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chef-in-residence _ _ O
conceit _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
unique _ _ O
to _ _ O
Intersect. _ _ O
On _ _ O
Mulberry _ _ B-LOC
Street, _ _ I-LOC
Chefs _ _ B-EST
Club _ _ I-EST
also _ _ O
turns _ _ O
its _ _ O
permanent _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
crew _ _ O
over _ _ O
to _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
else's _ _ O
menu; _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
Houston, _ _ B-LOC
the _ _ O
Decatur _ _ B-EST
Bar _ _ I-EST
& _ _ I-EST
Popup _ _ I-EST
Factory _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
gives _ _ O
its _ _ O
entire _ _ O
space _ _ O
to _ _ O
prospective _ _ O
restaurateurs _ _ O
for _ _ O
three _ _ O
months _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
time _ _ O
so _ _ O
they _ _ O
can _ _ O
test-drive _ _ O
their _ _ O
ideas _ _ O
before _ _ O
going _ _ O
out _ _ O
on _ _ O
their _ _ O
own. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
of _ _ O
Contra _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
in _ _ O
Manhattan, _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
turn _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
to _ _ O
friends _ _ O
of _ _ O
theirs _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
night _ _ O
or _ _ O
two. _ _ O
The _ _ O
most _ _ O
ambitious _ _ O
experiment _ _ O
in _ _ O
this _ _ O
vein _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
In _ _ B-EST
Situ _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
inside _ _ O
the _ _ O
San _ _ B-LOC
Francisco _ _ I-LOC
Museum _ _ I-LOC
of _ _ I-LOC
Modern _ _ I-LOC
Art _ _ I-LOC
that _ _ O
on _ _ O
any _ _ O
given _ _ O
day _ _ O
faithfully _ _ O
reproduces _ _ O
a _ _ O
dozen _ _ O
or _ _ O
so _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
strongly _ _ O
identified _ _ O
with _ _ O
other _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
world. _ _ O
To _ _ O
understand _ _ O
the _ _ O
appeal _ _ O
for _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O
pop-ups _ _ O
and _ _ O
residencies, _ _ O
think _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
Instagram _ _ O
posts, _ _ O
the _ _ O
email-address _ _ O
caches, _ _ O
the _ _ O
preview _ _ O
news _ _ O
items, _ _ O
even _ _ O
the _ _ O
occasional _ _ O
reviews _ _ O
they _ _ O
generate. _ _ O
For _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
months' _ _ O
or _ _ O
even _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
nights' _ _ O
work, _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
can _ _ O
refresh _ _ O
its _ _ O
aura _ _ O
of _ _ O
newness _ _ O
and _ _ O
relevance. _ _ O
In _ _ O
an _ _ O
era _ _ O
that _ _ O
feeds _ _ O
on _ _ O
novelty, _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
who _ _ O
just _ _ O
keep _ _ O
plugging _ _ O
along _ _ O
can _ _ O
seem _ _ O
older _ _ O
than _ _ O
they _ _ O
really _ _ O
are. _ _ O
The _ _ O
events _ _ O
make _ _ O
the _ _ O
host _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
look _ _ O
cooler, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
(It's _ _ O
been _ _ O
a _ _ O
while _ _ O
since _ _ O
Union _ _ O
Square _ _ O
Hospitality _ _ O
Group _ _ O
hired _ _ O
a _ _ O
chef _ _ O
who _ _ O
got _ _ O
menu _ _ O
analysts _ _ O
chattering _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Marchand _ _ O
does.) _ _ O
And _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
go _ _ O
to _ _ O
these _ _ O
dinners _ _ O
can _ _ O
boast _ _ O
about _ _ O
them _ _ O
on _ _ O
social _ _ O
media. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
a _ _ O
big, _ _ O
beautiful _ _ O
marketing _ _ O
ecosystem _ _ O
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
everybody _ _ O
from _ _ O
predators _ _ O
to _ _ O
bottom _ _ O
feeders _ _ O
gets _ _ O
to _ _ O
believe _ _ O
they're _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
top _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
chain. _ _ O

the _ _ O

15 _ _ O

in _ _ O

never _ _ O

The _ _ O

seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
stuck _ _ O
in _ _ O
some _ _ O
time _ _ O
between _ _ O
1994, _ _ O

with _ _ O
a _ _ O

The _ _ O

a _ _ O
tough _ _ O

to _ _ O
those _ _ O

be _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
moment _ _ O
that _ _ O
they _ _ O
might _ _ O
as _ _ O
well _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
time _ _ O
stamp. _ _ O
Benno _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
trying _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
contemporary. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
trying _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
delicious. _ _ O
And _ _ O
it _ _ O
is, _ _ O
from _ _ O
start _ _ O
to _ _ O
finish, _ _ O
almost _ _ O
without _ _ O
exception. _ _ O
Benno _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
third _ _ O
of _ _ O
three _ _ O
dining _ _ O
operations _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Benno _ _ O
opened _ _ O
last _ _ O
year _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Evelyn _ _ B-LOC
Hotel _ _ I-LOC
, _ _ O
on _ _ O
East _ _ B-LOC
27th _ _ I-LOC
Street. _ _ I-LOC
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
prices, _ _ O
and _ _ O
presumably _ _ O
the _ _ O
stakes, _ _ O
are _ _ O
highest. _ _ O
We _ _ O
know _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
statement _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
because _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Benno _ _ O
has _ _ O
put _ _ O
his _ _ O
name _ _ O
on _ _ O
it, _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
time _ _ O
in _ _ O
his _ _ O
career. _ _ O
Whatever _ _ O
the _ _ O
statement _ _ O
is, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
forward-looking. _ _ O
Most _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
statement _ _ O
is _ _ O
in _ _ O
French _ _ B-CUISINE
(barigoule, _ _ B-DISH
mousseline, _ _ B-DISH
tête _ _ B-DISH
de _ _ I-DISH
veau, _ _ I-DISH
béarnaise), _ _ B-DISH
a _ _ O
significant _ _ O
part _ _ O
is _ _ O
in _ _ O
Italian _ _ B-CUISINE
(carnaroli _ _ B-DISH
risotto, _ _ I-DISH
garganelli _ _ B-DISH
verde, _ _ I-DISH
pecorino _ _ B-DISH
ginepro) _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
not _ _ O
one _ _ O
word _ _ O
is _ _ O
in _ _ O
Danish _ _ B-CUISINE
or _ _ O
Mandarin. _ _ B-CUISINE
The _ _ O
statement _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
to _ _ O
say _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
topics _ _ O
of _ _ O
stocks _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
purées _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
accurate _ _ O
chopping _ _ O
and _ _ O
patient _ _ O
skimming; _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
entirely _ _ O
silent _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
subjects _ _ O
of _ _ O
fermented _ _ B-FOOD
vegetables, _ _ I-FOOD
or _ _ O
foraging, _ _ O
or _ _ O
immigration, _ _ O
or _ _ O
food _ _ O
deserts, _ _ O
or _ _ O
hashtags. _ _ O
The _ _ O
statement _ _ O
is _ _ O
delivered _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
windowless _ _ O
hotel _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
to _ _ O
people _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
comfortably _ _ O
on _ _ O
black-leather _ _ O
chairs _ _ O
or _ _ O
velvet _ _ O
banquettes _ _ O
the _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
pinot _ _ B-FOOD
noir _ _ I-FOOD
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
Loire _ _ B-LOC
Valley. _ _ I-LOC
It _ _ O
takes _ _ O
the _ _ O
form _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
fixed _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
courses, _ _ O
three _ _ O
or _ _ O
four _ _ O
or _ _ O
five, _ _ O
your _ _ O
choice. _ _ O
One _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
and _ _ O
one _ _ O
a _ _ O
main _ _ O
course. _ _ O
None _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
plate _ _ O
meant _ _ O
for _ _ O
sharing. _ _ O
None _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
large-format _ _ O
plate _ _ O
either, _ _ O
unless _ _ O
you _ _ O
count _ _ O
the _ _ O
veal _ _ B-DISH
sirloin _ _ I-DISH
chop _ _ I-DISH
that _ _ O
arrives _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
silver _ _ O
platter _ _ O
in _ _ O
slices _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
as _ _ O
pink _ _ O
and _ _ O
delicately _ _ O
shaded _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
cheek _ _ O
on _ _ O
any _ _ O
blushing _ _ O
young _ _ O
aristocrat _ _ O
Fragonard _ _ O
ever _ _ O
painted. _ _ O
The _ _ O
presentations _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
overly _ _ O
dramatic. _ _ O
They _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
disarmingly _ _ O
modest, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
cold _ _ O
slice _ _ O
of _ _ O
fish _ _ B-DISH
terrine _ _ I-DISH
that _ _ O
appeared _ _ O
before _ _ O
the _ _ O
appetizers _ _ O
one _ _ O
night _ _ O
looking _ _ O
pale _ _ O
and _ _ O
somewhat _ _ O
lost. _ _ O
I _ _ O
barely _ _ O
noticed _ _ O
it. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
I _ _ O
tasted _ _ O
fennel _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
bouillabaisse _ _ B-FOOD
flavors _ _ O
and _ _ O
-- _ _ O
excuse _ _ O
me, _ _ O
what _ _ O
was _ _ O
your _ _ O
name _ _ O
again? _ _ O
-- _ _ O
I _ _ O
started _ _ O
to _ _ O
pay _ _ O
attention. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
news _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
liquid _ _ B-FOOD
yolk _ _ I-FOOD
of _ _ I-FOOD
an _ _ I-FOOD
egg _ _ I-FOOD
tastes _ _ O
good _ _ O
trickled _ _ O
over _ _ O
baby _ _ B-FOOD
leeks, _ _ I-FOOD
fingerlings, _ _ B-FOOD
black-truffle _ _ B-FOOD
froth _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
pioppini _ _ B-FOOD
mushrooms _ _ I-FOOD
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
of _ _ O
shirt _ _ O
buttons. _ _ O
But _ _ O
just _ _ O
how _ _ O
good _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
makes _ _ O
an _ _ O
interesting _ _ O
item. _ _ O
Lamb _ _ B-DISH
saddle, _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ O
grill _ _ O
marks _ _ O
that _ _ O
could _ _ O
come _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
steakhouse, _ _ B-TYPE
is _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
fairytale _ _ B-FOOD
eggplant _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
Thumbelina _ _ O
carrots. _ _ O
Each _ _ O
vegetable _ _ O
in _ _ O
this _ _ O
miniature _ _ O
garden _ _ O
is _ _ O
planted _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
purée _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
reduced _ _ O
essence _ _ O
of _ _ O
itself. _ _ O
Each _ _ O
is _ _ O
very _ _ O
good, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
carrots _ _ O
are _ _ O
fantastic. _ _ O
Alongside _ _ O
them _ _ O
sits _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
breast _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
pressed _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
rich _ _ O
little _ _ O
brick _ _ O
coated _ _ O
in _ _ O
bread _ _ O
crumbs. _ _ O
One _ _ O
corner _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
brick _ _ O
sits _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark-green _ _ O
spread _ _ O
that _ _ O
tastes _ _ O
like _ _ O
gremolata. _ _ O
Not _ _ O
one _ _ O
combination _ _ O
of _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
on _ _ O
this _ _ O
plate _ _ O
is _ _ O
original, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
matter _ _ O
at _ _ O
all. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
food _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Benno _ _ O
made _ _ O
at _ _ O
his _ _ O
last _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
Lincoln _ _ O
Ristorante _ _ O
, _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
impressive, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
had _ _ O
the _ _ O
sense _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
outside _ _ O
in, _ _ O
trying _ _ O
to _ _ O
unlock _ _ O
the _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
of _ _ O
Italy _ _ O
through _ _ O
process _ _ O
and _ _ O
method. _ _ O
The _ _ O
results _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
always _ _ O
match _ _ O
the _ _ O
evident _ _ O
effort. _ _ O
I _ _ O
still _ _ O
got _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
of _ _ O
that _ _ O
feeling _ _ O
from _ _ O
his _ _ O
food _ _ O
at _ _ O
Leonelli _ _ O
Taberna _ _ O
, _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
back _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Evelyn _ _ O
lobby. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
supposed _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
hotel's _ _ O
casual _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
catch _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
trying _ _ O
to _ _ O
relax. _ _ O
Only _ _ O
a _ _ O
lasagna _ _ O
with _ _ O
green _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
below _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark _ _ O
field _ _ O
of _ _ O
browned _ _ O
béchamel _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
completely _ _ O
comfortable _ _ O
with _ _ O
itself. _ _ O
(On _ _ O
the _ _ O
streetside _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
hotel _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
shop _ _ O
and _ _ O
bakery _ _ O
selling _ _ O
two-foot-long _ _ O
flatbreads _ _ O
called _ _ O
focaccia _ _ O
that _ _ O
have _ _ O
more _ _ O
in _ _ O
common _ _ O
with _ _ O
Roman _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
al _ _ O
taglio.) _ _ O
The _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
at _ _ O
Benno, _ _ O
overseen _ _ O
by _ _ O
Justin _ _ O
Skribner, _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
de _ _ O
cuisine, _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
appear _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
plagued _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
similar _ _ O
anxiety. _ _ O
The _ _ O
French _ _ O
ideas, _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
drum _ _ O
of _ _ O
pig's _ _ O
trotter _ _ O
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
fried _ _ O
quail _ _ O
egg _ _ O
with _ _ O
flageolets _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
beans, _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
darkly _ _ O
seared _ _ O
duck _ _ O
breast _ _ O
with _ _ O
melting _ _ O
foie _ _ O
gras _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
savory _ _ O
triangle _ _ O
of _ _ O
duck _ _ O
leg, _ _ O
dates _ _ O
and _ _ O
pistachios _ _ O
in _ _ O
brik _ _ O
pastry, _ _ O
have _ _ O
an _ _ O
easy _ _ O
inevitability. _ _ O
Pasta _ _ O
is _ _ O
unlikely _ _ O
to _ _ O
become _ _ O
the _ _ O
thing _ _ O
Benno _ _ O
is _ _ O
known _ _ O
for. _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
stretches _ _ O
to _ _ O
Italy, _ _ O
nice _ _ O
things _ _ O
happen. _ _ O
Lobster _ _ O
fra _ _ O
diavolo, _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
bent _ _ O
shells _ _ O
called _ _ O
lumache, _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
tribute _ _ O
to _ _ O
an _ _ O
American _ _ O
pop _ _ O
hit _ _ O
made _ _ O
over, _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Thomas _ _ O
Keller _ _ O
tradition, _ _ O
with _ _ O
maximum _ _ O
clarity _ _ O
and _ _ O
precision. _ _ O
Spaghetti _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
grano _ _ O
arso, _ _ O
or _ _ O
burned-wheat _ _ O
flour, _ _ O
tasted _ _ O
pleasantly _ _ O
toasted _ _ O
rather _ _ O
than _ _ O
incinerated _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
soaked _ _ O
up _ _ O
the _ _ O
liquor _ _ O
of _ _ O
tiny _ _ O
hard-shell _ _ O
clams _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
soft _ _ O
mass _ _ O
of _ _ O
very _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
sea _ _ O
urchin _ _ O
roe. _ _ O
Technique _ _ O
never _ _ O
overplayed _ _ O
its _ _ O
hand _ _ O
in _ _ O
these _ _ O
dishes. _ _ O
The _ _ O
only _ _ O
time _ _ O
it _ _ O
came _ _ O
up _ _ O
short _ _ O
was _ _ O
when _ _ O
a _ _ O
drum _ _ O
of _ _ O
steelhead _ _ O
salmon _ _ O
poached _ _ O
in _ _ O
olive _ _ O
oil _ _ O
arrived _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
mushy _ _ O
and _ _ O
underdone. _ _ O
A _ _ O
week _ _ O
later, _ _ O
the _ _ O
fish _ _ O
was _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
more _ _ O
successfully. _ _ O
The _ _ O
scope _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Evelyn's _ _ O
dining _ _ O
operation _ _ O
is _ _ O
big _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
support _ _ O
a _ _ O
full-time _ _ O
baker _ _ O
(Lisa _ _ O
Kalemkiarian, _ _ O
responsible _ _ O
for _ _ O
Benno's _ _ O
needle-tipped _ _ O
mini-baguettes, _ _ O
among _ _ O
other _ _ O
items) _ _ O
and _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
chef _ _ O
(Lindsey _ _ O
Bittner, _ _ O
whose _ _ O
desserts _ _ O
include _ _ O
a _ _ O
rosemary _ _ O
flan _ _ O
with _ _ O
candied _ _ O
cranberries _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
ordered _ _ O
every _ _ O
time _ _ O
I _ _ O
went, _ _ O
so _ _ O
I _ _ O
could _ _ O
watch _ _ O
other _ _ O
people _ _ O
try _ _ O
it _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
time). _ _ O
You _ _ O
couldn't _ _ O
call _ _ O
the _ _ O
wine _ _ O
list _ _ O
dated, _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O
unwashed, _ _ O
uncombed _ _ O
natural _ _ O
types _ _ O
among _ _ O
other _ _ O
groomed, _ _ O
sedate _ _ O
numbers, _ _ O
and _ _ O
some _ _ O
fine _ _ O
values _ _ O
between _ _ O
$50 _ _ O
and _ _ O
$75 _ _ O
tiptoeing _ _ O
among _ _ O
the _ _ O
super-Tuscans _ _ O
and _ _ O
2005 _ _ O
Bordeaux. _ _ O
All _ _ O
this _ _ O
should _ _ O
persuade _ _ O
some _ _ O
skeptics _ _ O
to _ _ O
give _ _ O
Benno _ _ O
a _ _ O
try. _ _ O
The _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
greatest _ _ O
challenge _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
come _ _ O
from _ _ O
an _ _ O
era _ _ O
that's _ _ O
too _ _ O
old _ _ O
to _ _ O
seem _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
but _ _ O
too _ _ O
recent _ _ O
to _ _ O
feel _ _ O
nostalgic _ _ O
about. _ _ O
When _ _ O
pop _ _ O
music _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
age, _ _ O
we _ _ O
cringe. _ _ O
When _ _ O
buildings _ _ O
are _ _ O
that _ _ O
age, _ _ O
we _ _ O
knock _ _ O
them _ _ O
down _ _ O
before _ _ O
they _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
landmarked. _ _ O
But _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
one _ _ O
chef _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
what _ _ O
he _ _ O
believes _ _ O
is _ _ O
better _ _ O
than _ _ O

The _ _ O
fancy _ _ O
mall _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Time _ _ B-LOC
Warner _ _ I-LOC
Center _ _ I-LOC
known _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
Shops _ _ B-LOC
at _ _ I-LOC
Columbus _ _ I-LOC
Circle _ _ I-LOC
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
to _ _ O
answer _ _ O
for. _ _ O
Its _ _ O
opening, _ _ O
in _ _ O
2003, _ _ O
may _ _ O
have _ _ O
marked _ _ O
Manhattan's _ _ B-LOC
capitulation _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
retail _ _ O
landscape _ _ O
ruled _ _ O
by _ _ O
chains _ _ O
rather _ _ O
than _ _ O
independent, _ _ O
homegrown _ _ O
businesses. _ _ O
For _ _ O
diners, _ _ O
the _ _ O
mall _ _ O
is _ _ O
best _ _ O
known _ _ O
for _ _ O
its _ _ O
eating-and-drinking _ _ O
zone _ _ O
named, _ _ O
with _ _ O
matchless _ _ O
pretentiousness, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Restaurant _ _ O
Collection. _ _ O
This _ _ O
brought _ _ O
us _ _ O
Per _ _ B-EST
Se _ _ I-EST
and _ _ O
Masa _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
which _ _ O
overnight _ _ O
made _ _ O
the _ _ O
city's _ _ O
other _ _ O
high-end _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
seem _ _ O
as _ _ O
affordable _ _ O
as _ _ O
Veselka _ _ B-EST
. _ _ O
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
start _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
class _ _ O
of _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
where _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
priced _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
luxury _ _ O
good, _ _ O
with _ _ O
entry-level _ _ O
meals _ _ O
that _ _ O
today _ _ O
cost _ _ O
$300 _ _ O
or _ _ O
more. _ _ O
Much _ _ O
more, _ _ O
in _ _ O
Masa's _ _ B-EST
case. _ _ O
The _ _ O
purpose _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
exclusivity _ _ O
was _ _ O
to _ _ O
signal _ _ O
to _ _ O
people _ _ O
with _ _ O
money _ _ O
to _ _ O
spend _ _ O
that _ _ O
they _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
comfortable _ _ O
spending _ _ O
it _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Shops _ _ B-LOC
at _ _ I-LOC
Columbus _ _ I-LOC
Circle. _ _ I-LOC
For _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
reason, _ _ O
businesses _ _ O
that _ _ O
were _ _ O
too _ _ O
far _ _ O
down-market _ _ O
were _ _ O
not _ _ O
welcome _ _ O
as _ _ O
tenants. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
why _ _ O
there's _ _ O
a _ _ O
Whole _ _ B-EST
Foods _ _ I-EST
Market _ _ I-EST
but _ _ O
not _ _ O
a _ _ O
Family _ _ O
Dollar. _ _ O
So _ _ O
those _ _ O
of _ _ O
us _ _ O
who _ _ O
follow _ _ O
David _ _ O
Chang's _ _ O
mind _ _ O
along _ _ O
its _ _ O
switchbacks _ _ O
and _ _ O
cul-de-sacs _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
wonder _ _ O
if _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
being _ _ O
subversive _ _ O
when _ _ O
he _ _ O
decided _ _ O
to _ _ O
install _ _ O
Bang _ _ B-EST
Bar _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
essentially _ _ O
a _ _ O
shawarma _ _ B-DIET
stand, _ _ I-DIET
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
mall's _ _ O
third _ _ O
floor. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chang _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
close _ _ O
observer _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
ways _ _ O
society _ _ O
assigns _ _ O
high _ _ O
status _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
of _ _ O
some _ _ O
cultures _ _ O
and _ _ O
devalues _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
of _ _ O
others. _ _ O
One _ _ O
of _ _ O
his _ _ O
greatest _ _ O
hits _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
riff _ _ O
about _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
who _ _ O
complain _ _ O
about _ _ O
$17 _ _ O
bowls _ _ O
of _ _ O
ramen _ _ B-FOOD
while _ _ O
paying _ _ O
$30 _ _ O

might _ _ O
make _ _ O
more _ _ O

In _ _ O
the _ _ O
weeks _ _ O
after _ _ O
its _ _ O
opening, _ _ O
on _ _ O
Halloween, _ _ O
the _ _ O
lines _ _ O
were _ _ O
worthy _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Department _ _ O
of _ _ O
Motor _ _ O
Vehicles. _ _ O
Employees _ _ O
tried _ _ O
to _ _ O
appease _ _ O
the _ _ O
horde _ _ O
by _ _ O
handing _ _ O
out _ _ O
off-the-menu _ _ O
snacks, _ _ O
like _ _ O
rice _ _ B-DISH
porridge _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
fermented _ _ I-DISH
shiitakes, _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
asking _ _ O
whimsical _ _ O
survey _ _ O
questions. _ _ O
("Do _ _ O
you _ _ O
keep _ _ O
peanut _ _ B-FOOD
butter _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
fridge?") _ _ O
After _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chang _ _ O
opened _ _ O
a _ _ O
Momofuku _ _ B-EST
Noodle _ _ I-EST
Bar _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
space _ _ O
next _ _ O
door, _ _ O
Bang _ _ B-EST
Bar's _ _ I-EST
crowds _ _ O
grew _ _ O
somewhat _ _ O
more _ _ O
manageable, _ _ O
and _ _ O
when _ _ O
I _ _ O
showed _ _ O
up _ _ O
for _ _ O
breakfast _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
December, _ _ O
there _ _ O
was _ _ O
no _ _ O
line _ _ O
at _ _ O
all. _ _ O
Maybe _ _ O
Deutsche _ _ O
Bank _ _ O
employees _ _ O
will _ _ O
keep _ _ O
Bang _ _ B-EST
Bar's _ _ I-EST
early _ _ O
shift _ _ O
afloat, _ _ O
but _ _ O
right _ _ O
now _ _ O
its _ _ O
success _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
hinge _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
lunch _ _ O
rush. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
two _ _ O
rotisseries. _ _ O
After _ _ O
11 _ _ O
a.m., _ _ O
one _ _ O
spit _ _ O
is _ _ O
buried _ _ O
deep _ _ O
inside _ _ O
a _ _ O
missile _ _ O
of _ _ O
dark _ _ B-FOOD
chicken _ _ I-FOOD
marinated _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
yakitori-style _ _ B-FOOD
glaze. _ _ I-FOOD
The _ _ O
other _ _ O
is _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
center _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
red, _ _ O
dripping, _ _ O
gochujang-rubbed _ _ B-FOOD
tower _ _ I-FOOD
of _ _ I-FOOD
pork. _ _ I-FOOD
Ideally, _ _ O
whichever _ _ O
meat _ _ B-FOOD
you _ _ O
choose _ _ O
will _ _ O
have _ _ O
built _ _ O
up _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark _ _ O
outer _ _ O
bark _ _ O
that _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
lopped _ _ O
off _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
knife _ _ O
strokes _ _ O
and _ _ O
stacked _ _ O
on _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
disc _ _ O
of _ _ O
griddled _ _ B-FOOD
flatbread. _ _ I-FOOD
The _ _ O
bread, _ _ B-FOOD
thicker _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
tortilla _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
less _ _ O
oily _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
roti, _ _ B-FOOD
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
tight, _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
cigarette, _ _ O
then _ _ O
bent _ _ O
in _ _ O
half, _ _ O
with _ _ O
both _ _ O
open _ _ O
ends _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
top. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
called, _ _ O
in _ _ O
Bang _ _ B-EST
Bar _ _ I-EST
parlance, _ _ O
a _ _ O
U. _ _ B-DISH
The _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-FOOD
or _ _ O
pork _ _ B-FOOD
can _ _ O
also _ _ O
be _ _ O
piled _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
rice, _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
bread _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
really _ _ O
very _ _ O
good. _ _ O
A _ _ O
close _ _ O
relative _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O

Mr. _ _ O
Chang's _ _ O
crew _ _ O
originated _ _ O
at _ _ O
Majordomo _ _ B-EST
in _ _ O
Los _ _ B-LOC
Angeles, _ _ I-LOC
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
perceptibly _ _ O
tangy _ _ O
and _ _ O
salted, _ _ O
without _ _ O
being _ _ O
salty. _ _ O
A _ _ O
couple _ _ O
of _ _ O
condiments _ _ O
-- _ _ O
including _ _ O
habanero _ _ B-FOOD
salsa _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
brick-red _ _ O
Ssam _ _ B-FOOD
Sauce _ _ I-FOOD
used, _ _ O
in _ _ O
various _ _ O
iterations, _ _ O
to _ _ O
italicize _ _ O
Noodle _ _ B-EST
Bar's _ _ I-EST
pork _ _ B-FOOD
buns _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
hundred _ _ O
other _ _ O
creations _ _ O
in _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chang's _ _ O
Momofuku _ _ B-EST
restaurant _ _ O
group _ _ O
-- _ _ O
are _ _ O
kept _ _ O
out _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
counter _ _ O
alongside _ _ O
the _ _ O
moist _ _ O
towelettes. _ _ O
But _ _ O
they're _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
apply _ _ O
once _ _ O
a _ _ O
U _ _ B-DISH
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
rolled. _ _ O
What _ _ O
I _ _ O
did _ _ O
want _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
spoonful _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
of _ _ O
raw _ _ O
white _ _ B-FOOD
onions, _ _ I-FOOD
some _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
cucumber, _ _ B-FOOD
maybe _ _ O
parsley _ _ B-FOOD
or _ _ O
cilantro _ _ B-FOOD
-- _ _ O
the _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
simple _ _ O
salad _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
almost _ _ O
always _ _ O
lobbed _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
shawarma _ _ B-FOOD
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
doner _ _ B-FOOD
kebab. _ _ I-FOOD
Both _ _ O
the _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
pork _ _ B-FOOD
are _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
sweet, _ _ O
and _ _ O
could _ _ O
use _ _ O
a _ _ O
lift. _ _ O
The _ _ O
lunch _ _ O
menu _ _ O
also _ _ O
has _ _ O
two _ _ O
dips _ _ O
-- _ _ O
a _ _ O
darkly _ _ O
fascinating, _ _ O
spicy _ _ B-FOOD
eggplant _ _ I-FOOD
spread, _ _ I-FOOD
or _ _ O
whipped _ _ B-FOOD
chickpeas _ _ I-FOOD
whose _ _ O
sharp, _ _ O
pecorino-like _ _ B-FOOD
flavor _ _ O
betrays _ _ O
the _ _ O
presence _ _ O
of _ _ O
Hozon, _ _ B-FOOD
the _ _ O
fermented _ _ B-FOOD
chickpea _ _ I-FOOD
paste _ _ I-FOOD
invented _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
Momofuku _ _ B-EST
laboratory. _ _ O
They _ _ O
are _ _ O
alluring _ _ O
enough, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
real _ _ O
reason _ _ O
to _ _ O
order _ _ O
them _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
bread, _ _ B-FOOD
puffier _ _ O
and _ _ O
softer _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
that _ _ O
wraps _ _ O
the _ _ O
U. _ _ B-EST
A _ _ O
smaller _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
this, _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
five _ _ O
inches _ _ O
across, _ _ O
is _ _ O
folded _ _ O
in _ _ O
half _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
taco _ _ B-FOOD
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
a _ _ O
"mini," _ _ B-DISH
which _ _ O
replaces _ _ O
the _ _ O
U _ _ B-DISH
at _ _ O
breakfast. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
great _ _ O
shock _ _ O
that _ _ O
this _ _ O
bread _ _ B-FOOD
works _ _ O
nicely _ _ O
with _ _ O
smoked _ _ B-FOOD
salmon _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
scallion _ _ B-FOOD
cream _ _ I-FOOD
cheese _ _ I-FOOD
blended _ _ O
with _ _ O
just _ _ O
enough _ _ O
soy _ _ B-FOOD
sauce _ _ I-FOOD
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
it _ _ O
arguably _ _ O
Asian. _ _ B-CUISINE
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
flavorful _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
bagel _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
better _ _ O
at _ _ O
holding _ _ O
everything _ _ O
together. _ _ O
But _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
somewhat _ _ O
surprising _ _ O
how _ _ O
delicious _ _ O
a _ _ O
freshly _ _ O
griddled _ _ O
mini _ _ B-DISH
is _ _ O
with _ _ O
caper-scallion _ _ B-FOOD
cream _ _ I-FOOD
cheese, _ _ I-FOOD
salted _ _ B-FOOD
cucumber, _ _ I-FOOD
tomato _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
fresh _ _ B-FOOD
dill _ _ I-FOOD
inside. _ _ O
The _ _ O
whole _ _ O
thing _ _ O
tastes _ _ O
alive _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
way _ _ O
that _ _ O
a _ _ O
bagel _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
schmear _ _ O
of _ _ O
veggie _ _ B-FOOD
cream _ _ I-FOOD
cheese _ _ I-FOOD
never _ _ O
will. _ _ O
I've _ _ O
saved _ _ O
the _ _ O
breakfast _ _ B-DISH
mini _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
mortadella _ _ I-DISH
for _ _ O
last, _ _ O
although _ _ O
it's _ _ O
been _ _ O
the _ _ O
subject _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
rapt _ _ O
online _ _ O
attention. _ _ O
Building _ _ O

of _ _ O
mortadella _ _ B-FOOD
layered _ _ O
with _ _ O
lardo _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
roasting _ _ O
them _ _ O
on _ _ O
spits _ _ O
is _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
the _ _ O
sort _ _ O
of _ _ O
thing _ _ O
the _ _ O
Momofuku _ _ B-EST
group _ _ O
was _ _ O
put _ _ O
on _ _ O
this _ _ O
earth _ _ O
to _ _ O
do. _ _ O
I _ _ O
am _ _ O
glad _ _ O
this _ _ O
revolving _ _ O
meat _ _ O
torpedo _ _ O
exists. _ _ O
I _ _ O
respect _ _ O

cooks _ _ O
-- _ _ O
this _ _ O
collaborative _ _ O
effort _ _ O

no _ _ O

Mr. _ _ O

said _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O

-- _ _ O
for _ _ O
realizing _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
proper _ _ O
garnish _ _ O
for _ _ O
caramelized _ _ B-FOOD

is _ _ O
a _ _ O
slice _ _ O
of _ _ O
yellow _ _ B-FOOD
American _ _ I-FOOD

and _ _ O
hot _ _ B-FOOD

I _ _ O

to _ _ O
both _ _ O

And _ _ O
if _ _ O

were _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
habit _ _ O
of _ _ O
turning _ _ O
up _ _ O
at _ _ O
Columbus _ _ B-LOC
Circle _ _ I-LOC
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
hangover _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
mornings, _ _ O
I _ _ O
would _ _ O
probably _ _ O
become _ _ O
a _ _ O
regular _ _ O
consumer _ _ O
of _ _ O
mortadella _ _ B-DISH
minis _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
Ssam _ _ I-DISH
Sauce. _ _ I-DISH
With _ _ O
a _ _ O
clear _ _ O
head _ _ O
and _ _ O
stomach, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
the _ _ O
saltiness _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
too _ _ O
bracing. _ _ O
At _ _ O
either _ _ O
meal, _ _ O
Bang _ _ B-EST
Bar _ _ I-EST
offers _ _ O
a _ _ O
cinnamon _ _ B-DISH
roll _ _ I-DISH
modeled _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
kkwabaegi, _ _ B-DISH
the _ _ O
twisted _ _ O
Korean _ _ B-CUISINE
doughnut _ _ B-FOOD
stick. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
baked _ _ O
rather _ _ O
than _ _ O
fried, _ _ O
making _ _ O
it _ _ O
a _ _ O
rare _ _ O
example _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
Momofuku _ _ B-EST
dish _ _ O
that _ _ O
contains _ _ O
less _ _ O
fat _ _ B-FOOD
than _ _ O
its _ _ O
inspiration. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
fine _ _ O
pastry _ _ B-FOOD
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
with _ _ O
Bang _ _ B-EST
Bar's _ _ I-EST
Vietnamese _ _ B-DISH
coffee, _ _ I-DISH
even _ _ O
after _ _ O
you _ _ O
learn _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
cream _ _ B-FOOD

contains _ _ O
fermented _ _ B-FOOD
chickpeas. _ _ I-FOOD
By _ _ O
the _ _ O
way, _ _ O
bang, _ _ B-FOOD
or _ _ O
bbang _ _ B-FOOD

depending _ _ O
on _ _ O
how _ _ O
you _ _ O
like _ _ O
your _ _ O

means _ _ O
bread. _ _ B-FOOD
So _ _ O
this _ _ O

officially _ _ O
a _ _ O

how _ _ O

the _ _ O

is. _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
I _ _ O

of _ _ O

while _ _ O
some _ _ O

Hwaban _ _ B-EST
needs _ _ O

of _ _ O
them _ _ O
to _ _ O
keep _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O

"This _ _ O

who _ _ O
owns _ _ O
the _ _ O

with _ _ O
her _ _ O
husband, _ _ O
Key _ _ O

say _ _ O
on _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
her _ _ O
frequent _ _ O
circuits _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O

She _ _ O
said _ _ O
it _ _ O
one _ _ O

about _ _ O
the _ _ O

of _ _ O
chicken, _ _ B-FOOD
tofu _ _ B-FOOD

the _ _ O

a _ _ O

-- _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
warm _ _ O

transfixing _ _ O
soy-milk _ _ B-FOOD

Another _ _ O
time, _ _ O
she _ _ O
was _ _ O
talking _ _ O
about _ _ O
what _ _ O
she _ _ O
calls _ _ O
"snowy _ _ B-DISH
bibimbap," _ _ I-DISH
a _ _ O
gentle, _ _ O
agreeable _ _ O
wintertime _ _ O
variation _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
classic _ _ O
rice _ _ B-FOOD

The _ _ O

does _ _ O
very _ _ O

One _ _ O
of _ _ O

is _ _ O
a _ _ O

of _ _ O
king _ _ O

a _ _ O

surrounded _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
rich _ _ O
pine-nut _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
the _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O

Like _ _ O
the _ _ O
Manhattan _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
Atomix _ _ O
and _ _ O
Jungsik _ _ O
, _ _ O
Hwaban _ _ O
de-emphasizes _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweeter _ _ O
and _ _ O
spicier _ _ O
side _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
palate _ _ O
so _ _ O
other _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
can _ _ O
come _ _ O
through. _ _ O
Coins _ _ O
of _ _ O

sliced _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
block _ _ O
of _ _ O

in _ _ O
a _ _ O
clear, _ _ O
subtle _ _ O
dried-seafood _ _ O
broth. _ _ O
Soy-braised _ _ O
abalone _ _ O
is _ _ O
served _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
anchovy _ _ O
broth _ _ O
that _ _ O
is, _ _ O
if _ _ O
not _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
subtle, _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
soft-spoken. _ _ O
One _ _ O
of _ _ O
two _ _ O
pork _ _ O
belly _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
involves _ _ O
ssamjang, _ _ O
the _ _ O
potent _ _ O
soy-chile _ _ O
paste _ _ O
now _ _ O
sold _ _ O
in _ _ O
supermarkets _ _ O
throughout _ _ O
the _ _ O
land, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
does _ _ O
not. _ _ O
In _ _ O
that _ _ O
one, _ _ O
you _ _ O
eat _ _ O
a _ _ O
slice _ _ O
of _ _ O
simmered _ _ O
pork _ _ O
belly _ _ O
together _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
mushroom _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
square _ _ O
of _ _ O
cabbage _ _ O
kimchi. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
a _ _ O
sharp _ _ O
little _ _ O
kick _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
spicy _ _ O
fish _ _ O
stew _ _ O
known _ _ O
as _ _ O
maeun-tang, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
fair _ _ O
amount _ _ O
of _ _ O
chile _ _ O
paste _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
daktori-tang _ _ O
, _ _ O
a _ _ O
spin _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
classic _ _ O
braised _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
and _ _ O
vegetable _ _ O
dish, _ _ O
both _ _ O
of _ _ O
which _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Jang _ _ O
makes _ _ O
very _ _ O
well. _ _ O
But _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
the _ _ O
surprise _ _ O
of _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
ginger _ _ O
and _ _ O
carrots _ _ O
along _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
chiles _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
bright _ _ O
orange _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
for _ _ O
seared _ _ O
salmon. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O

Mr. _ _ O

a _ _ O
chiaroscuro _ _ O
lair _ _ O
for _ _ O
omakase _ _ O
sushi _ _ O
on _ _ O
West _ _ O
13th _ _ O

I _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
put _ _ O
off _ _ O
by _ _ O
how _ _ O
active _ _ O
the _ _ O
servers _ _ O
were _ _ O
there; _ _ O
just _ _ O
as _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
focusing _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
piece _ _ O
of _ _ O
fish _ _ O
in _ _ O
front _ _ O
of _ _ O
me, _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
would _ _ O
dart _ _ O
in _ _ O
at _ _ O
one _ _ O
elbow _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
to _ _ O
ask _ _ O
how _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
enjoying _ _ O
it _ _ O
all. _ _ O
The _ _ O
service _ _ O
style _ _ O
is _ _ O
similar _ _ O
at _ _ O
Hwaban, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
plays _ _ O
better _ _ O
there. _ _ O
A _ _ O
meal _ _ O
at _ _ O
Hwaban _ _ O
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
about _ _ O
three _ _ O
times _ _ O
less _ _ O
expensive, _ _ O
at _ _ O
$55 _ _ O
for _ _ O
an _ _ O
appetizer _ _ O
and _ _ O
two _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses. _ _ O
The _ _ O
mains _ _ O
are _ _ O
served _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
time, _ _ O
which _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Han _ _ O
says _ _ O
is _ _ O
her _ _ O
attempt _ _ O
to _ _ O
reproduce _ _ O
the _ _ O
abundance _ _ O
of _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
family _ _ O
tables _ _ O
like _ _ O
her _ _ O
mother's. _ _ O
Her _ _ O
mother _ _ O
also _ _ O
gets _ _ O
credit _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
two-sided _ _ O
fritters _ _ O
of _ _ O
minced _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
pressed _ _ O
against _ _ O
zucchini _ _ O
coins _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
short _ _ O
à _ _ O
la _ _ O
carte _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
They're _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
pair _ _ O
of _ _ O
fried _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
and _ _ O
little _ _ O
cubes _ _ O
of _ _ O
jelly _ _ O
that _ _ O
melt _ _ O
into _ _ O
dipping _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
on _ _ O
contact _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
warm _ _ O
fritters. _ _ O
The _ _ O
same _ _ O
soy _ _ O
jelly _ _ O
accompanies _ _ O
a _ _ O
kimchi-jeon _ _ O
that's _ _ O
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
browned _ _ O
mozzarella _ _ O
-- _ _ O
in _ _ O
other _ _ O
words, _ _ O
a _ _ O

Something _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
going _ _ O
wrong _ _ O
at _ _ O
Bluebird _ _ B-EST
London _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
the _ _ O
busily _ _ O
programmed _ _ O
10,500-square-foot _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O

in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Time _ _ B-LOC
Warner _ _ I-LOC
Center _ _ I-LOC
imported _ _ O
from _ _ O
England _ _ B-LOC
in _ _ O
September. _ _ O
Maybe _ _ O
the _ _ O
people _ _ O
in _ _ O
charge _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
taking _ _ O
management _ _ O
cues _ _ O
from _ _ O
Prime _ _ O
Minister _ _ O
Theresa _ _ O
May's _ _ O
government, _ _ O
which _ _ O
has _ _ O
approached _ _ O
its _ _ O
Brexit _ _ O
plan _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
class _ _ O
of _ _ O

out _ _ O

Or _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
the _ _ O
mess _ _ O
back _ _ O
home _ _ O
has _ _ O
just _ _ O
sapped _ _ O
the _ _ O

spirit. _ _ O
Whatever _ _ O
the _ _ O

what _ _ O
was _ _ O
meant _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
cheerful _ _ O
gift _ _ O
from _ _ O
London _ _ B-LOC
has _ _ O
turned _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
Bluebird _ _ B-EST
of _ _ O
Unhappiness. _ _ O
Sir _ _ O
Terence _ _ O

opened _ _ O
the _ _ O

1997 _ _ O

built _ _ O
on _ _ O
King's _ _ B-LOC
Road _ _ I-LOC
in _ _ O
Chelsea _ _ B-LOC
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
Bluebird _ _ O
Motor _ _ O
Company. _ _ O
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
his _ _ O
"gastrodomes," _ _ B-TYPE
those _ _ O
soaring _ _ O
complexes _ _ O
like _ _ O
Quaglino's _ _ B-EST

Bibendum _ _ B-EST
that _ _ O
embedded _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
within _ _ O
a _ _ O
busy _ _ O
hive _ _ O
of _ _ O
shops, _ _ O
cafes _ _ B-TYPE
and _ _ O

The _ _ O
gastrodomes' _ _ B-TYPE
designs _ _ O
were _ _ O
talked _ _ O
about _ _ O
more _ _ O
often _ _ O
and _ _ O
more _ _ O
enthusiastically _ _ O
than _ _ O
their _ _ O
menus, _ _ O
which _ _ O
aimed _ _ O
for _ _ O

familiarity. _ _ O
The _ _ O
current _ _ O

Bluebird _ _ B-EST
in _ _ O

changing _ _ O

it _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
at _ _ O
all _ _ O
clear _ _ O
why _ _ O
they _ _ O

which _ _ O
must _ _ O
be _ _ O
there _ _ O
to _ _ O
soak _ _ O
up _ _ O
any _ _ O
seasoning _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
accidentally _ _ O
attaches _ _ O
itself _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
fish. _ _ B-FOOD
At _ _ O
lunch _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
lobster _ _ B-DISH
Cobb _ _ I-DISH
salad _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ O
lettuce _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
round, _ _ O
red _ _ O
objects _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
probably _ _ O
supposed _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
tomatoes. _ _ B-FOOD
Because _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
English _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurant, _ _ O
you _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
curious _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
English _ _ B-CUISINE
food. _ _ O
Because _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
in _ _ O
Bluebird _ _ B-EST
London, _ _ I-EST
you _ _ O
will _ _ O
regret _ _ O
this. _ _ O
A _ _ O
prawn _ _ B-DISH

monkfish _ _ I-DISH
curry _ _ I-DISH
is _ _ O
presented _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
thali _ _ O
with _ _ O
mango _ _ B-FOOD
chutney, _ _ I-FOOD
basmati _ _ B-FOOD
rice _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
paratha, _ _ B-FOOD
which _ _ O
run _ _ O
the _ _ O
gamut _ _ O
from _ _ O
unnecessarily _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
to _ _ O
ridiculously _ _ O
sweet. _ _ O
The _ _ O
fish _ _ B-FOOD
half _ _ O
of _ _ O
fish _ _ B-DISH
and _ _ I-DISH
chips _ _ I-DISH
is _ _ O
golden _ _ O
and _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
ends _ _ O
but _ _ O
pale _ _ O
and _ _ O
soggy _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
middle. _ _ O
At _ _ O
least _ _ O
the _ _ O
minted _ _ B-FOOD
peas _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
come _ _ O
with _ _ O
it _ _ O
are _ _ O
crunchy. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
said _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
potato _ _ B-FOOD
chips _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
come _ _ O
with _ _ O
an _ _ O
order _ _ O
of _ _ O
beef _ _ B-DISH
tartare. _ _ I-DISH
They _ _ O
are _ _ O
pale, _ _ O
cobweb-colored, _ _ O
not _ _ O
fresh, _ _ O
and _ _ O
undercooked _ _ O
so _ _ O
they _ _ O
sag _ _ O
and _ _ O
fall _ _ O
apart _ _ O
beneath _ _ O
any _ _ O
amount _ _ O
of _ _ O
beef. _ _ B-FOOD
The _ _ O
tartare, _ _ B-FOOD
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
way, _ _ O
is _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
with _ _ O
ketchup, _ _ B-FOOD
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
as _ _ O
wrong _ _ O
as _ _ O
you _ _ O
might _ _ O
think. _ _ O
If _ _ O
something _ _ O
comes _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
pastry _ _ B-FOOD
crust, _ _ I-FOOD
exercise _ _ O
caution. _ _ O
On _ _ O

for _ _ O

is _ _ O
a _ _ O
dome _ _ O
of _ _ O
puff _ _ B-FOOD
pastry; _ _ I-FOOD
it _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
taste _ _ O
like _ _ O
butter _ _ B-FOOD
or _ _ O
salt, _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
cooked. _ _ O
The _ _ O

around _ _ O
a _ _ O

pork _ _ I-DISH

is _ _ O
on _ _ O
its _ _ O

The _ _ O

very _ _ O
thick _ _ O

encasing _ _ O
beef _ _ B-DISH
Wellington _ _ I-DISH
is _ _ O

only _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O

where _ _ O
it _ _ O
meets _ _ O
the _ _ O
tenderloin, _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
mass _ _ O
of _ _ O
wet, _ _ O
gluey _ _ O

This _ _ O
costs _ _ O
$95 _ _ O
and _ _ O
will _ _ O
serve _ _ O
two _ _ O
people, _ _ O
both _ _ O
of _ _ O
whom _ _ O
had _ _ O
better _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
taste _ _ O
of _ _ O
raw _ _ B-FOOD
flour. _ _ I-FOOD
All _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
doom _ _ O
and _ _ O
gloom _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
department, _ _ O
though. _ _ O
The _ _ O
pull-apart _ _ B-DISH
cheese _ _ I-DISH
straws _ _ I-DISH
are _ _ O
thick, _ _ O
puffy _ _ O
and _ _ O
warm, _ _ O
bronzed _ _ O
on _ _ O
top _ _ O
with _ _ O
baked _ _ O
Montgomery's _ _ B-FOOD
Cheddar. _ _ I-FOOD
Most _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweets _ _ O
are _ _ O
likable, _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
the _ _ O
cube _ _ O
of _ _ O
sticky _ _ B-DISH
toffee _ _ I-DISH
pudding _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
wedge _ _ O
of _ _ O
Bakewell _ _ B-DISH
tart _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
layer _ _ O
of _ _ O
orange _ _ B-FOOD
marmalade _ _ I-FOOD
between _ _ O
the _ _ O
frangipane _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
pastry _ _ B-FOOD
shell. _ _ I-FOOD
The _ _ O
only _ _ O
real _ _ O
hazard _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
barely _ _ O
congealed _ _ O
Pimm's _ _ B-DISH
jelly _ _ I-DISH
at _ _ O
which _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
has _ _ O
hurled _ _ O
fistfuls _ _ O
of _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
cucumbers _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
strawberries. _ _ B-FOOD
It's _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
stray _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
salad _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
might _ _ O
pick _ _ O
up _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
party _ _ O
before _ _ O
you _ _ O
realized _ _ O
that _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
had _ _ O
dumped _ _ O
the _ _ O
warm _ _ O
dregs _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
drink _ _ O
into _ _ O
it. _ _ O
The _ _ O
servers _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
eager _ _ O
to _ _ O
oblige, _ _ O
but _ _ O
gave _ _ O
the _ _ O
impression _ _ O
of _ _ O
struggling _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
face _ _ O
of _ _ O
unseen _ _ O
enemies. _ _ O
One _ _ O
night, _ _ O
asked _ _ O
"Still _ _ O
or _ _ O
sparkling?," _ _ O
I _ _ O
chose _ _ O
the _ _ O
sparkling _ _ B-FOOD
water. _ _ I-FOOD
My _ _ O
server _ _ O
began _ _ O
to _ _ O
walk _ _ O
away, _ _ O
then _ _ O
turned _ _ O
on _ _ O
his _ _ O
heel _ _ O
and _ _ O
said, _ _ O
"I'm _ _ O
sorry, _ _ O
we're _ _ O
all _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
sparkling." _ _ O
"That's _ _ O
fine," _ _ O
I _ _ O
said. _ _ O
"I'll _ _ O
just _ _ O
have _ _ O
the _ _ O
BrewDog _ _ B-DISH
I.P.A. _ _ I-DISH
instead." _ _ O
"I _ _ O
apologize," _ _ O
he _ _ O
said. _ _ O
"We _ _ O
don't _ _ O
have _ _ O
any _ _ O
draft _ _ O
beer." _ _ B-FOOD
After _ _ O
the _ _ O
main _ _ O
course _ _ O
was _ _ O
cleared, _ _ O
I _ _ O
asked _ _ O
him _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
Chocolate _ _ B-DISH
Bluebird. _ _ I-DISH
"That _ _ O
is _ _ O
our _ _ O
signature _ _ O
dessert," _ _ O
he _ _ O
said. _ _ O
I _ _ O
nodded. _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
read _ _ O
that _ _ O
this _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
chocolate _ _ B-FOOD
mousse _ _ I-FOOD
inside _ _ O
a _ _ O
blue-chocolate _ _ B-FOOD
shell _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
shape _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
vintage _ _ O
racecar _ _ O
once _ _ O
made _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
Bluebird _ _ O
Motor _ _ O
Company. _ _ O
"Unfortunately, _ _ O
we _ _ O
do _ _ O
not _ _ O
have _ _ O
it _ _ O
tonight," _ _ O
he _ _ O
said. _ _ O
His _ _ O
courtesy _ _ O
went _ _ O
a _ _ O
long _ _ O
way. _ _ O
Ultimately, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
I _ _ O
preferred _ _ O
the _ _ O
blunt _ _ O
approach _ _ O
that _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
bartenders _ _ O
took _ _ O
with _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
my _ _ O
guests. _ _ O
Looking _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
long _ _ O
list _ _ O
of _ _ O
old _ _ O
and _ _ O
new _ _ O
cocktails, _ _ B-FOOD
she _ _ O
asked _ _ O
the _ _ O
bartender _ _ O
which _ _ O
he _ _ O
would _ _ O
recommend. _ _ O
"If _ _ O
you _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
drink _ _ O
something _ _ O
that _ _ O
tastes _ _ O
good," _ _ O
he _ _ O
said, _ _ O
"I _ _ O
wouldn't _ _ O
order _ _ O
anything _ _ O
off _ _ O
our _ _ O
menu." _ _ O

Four _ _ B-EST

Restaurant _ _ I-EST
at _ _ O
all _ _ O
but _ _ O
just _ _ O
leaving _ _ O
it _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
slush _ _ O
pile, _ _ O
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
case _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
found _ _ O
in _ _ O
court _ _ O
records _ _ O
involving _ _ O
Julian _ _ O
Niccolini. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Niccolini _ _ O
has _ _ O
operated _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
with _ _ O
Alex _ _ O
von _ _ O
Bidder _ _ O
since _ _ O
the _ _ O
mid-1990s, _ _ O
first _ _ O
at _ _ O
its _ _ O
original _ _ O
home _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Seagram _ _ B-LOC
Building _ _ I-LOC
and _ _ O
now, _ _ O
after _ _ O
a _ _ O
two-year _ _ O
hiatus, _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
smaller _ _ O
berth _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
side _ _ O
of _ _ O
Park _ _ B-LOC
Avenue. _ _ I-LOC
Over _ _ O
that _ _ O
time, _ _ O
he _ _ O
has _ _ O
frequently _ _ O
been _ _ O
celebrated _ _ O
for _ _ O
his _ _ O
charm. _ _ O
Less _ _ O
frequently, _ _ O
he _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
a _ _ O
defendant _ _ O
in _ _ O
civil _ _ O
and _ _ O
criminal _ _ O
actions _ _ O
arising _ _ O
from _ _ O
things _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
accused _ _ O
of _ _ O
having _ _ O
done _ _ O
to _ _ O
women _ _ O
inside _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
In _ _ O
1991, _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
his _ _ O
waitresses _ _ O
sued _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Niccolini _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
Four _ _ O
Seasons _ _ O
, _ _ O
citing _ _ O
sexual _ _ O
harassment. _ _ O
She _ _ O
claimed _ _ O
that _ _ O
for _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
three _ _ O
years _ _ O
he _ _ O
had _ _ O
repeatedly _ _ O
rubbed _ _ O
up _ _ O
against _ _ O
her, _ _ O
told _ _ O
her _ _ O
in _ _ O
vulgar _ _ O
terms _ _ O
about _ _ O
his _ _ O
sexual _ _ O
urges _ _ O
and _ _ O
called _ _ O
her _ _ O
"slut," _ _ O
"lesbian" _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
things. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Niccolini _ _ O
denied _ _ O
the _ _ O
charges. _ _ O
In _ _ O
2014, _ _ O
a _ _ O
former _ _ O
assistant _ _ O
manager _ _ O
filed _ _ O
suit _ _ O
against _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Niccolini _ _ O
, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
von _ _ O
Bidder _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
Four _ _ O
Seasons, _ _ O
alleging _ _ O
discrimination. _ _ O
The _ _ O
ex-manager _ _ O
said _ _ O
that _ _ O
after _ _ O
she _ _ O
returned _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
maternity _ _ O
leave, _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
made _ _ O
it _ _ O
difficult _ _ O
for _ _ O
her _ _ O
to _ _ O
pump _ _ O
breast _ _ B-FOOD
milk _ _ I-FOOD
during _ _ O
work _ _ O
hours _ _ O
and, _ _ O
about _ _ O
three _ _ O
months _ _ O
later, _ _ O
fired _ _ O
her _ _ O
and _ _ O
replaced _ _ O
her _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
man. _ _ O
In _ _ O
a _ _ O
response _ _ O
filed _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
court, _ _ O
the _ _ O
defendants _ _ O
denied _ _ O
the _ _ O
allegations. _ _ O
Both _ _ O
suits _ _ O
were _ _ O
settled _ _ O
under _ _ O
terms _ _ O
that _ _ O
have _ _ O
not _ _ O
been _ _ O
divulged. _ _ O
In _ _ O
2015, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Niccolini _ _ O
was _ _ O
arrested _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
felony _ _ O
charge _ _ O
of _ _ O
sexual _ _ O
abuse. _ _ O
According _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
prosecutor, _ _ O
he _ _ O
had _ _ O
attacked _ _ O
a _ _ O
woman _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
Four _ _ B-EST
Seasons _ _ I-EST
bar _ _ I-EST
"with _ _ O
such _ _ O
force _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
ripped _ _ O
her _ _ O
bra _ _ O
open _ _ O
and _ _ O
caused _ _ O
significant _ _ O
scratch _ _ O
marks _ _ O
on _ _ O
her _ _ O
back _ _ O
and _ _ O
bruising _ _ O
on _ _ O
her _ _ O
hip." _ _ O
After _ _ O
pleading _ _ O
guilty _ _ O
the _ _ O
following _ _ O
year _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
reduced _ _ O
charge _ _ O
of _ _ O
misdemeanor _ _ O
assault, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Niccolini _ _ O
was _ _ O
given _ _ O
a _ _ O
"conditional _ _ O
discharge," _ _ O
avoiding _ _ O
jail. _ _ O
I _ _ O
know _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
will _ _ O
never _ _ O
eat _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
Four _ _ B-EST
Seasons _ _ I-EST
because _ _ O
they _ _ O
don't _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
give _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Niccolini _ _ O
their _ _ O
money. _ _ O
I _ _ O
understand _ _ O
this. _ _ O
I _ _ O
also _ _ O
know _ _ O
people _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
media _ _ O
who _ _ O
think _ _ O
the _ _ O
Four _ _ B-EST
Seasons _ _ I-EST
should _ _ O
not _ _ O
get _ _ O
any _ _ O
coverage _ _ O
as _ _ O
long _ _ O
as _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Niccolini _ _ O
owns _ _ O
a _ _ O
piece _ _ O
of _ _ O
it. _ _ O
I _ _ O
understand _ _ O
this, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it's _ _ O
not _ _ O
my _ _ O
view. _ _ O
[Julian _ _ O
Niccolini _ _ O
has _ _ O
since _ _ O
been _ _ O
forced _ _ O
to _ _ O
resign _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant.] _ _ O
Their _ _ O
stance _ _ O
rests, _ _ O
I _ _ O
think, _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
idea _ _ O
that _ _ O
writing _ _ O
about _ _ O
powerful _ _ O
men _ _ O
who _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
accused _ _ O
of _ _ O
abusing _ _ O
women _ _ O
amounts _ _ O
to _ _ O
condoning _ _ O
the _ _ O
abuse _ _ O
and _ _ O
helping _ _ O
the _ _ O
abusers _ _ O
stay _ _ O
in _ _ O
power. _ _ O
While _ _ O
it's _ _ O
true _ _ O
that _ _ O
media _ _ O
attention _ _ O
is _ _ O
often _ _ O
like _ _ O
oxygen _ _ O
to _ _ O
restaurants, _ _ O
critics _ _ O
have _ _ O
the _ _ O
power _ _ O
to _ _ O
tell _ _ O
a _ _ O
story _ _ O
other _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
is _ _ O
pushing. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
when _ _ O
we're _ _ O
not _ _ O
writing _ _ O
a _ _ O
pan, _ _ O
a _ _ O
fair _ _ O
assessment _ _ O
often _ _ O
requires _ _ O
weaving _ _ O
shining _ _ O
threads _ _ O
with _ _ O
ugly _ _ O
ones. _ _ O
The _ _ O
ugliest _ _ O
threads _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
Four _ _ B-EST
Seasons _ _ I-EST
happen _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
ugly _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
many _ _ O
people _ _ O
stay _ _ O
away. _ _ O
But _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
beauty _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
fabric, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Four _ _ B-EST
Seasons _ _ I-EST
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
a _ _ O
significant _ _ O
force _ _ O
in _ _ O
dining: _ _ O
a _ _ O
pioneer _ _ O
in _ _ O
championing _ _ O
American _ _ B-CUISINE
ingredients _ _ O
and _ _ O
wine; _ _ B-FOOD
an _ _ O
innovator _ _ O
in _ _ O
bringing _ _ O
contemporary _ _ O
design _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
world; _ _ O
a _ _ O
cultivator _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
eclectic _ _ O
scene _ _ O
that _ _ O
treated _ _ O
political _ _ O
power, _ _ O
financial _ _ O
success _ _ O
and _ _ O
creative _ _ O
talent _ _ O
as _ _ O
coequal _ _ O
branches _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
high _ _ O
society _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
peculiar _ _ O
to _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York. _ _ I-LOC
Most _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
happened _ _ O
some _ _ O
time _ _ O
ago. _ _ O
In _ _ O
its _ _ O
last _ _ O
years _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Seagram _ _ B-LOC
Building, _ _ I-LOC
the _ _ O
Four _ _ B-EST
Seasons _ _ I-EST
had _ _ O
become _ _ O
a _ _ O
shabby _ _ O
but _ _ O
lovely _ _ O
museum _ _ O
of _ _ O
midcentury _ _ O
architecture _ _ O
and _ _ O
design, _ _ O
with _ _ O
martinis _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
mind _ _ O
overpaying _ _ O
for _ _ O
and _ _ O
food _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
did. _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
curious _ _ O
about _ _ O
its _ _ O
new _ _ O
incarnation, _ _ O
which _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
August, _ _ O
and _ _ O
curiosity _ _ O
is _ _ O
as _ _ O
good _ _ O
a _ _ O
reason _ _ O
as _ _ O
any _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
critic _ _ O
to _ _ O
swing _ _ O
into _ _ O
action. _ _ O
If _ _ O
I _ _ O
were _ _ O
writing _ _ O
the _ _ O
next _ _ O
chapter _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
long _ _ O
history, _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
mention _ _ O
how _ _ O
gracefully _ _ O
Diego _ _ O
Garcia _ _ O
has _ _ O
grown _ _ O
into _ _ O
his _ _ O
new _ _ O
job _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
chef. _ _ O
I _ _ O
enjoyed _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Garcia's _ _ O
fish _ _ B-FOOD
cookery _ _ O
at _ _ O
his _ _ O
last _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
a _ _ O
small, _ _ O
bare-bones _ _ O
place _ _ O
in _ _ O
Hell's _ _ B-LOC
Kitchen _ _ I-LOC
called _ _ O
Gloria _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
but _ _ O
he _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
limited _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen's _ _ O
size. _ _ O
He _ _ O
works _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
grander _ _ O
scale _ _ O
now, _ _ O
with _ _ O
more _ _ O
expensive _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
and _ _ O
more _ _ O
delicate _ _ O
treatments _ _ O
that _ _ O
still _ _ O
betray _ _ O
his _ _ O
creative _ _ O
streak. _ _ O
He _ _ O
roasts _ _ O
duck _ _ B-FOOD
because _ _ O
the _ _ O
Four _ _ B-EST
Seasons _ _ I-EST
is _ _ O
famous _ _ O
for _ _ O
it, _ _ O
and _ _ O
makes _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
pasta _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
risotto _ _ B-DISH
because _ _ O
the _ _ O
captains _ _ O
in _ _ O
their _ _ O
black _ _ O
jackets _ _ O
need _ _ O
some _ _ O
place _ _ O
to _ _ O
shave _ _ O
all _ _ O
those _ _ O
white _ _ B-FOOD
truffles. _ _ I-FOOD
For _ _ O
all _ _ O
intents _ _ O
and _ _ O
purposes, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
he _ _ O
has _ _ O
turned _ _ O
the _ _ O
Four _ _ B-EST
Seasons _ _ I-EST
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
seafood _ _ B-TYPE
restaurant, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
very _ _ O
good _ _ O
one. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
not _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
believe _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
once _ _ O
a _ _ O
sous-chef _ _ O
at _ _ O
Le _ _ B-EST
Bernardin _ _ I-EST
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
taste, _ _ O
say, _ _ O
the _ _ O
raw _ _ B-FOOD
scallop _ _ I-FOOD
slivers _ _ O
in _ _ O
citrus _ _ B-FOOD
juices, _ _ I-FOOD
elegantly _ _ O
equipped _ _ O
with _ _ O
tart _ _ O
apple _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
caviar, _ _ B-FOOD
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
intensely _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
chowder _ _ B-DISH
of _ _ O
tiny, _ _ O
just-cooked _ _ O
clams _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
New _ _ B-CUISINE
England-style _ _ I-CUISINE
cream _ _ B-FOOD
broth _ _ I-FOOD
that's _ _ O
pale _ _ O
yellow _ _ O
with _ _ O
butterfat. _ _ B-FOOD
He _ _ O
knows _ _ O
when _ _ O
to _ _ O
show _ _ O
restraint _ _ O
and _ _ O
when _ _ O
to _ _ O
go _ _ O
all _ _ O
in, _ _ O
taking _ _ O
sea-urchin _ _ B-DISH
ravioli _ _ I-DISH
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
already _ _ O
head-spinningly _ _ O
rich _ _ O
and _ _ O
draping _ _ O
lobes _ _ O
of _ _ O
sea _ _ B-FOOD
urchin _ _ I-FOOD
over _ _ O
them. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
is _ _ O
boring _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
right _ _ O
way. _ _ O
I _ _ O
don't _ _ O
want _ _ O
surprises _ _ O
in _ _ O
Dover _ _ B-DISH
sole _ _ I-DISH
à _ _ I-DISH
la _ _ I-DISH
meunière, _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
I _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
get _ _ O
any. _ _ O
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
flawless. _ _ O
The _ _ O
duck _ _ B-FOOD
will _ _ O
surprise _ _ O
only _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
don't _ _ O
know _ _ O
that _ _ O
duck _ _ B-FOOD
meat _ _ I-FOOD
cooked _ _ O
to _ _ O
well-done _ _ O
bastes _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
own _ _ O
fat _ _ O
until _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
almost _ _ O
a _ _ O
warm _ _ O
confit. _ _ B-FOOD
Other _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
were _ _ O
boring _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
usual _ _ O
sense. _ _ O
The _ _ O
mustard _ _ B-FOOD
sauce _ _ I-FOOD
poured _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
golden _ _ O
crab _ _ B-DISH
cake _ _ I-DISH
tasted _ _ O
like _ _ O
cream _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
shown _ _ O
a _ _ O
picture _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
mustard _ _ O
jar. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chapter _ _ O
would _ _ O
also _ _ O
depict _ _ O
the _ _ O
return _ _ O
of _ _ O
Bill _ _ O
Yosses. _ _ O
Anybody _ _ O
who _ _ O
ate _ _ O
his _ _ O
desserts _ _ O
before _ _ O
he _ _ O
disappeared _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
White _ _ O
House _ _ O
won't _ _ O
be _ _ O
surprised _ _ O
by _ _ O
how _ _ O
good _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
here. _ _ O
They _ _ O
do _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
slight _ _ O
Rip _ _ O
Van _ _ O
Winkle _ _ O
quality, _ _ O
suggesting _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Yosses _ _ O
allowed _ _ O
several _ _ O
new _ _ O
waves _ _ O
in _ _ O
pastry _ _ B-FOOD
to _ _ O
pass _ _ O
him _ _ O
by, _ _ O
but _ _ O
that's _ _ O
no _ _ O
criticism. _ _ O
He _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
better _ _ O
baba _ _ B-DISH
au _ _ I-DISH
rhum _ _ I-DISH
than _ _ O
almost _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
in _ _ O
town, _ _ O
his _ _ O
chocolate _ _ B-DISH
tart _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
a _ _ I-DISH
salted _ _ I-DISH
stripe _ _ I-DISH
of _ _ I-DISH
caramel _ _ I-DISH
is _ _ O
both _ _ O
powerful _ _ O
and _ _ O
precise, _ _ O
and _ _ O
his _ _ O
hazelnut _ _ B-DISH
financier _ _ I-DISH
balanced _ _ O
over _ _ O
roasted _ _ B-FOOD
pears _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
delicious _ _ O
than _ _ O
almost _ _ O
any _ _ O
almond _ _ B-DISH
financier _ _ I-DISH
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
find. _ _ O
He _ _ O
has _ _ O
even _ _ O
improved _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
signature, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Kate _ _ O
Pierson _ _ O
beehive _ _ O
of _ _ O
cotton _ _ B-DISH
candy _ _ I-DISH
that _ _ O
sails _ _ O
out _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
tables _ _ O
of _ _ O
valued _ _ O
guests. _ _ O
(Apparently _ _ O
I've _ _ O
joined _ _ O
that _ _ O
club.) _ _ O
This _ _ O
being _ _ O
the _ _ O
Four _ _ B-EST
Seasons, _ _ I-EST
the _ _ O
history _ _ O
would _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
mention _ _ O
the _ _ O
new _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
interior. _ _ O
It _ _ O
reminded _ _ O
me _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
old _ _ O
Philip _ _ O
Johnson _ _ O
dining _ _ O
rooms _ _ O
without _ _ O
making _ _ O
me _ _ O
sad _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
here _ _ O
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
there, _ _ O
a _ _ O
trick _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
thought _ _ O
was _ _ O
impossible. _ _ O
The _ _ O
bronze _ _ O
bead _ _ O
curtains _ _ O
have _ _ O
transformed _ _ O
into _ _ O
strings _ _ O
of _ _ O
gilded _ _ O
glass _ _ O
baubles; _ _ O
the _ _ O
flatware _ _ O
and _ _ O
glasses _ _ O
pay _ _ O
homage _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
vintage _ _ O
designs _ _ O
used _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
original _ _ O
restaurant; _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
bar _ _ O
is _ _ O
once _ _ O
again _ _ O
a _ _ O
four-sided _ _ O
island _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
middle _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
lounge. _ _ O
For _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
time _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
eat _ _ O
a _ _ O
real _ _ O
meal _ _ O
there, _ _ O
while _ _ O
you _ _ O
watch _ _ O
the _ _ O
Grand _ _ O
Central-bound _ _ O
commuters _ _ O
outside _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
cotton _ _ O
candy-bound _ _ O
regulars _ _ O
inside, _ _ O
generally _ _ O
a _ _ O
mature _ _ O
group _ _ O
in _ _ O
tightly _ _ O
knotted _ _ O
ties _ _ O
or _ _ O
heels _ _ O
that _ _ O
echo _ _ O
down _ _ O
the _ _ O
corridor _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
ticking _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
grandfather _ _ O
clock. _ _ O
All _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
generous _ _ O
budget _ _ O
(the _ _ O
prices _ _ O
are _ _ O
as _ _ O
exclusionary _ _ O
as _ _ O
ever) _ _ O
could _ _ O
make _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
hours _ _ O
of _ _ O
celebratory _ _ O
sightseeing _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
kind _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
quickly _ _ O
disappearing _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
city. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Four _ _ B-DISH
Seasons _ _ I-DISH
offers _ _ O
an _ _ O
escape _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
outside _ _ O
world. _ _ O
Escaping _ _ O
from _ _ O
what's _ _ O
inside, _ _ O
however, _ _ O
takes _ _ O
a _ _ O
mental _ _ O
effort _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
beyond _ _ O
me _ _ O
and _ _ O
will _ _ O
probably _ _ O
be _ _ O
beyond _ _ O
many _ _ O
others _ _ O
as _ _ O
well, _ _ O
whether _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Niccolini _ _ O
is _ _ O
in _ _ O
sight _ _ O
or _ _ O
not. _ _ O
During _ _ O
my _ _ O
three _ _ O
meals, _ _ O
I _ _ O
never _ _ O
saw _ _ O
him. _ _ O
Restaurants, _ _ O
even _ _ O
grand _ _ O
ones _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
Four _ _ B-DISH
Seasons, _ _ I-DISH
are _ _ O
intimate _ _ O
places; _ _ O
eating _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
act _ _ O
that _ _ O
requires _ _ O
trust _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
sense _ _ O
of _ _ O
safety. _ _ O
We _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
up _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
feeling _ _ O
restored _ _ O
on _ _ O
all _ _ O
fronts _ _ O
except _ _ O
the _ _ O
financial _ _ O
one. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Niccolini's _ _ O
actions _ _ O
have _ _ O
done _ _ O
serious _ _ O
damage _ _ O
to _ _ O
his _ _ O
power _ _ O
to _ _ O
provide _ _ O
that _ _ O
feeling, _ _ O
even _ _ O
as _ _ O
he _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
von _ _ O
Bidder _ _ O
have _ _ O
made _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
better _ _ O
than _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
in _ _ O
years. _ _ O
This _ _ O
review _ _ O
will _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
tied _ _ O
up _ _ O

Alex _ _ O
Raij _ _ O
and _ _ O
Eder _ _ O
Montero _ _ O
met _ _ O
while _ _ O
working _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
sprawling, _ _ O
impersonal, _ _ O
gloomy _ _ O
modern-Spanish _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
lasted _ _ O
about _ _ O
two _ _ O
years. _ _ O
They _ _ O
went _ _ O
on _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
married _ _ O
and, _ _ O
as _ _ O
joint _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
and _ _ O
owners, _ _ O
opened _ _ O
a _ _ O
string _ _ O
of _ _ O
compact, _ _ O
intimate, _ _ O
slinky _ _ O
modern-Spanish _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurants _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
still _ _ O
in _ _ O
business. _ _ O
Their _ _ O
one _ _ O
misfire _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
small, _ _ O
intimate _ _ O
non-Spanish _ _ O
coffee _ _ B-TYPE
shop _ _ I-TYPE
in _ _ O
Cobble _ _ B-LOC
Hill, _ _ I-LOC
Brooklyn. _ _ I-LOC
After _ _ O
dusting _ _ O
themselves _ _ O
off, _ _ O
they _ _ O
replaced _ _ O
the _ _ O
cafe _ _ O
tables _ _ O
with _ _ O
taller _ _ O
and _ _ O
longer _ _ O
ones, _ _ O
traded _ _ O
the _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
cases _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
bar, _ _ O
installed _ _ O
a _ _ O
stripe _ _ O
of _ _ O
backlighted _ _ O
glass _ _ O
blocks _ _ O
that _ _ O
cast _ _ O
a _ _ O
subaqueous _ _ O
glow _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
room, _ _ O
and _ _ O
in _ _ O
September _ _ O
reopened _ _ O
as _ _ O
Saint _ _ B-EST
Julivert _ _ I-EST
Fisherie _ _ I-EST
. _ _ O
And _ _ O
what _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
fisherie, _ _ B-TYPE
you _ _ O
ask, _ _ O
having _ _ O
quickly _ _ O
consulted _ _ O
your _ _ O
French, _ _ O
Spanish _ _ O
and _ _ O
English _ _ O
dictionaries _ _ O
and _ _ O
found _ _ O
no _ _ O
such _ _ O
word? _ _ O
Saint _ _ B-EST
Julivert _ _ I-EST
is _ _ O
my _ _ O
first, _ _ O
but _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
anything _ _ O
to _ _ O
go _ _ O
by, _ _ O
then _ _ O
a _ _ O
fisherie _ _ B-TYPE
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
seafood _ _ B-TYPE
establishment _ _ I-TYPE
that _ _ O
aspires _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
raw _ _ B-TYPE
bar _ _ I-TYPE
but _ _ O
does _ _ O
not _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
mistaken _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
full-bore _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
Wines _ _ B-FOOD
come _ _ O
mostly _ _ O
from _ _ O
coastal _ _ O
regions _ _ O
(and _ _ O
are _ _ O
organized _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
nearest _ _ O
body _ _ O
of _ _ O
salt _ _ O
water). _ _ O
Small _ _ O
plates _ _ O
abound. _ _ O
And _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
guessed _ _ O
that _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
something _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
tapas _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Raij _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Montero _ _ O
explore _ _ O
at _ _ O
El _ _ B-EST
Quinto _ _ I-EST
Pino _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
Txikito _ _ B-EST
and _ _ O
La _ _ B-EST
Vara _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
but _ _ O
without _ _ O
the _ _ O
running _ _ O
Spanish _ _ B-CUISINE
theme, _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
far _ _ O
off. _ _ O
Not _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
entirely _ _ O
un-Spanish. _ _ O
The _ _ O
octopus _ _ B-DISH
carpaccio _ _ I-DISH
from _ _ O
Txikito _ _ B-EST
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
special _ _ O
guest _ _ O
appearance _ _ O
at _ _ O
Saint _ _ B-EST
Julivert _ _ I-EST
Fisherie, _ _ I-EST
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
the _ _ O
Fresh _ _ O
Prince _ _ O
once _ _ O
turned _ _ O
up _ _ O
on _ _ O
an _ _ O
episode _ _ O
of _ _ O
"Blossom." _ _ O
Under _ _ O
marjoram _ _ B-FOOD
leaves _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
pinprick _ _ O
grains _ _ O
of _ _ O
Espelette _ _ B-FOOD
pepper, _ _ I-FOOD
the _ _ O
carpaccio _ _ B-DISH
is _ _ O
as _ _ O
good _ _ O
as _ _ O
you _ _ O
remember; _ _ O
the _ _ O
warm _ _ O
plate _ _ O
halfway _ _ O
melts _ _ O
the _ _ O
fattier _ _ O
bits _ _ O
of _ _ O
octopus _ _ B-FOOD
into _ _ O
delicious _ _ O
goo. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
another _ _ O
cameo: _ _ O
El _ _ B-EST
Quinto _ _ I-EST
Pino's _ _ I-EST
very _ _ O
fine _ _ O
combination _ _ O
of _ _ O
pink-fleshed _ _ B-DISH
anchovies _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
cold _ _ I-DISH
vanilla _ _ I-DISH
butter. _ _ I-DISH
The _ _ O
butter _ _ B-FOOD
soothes _ _ O
the _ _ O
anchovies _ _ B-FOOD
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
the _ _ O
vermouth _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
martini _ _ B-DISH
helps _ _ O
the _ _ O
gin _ _ B-FOOD
settle _ _ O
down. _ _ O
(On _ _ O
a _ _ O
related _ _ O
topic, _ _ O
the _ _ O
short _ _ O
cocktail _ _ O
list _ _ O
includes _ _ O
a _ _ O
deceptively _ _ O
soft-spoken _ _ O
number _ _ O
called _ _ O
the _ _ O
Kanpai _ _ B-DISH
Martini. _ _ I-DISH
It's _ _ O
a _ _ O
variation _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
Vesper, _ _ B-DISH
which _ _ O
itself _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
amended _ _ O
martini _ _ B-DISH
that _ _ O
Ian _ _ O
Fleming _ _ O
had _ _ O
James _ _ O
Bond _ _ O
order _ _ O
in _ _ O
"Casino _ _ O
Royale.") _ _ O
At _ _ O
times _ _ O
Saint _ _ B-EST
Julivert _ _ I-EST
reminds _ _ O
me _ _ O
of _ _ O
Cal _ _ B-EST
Pep _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
in _ _ O
Barcelona, _ _ B-LOC
Spain, _ _ I-LOC
whose _ _ O
plain, _ _ O
cramped _ _ O
counter _ _ O
looks _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
place _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
world _ _ O
where _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
an _ _ O
epiphany _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
taste _ _ O
buds, _ _ O
right _ _ O
up _ _ O
until _ _ O
the _ _ O
moment _ _ O
the _ _ O
txipirones _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
thumbtack-size _ _ O
clams _ _ B-FOOD
knock _ _ O
you _ _ O
off _ _ O
your _ _ O
barstool. _ _ O
Like _ _ O
Cal _ _ B-EST
Pep, _ _ I-EST
and _ _ O
unlike _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
every _ _ O
other _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
restaurant, _ _ O
Saint _ _ B-EST
Julivert _ _ I-EST
serves _ _ O
gooseneck _ _ B-DISH
barnacles _ _ I-DISH
when _ _ O
they're _ _ O
available, _ _ O
boiling _ _ O
them _ _ O
with _ _ O
bay _ _ B-FOOD
leaves _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
salt _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
mounding _ _ O
them _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
cloth _ _ O
napkin _ _ O
before _ _ O
they _ _ O
cool _ _ O
so _ _ O
that _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
twist _ _ O
the _ _ O
wrinkled _ _ O
sheath _ _ O
of _ _ O
skin _ _ O
away _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweet, _ _ O
edible _ _ O
meat _ _ B-FOOD
inside _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
good _ _ O
chance _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
vicinity _ _ O
will _ _ O
get _ _ O
hit _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
squirt _ _ O
of _ _ O
hot _ _ O
barnacle _ _ B-FOOD
juice. _ _ I-FOOD
Mostly, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
any _ _ O
Spanish-ness _ _ B-CUISINE
in _ _ O
Saint _ _ B-EST
Julivert _ _ I-EST
has _ _ O
more _ _ O
to _ _ O
do _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O
spirit _ _ O
than _ _ O
its _ _ O
recipes, _ _ O
which _ _ O
come _ _ O
from _ _ O
all _ _ O
over: _ _ O
the _ _ O
deep-fried _ _ O
Puerto _ _ B-CUISINE
Rican _ _ I-CUISINE
cylinders _ _ O
of _ _ O
cornmeal _ _ B-FOOD
known _ _ O
as _ _ O
sorrullitos; _ _ B-DISH
a _ _ O
kanpachi _ _ O
collar _ _ O
whose _ _ O
juicy _ _ O
meat _ _ O
is _ _ O
shockingly _ _ O
white _ _ O
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
black _ _ O
rub _ _ O
of _ _ O
jerk _ _ O
spices; _ _ O
tender _ _ O
slices _ _ O
of _ _ O
warm _ _ O
beef _ _ O
tenderloin _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
fist-size _ _ O
roll, _ _ O
known _ _ O
in _ _ O
Portugal _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
prego _ _ O
sandwich. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
the _ _ O
crispy _ _ O
tuna _ _ O
bake, _ _ O
a _ _ O
peculiarly _ _ O
satisfying _ _ O
hybrid _ _ O
that _ _ O
crosses _ _ O
a _ _ O
tuna _ _ O
noodle _ _ O
casserole _ _ O
by _ _ O
way _ _ O
of _ _ O
India _ _ O
with _ _ O
fideuà, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Spanish _ _ O
dish _ _ O
that _ _ O
treats _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
rice _ _ O
in _ _ O
paella. _ _ O
The _ _ O
noodles, _ _ O
short _ _ O
ridged _ _ O
tubes, _ _ O
are _ _ O
toasted _ _ O
and _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
with _ _ O
oil-cured _ _ O
tuna _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
tomato _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
with _ _ O
turmeric _ _ O
and _ _ O
curry _ _ O
leaves. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
fearless, _ _ O
not _ _ O
to _ _ O
mention _ _ O
filling, _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
menu _ _ O
that _ _ O
could _ _ O
use _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
more _ _ O
of _ _ O
both _ _ O
qualities. _ _ O
Although _ _ O
Saint _ _ O
Julivert _ _ O
works _ _ O
with _ _ O
exceptional _ _ O
seafood, _ _ O
and _ _ O
treats _ _ O
it _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
care _ _ O
that _ _ O
fans _ _ O
of _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Raij _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Montero _ _ O
have _ _ O
come _ _ O
to _ _ O
expect, _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
plays _ _ O
it _ _ O
safe _ _ O
more _ _ O
often _ _ O
than _ _ O
it _ _ O
should. _ _ O
Like _ _ O
all _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
couple's _ _ O
restaurants, _ _ O
Saint _ _ O
Julivert _ _ O
toggles _ _ O
between _ _ O
innovation _ _ O
and _ _ O
tradition. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
places _ _ O
explore _ _ O
Spanish _ _ O
cuisine, _ _ O
so _ _ O
when _ _ O
they _ _ O
toss _ _ O
off _ _ O
a _ _ O
straight-ahead _ _ O
classic _ _ O
like _ _ O
patatas _ _ O
bravas, _ _ O
there's _ _ O
a _ _ O
reason. _ _ O
When _ _ O
Saint _ _ O
Julivert _ _ O
serves _ _ O
fluke _ _ O
ceviche _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
crab _ _ O
and _ _ O
avocado _ _ O
salad _ _ O
dressed _ _ O
with _ _ O
yuzu _ _ O
juice _ _ O
and _ _ O
trout _ _ O
roe, _ _ O
it _ _ O
can _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
grasping _ _ O
at _ _ O
ideas _ _ O
that _ _ O
other _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
are _ _ O
already _ _ O
doing _ _ O
-- _ _ O
even _ _ O
when _ _ O
Saint _ _ O
Julivert _ _ O
does _ _ O
them _ _ O
better. _ _ O
The _ _ O
sautéed _ _ O
skate _ _ O
splashed _ _ O
with _ _ O
Manzanilla _ _ O
could _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
fresher _ _ O
or _ _ O
more _ _ O
skillfully _ _ O
browned, _ _ O
but _ _ O
do _ _ O
the _ _ O
garlic _ _ O
chips _ _ O
and _ _ O
sliced _ _ O
dried _ _ O
chiles _ _ O
on _ _ O
top _ _ O
make _ _ O
this _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
well-known _ _ O
standard _ _ O
one _ _ O
I'll _ _ O
remember _ _ O
a _ _ O
month _ _ O
from _ _ O
now? _ _ O
Maybe _ _ O
not, _ _ O
although _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
very _ _ O
happy _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
it, _ _ O
not _ _ O
least _ _ O
because _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
few _ _ O
things _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
standard _ _ O
main _ _ O
course. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
if _ _ O
you're _ _ O
an _ _ O
old _ _ O
hand _ _ O
at _ _ O
navigating _ _ O
the _ _ O
shallow _ _ O
waters _ _ O
of _ _ O
small _ _ O
plates, _ _ O
it _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
unnervingly _ _ O
easy _ _ O
to _ _ O
spend _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
$100 _ _ O
on _ _ O
food _ _ O
and _ _ O
drinks _ _ O
at _ _ O
Saint _ _ O
Julivert _ _ O
and _ _ O
still _ _ O
wonder _ _ O
whether _ _ O
you've _ _ O
actually _ _ O
had _ _ O
dinner. _ _ O
Seafood _ _ O
this _ _ O
good _ _ O
is _ _ O
expensive, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
stray _ _ O
very _ _ O
far _ _ O
above _ _ O
$20; _ _ O
the _ _ O
result _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
portions _ _ O
can _ _ O
seem _ _ O
somewhat _ _ O
airy. _ _ O
When _ _ O
there's _ _ O
an _ _ O
inexpensive _ _ O
opportunity _ _ O
to _ _ O
pad _ _ O
out _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish, _ _ O
Saint _ _ O
Julivert _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
always _ _ O
take _ _ O
it. _ _ O
I _ _ O
understand _ _ O
why _ _ O
I _ _ O
can't _ _ O
have _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
three _ _ O
excellent _ _ O
wild _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
$21 _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
red _ _ O
pozole, _ _ O
but _ _ O
couldn't _ _ O
there _ _ O
be _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
spoonful _ _ O
of _ _ O
hominy _ _ O
kernels? _ _ O
Saltines _ _ O
fried _ _ O
in _ _ O
canola _ _ O
oil _ _ O
are _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
ceviche _ _ O
and _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
cold _ _ O
and _ _ O
highly _ _ O
appealing _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
under _ _ O
pink _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
onions; _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
bread _ _ O
slices _ _ O
accompany _ _ O
the _ _ O
mackerel _ _ O
whipped _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
hummus-like _ _ O
orange _ _ O
spread _ _ O
with _ _ O
piri-piri _ _ O
oil. _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
each _ _ O
time _ _ O
I _ _ O
went, _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
at _ _ O
my _ _ O
table _ _ O
asked _ _ O
for _ _ O
more _ _ O
bread. _ _ O
None _ _ O
of _ _ O
Saint _ _ O
Julivert's _ _ O
issues _ _ O
are _ _ O
insoluble. _ _ O
The _ _ O
lighting _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
warmed _ _ O
up _ _ O
so _ _ O
the _ _ O
room _ _ O
looks _ _ O
less _ _ O
like _ _ O
an _ _ O
aquarium. _ _ O
A _ _ O
few _ _ O
more _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
you _ _ O
won't _ _ O
see _ _ O
anywhere _ _ O
else, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
tuna _ _ O
bake, _ _ O
would _ _ O
make _ _ O
it _ _ O
harder _ _ O
to _ _ O
resist. _ _ O
Another _ _ O
two _ _ O
or _ _ O
three _ _ O
large _ _ O
plates _ _ O
would _ _ O
make _ _ O
it _ _ O
a _ _ O
place _ _ O
you _ _ O
think _ _ O
of _ _ O
when _ _ O
you're _ _ O
hungry. _ _ O
The _ _ O
excellent _ _ O
$19 _ _ O
prego _ _ O
sandwich _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
snack _ _ O
than _ _ O
dinner, _ _ O
until _ _ O
you _ _ O
pay _ _ O
another _ _ O
$7 _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
fried _ _ O
oysters _ _ O
tucked _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
roll _ _ O
beside _ _ O
the _ _ O
beef, _ _ O
making _ _ O
it _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
carpetbagger. _ _ O
On _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
hand, _ _ O
that's _ _ O
worth _ _ O
doing _ _ O
even _ _ O
if _ _ O
you're _ _ O
not _ _ O
hungry. _ _ O

Almost _ _ O
everybody _ _ O
is _ _ O
calling _ _ O
Misi _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
the _ _ O
latest _ _ O
endeavor _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
Missy _ _ O
Robbins, _ _ O
a _ _ O
pasta _ _ B-TYPE
restaurant. _ _ I-TYPE
That's _ _ O
not _ _ O
quite _ _ O
right. _ _ O
Yes, _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Robbins _ _ O
has _ _ O
given _ _ O
half _ _ O
of _ _ O
her _ _ O
menu _ _ O
over _ _ O
to _ _ O
long _ _ O
noodles _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
short _ _ O
ones; _ _ O
strands _ _ O
of _ _ O
linguine _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
garlic _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
double _ _ O
dose _ _ O
of _ _ O
fish _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
form _ _ O
of _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
anchovies _ _ O
and _ _ O
drizzled _ _ O
colatura; _ _ O
circles _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
ricotta _ _ O
whipped _ _ O
until _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
as _ _ O
soft _ _ O
as _ _ O
cream; _ _ O
pinched _ _ O
rings _ _ O
of _ _ O
tortelli _ _ O
stuffed _ _ O
with _ _ O
mascarpone _ _ O
and _ _ O
spinach; _ _ O
the _ _ O
deeply _ _ O
ridged _ _ O
Sardinian _ _ O
shells _ _ O
known _ _ O
as _ _ O
malloreddus; _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
marvels _ _ O
of _ _ O
starch _ _ O
formation. _ _ O
True, _ _ O
anybody _ _ O
who _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
to _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Robbins's _ _ O
other _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
Lilia _ _ O
, _ _ O
also _ _ O
located _ _ O
in _ _ O
Williamsburg, _ _ O
Brooklyn, _ _ O
knows _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
there _ _ O
reliably _ _ O
steals _ _ O
the _ _ O
show _ _ O
from _ _ O
everything _ _ O
else _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
table. _ _ O
When _ _ O
those _ _ O
people _ _ O
show _ _ O
up _ _ O
at _ _ O
Misi, _ _ O
odds _ _ O
are _ _ O
good _ _ O
that _ _ O
they _ _ O
will _ _ O
not _ _ O
have _ _ O
chosen _ _ O
that _ _ O
day _ _ O
to _ _ O
start _ _ O
a _ _ O
keto _ _ O
diet. _ _ O
Moreover, _ _ O
Misi _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
greater _ _ O
variety _ _ O
of _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
than _ _ O
Lilia, _ _ O
so _ _ O
many _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
architecture _ _ O
makes _ _ O
space _ _ O
for _ _ O
them. _ _ O
Misi _ _ O
is _ _ O
across _ _ O
the _ _ O
street _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
old _ _ O
Domino _ _ O
refinery _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
East _ _ O
River, _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
cranes _ _ O
used _ _ O
to _ _ O
unload _ _ O
sugar _ _ O
from _ _ O
barges _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
open _ _ O
air _ _ O
so _ _ O
that _ _ O
on _ _ O
days _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
wind _ _ O
was _ _ O
right _ _ O
you _ _ O
could _ _ O
taste _ _ O
it _ _ O
on _ _ O
your _ _ O
tongue _ _ O
a _ _ O
mile _ _ O
away. _ _ O
Next _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room, _ _ O
facing _ _ O
the _ _ O
factory's _ _ O
remains, _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
separate, _ _ O
glassed-in _ _ O
workshop _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
temperature _ _ O
and _ _ O
humidity _ _ O
are _ _ O
kept _ _ O
at _ _ O
consistent _ _ O
dough-friendly _ _ O
levels. _ _ O
There, _ _ O
the _ _ O
long _ _ O
noodles, _ _ O
etc., _ _ O
are _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
out _ _ O
and _ _ O
cut _ _ O
long _ _ O
before _ _ O
5:30 _ _ O
each _ _ O
night, _ _ O
when _ _ O
Misi's _ _ O
front _ _ O
door _ _ O
is _ _ O
unlocked _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
crowd _ _ O
waiting _ _ O
in _ _ O
line _ _ O
for _ _ O
walk-in _ _ O
seats _ _ O
begins _ _ O
to _ _ O
snake _ _ O
eagerly _ _ O
forward. _ _ O
And _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
sure, _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
watch _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Robbins _ _ O
and _ _ O
her _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
crew _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
two _ _ O
long _ _ O
dining _ _ O
counters, _ _ O
you'll _ _ O
see _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
quick _ _ O
motion _ _ O
over _ _ O
and _ _ O
over: _ _ O
an _ _ O
almost _ _ O
surreptitiously _ _ O
quick _ _ O
trip _ _ O
of _ _ O
hand _ _ O
to _ _ O
mouth, _ _ O
a _ _ O
sharp _ _ O
bite _ _ O
and _ _ O
an _ _ O
appraising _ _ O
chew _ _ O
to _ _ O
decide _ _ O
if _ _ O
that _ _ O
batch _ _ O
of _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
is _ _ O
ready _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
pulled _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
water. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
show _ _ O
their _ _ O
mastery _ _ O
over _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
by _ _ O
pressing _ _ O
it _ _ O
thinner _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
screen _ _ O
protector _ _ O
for _ _ O
an _ _ O
iPhone. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Robbins _ _ O
likes _ _ O
hers _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
body _ _ O
and _ _ O
heft, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
chew _ _ O
test _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
reliable _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
tell _ _ O
when _ _ O
thick _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
like _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
ready. _ _ O
You _ _ O
are _ _ O
very _ _ O
unlikely _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
a _ _ O
piece _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
undercooked _ _ O
at _ _ O
its _ _ O
core, _ _ O
or _ _ O
one _ _ O
that _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
fight _ _ O
back _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
let _ _ O
you _ _ O
know _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
alive. _ _ O
You _ _ O
get _ _ O
this _ _ O
just-in-between _ _ O
texture _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
stubs _ _ O
of _ _ O
mezze _ _ O
rigatoni _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
simple, _ _ O
glossy, _ _ O
ripe _ _ O
tomato _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
that's _ _ O
been _ _ O
stewed _ _ O
with _ _ O
whole _ _ O
garlic _ _ O
cloves _ _ O
-- _ _ O
30 _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
batch, _ _ O
according _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
You _ _ O
get _ _ O
it _ _ O
again _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
corzetti, _ _ O
discs _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
diameter _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
Red _ _ O
Bull _ _ O
can _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
pressed _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
wooden _ _ O
stamp _ _ O
to _ _ O
give _ _ O
them _ _ O
a _ _ O
target _ _ O
pattern. _ _ O
In _ _ O
October, _ _ O
Misi _ _ O
served _ _ O
these _ _ O
ridged _ _ O
coins _ _ O
with _ _ O
another _ _ O
tomato _ _ O
sauce, _ _ O
this _ _ O
one _ _ O
barely _ _ O
cooked, _ _ O
just _ _ O
some _ _ O
Sungold _ _ O
tomatoes _ _ O
warmed _ _ O
until _ _ O
they _ _ O
broke _ _ O
open _ _ O
and _ _ O
their _ _ O
yellow _ _ O
pulp _ _ O
spilled _ _ O
out. _ _ O
Fresh _ _ O
basil, _ _ O
thyme _ _ O
and _ _ O
chervil _ _ O
were _ _ O
scattered _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
top, _ _ O
as _ _ O
good _ _ O
an _ _ O
illustration _ _ O
as _ _ O
any _ _ O
of _ _ O
how _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Robbins _ _ O
makes _ _ O
her _ _ O
food _ _ O
stand _ _ O
out _ _ O
without _ _ O
deviating _ _ O
from _ _ O
an _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
reliance _ _ O
on _ _ O
simple, _ _ O
unmanipulated _ _ O
ingredients. _ _ O
But _ _ O
to _ _ O
call _ _ O
Misi _ _ O
a _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
to _ _ O
overlook _ _ O
its _ _ O
highly _ _ O
impressive _ _ O
work _ _ O
with _ _ O
vegetables. _ _ O
They _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
subject _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu's _ _ O
other _ _ O
half, _ _ O
sneakily _ _ O
headlined _ _ O
"antipasti." _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
where _ _ O
you _ _ O
will _ _ O
find _ _ O
a _ _ O
globe _ _ O
eggplant _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
until _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
as _ _ O
soft _ _ O
and _ _ O
easy _ _ O
to _ _ O
spread _ _ O
as _ _ O
cream _ _ O
cheese; _ _ O
the _ _ O
cut _ _ O
surfaces _ _ O
are _ _ O
dressed _ _ O
with _ _ O
Calabrian _ _ O
chiles, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
taste _ _ O
of _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
juice _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
found _ _ O
its _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
center _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
eggplant. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
fleshy _ _ O
and _ _ O
firm _ _ O
chanterelles, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
lightly _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
and _ _ O
preserved _ _ O
in _ _ O
olive _ _ O
oil _ _ O
until _ _ O
they're _ _ O
brought _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
crisscrossed _ _ O
with _ _ O
rosemary _ _ O
needles. _ _ O
Grilled _ _ O
runner _ _ O
beans _ _ O
with _ _ O
garlic _ _ O
and _ _ O
chiles _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
around _ _ O
lately, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
big _ _ O
heap _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
would _ _ O
have _ _ O
enjoyed _ _ O
more _ _ O
if _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
stringy, _ _ O
leathery _ _ O
beans _ _ O
had _ _ O
not _ _ O
gotten _ _ O
past _ _ O
the _ _ O
inspectors _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen. _ _ O
Like _ _ O
the _ _ O
pastas, _ _ O
Misi's _ _ O
vegetables _ _ O
tend _ _ O
to _ _ O
bring _ _ O
together _ _ O
only _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
ingredients, _ _ O
often _ _ O
applied _ _ O
in _ _ O
ways _ _ O
you _ _ O
don't _ _ O
quite _ _ O
expect. _ _ O
I _ _ O
don't _ _ O
know _ _ O
where _ _ O
else _ _ O
you _ _ O
will _ _ O
taste _ _ O
pistachios _ _ O
and _ _ O
anchovies _ _ O
combined _ _ O
with _ _ O
skinny, _ _ O
leaf-bud-green _ _ O
leeks _ _ O
marinated _ _ O
in _ _ O
vinegar, _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
panzanella _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
bread, _ _ O
capers, _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
oregano _ _ O
and _ _ O
chunks _ _ O
of _ _ O
zucchini _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
still _ _ O
tender _ _ O
after _ _ O
a _ _ O
quick _ _ O
poaching _ _ O
in _ _ O
olive _ _ O
oil. _ _ O
And _ _ O
though _ _ O
the _ _ O
gently _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
tomatoes _ _ O
won't _ _ O
come _ _ O
back _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
until _ _ O
next _ _ O
summer, _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
try _ _ O
imagining _ _ O
how _ _ O
their _ _ O
dusting _ _ O
of _ _ O
fennel _ _ O
seeds _ _ O
and _ _ O
cracked _ _ O
coriander _ _ O
seeds _ _ O
responds _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
last-minute _ _ O
squirt _ _ O
of _ _ O
spicy _ _ O
honey. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
enough _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O
vegetables, _ _ O
and _ _ O
enough _ _ O
meatless _ _ O
pastas, _ _ O
that _ _ O
a _ _ O
vegetarian _ _ O
could _ _ O
eat _ _ O
extremely _ _ O
well _ _ O
at _ _ O
Misi _ _ O
just _ _ O
by _ _ O
watching _ _ O
out _ _ O
for _ _ O
things _ _ O
like _ _ O
bottarga _ _ O
and _ _ O
staying _ _ O
away _ _ O
entirely _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
pork _ _ O
sugo _ _ O
tossed _ _ O
with _ _ O
strangozzi. _ _ O
(Meat _ _ O
eaters, _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
hand, _ _ O
may _ _ O
find _ _ O
the _ _ O
sugo _ _ O
helps _ _ O
restore _ _ O
chafed _ _ O
nerves.) _ _ O
Although _ _ O
Misi _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
let _ _ O
its _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
range _ _ O
as _ _ O
widely _ _ O
as _ _ O
Lilia's, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
more _ _ O
successful _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
several _ _ O
ways. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
distilled _ _ O
down _ _ O
to _ _ O
essentials, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole _ _ O
enterprise _ _ O
seems _ _ O
more _ _ O
carefully _ _ O
thought _ _ O
through. _ _ O
The _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
is _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
ground _ _ O
floor _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
apartment _ _ O
building _ _ O
by _ _ O
SHoP _ _ O
Architects _ _ O
, _ _ O
who _ _ O
chose _ _ O
to _ _ O
leave _ _ O
a _ _ O
hole _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
middle _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
could _ _ O
fly _ _ O
a _ _ O
helicopter _ _ O
through. _ _ O
The _ _ O
developer, _ _ O
Two _ _ O
Trees _ _ O
, _ _ O
recruited _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Robbins _ _ O
and _ _ O
her _ _ O
business _ _ O
partner, _ _ O
Sean _ _ O
Feeney, _ _ O
and _ _ O
gave _ _ O
them _ _ O
a _ _ O
chance _ _ O
to _ _ O
build _ _ O
the _ _ O
virgin _ _ O
space _ _ O
to _ _ O
their _ _ O
needs. _ _ O
The _ _ O
acoustics _ _ O
are _ _ O
better _ _ O
than _ _ O
at _ _ O
Lilia, _ _ O
and _ _ O
traffic _ _ O
between _ _ O
tables _ _ O
flows _ _ O
more _ _ O
smoothly. _ _ O
The _ _ O
interior _ _ O
is _ _ O
unusually _ _ O
good, _ _ O
with _ _ O
narrow _ _ O
horizontal _ _ O
wall _ _ O
tiles _ _ O
in _ _ O
white _ _ O
and _ _ O
nooks _ _ O
for _ _ O
stacked _ _ O
plates _ _ O
that _ _ O
make _ _ O
them _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
décor. _ _ O
As _ _ O
at _ _ O
Lilia, _ _ O
the _ _ O
wine _ _ O
list _ _ O
practically _ _ O
begs _ _ O
you _ _ O
to _ _ O
take _ _ O
something _ _ O
new _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
whirl: _ _ O
a _ _ O
catarratto _ _ O
from _ _ O
Sicily, _ _ O
a _ _ O
Corsican _ _ O
niellucciu, _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
croatina-ughetta _ _ O
blend _ _ O
from _ _ O
Lombardy _ _ O
softened _ _ O
with _ _ O
some _ _ O
uva _ _ O
rara. _ _ O
Of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
you _ _ O
could _ _ O
stick _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
$45 _ _ O
Lambrusco, _ _ O
or _ _ O
get _ _ O
a _ _ O
$250 _ _ O
Champagne _ _ O
from _ _ O
David _ _ O
Léclapart, _ _ O
after _ _ O
which _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
try _ _ O
flying _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
hole _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
building _ _ O
yourself. _ _ O
If _ _ O
we _ _ O
are _ _ O
striving _ _ O
for _ _ O
total _ _ O
accuracy, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
we _ _ O
need _ _ O
to _ _ O
call _ _ O
Misi _ _ O
a _ _ O
pasta-vegetables-and-gelato _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
Its _ _ O
gelato _ _ O
is _ _ O
made _ _ O
in _ _ O
house; _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
about _ _ O
six _ _ O
kinds _ _ O
at _ _ O
any _ _ O
given _ _ O
moment. _ _ O
The _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
open _ _ O
up _ _ O
right _ _ O
away, _ _ O
in _ _ O
part _ _ O
because _ _ O
Misi _ _ O
serves _ _ O
them _ _ O
just _ _ O
below _ _ O
the _ _ O
melting _ _ O
point _ _ O
and _ _ O
in _ _ O
part _ _ O
because _ _ O
the _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
are _ _ O
used _ _ O
prodigally. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
almonds _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
almond, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
espresso _ _ O
could _ _ O
keep _ _ O
you _ _ O
up _ _ O
an _ _ O
extra _ _ O
hour. _ _ O
But _ _ O
even _ _ O
the _ _ O
unflavored _ _ O
fior _ _ O
di _ _ O
latte, _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
milk, _ _ O
cream _ _ O
and _ _ O
sugar, _ _ O
comes _ _ O
at _ _ O
you _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
rush. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
no _ _ O
desserts _ _ O
other _ _ O
than _ _ O
gelato. _ _ O
The _ _ O
only _ _ O
decision _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
night _ _ O
is _ _ O
which _ _ O
one _ _ O
you're _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
have. _ _ O

Something _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
missing _ _ O
from _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York's _ _ I-LOC
current _ _ O
Indian _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurant _ _ O
scene, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
wasn't _ _ O
sure _ _ O
what _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
until _ _ O
I _ _ O
ate _ _ O
the _ _ O
kaleji _ _ B-DISH
masala _ _ I-DISH
at _ _ O
Adda _ _ B-EST
Indian _ _ I-EST
Canteen _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
Long _ _ B-LOC
Island _ _ I-LOC
City, _ _ I-LOC
Queens. _ _ I-LOC
Modernization _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
theme _ _ O
unifying _ _ O
many _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Indian _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurants _ _ O
that _ _ O
have _ _ O
taken _ _ O
root _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
few _ _ O
years. _ _ O
At _ _ O
the _ _ O
rarefied _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
spectrum, _ _ O
we _ _ O
have _ _ O
Indian _ _ B-EST
Accent _ _ I-EST
bringing _ _ O
the _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
into _ _ O
line _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
intricate _ _ O
techniques _ _ O
and _ _ O
plating _ _ O
that _ _ O
can _ _ O
land _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
itineraries _ _ O
of _ _ O
list-clutching _ _ O
gastrotourists. _ _ O
At _ _ O
the _ _ O
populist _ _ O
end, _ _ O
we've _ _ O
seen _ _ O
Indian _ _ B-CUISINE
cooking _ _ O
gastro-pubbed _ _ O
by _ _ O
Babu _ _ O
Ji _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
new _ _ O
places _ _ O
that _ _ O
try _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
non-desis _ _ O
feel _ _ O
at _ _ O
home _ _ O
with _ _ O
house-party _ _ O
vibes, _ _ O
beer _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
self-service _ _ O
fridge, _ _ O
and _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
like _ _ O
naan _ _ B-DISH
pizzas _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
samosa _ _ B-DISH
burgers. _ _ I-DISH
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
hasn't _ _ O
seen _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
as _ _ O
many _ _ O
recently _ _ O
opened _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
devoted _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
pure, _ _ O
original _ _ O
stuff _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
getting _ _ O
modernized. _ _ O
The _ _ O
snacks _ _ O
pitched _ _ O
together _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
blur _ _ O
by _ _ O
hawkers _ _ O
at _ _ O
folding _ _ O
tables _ _ O
and _ _ O
rolling _ _ O
carts _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
side _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
road; _ _ O
the _ _ O
gravy-soaked _ _ O
stews _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
sauceless _ _ O
dry _ _ B-FOOD
curries _ _ I-FOOD
patiently _ _ O
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
25 _ _ O
or _ _ O
so _ _ O
vegetables _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
seasonings, _ _ O
all _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
chopped, _ _ O
ground, _ _ O
fried _ _ O
and _ _ O
simmered _ _ O
at _ _ O
home _ _ O
by _ _ O
those _ _ O
keepers _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
culinary _ _ O
flame _ _ O
known _ _ O
collectively _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
aunties _ _ O
-- _ _ O
we've _ _ O
seen _ _ O
interpretations _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
food, _ _ O
squeezed _ _ O
from _ _ O
eyedroppers _ _ O
and _ _ O
prepared _ _ O
for _ _ O
their _ _ O
photo _ _ O
shoots _ _ O
with _ _ O
edible _ _ O
flowers. _ _ O
But _ _ O
new _ _ O
places _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
the _ _ O
genuine _ _ O
article _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
scarce. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
problem _ _ O
of _ _ O
missing _ _ O
context _ _ O
here; _ _ O
twists _ _ O
on _ _ O
tradition _ _ O
don't _ _ O
really _ _ O
resonate _ _ O
when _ _ O
tradition _ _ O
is _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
find _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
untwisted _ _ O
form. _ _ O
And _ _ O
for _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
who _ _ O
truly _ _ O
loves _ _ O
Indian _ _ B-CUISINE
cooking, _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
more _ _ O
pressing _ _ O
problem _ _ O
of _ _ O
missing _ _ O
flavor. _ _ O
Five _ _ O
dots _ _ O
of _ _ O
tandoori-spice _ _ B-FOOD
oil _ _ I-FOOD
just _ _ O
won't _ _ O
land _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
taste _ _ O
buds _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
impact _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
full _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
charred _ _ O
and _ _ O
steaming _ _ O
tandoori _ _ B-DISH
chicken, _ _ I-DISH
no _ _ O
matter _ _ O
how _ _ O
evenly _ _ O
spaced _ _ O
those _ _ O
dots _ _ O
are. _ _ O
I _ _ O
hadn't _ _ O
given _ _ O
much _ _ O
thought _ _ O
to _ _ O
either _ _ O
problem, _ _ O
to _ _ O
tell _ _ O
the _ _ O
truth, _ _ O
until _ _ O
I _ _ O
made _ _ O
it _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
out-of-the-way _ _ O
patch _ _ O
of _ _ O
Long _ _ B-LOC
Island _ _ I-LOC
City _ _ I-LOC
where _ _ O
Adda _ _ B-EST
Indian _ _ I-EST
Canteen _ _ I-EST
operates. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
that _ _ O
neighborhood _ _ O
where _ _ O
high-rise _ _ O
apartments _ _ O
grow _ _ O
overnight _ _ O
and _ _ O
Amazon _ _ O
will _ _ O
soon _ _ O
tiptoe _ _ O
in _ _ O
with _ _ O
25,000 _ _ O
employees. _ _ O
Adda _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
east _ _ O
of _ _ O
all _ _ O
that, _ _ O
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
National _ _ O
Guard _ _ O
recruiting _ _ O
office, _ _ O
surrounded _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
thicket _ _ O
of _ _ O
railroad _ _ O
tracks _ _ O
and _ _ O
highway _ _ O
overpasses. _ _ O
Unless _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
looking _ _ O
for _ _ O
it, _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
likely _ _ O
to _ _ O
end _ _ O
up _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
small _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room, _ _ O
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
Indian _ _ O
tabloids _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
upcycled _ _ O
as _ _ O
wallpaper. _ _ O
Once _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
found _ _ O
it, _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
things _ _ O
I _ _ O
ate _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
kaleji _ _ B-DISH
masala, _ _ I-DISH
chicken _ _ B-FOOD
livers _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark _ _ O
gravy _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
with _ _ O
fresh _ _ B-FOOD
ginger _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
garam _ _ B-FOOD
masala. _ _ I-FOOD
Right _ _ O
away _ _ O
I _ _ O
realized _ _ O
that _ _ O
this _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
Indian _ _ O
food _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
hungry _ _ O
for, _ _ O
or _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
the _ _ O
kind _ _ O
that _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
been _ _ O
hungry _ _ O
for: _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
care _ _ O
but _ _ O
no _ _ O
pretense; _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
for _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
love _ _ O
the _ _ O
interplay _ _ O
of _ _ O
spices; _ _ O
presented _ _ O
without _ _ O
apology _ _ O
in _ _ O
all _ _ O
its _ _ O
brown, _ _ O
lumpy _ _ O
glory; _ _ O
and _ _ O
complex _ _ O
in _ _ O
ways _ _ O
that _ _ O
demand _ _ O
full _ _ O
attention. _ _ O
Adda _ _ O
(ah _ _ O
DAH) _ _ O
Indian _ _ O
Canteen _ _ O
was _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
September _ _ O
by _ _ O
Roni _ _ O
Mazumdar, _ _ O
who _ _ O
owns _ _ O
it, _ _ O
and _ _ O
Chintan _ _ O
Pandya, _ _ O
who _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef. _ _ O
The _ _ O
two _ _ O
men _ _ O
already _ _ O
run _ _ O
Rahi _ _ O
, _ _ O
in _ _ O
Greenwich _ _ O
Village, _ _ O
perhaps _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
casual, _ _ O
modernizing _ _ O
Indian _ _ O
restaurants, _ _ O
where _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Pandya _ _ O
serves _ _ O
original _ _ O
notions _ _ O
like _ _ O
tandoori _ _ O
skate _ _ O
and _ _ O
sends _ _ O
almost _ _ O
everything _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
decorated _ _ O
with _ _ O
edible _ _ O
flowers. _ _ O
They've _ _ O
taken _ _ O
another _ _ O
angle _ _ O
at _ _ O
Adda, _ _ O
mining _ _ O
family _ _ O
recipes _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
lessons _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Pandya _ _ O
absorbed _ _ O
from _ _ O
civilian _ _ O
cooks _ _ O
around _ _ O
India. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu _ _ O
travels _ _ O
beyond _ _ O
the _ _ O
standard _ _ O
north _ _ O
Indian _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
most _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
already _ _ O
know, _ _ O
but _ _ O
even _ _ O
those _ _ O
dishes, _ _ O
when _ _ O
they _ _ O
appear, _ _ O
are _ _ O
prepared _ _ O
so _ _ O
emphatically _ _ O
that _ _ O
they _ _ O
don't _ _ O
resemble _ _ O
anything _ _ O
else _ _ O
in _ _ O
town. _ _ O
Adda _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
lusty, _ _ O
full-throated _ _ O
defense _ _ O
of _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
cooking. _ _ O
Saag _ _ O
paneer, _ _ O
the _ _ O
grayest _ _ O
of _ _ O
old _ _ O
gray _ _ O
mares _ _ O
in _ _ O
many _ _ O
Indian _ _ O
restaurants, _ _ O
is _ _ O
coltishly _ _ O
energetic _ _ O
at _ _ O
Adda. _ _ O
The _ _ O
cheese _ _ O
is _ _ O
made _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it's _ _ O
gorgeously _ _ O
soft, _ _ O
while _ _ O
the _ _ O
saag _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
tart _ _ O
and _ _ O
peppery _ _ O
mix _ _ O
of _ _ O
wilted _ _ O
arugula, _ _ O
sorrel, _ _ O
spinach _ _ O
and _ _ O
mustard _ _ O
greens. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Pandya _ _ O
does _ _ O
very _ _ O
well _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
class _ _ O
of _ _ O
sidewalk _ _ O
treats _ _ O
called _ _ O
chaat. _ _ O
Each _ _ O
delivers _ _ O
the _ _ O
messy _ _ O
riot _ _ O
you'd _ _ O
hope _ _ O
for, _ _ O
busy _ _ O
with _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
hieroglyphs _ _ O
of _ _ O
fried _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
and _ _ O
splattered _ _ O
with _ _ O
yogurt _ _ O
and _ _ O
tamarind _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
One _ _ O
chaat _ _ O
is _ _ O
anchored _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
big _ _ O
kale _ _ O
fritter, _ _ O
another _ _ O
by _ _ O
several _ _ O
smaller _ _ O
chips _ _ O
of _ _ O
battered, _ _ O
spiced _ _ O
lentil _ _ O
cakes, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
third _ _ O
by _ _ O
fried _ _ O
smashed _ _ O
potatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
chickpeas. _ _ O
But _ _ O
discerning _ _ O
chaat _ _ O
lovers _ _ O
should _ _ O
probably _ _ O
go _ _ O
directly _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
dahi _ _ O
batata _ _ O
puri, _ _ O
soft _ _ O
potato _ _ O
packed _ _ O
into _ _ O
hollow _ _ O
globes _ _ O
of _ _ O
fried _ _ O
dough _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
pick _ _ O
up _ _ O
and _ _ O
eat _ _ O
with _ _ O
your _ _ O
fingers, _ _ O
like _ _ O
chocolates. _ _ O
Anything _ _ O
that _ _ O
passes _ _ O
through _ _ O
Adda's _ _ O
tandoor _ _ O
is _ _ O
worth _ _ O
investigating. _ _ O
Seekh _ _ O
kebabs, _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
that's _ _ O
coarsely _ _ O
ground _ _ O
by _ _ O
hand, _ _ O
come _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
tandoor _ _ O
juicier _ _ O
and _ _ O
pinker _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
usual; _ _ O
Mumbai-style _ _ O
tandoori _ _ O
macchi, _ _ O
a _ _ O
skewered _ _ O
pompano _ _ O
rubbed _ _ O
with _ _ O
ground _ _ O
mustard _ _ O
seeds _ _ O
and _ _ O
cilantro, _ _ O
is _ _ O
lightly _ _ O
charred _ _ O
and _ _ O
smoky _ _ O
after _ _ O
roasting, _ _ O
but _ _ O
still _ _ O
moist; _ _ O
bhatti _ _ O
da _ _ O
murgh, _ _ O
a _ _ O
double-marinated _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
thigh _ _ O
and _ _ O
drumstick, _ _ O
is _ _ O
so _ _ O
thickly _ _ O
crusted _ _ O
with _ _ O
coriander _ _ O
and _ _ O
cumin _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
crunches _ _ O
when _ _ O

My _ _ O
server _ _ O
expressed _ _ O
an _ _ O
enthusiasm _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
poussin _ _ O
-- _ _ O
plunged _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
tandoor _ _ O
in _ _ O
one _ _ O
piece _ _ O
after _ _ O
marinating _ _ O
in _ _ O
vinegar, _ _ O
yogurt, _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
red _ _ O
chiles _ _ O
and _ _ O
kala _ _ O
namak, _ _ O
the _ _ O
sulfurous _ _ O
black _ _ O
salt _ _ O
of _ _ O
India _ _ O
-- _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
typically _ _ O
find _ _ O
in _ _ O
new _ _ O
converts _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
cult. _ _ O
After _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
it, _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
ready _ _ O
to _ _ O
join. _ _ O
He _ _ O
was _ _ O
enthusiastic _ _ O
about _ _ O
almost _ _ O
everything, _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
turned _ _ O
out; _ _ O
the _ _ O
service _ _ O
at _ _ O
Adda _ _ O
is _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
if _ _ O
not _ _ O
eager _ _ O
to _ _ O
talk _ _ O
up _ _ O
the _ _ O
food. _ _ O
(Getting _ _ O
your _ _ O
water _ _ O
glass _ _ O
refilled _ _ O
is _ _ O
another _ _ O
story.) _ _ O
Placing _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish _ _ O
of _ _ O
yogurt _ _ O
and _ _ O
pomegranate _ _ O
seeds _ _ O
next _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
goat _ _ O
biryani _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
lid _ _ O
of _ _ O
dough, _ _ O
he _ _ O
said, _ _ O
"This _ _ O
is _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
your _ _ O
best _ _ O
friend _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
spice _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
biryani _ _ O
starts _ _ O
to _ _ O
hit _ _ O
you." _ _ O
It _ _ O
was, _ _ O
in _ _ O
fact, _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
fiercest _ _ O
biryanis _ _ O
I've _ _ O
ever _ _ O
met, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
yogurt _ _ O
tamed _ _ O
it _ _ O
so _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
could _ _ O
taste _ _ O
the _ _ O
tender _ _ O
goat _ _ O
meat _ _ O
and _ _ O
crisp, _ _ O
bittersweet _ _ O
fried _ _ O
onions. _ _ O
Few _ _ O
things _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
are _ _ O
quite _ _ O
as _ _ O
chile-drenched _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
biryani, _ _ O
but _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Pandya _ _ O
definitely _ _ O
favors _ _ O
India's _ _ O
more _ _ O
intense _ _ O
flavors. _ _ O
Adda _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
big _ _ O
on _ _ O
soft-spoken _ _ O
cream _ _ O
sauces; _ _ O
the _ _ O
coconut _ _ O
milk _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Malvani _ _ O
prawn _ _ O
curry _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
South _ _ O
Konkan _ _ O
coast, _ _ O
for _ _ O
instance, _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
pronounced _ _ O
kick. _ _ O
(It's _ _ O
very _ _ O
good _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
get _ _ O
it _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
night _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
prawns _ _ O
are _ _ O
firm _ _ O
and _ _ O
not _ _ O
spongy.) _ _ O
And _ _ O
while _ _ O
Adda _ _ O
does _ _ O
serve _ _ O
some _ _ O
vegetables, _ _ O
it _ _ O
would _ _ O
not _ _ O
make _ _ O
my _ _ O
list _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
20 _ _ O
best _ _ O
local _ _ O
Indian _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
for _ _ O
vegetarians. _ _ O
It _ _ O
would, _ _ O
however, _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
place _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
send _ _ O
you _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
know _ _ O
how _ _ O
good _ _ O
Delhi _ _ O
butter _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
can _ _ O
be. _ _ O
Or _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
don't _ _ O
yet _ _ O
believe _ _ O
that _ _ O
rara _ _ O
gosht, _ _ O
chunks _ _ O
of _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
stewed _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
bone _ _ O
with _ _ O
spiced _ _ O
minced _ _ O
lamb, _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
redundant _ _ O
but _ _ O
luxurious. _ _ O
And _ _ O
Adda _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
tell _ _ O
you _ _ O
about _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
woke _ _ O
up _ _ O
one _ _ O
morning _ _ O
hungry _ _ O
for _ _ O
bheja _ _ O
fry, _ _ O
goat _ _ O
brains _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
with _ _ O
onions, _ _ O
ginger _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
considerable _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
green _ _ O
chiles. _ _ O
"Like _ _ O
soft _ _ O
scrambled _ _ O
eggs," _ _ O
our _ _ O
server _ _ O
said, _ _ O
accurately. _ _ O
I _ _ O
might _ _ O
point _ _ O
out _ _ O
that _ _ O
a _ _ O
typical _ _ O
Indian _ _ O
bheja _ _ O
fry _ _ O
is _ _ O
drier, _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
higher _ _ O
ratio _ _ O
of _ _ O
brains _ _ O
to _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
But _ _ O
I _ _ O
would _ _ O
not _ _ O
necessarily _ _ O
mean _ _ O
that _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
complaint. _ _ O

Earlier _ _ O
this _ _ O
year _ _ O
Henry, _ _ B-EST
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
lobby _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Life _ _ B-LOC
Hotel _ _ I-LOC
on _ _ O
West _ _ B-LOC
31st _ _ I-LOC
Street, _ _ I-LOC
quietly _ _ O
died. _ _ O
You _ _ O
wouldn't _ _ O
know _ _ O
it _ _ O
to _ _ O
look _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
place _ _ O
on _ _ O
any _ _ O
recent _ _ O
night _ _ O
at _ _ O
8, _ _ O
when _ _ O
a _ _ O
seamless _ _ O
playlist _ _ O
of _ _ O
hip-hop _ _ O
and _ _ O
R&B _ _ O
unspools _ _ O
as _ _ O
servers _ _ O
carry _ _ O
stacked _ _ O
beef _ _ B-DISH
ribs _ _ I-DISH
to _ _ O
what _ _ O
seems _ _ O
like _ _ O
every _ _ O
third _ _ O
table. _ _ O
What _ _ O
changed? _ _ O
In _ _ O
August, _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
Joseph _ _ O
Johnson _ _ O
, _ _ O
better _ _ O
known _ _ O
as _ _ O
JJ, _ _ O
was _ _ O
made _ _ O
a _ _ O
partner _ _ O
and _ _ O
assumed _ _ O
control _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen. _ _ O
What _ _ O
he _ _ O
has _ _ O
done _ _ O
is _ _ O
less _ _ O
a _ _ O
makeover _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
takeover; _ _ O
his _ _ O
imprint _ _ O
radiates _ _ O
out _ _ O
from _ _ O
his _ _ O
Afrocentric _ _ B-CUISINE
menu _ _ O
to _ _ O
animate _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole _ _ O
enterprise. _ _ O
The _ _ O
playlist, _ _ O
which _ _ O
can _ _ O
run _ _ O
from _ _ O
noon _ _ O
until _ _ O
8 _ _ O
the _ _ O
next _ _ O
morning _ _ O
without _ _ O
repeating _ _ O
a _ _ O
track, _ _ O
is _ _ O
his. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Johnson's _ _ O
initials _ _ O
now _ _ O
hang _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
front _ _ O
window, _ _ O
flooding _ _ O
the _ _ O
nearby _ _ O
tables _ _ O
with _ _ O
pink _ _ O
neon. _ _ O
The _ _ O
initials _ _ O
have _ _ O
migrated _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
website _ _ O
as _ _ O
well, _ _ O
where _ _ O
its _ _ O
name _ _ O
is _ _ O
now _ _ O
given _ _ O
as _ _ O
Henry _ _ B-EST
at _ _ I-EST
Life _ _ I-EST
Hotel _ _ I-EST
by _ _ I-EST
JJ _ _ I-EST
. _ _ O
These _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
subtle _ _ O
gestures, _ _ O
but _ _ O
subtlety _ _ O
has _ _ O
rarely _ _ O
saved _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
brink _ _ O
of _ _ O
failure. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Johnson _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
busy _ _ O
hiring _ _ O
new _ _ O
employees _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
front _ _ O
and _ _ O
back _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
house, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
racial _ _ O
mix _ _ O
he _ _ O
has _ _ O
already _ _ O
achieved _ _ O
is _ _ O
as _ _ O
impressive _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
rare. _ _ O
Diversifying _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
service _ _ O
staff _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
surest _ _ O
ways _ _ O
to _ _ O
diversify _ _ O
the _ _ O
audience, _ _ O
and _ _ O
on _ _ O
many _ _ O
nights _ _ O
brown _ _ O
faces _ _ O
and _ _ O
white _ _ O
faces, _ _ O
topknots _ _ O
and _ _ O
braids, _ _ O
headscarves _ _ O
and _ _ O
headbands, _ _ O
sit _ _ O
side _ _ O
by _ _ O
side, _ _ O
giving _ _ O
Henry _ _ B-EST
more _ _ O
the _ _ O
appearance _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
Harlem _ _ B-LOC
than _ _ O
of _ _ O
one _ _ O
just _ _ O
off _ _ O
Herald _ _ B-LOC
Square. _ _ I-LOC
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
in _ _ O
Harlem, _ _ B-LOC
as _ _ O
chef _ _ O
de _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
slinky _ _ O
neighborhood _ _ O
hangout _ _ O
called _ _ O
the _ _ O
Cecil _ _ B-EST
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
history-drenched _ _ O
jazz _ _ B-TYPE
supper _ _ I-TYPE
club _ _ I-TYPE
Minton's _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Johnson _ _ O
made _ _ O
his _ _ O
name. _ _ O
Fleshing _ _ O
out _ _ O
a _ _ O
notion _ _ O
suggested _ _ O
by _ _ O
Alexander _ _ O
Smalls, _ _ O
the _ _ O
consulting _ _ O
chef _ _ O
in _ _ O
both _ _ O
places, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Johnson _ _ O
explored _ _ O
the _ _ O
African _ _ O
diaspora, _ _ O
the _ _ O
imprint _ _ O
that _ _ O
Africans _ _ O
have _ _ O
put _ _ O
on _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
world. _ _ O
He _ _ O
does _ _ O
something _ _ O
similar _ _ O
at _ _ O
Henry, _ _ O
although _ _ O
his _ _ O
view _ _ O
has _ _ O
grown _ _ O
to _ _ O
embrace _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
from, _ _ O
say, _ _ O
India _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
Southeast _ _ B-LOC
Asia _ _ I-LOC
that _ _ O
turn _ _ O
up _ _ O
in _ _ O
Africa _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
in _ _ O
diasporic _ _ O
countries _ _ O
like _ _ O
Jamaica _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
Barbados. _ _ B-LOC
He _ _ O
calls _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
at _ _ O
Henry _ _ O
"Pan-African." _ _ B-CUISINE

This _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
big _ _ O
story _ _ O
-- _ _ O
too _ _ O
big _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
told _ _ O
in _ _ O
full _ _ O
by _ _ O
one _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
for _ _ O
that _ _ O
matter. _ _ O
But _ _ O
it's _ _ O
an _ _ O
important _ _ O
story, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
certainly _ _ O
beats _ _ O
Henry's _ _ B-EST
original _ _ O
idea _ _ O
of _ _ O
tying _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
history _ _ O
of _ _ O
Life _ _ O
magazine, _ _ O
which _ _ O
was _ _ O
once _ _ O
published _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
building, _ _ O
and _ _ O
to _ _ O
Henry _ _ O
Luce _ _ O
, _ _ O
who _ _ O
bought _ _ O
it _ _ O
in _ _ O
1936, _ _ O
then _ _ O
radically _ _ O
remade _ _ O
it _ _ O
and _ _ O
moved _ _ O
it _ _ O
to _ _ O
other _ _ O
quarters. _ _ O
This _ _ O
concept _ _ O
was _ _ O
so _ _ O
wispy _ _ O
that _ _ O
Henry's _ _ B-EST
first _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Michael _ _ O
Vignola, _ _ O
resorted _ _ O
to _ _ O
an _ _ O
all-things-to-all-people _ _ O
menu _ _ O
of _ _ O
foie _ _ B-DISH
gras _ _ I-DISH
sliders _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
meatball _ _ O
pizza. _ _ O
Just _ _ O
how _ _ O
vast _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Johnson's _ _ O
scope _ _ O
has _ _ O
become _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
clear _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
appetizer _ _ O
course. _ _ O
(Here _ _ O
I _ _ O
am _ _ O
assuming _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
chosen _ _ O
a _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
two- _ _ O
or _ _ O
three-course _ _ O
meal _ _ O
rather _ _ O
than _ _ O
eating _ _ O
all _ _ O
15 _ _ O
items _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu, _ _ O
in _ _ O
full _ _ O
and _ _ O
in _ _ O
order; _ _ O
this _ _ O
route _ _ O
costs _ _ O
$390 _ _ O
and _ _ O
is _ _ O
called _ _ O
"It _ _ O
Was _ _ O
All _ _ O
a _ _ O
Dream," _ _ O
after _ _ O
a _ _ O
Notorious _ _ O
B.I.G. _ _ O
lyric.) _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
littleneck _ _ O
clams, _ _ O
battered _ _ O
with _ _ O
rice _ _ O
flour _ _ O
and _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
with _ _ O
shaved _ _ O
fennel _ _ O
and _ _ O
Asian _ _ O
pear. _ _ O
All _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
is _ _ O
dotted _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
tangerine-colored _ _ O
fluff _ _ O
of _ _ O
piri-piri _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
less _ _ O
ferociously _ _ O
spicy _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
scalding _ _ O
piri-piris _ _ O
of _ _ O
Angola, _ _ O
Mozambique _ _ O
or _ _ O
South _ _ O
Africa. _ _ O
You _ _ O
are _ _ O
welcome _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
a _ _ O
half-dozen, _ _ O
but _ _ O
at _ _ O
my _ _ O
table _ _ O
a _ _ O
full _ _ O
dozen _ _ O
went _ _ O
quickly. _ _ O
Benne _ _ O
seeds, _ _ O
the _ _ O
heirloom _ _ O
variety _ _ O
of _ _ O
sesame _ _ O
brought _ _ O
to _ _ O
North _ _ O
America _ _ O
on _ _ O
slave _ _ O
ships, _ _ O
add _ _ O
a _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
something _ _ O
like _ _ O
toasted _ _ O
almonds _ _ O
mixed _ _ O
with _ _ O
coffee _ _ O
beans _ _ O
to _ _ O
tuna _ _ O
tartare. _ _ O
The _ _ O
tuna _ _ O
is _ _ O
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
chip _ _ O
of _ _ O
curried _ _ O
peanut _ _ O
brittle _ _ O
and _ _ O
spooned _ _ O
over _ _ O
shiso _ _ O
leaves; _ _ O
you _ _ O
pinch _ _ O
the _ _ O
leaf _ _ O
and _ _ O
pop _ _ O
it _ _ O
in _ _ O
your _ _ O
mouth, _ _ O
where _ _ O
good _ _ O
things _ _ O
start _ _ O
to _ _ O
happen. _ _ O
And _ _ O
as _ _ O
you're _ _ O
adjusting _ _ O
to _ _ O
this _ _ O
cross-pollination _ _ O
of _ _ O
Africa _ _ O
and _ _ O
Japan, _ _ O
Indo-Caribbean _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
appears _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
horizon: _ _ O
a _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
folded _ _ O
roti _ _ O
with _ _ O
dips. _ _ O
The _ _ O
spinach _ _ O
chutney _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
joyless, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
inky _ _ O
purée _ _ O
of _ _ O
eggplant _ _ O
sweetened _ _ O
with _ _ O
dates _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
terrific _ _ O
idea. _ _ O
Why _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Johnson _ _ O
puts _ _ O
a _ _ O
fried _ _ O
egg _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
roti _ _ O
is _ _ O
unclear. _ _ O
When _ _ O
your _ _ O
meal _ _ O
at _ _ O
Henry _ _ O
is _ _ O
over, _ _ O
you _ _ O
may _ _ O
wish _ _ O
you _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
sent _ _ O
home _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
world _ _ O
map _ _ O
showing _ _ O
the _ _ O
history _ _ O
of _ _ O
forced _ _ O
African _ _ O
migration _ _ O
and _ _ O
spice-trade _ _ O
routes. _ _ O
While _ _ O
it's _ _ O
going _ _ O
on, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
you _ _ O
generally _ _ O
flow _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
inner _ _ O
logic _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
get _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
hip-hop _ _ O
track _ _ O
without _ _ O
being _ _ O
able _ _ O
to _ _ O
name _ _ O
every _ _ O
last _ _ O
sample. _ _ O
Generally, _ _ O
but _ _ O
not _ _ O
always. _ _ O
I _ _ O
believe _ _ O
I _ _ O
understood _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
reasoning _ _ O
behind _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
collard _ _ O
greens _ _ O
and _ _ O
cashews _ _ O
tossed _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
coconut _ _ O
dressing, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
still _ _ O
find _ _ O
raw _ _ O
collards _ _ O
somewhat _ _ O
rough _ _ O
going _ _ O
after _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
few _ _ O
mouthfuls. _ _ O
Is _ _ O
the _ _ O
seared _ _ O
salmon _ _ O
with _ _ O
rice _ _ O
noodles, _ _ O
edamame _ _ O
and _ _ O
bok _ _ O
choy _ _ O
a _ _ O
reference _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
Vietnamese _ _ O
community _ _ O
in _ _ O
Senegal? _ _ O
To _ _ O
me _ _ O
it _ _ O
tasted, _ _ O
not _ _ O
unpleasantly, _ _ O
like _ _ O
something _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
better _ _ O
Asian _ _ O
fusion _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
in _ _ O
Manhattan _ _ O
would _ _ O
have _ _ O
served _ _ O
20 _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago. _ _ O
Henry's _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
and _ _ O
pork _ _ O
dumplings, _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
hand, _ _ O
are _ _ O
nondescript _ _ O
little _ _ O
blobs; _ _ O
they _ _ O
sit _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
aromatic _ _ O
"Harlem _ _ O
curry," _ _ O
informed _ _ O
by _ _ O
Bengali _ _ O
cooking, _ _ O
that _ _ O
deserves _ _ O
a _ _ O
better _ _ O
dance _ _ O
partner. _ _ O
You _ _ O
could _ _ O
say _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
intensely _ _ O
herb-scented _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
broth _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
boil _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Johnson _ _ O
calls _ _ O
the _ _ O
Afropot; _ _ O
the _ _ O
clams _ _ O
and _ _ O
king _ _ O
crab _ _ O
legs _ _ O
were _ _ O
very _ _ O
good, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
prawns _ _ O
were _ _ O
unappealingly _ _ O
soft _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
mussels _ _ O
not _ _ O
quite _ _ O
fleshy _ _ O
enough. _ _ O
The _ _ O
cooking, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
getting _ _ O
tighter _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
month, _ _ O
picking _ _ O
up _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
first _ _ O
and _ _ O
somewhat _ _ O
droopy _ _ O
meal _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
night _ _ O
when _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Johnson _ _ O
was _ _ O
not _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen. _ _ O
Tamarind _ _ O
jerk _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
had _ _ O
no _ _ O
spice _ _ O
to _ _ O
speak _ _ O
of. _ _ O
A _ _ O
parcel _ _ O
of _ _ O
rice _ _ O
supposedly _ _ O
inspired _ _ O
by _ _ O
Dominican _ _ O
concón _ _ O
had _ _ O
as _ _ O
much _ _ O
crunch _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
left _ _ O
out _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
counter _ _ O
overnight, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
eggplant _ _ O
curry _ _ O
ladled _ _ O
over _ _ O
it _ _ O
tasted _ _ O
more _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
halfheartedly _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
tomato _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
The _ _ O
second _ _ O
time _ _ O
I _ _ O
tried _ _ O
it, _ _ O
the _ _ O
rice _ _ O
had _ _ O
a _ _ O
golden _ _ O
crackle _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
curry _ _ O
was _ _ O
worth _ _ O
paying _ _ O
attention _ _ O
to. _ _ O
Apart _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
seared _ _ O
scallops _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
remarkably _ _ O
good _ _ O
hominy _ _ O
broth _ _ O
with _ _ O
cilantro _ _ O
pistou, _ _ O
those _ _ O
bone-in _ _ O
ribs _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
rewarding _ _ O
main _ _ O
course. _ _ O
The _ _ O
rewards _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
so _ _ O
much _ _ O
the _ _ O
short _ _ O
ribs _ _ O
themselves, _ _ O
though _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
flavorful _ _ O
and _ _ O
tender; _ _ O
the _ _ O
thrill _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
is _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
battery _ _ O
of _ _ O
little _ _ O
sides _ _ O
like _ _ O
stir-fried _ _ O
millet, _ _ O
spiced _ _ O
black _ _ O
beans _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
hoisin _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
I _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
to _ _ O
take _ _ O
home _ _ O
to _ _ O
keep _ _ O
on _ _ O
hand _ _ O
for _ _ O
Chinese-food _ _ O
emergencies. _ _ O
I _ _ O
also _ _ O
thought _ _ O
about _ _ O
pocketing _ _ O
a _ _ O
Foie _ _ O
Crispy _ _ O
Treat, _ _ O
and _ _ O
I _ _ O
would _ _ O
have _ _ O
gotten _ _ O
away _ _ O
with _ _ O
it _ _ O
because _ _ O
everybody _ _ O
else _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
thought _ _ O
they _ _ O
were _ _ O
too _ _ O
weird. _ _ O
Weird _ _ O
they _ _ O
are, _ _ O
but _ _ O
interesting, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
Maybe _ _ O
you'd _ _ O
be _ _ O
happier _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
potato _ _ O
pie _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
butter _ _ O
crust, _ _ O
very _ _ O
old _ _ O
school _ _ O
apart _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
purple _ _ O
yam _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
filling. _ _ O
True, _ _ O
at _ _ O
some _ _ O
point _ _ O
in _ _ O
your _ _ O
meal _ _ O
a _ _ O
hotel _ _ O
guest _ _ O
may _ _ O
decide _ _ O
to _ _ O
march _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
full _ _ O
set _ _ O
of _ _ O
luggage. _ _ O
But _ _ O
under _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Johnson, _ _ O
Henry _ _ O
is _ _ O
under _ _ O
no _ _ O
risk _ _ O
of _ _ O
being _ _ O
capsized _ _ O
by _ _ O
that _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
distraction. _ _ O
He _ _ O
has _ _ O
pulled _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
back _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
edge _ _ O
of _ _ O
failure, _ _ O
and _ _ O
that's _ _ O
a _ _ O
rare _ _ O
trick. _ _ O

For _ _ O
most _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
time _ _ O
on _ _ O
earth, _ _ O
the _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
slice _ _ O
has _ _ O
not _ _ O
been _ _ O
seen _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
product _ _ O
that _ _ O
needed _ _ O
tinkering. _ _ O
Yes, _ _ O
pizza _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
accessorized _ _ O
with _ _ O
toppings _ _ O
from _ _ O
crayfish _ _ B-FOOD
(not _ _ O
bad) _ _ O
to _ _ O
Buffalo _ _ B-FOOD
chicken _ _ I-FOOD
(hmm) _ _ O
to _ _ O
Caesar _ _ B-FOOD
salad _ _ I-FOOD
(no, _ _ O
no, _ _ O
no, _ _ O
no, _ _ O
no). _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
foldable, _ _ O
portable _ _ O
triangles _ _ O
of _ _ O
cheese, _ _ B-FOOD
sauce _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
dough _ _ B-FOOD
themselves _ _ O
were _ _ O
generally _ _ O
held _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
natural _ _ O
resource _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
perfect _ _ O
as _ _ O
is, _ _ O
much _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
soft, _ _ O
unfiltered _ _ O
city _ _ O
tap _ _ O
water _ _ O
claimed _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
source _ _ O
of _ _ O
their _ _ O
excellence. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
pizzerias _ _ O
try _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
a _ _ O
better _ _ O
slice. _ _ O
Very _ _ O
few _ _ O
try _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
a _ _ O
different _ _ O
slice. _ _ O
Mama's _ _ O
Too _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
different _ _ O
slice. _ _ O
It _ _ O
combines _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
appealing _ _ O
elements _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
Neapolitan _ _ O
pie _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
satisfying _ _ O
aspects _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
archetypal _ _ O
product _ _ O
sold _ _ O
on _ _ O
paper _ _ O
plates _ _ O
from _ _ O
sidewalk _ _ O
windows. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
Frank _ _ O
Tuttolomondo, _ _ O
the _ _ O
owner _ _ O
and _ _ O
pie _ _ O
architect _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
informal _ _ O
but _ _ O
very _ _ O
serious _ _ O
pizzeria _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
Upper _ _ O
West _ _ O
Side, _ _ O
has _ _ O
learned _ _ O
how _ _ O
to _ _ O
genetically _ _ O
modify _ _ O
pizza. _ _ O
The _ _ O
bulge _ _ O
of _ _ O
crust _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
edge _ _ O
of _ _ O
what _ _ O
Mama's _ _ O
Too _ _ O
calls _ _ O
the _ _ O
"house _ _ O
slice" _ _ O
is _ _ O
brown, _ _ O
more _ _ O
rough _ _ O
than _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
and _ _ O
baked _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
ferocious _ _ O
crackle. _ _ O
You _ _ O
could _ _ O
tear _ _ O
it _ _ O
off _ _ O
and _ _ O
enjoy _ _ O
it _ _ O
on _ _ O
its _ _ O
own, _ _ O
or _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
with _ _ O
butter _ _ O
or _ _ O
olive _ _ O
oil, _ _ O
just _ _ O
as _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
Neapolitans. _ _ O
Yet _ _ O
the _ _ O
flat _ _ O
layer _ _ O
of _ _ O
crust _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
bottom _ _ O
is _ _ O
firm, _ _ O
without _ _ O
the _ _ O
soupy _ _ O
center _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Neapolitan _ _ O
style. _ _ O
True _ _ O
to _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
form, _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
hold _ _ O
it _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
air _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
curved _ _ O
rim _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
stay _ _ O
flat _ _ O
and _ _ O
parallel _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
floor. _ _ O
As _ _ O
they _ _ O
do _ _ O
at _ _ O
Totonno's _ _ O
and _ _ O
some _ _ O
other _ _ O
brick-oven _ _ O
pizzerias, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Tuttolomondo _ _ O
lays _ _ O
the _ _ O
cheese _ _ O
down _ _ O
before _ _ O
the _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
Rather _ _ O
than _ _ O
drippy, _ _ O
milky _ _ O
discs _ _ O
of _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
mozzarella, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
he _ _ O
covers _ _ O
the _ _ O
raw _ _ O
dough _ _ O
(after _ _ O
priming _ _ O
it _ _ O
with _ _ O
olive _ _ O
oil) _ _ O
in _ _ O
shreds _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
slice-friendly _ _ O
variety _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
known _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
trade _ _ O
as _ _ O
low-moisture _ _ O
mozzarella _ _ O
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
rest _ _ O
of _ _ O
us _ _ O
call _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
cheese. _ _ O
Over _ _ O
this, _ _ O
he _ _ O
ladles _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
blots _ _ O
of _ _ O
tomato _ _ O
pulp. _ _ O
This _ _ O
helps _ _ O
the _ _ O
crust _ _ O
to _ _ O
bake _ _ O
through _ _ O
without _ _ O
getting _ _ O
soggy, _ _ O
keeps _ _ O
the _ _ O
cheese _ _ O
from _ _ O
sliding _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
crust, _ _ O
and _ _ O
most _ _ O
of _ _ O
all _ _ O
lets _ _ O
you _ _ O
taste _ _ O
the _ _ O
tomatoes, _ _ O
which _ _ O
are _ _ O
very _ _ O
good. _ _ O
You _ _ O
could, _ _ O
I _ _ O
suppose, _ _ O
think _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
house _ _ O
slice _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
white _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
with _ _ O
tomato-sauce _ _ O
topping. _ _ O
After _ _ O
the _ _ O
pie _ _ O
comes _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
oven, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Tuttolomondo _ _ O
sprinkles _ _ O
it _ _ O
with _ _ O
grated _ _ O
two-year-old _ _ O
Parmigiano-Reggiano. _ _ O
Basil _ _ O
leaves _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
to _ _ O
go _ _ O
on. _ _ O
At _ _ O
this _ _ O
point, _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
pay, _ _ O
walk _ _ O
out _ _ O
the _ _ O
door _ _ O
and _ _ O
amble _ _ O
toward _ _ O
Broadway _ _ O
and _ _ O
106th _ _ O
Street _ _ O
cradling _ _ O
your _ _ O
slice _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
paper _ _ O
plate _ _ O
and _ _ O
taking _ _ O
bites _ _ O
as _ _ O
you _ _ O
go. _ _ O
In _ _ O
other _ _ O
words, _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
have _ _ O
the _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
sidewalk _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
experience, _ _ O
but _ _ O
you _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
you _ _ O
normally _ _ O
find _ _ O
only _ _ O
in _ _ O
high-minded _ _ O
sit-down _ _ O
pizzerias _ _ O
like _ _ O
Sorbillo _ _ O
, _ _ O
Ops _ _ O
or _ _ O
Una _ _ O
Pizza _ _ O
Napoletana _ _ O
. _ _ O
Those _ _ O
bloodhounds _ _ O
who _ _ O
follow _ _ O
the _ _ O
city's _ _ O
melted-mozzarella _ _ O
trail _ _ O
will _ _ O
recognize _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mama's _ _ O
Too _ _ O
is _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
great _ _ O
reawakening _ _ O
of _ _ O
slice _ _ O
culture. _ _ O
Unlike _ _ O
brick-oven _ _ O
pizza, _ _ O
which _ _ O
came _ _ O
from _ _ O
Europe _ _ O
and _ _ O
relied _ _ O
on _ _ O
preindustrial _ _ O
technology, _ _ O
the _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
slice _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
lowly _ _ O
American _ _ O
hybrid. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
baked _ _ O
in _ _ O
gas _ _ O
ovens, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
sheer _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
places _ _ O
selling _ _ O
it _ _ O
suggests _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
requires _ _ O
no _ _ O
special _ _ O
skill. _ _ O
When _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
praised, _ _ O
we _ _ O
don't _ _ O
talk _ _ O
about _ _ O
its _ _ O
artisanal _ _ O
roots; _ _ O
we _ _ O
call _ _ O
it _ _ O
the _ _ O
humble _ _ O
slice, _ _ O
the _ _ O
street-corner _ _ O
slice, _ _ O
the _ _ O
slice _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
common _ _ O
man _ _ O
and _ _ O
woman. _ _ O
The _ _ O
ordinary _ _ O
slice _ _ O
and _ _ O
its _ _ O
heftier _ _ O
cousin, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Sicilian-style _ _ O
square, _ _ O
were _ _ O
probably _ _ O
first _ _ O
rehabilitated _ _ O
with _ _ O
superior _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
sophisticated _ _ O
understanding _ _ O
of _ _ O
baking _ _ O
by _ _ O
Best _ _ O
Pizza _ _ O
in _ _ O
Williamsburg, _ _ O
Brooklyn, _ _ O
in _ _ O
2010. _ _ O
Today, _ _ O
serious _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
hobbyists _ _ O
talk _ _ O
about _ _ O
their _ _ O
favorite _ _ O
slices _ _ O
by _ _ O
reeling _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
dough's _ _ O
rising _ _ O
time _ _ O
and _ _ O
hydration _ _ O
levels. _ _ O
North _ _ O
Brooklyn _ _ O
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
the _ _ O
center _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
neoclassical _ _ O
slice _ _ O
movement, _ _ O
with _ _ O
L'Industrie _ _ O
and _ _ O
Williamsburg _ _ O
Pizza _ _ O
and, _ _ O
most _ _ O
recently, _ _ O
Paulie _ _ O
Gee's _ _ O
Slice _ _ O
Shop _ _ O
in _ _ O
Greenpoint, _ _ O
Brooklyn, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
forward-thinking _ _ O
slice _ _ O
is _ _ O
found _ _ O
in _ _ O
Manhattan, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
at _ _ O
Scarr's _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
Lower _ _ O
East _ _ O
Side _ _ O
and _ _ O
Corner _ _ O
Slice _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Gotham _ _ O
West _ _ O
Market. _ _ O
The _ _ O
goal _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
neoclassicists _ _ O
is, _ _ O
essentially, _ _ O
to _ _ O
return _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
golden _ _ O
age _ _ O
of _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
takeout _ _ O
pizza, _ _ O
which _ _ O
survives _ _ O
at _ _ O
places _ _ O
like _ _ O
Di _ _ O
Fara _ _ O
in _ _ O
Midwood, _ _ O
Brooklyn, _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
holy _ _ O
sites _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
neoclassical _ _ O
church. _ _ O
Paulie _ _ O
Gee's _ _ O
Slice _ _ O
Shop, _ _ O
Scarr's _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
neoclassicist _ _ O
joints _ _ O
cultivate _ _ O
a _ _ O
self-consciously _ _ O
vintage _ _ O
atmosphere, _ _ O
styling _ _ O
their _ _ O
logos _ _ O
and _ _ O
signs _ _ O
and _ _ O
interiors _ _ O
so _ _ O
they _ _ O
look _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
place _ _ O
where _ _ O
Johnny _ _ O
Boy _ _ O
and _ _ O
Charlie _ _ O
in _ _ O
"Mean _ _ O
Streets" _ _ O
might _ _ O
have _ _ O
gone _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
pepperoni _ _ O
slice _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
Coke. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Tuttolomondo _ _ O
does _ _ O
not _ _ O
fetishize _ _ O
the _ _ O
past. _ _ O
Perhaps _ _ O
this _ _ O
is _ _ O
because _ _ O
he _ _ O
lived _ _ O
it. _ _ O
For _ _ O
almost _ _ O
60 _ _ O
years _ _ O
his _ _ O
family _ _ O
has _ _ O
owned _ _ O
a _ _ O
series _ _ O
of _ _ O
old-school _ _ O
slice _ _ O
joints _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
neighborhood. _ _ O
The _ _ O
current _ _ O
incarnation _ _ O
is _ _ O
literally _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
street _ _ O
corner, _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
intersection _ _ O
of _ _ O
106th _ _ O
Street _ _ O
and _ _ O
Amsterdam _ _ O
Avenue. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
called _ _ O
Mama's _ _ O
Pizza _ _ O
. _ _ O
He _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
open _ _ O
Mama's _ _ O
Too _ _ O
a _ _ O
block _ _ O
away _ _ O
to _ _ O
outdo _ _ O
his _ _ O
parents; _ _ O
he's _ _ O
bringing _ _ O
their _ _ O
product _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
era. _ _ O
If _ _ O
the _ _ O
neoclassicists _ _ O
are _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
folk _ _ O
revivalists _ _ O
who _ _ O
collected _ _ O
old _ _ O
acoustic _ _ O
78s, _ _ O
he _ _ O
is _ _ O
Dylan _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
Newport _ _ O
Folk _ _ O
Festival _ _ O
in _ _ O
1965. _ _ O
When _ _ O
Mama's _ _ O
Too _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
December, _ _ O
it _ _ O
also _ _ O
served _ _ O
housemade _ _ O
pasta. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
still _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
board _ _ O
that _ _ O
hangs _ _ O
on _ _ O
one _ _ O
wall, _ _ O
but _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Tuttolomondo _ _ O
has _ _ O
stopped _ _ O
serving _ _ O
it _ _ O
to _ _ O
concentrate _ _ O
on _ _ O
pizza. _ _ O
Besides _ _ O
the _ _ O
house _ _ O
slice, _ _ O
he _ _ O
also _ _ O
makes _ _ O
squares _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
sees _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
marriage _ _ O
of _ _ O
rectangular _ _ O
Sicilian _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
with _ _ O
Roman _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
al _ _ O
taglio. _ _ O
The _ _ O
crust _ _ O
is _ _ O
much _ _ O
taller _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
Roman _ _ O
style, _ _ O
and _ _ O
taller _ _ O
than _ _ O
some _ _ O
Sicilians, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
airy _ _ O
and _ _ O
chewy. _ _ O
On _ _ O
the _ _ O
bottom _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
the _ _ O
bronze _ _ O
color, _ _ O
the _ _ O
cratered _ _ O
surface _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
pan-fried _ _ O
crunch _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
bread _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
cheese _ _ O
sandwich. _ _ O
The _ _ O
edges, _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
dough _ _ O
meets _ _ O
the _ _ O
pan, _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
gold _ _ O
fringe _ _ O
of _ _ O
browned _ _ O
cheese, _ _ O
known _ _ O
among _ _ O
students _ _ O
of _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
styles _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
"frico _ _ O
crust." _ _ O
This _ _ O
fringe _ _ O
is, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
and _ _ O
delicious. _ _ O
The _ _ O
most _ _ O
impressive _ _ O
square _ _ O
is, _ _ O
I _ _ O
think, _ _ O
the _ _ O
pepperoni. _ _ O
Unlike _ _ O
most _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
others, _ _ O
it _ _ O
incorporates _ _ O
tomato _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
The _ _ O
mozzarella _ _ O
is _ _ O
baked _ _ O
until _ _ O
it _ _ O
begins _ _ O
to _ _ O
brown. _ _ O
The _ _ O
pepperoni _ _ O
slices _ _ O
are _ _ O
small _ _ O
and _ _ O
concave, _ _ O
like _ _ O
contact _ _ O
lenses _ _ O
made _ _ O
of _ _ O
meat. _ _ O
Crunchy _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
rims, _ _ O
these _ _ O
little _ _ O
cups _ _ O
are _ _ O
half-filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
spicy _ _ O
red _ _ O
oil. _ _ O
It _ _ O
may _ _ O
sound _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
I _ _ O
approached _ _ O
this _ _ O
slice _ _ O
with _ _ O
cool, _ _ O
analytical _ _ O
detachment. _ _ O
The _ _ O
truth _ _ O
is _ _ O
I _ _ O
ripped _ _ O
into _ _ O
it _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
pack _ _ O
of _ _ O
hyenas. _ _ O
The _ _ O
other _ _ O
squares _ _ O
tend _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
white _ _ O
pies _ _ O
with _ _ O
toppings. _ _ O
Again, _ _ O
tomato _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
toppings. _ _ O
In _ _ O
one _ _ O
case _ _ O
it's _ _ O
a _ _ O
thick _ _ O
and _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
layer _ _ O
of _ _ O
vodka _ _ O
sauce, _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
ideas _ _ O
that _ _ O
separates _ _ O
Mama's _ _ O
Too _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
neoclassicists. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Tuttolomondo _ _ O
also _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
cacio _ _ O
e _ _ O
pepe _ _ O
Sicilian _ _ O
pie, _ _ O
essentially _ _ O
a _ _ O
four-cheese _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
cheeses _ _ O
is _ _ O
pecorino; _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole _ _ O
slice _ _ O
hums _ _ O
with _ _ O
black _ _ O
pepper. _ _ O
The _ _ O
square _ _ O
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
Gorgonzola _ _ O
dolce _ _ O
and _ _ O
pears _ _ O
works _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
way _ _ O
that _ _ O
combination _ _ O
often _ _ O
doesn't, _ _ O
although _ _ O
half _ _ O
a _ _ O
slice _ _ O
was _ _ O
enough _ _ O
for _ _ O
me. _ _ O
The _ _ O
shop _ _ O
is _ _ O
small, _ _ O
and _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
sit _ _ O
at _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
handful _ _ O
of _ _ O
red _ _ O
counter _ _ O
stools _ _ O
you _ _ O
will _ _ O
share _ _ O
the _ _ O
small _ _ O
tiled _ _ O
floor _ _ O
up _ _ O
front _ _ O
with _ _ O
neighbors _ _ O
waiting _ _ O
for _ _ O
takeout _ _ O
and _ _ O
delivery _ _ O
guys. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
no _ _ O
vintage _ _ O
soda _ _ O
refrigerators _ _ O
or _ _ O
letterboard _ _ O
signs, _ _ O
but _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
photograph _ _ O
of _ _ O
Robert _ _ O
De _ _ O
Niro _ _ O
eating _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
much _ _ O

Travolta _ _ O
in _ _ O
"Saturday _ _ O
Night _ _ O
Fever," _ _ O
biting _ _ O

The _ _ O

is _ _ O
in _ _ O
black _ _ O

white _ _ O
except _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O

A _ _ O
card _ _ O
is _ _ O
set _ _ O
down _ _ O
in _ _ O
front _ _ O
of _ _ O
you _ _ O
before _ _ O
each _ _ O

run _ _ O
by _ _ O
Junghyun _ _ O
Park _ _ O
and _ _ O
his _ _ O
wife, _ _ O
Jeungeun. _ _ O
Each _ _ O
is _ _ O
printed _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
boldface _ _ O
transliteration _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
word _ _ O
under _ _ O
an _ _ O
abstract _ _ O
design _ _ O
of _ _ O
geometric _ _ O
shapes _ _ O
and _ _ O
lines. _ _ O
They _ _ O
look _ _ O
like _ _ O
flashcards _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
school _ _ O
run _ _ O
by _ _ O
progressive _ _ O
graphic _ _ O
designers. _ _ O
"Your _ _ O
first _ _ O
course _ _ O
is _ _ O
guk, _ _ B-FOOD
which _ _ O
means _ _ O
soup," _ _ B-FOOD
a _ _ O
server _ _ O
will _ _ O
say. _ _ O
"This _ _ O
card _ _ O
is _ _ O
for _ _ O
hwe, _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
for _ _ O
raw." _ _ O
"Jorim _ _ O
is _ _ O
next. _ _ O
Jorim _ _ O
means _ _ O
it's _ _ O
been _ _ O
braised." _ _ O
This _ _ O
sounds _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
would _ _ O
get _ _ O
old, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
doesn't. _ _ O
Very _ _ O
early _ _ O
on, _ _ O
you _ _ O
learn _ _ O
that _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
side _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O
vocabulary _ _ O

of _ _ O

One _ _ O

another, _ _ O
each _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
10 _ _ O
courses _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
$175 _ _ O
meal _ _ O
opens _ _ O
up _ _ O
new _ _ O
ideas _ _ O
about _ _ O
Korean _ _ B-CUISINE
cuisine _ _ O
and _ _ O
culture. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
Atomix _ _ B-EST
pedagogical _ _ O
method, _ _ O
instruction _ _ O
is _ _ O
followed _ _ O
closely _ _ O
by _ _ O
reward. _ _ O
(While _ _ O
we _ _ O
are _ _ O
working _ _ O
on _ _ O
vocabulary: _ _ O
The _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O

is _ _ O
pronounced, _ _ O

of _ _ O
the _ _ O

Many _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O

are _ _ O
the _ _ O
kind _ _ O
you _ _ O

of _ _ O

Guk-which-means-soup _ _ B-DISH
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
shimmering _ _ O
broth _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Park, _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
makes _ _ O
from _ _ O
fermented _ _ B-FOOD
tomatoes _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
kelp; _ _ B-FOOD
chilled _ _ O
and _ _ O
poured _ _ O
over _ _ O
scallop _ _ B-FOOD
slices _ _ O
layered _ _ O
between _ _ O
slivers _ _ O
of _ _ O
green _ _ B-FOOD
tomato _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
marinated _ _ O
in _ _ O
Korean _ _ B-FOOD
fig _ _ I-FOOD
vinegar, _ _ I-FOOD
the _ _ O
broth _ _ O
has _ _ O
an _ _ O
electrifying _ _ O
sweet-sour _ _ O
balance. _ _ O
The _ _ O
dish _ _ O
may _ _ O
not _ _ O
scream _ _ O
"Korean _ _ B-CUISINE
cuisine," _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
next _ _ O
one _ _ O
does. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
hwe _ _ O
-- _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
for _ _ O
raw, _ _ O
you'll _ _ O
recall, _ _ O
and _ _ O
also _ _ O
the _ _ O
term _ _ O
for _ _ O
Korean-style _ _ B-CUISINE
sashimi. _ _ B-FOOD
The _ _ O
fish _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
striped _ _ B-FOOD
jack, _ _ I-FOOD
brushed _ _ O
with _ _ O
plum _ _ B-FOOD
vinegar _ _ I-FOOD
sauce. _ _ I-FOOD
Slices _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
are _ _ O
folded _ _ O
around _ _ O
a _ _ O
mild _ _ O
fermented _ _ B-FOOD
chile, _ _ I-FOOD
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
drops _ _ O
of _ _ O
sesame _ _ B-FOOD
oil _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
bits _ _ O
of _ _ O
kimchi _ _ B-FOOD
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
cabbage _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
ramps. _ _ B-FOOD
Sitting _ _ O
over _ _ O
each _ _ O
slice _ _ O
of _ _ O
jack _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
square _ _ O
of _ _ O
gim, _ _ B-FOOD
which _ _ O
the _ _ O
Japanese _ _ O
call _ _ O
nori. _ _ B-FOOD
Pinch _ _ O
some _ _ O
fish _ _ B-FOOD
inside _ _ O
the _ _ O
gim _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
eat _ _ O
it, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
that _ _ O
unspool _ _ O
are _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
those _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
brought _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
with _ _ O
Korean _ _ B-CUISINE
sashimi, _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
they're _ _ O
put _ _ O
together _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
harmony _ _ O
that's _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
achieve _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
swab _ _ O
them _ _ O
yourself _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
influence _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
glasses _ _ O
of _ _ O
soju. _ _ B-FOOD
Inspired _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
poem _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
Choson _ _ O
era, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Park _ _ O
summoned _ _ O
an _ _ O
entirely _ _ O
different _ _ O
set _ _ O
of _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
hwe _ _ O
on _ _ O
Atomix's _ _ B-EST
opening _ _ O
menu, _ _ O
which _ _ O
ran _ _ O
from _ _ O
late _ _ O
May _ _ O
to _ _ O
early _ _ O
September. _ _ O
Then, _ _ O
the _ _ O
fish _ _ B-FOOD
was _ _ O
sea _ _ B-FOOD
bream, _ _ I-FOOD
firm _ _ O
and _ _ O
chewy, _ _ O
marinated _ _ O
overnight _ _ O
with _ _ O
ginger _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
magnificently _ _ O
good _ _ O
tangerine _ _ B-FOOD
vinegar _ _ I-FOOD
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
island _ _ O
of _ _ O
Jeju. _ _ B-LOC
Eaten _ _ O
with _ _ O
sea _ _ B-FOOD
urchin, _ _ I-FOOD
plain _ _ O
spinach, _ _ B-FOOD
sparkling _ _ O
shards _ _ O
of _ _ O
jelly _ _ B-FOOD
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
pale _ _ O
young _ _ B-FOOD
soy _ _ I-FOOD
sauce, _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
Chinese-mustard _ _ B-FOOD
leaves _ _ I-FOOD
fermented _ _ O
in _ _ O
some _ _ O
wonderful _ _ O
way, _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
so _ _ O
deeply _ _ O
harmonic _ _ O
I _ _ O
wouldn't _ _ O
have _ _ O
minded _ _ O
if _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Park _ _ O
had _ _ O
served _ _ O
it _ _ O
over _ _ O
and _ _ O
over _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
rest _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
meal. _ _ O
Centuries _ _ O
before _ _ O
it _ _ O
became _ _ O
the _ _ O
fashion _ _ O
among _ _ O
American _ _ O
chefs, _ _ O
fermentation _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
pillar _ _ O
of _ _ O
Korean _ _ B-CUISINE
cuisine. _ _ O
Atomix _ _ O
exploits _ _ O
it _ _ O
in _ _ O
all _ _ O
kinds _ _ O
of _ _ O
ways. _ _ O
Fermentation _ _ O
bends _ _ O
a _ _ O
mix _ _ O
of _ _ O
juices _ _ B-FOOD
from _ _ O
Korean _ _ B-FOOD
pears, _ _ I-FOOD
green _ _ B-FOOD
apples _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
pineapple _ _ B-FOOD
toward _ _ O
a _ _ O
cidery _ _ O
direction _ _ O
that _ _ O
makes _ _ O
it _ _ O
a _ _ O
thrilling _ _ O
marinade, _ _ O
braising _ _ O
liquid _ _ O
and _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
for _ _ O
exquisitely _ _ O
rich _ _ O
Wagyu _ _ B-DISH
strip _ _ I-DISH
loin. _ _ I-DISH
It's _ _ O
the _ _ O
foundation _ _ O
for _ _ O
an _ _ O
array _ _ O
of _ _ O
vinegars _ _ B-FOOD
you _ _ O
won't _ _ O
find _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
average _ _ O
table _ _ O
in _ _ O
Koreatown: _ _ B-LOC
cherry _ _ O
blossom, _ _ O
persimmon, _ _ O
mugwort, _ _ O
birch. _ _ O
And, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
fermentation _ _ O
is _ _ O
behind _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
arsenal _ _ O
of _ _ O
pickled _ _ B-FOOD
vegetables, _ _ I-FOOD
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
interesting _ _ O
of _ _ O
which _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
tart _ _ O
brussels _ _ B-FOOD
sprouts _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Park _ _ O
serves _ _ O
in _ _ O
banchan _ _ O
format _ _ O
alongside _ _ O
roast _ _ O
duck _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
mole _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
that _ _ O
could _ _ O
pass _ _ O
muster _ _ O
in _ _ O
Mexico _ _ O
if _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Park _ _ O
did _ _ O
not _ _ O
up _ _ O
the _ _ O
funk _ _ O
level _ _ O
with _ _ O
gochujang. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
were _ _ O
fermented _ _ O
or _ _ O
otherwise _ _ O
preserved _ _ O
in _ _ O
South _ _ O
Korea. _ _ O
Many _ _ O
more _ _ O
were _ _ O
put _ _ O
up _ _ O
for _ _ O
storage _ _ O
at _ _ O
Atoboy _ _ O
, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Parks' _ _ O
other _ _ O

over _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
year _ _ O
or _ _ O
more _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
Parks _ _ O
prepared _ _ O
to _ _ O
open _ _ O
Atomix. _ _ O
Atoboy's _ _ O
food _ _ O
is _ _ O
woven _ _ O
around _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
banchan _ _ O
dishes, _ _ O
and _ _ O
while _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Park _ _ O
gives _ _ O
himself _ _ O
room _ _ O
to _ _ O
play, _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
there _ _ O
stays _ _ O
true _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
fairly _ _ O
simple _ _ O
origins _ _ O
of _ _ O
banchan. _ _ O
His _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
menus _ _ O
at _ _ O
Atomix _ _ O
make _ _ O
a _ _ O
quantum _ _ O
leap _ _ O
in _ _ O
complexity. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
like _ _ O
seeing _ _ O
the _ _ O
guy _ _ O
who _ _ O
strums _ _ O
the _ _ O
12-string _ _ O
guitar _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
L _ _ O
platform _ _ O
pick _ _ O
up _ _ O
a _ _ O
conductor's _ _ O
baton _ _ O
and _ _ O
lead _ _ O
an _ _ O

through _ _ O
a _ _ O

On _ _ O
the _ _ O
back _ _ O
of _ _ O
Atomix's _ _ O

he _ _ O
lists _ _ O
the _ _ O

each _ _ O
of _ _ O
their _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
-- _ _ O
around _ _ O
20 _ _ O
on _ _ O

very _ _ O
few _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
ordinary _ _ O
and _ _ O
none _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
place. _ _ O
Nothing _ _ O
at _ _ O
Atomix _ _ O
tastes _ _ O
confused _ _ O
or _ _ O
overburdened. _ _ O
The _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
are _ _ O
even _ _ O
more _ _ O
elaborate _ _ O
than _ _ O
those _ _ O
at _ _ O
Jungsik _ _ O
, _ _ O
the _ _ O
rarefied _ _ O
Korean-inspired _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
downtown _ _ O
where _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O

was _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
de _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
before _ _ O
he _ _ O
and _ _ O
his _ _ O
wife _ _ O
struck _ _ O
out _ _ O
on _ _ O
their _ _ O
own. _ _ O
And _ _ O
while _ _ O
Jungsik _ _ O
seems _ _ O
determined _ _ O
to _ _ O
stuff _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
into _ _ O
an _ _ O
outdated _ _ O
French _ _ O
formality, _ _ O
Atomix _ _ O
is _ _ O
warm, _ _ O
contemporary _ _ O
and _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
at _ _ O
just _ _ O
about _ _ O
every _ _ O
turn. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Parks, _ _ O
who _ _ O
were _ _ O
raised _ _ O
in _ _ O
South _ _ O

hired _ _ O
a _ _ O

to _ _ O
remake _ _ O
two _ _ O
floors _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
secretive-looking _ _ O
townhouse _ _ O
on _ _ O
East _ _ O
30th _ _ O

Upstairs _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
bar _ _ O
where _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
slither _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
pale-leather _ _ O
booth _ _ O
to _ _ O
idle _ _ O
over _ _ O
smartly _ _ O
conceived _ _ O
snacks _ _ O
like _ _ O
soy-marinated _ _ O

beef _ _ O
tartare, _ _ O
mixed _ _ O
with _ _ O
red _ _ O
and _ _ O
black _ _ O

and _ _ O
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
snowfall _ _ O
of _ _ O
pecorino; _ _ O

fried _ _ O
wings _ _ O
stuffed _ _ O
with _ _ O
fried _ _ O
rice _ _ O
and _ _ O
dusted _ _ O
with _ _ O

Sichuan _ _ O
peppercorns. _ _ O
Stairs _ _ O
descend _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
bright, _ _ O
skylit _ _ O
lounge _ _ O
of _ _ O
upholstered _ _ O
benches _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O

kicks _ _ O
off _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
couple _ _ O
of _ _ O
hors _ _ O

and _ _ O
drinks. _ _ O
The _ _ O
idea _ _ O
must _ _ O
be _ _ O
for _ _ O
you _ _ O
to _ _ O
leave _ _ O
the _ _ O
shuffle _ _ O
of _ _ O
Manhattan _ _ O
behind _ _ O
in _ _ O
stages, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
always _ _ O
spent _ _ O
my _ _ O
few _ _ O
minutes _ _ O
in _ _ O
this _ _ O

eyeing _ _ O
the _ _ O
comfortable, _ _ O
dark, _ _ O

a _ _ O

and _ _ O
simple _ _ O
lines _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O

seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
bow _ _ O
toward _ _ O
Korea's _ _ O
long _ _ O
Zen _ _ O
tradition, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
purposeful _ _ O
calm _ _ O
reigns _ _ O
there. _ _ O
Servers _ _ O
and _ _ O
cooks _ _ O
all _ _ O
wear _ _ O
flowing, _ _ O
boat-neck _ _ O
shirts _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
shimmering _ _ O
pewter _ _ O
color _ _ O
that _ _ O
gives _ _ O
them _ _ O
a _ _ O
slight _ _ O
science-fiction _ _ O
look; _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
work _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
Korean-born _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
designer, _ _ O
Sungho _ _ O
Ahn. _ _ O

smiling _ _ O
and _ _ O
holding _ _ O
out _ _ O
a _ _ O
cloth _ _ O
case _ _ O
to _ _ O
offer _ _ O
a _ _ O
pair _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Korean-made _ _ O
chopsticks _ _ O
she _ _ O
collects. _ _ O
They're _ _ O
beautiful _ _ O
objects, _ _ O
and _ _ O
so _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
handmade _ _ O
plates _ _ O
and _ _ O
bowls _ _ O
that _ _ O
begin _ _ O
to _ _ O
file _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen, _ _ O
each _ _ O
made _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
potter _ _ O
or _ _ O
glass _ _ O
worker _ _ O
or _ _ O
wood _ _ O
carver _ _ O
in _ _ O
South _ _ O
Korea. _ _ O
These _ _ O
artisans _ _ O
are _ _ O
identified _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
cards, _ _ O
whose _ _ O
abstract _ _ O
designs _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
work _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
South _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
artist. _ _ O
Tasting _ _ O
menus _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
arid _ _ O
and _ _ O
sterile _ _ O
when _ _ O
a _ _ O
chef _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
have _ _ O
much _ _ O
to _ _ O
say. _ _ O
The _ _ O
format _ _ O
comes _ _ O
to _ _ O
life _ _ O
when _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
is _ _ O
overflowing _ _ O
with _ _ O
ideas, _ _ O
like _ _ O
Atomix. _ _ O
The _ _ O
way _ _ O
the _ _ O
Parks _ _ O
put _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
culture _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
foreground _ _ O
recalls _ _ O
the _ _ O
early _ _ O
days _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Four _ _ O
Seasons, _ _ O
which _ _ O
moved _ _ O
beyond _ _ O
European _ _ O
models _ _ O
of _ _ O
formal _ _ O
dining _ _ O
by _ _ O
hiring _ _ O
an _ _ O
American _ _ O
architect _ _ O

American _ _ O
industrial _ _ O
designers _ _ O
to _ _ O
go _ _ O
along _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
American _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
and _ _ O
even _ _ O
American _ _ O

The _ _ O

a _ _ O

The _ _ O
rise _ _ O
of _ _ O
Sichuan _ _ B-CUISINE
food _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ B-DISH
York _ _ I-DISH
has _ _ O
made _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
decade _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
a _ _ O
glorious _ _ O
era _ _ O
for _ _ O
prowlers _ _ O
of _ _ O
Chinese _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurants. _ _ O
Chongqing _ _ B-FOOD
chicken _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
mung-bean _ _ B-FOOD
jelly _ _ I-FOOD
proliferated _ _ O
as _ _ O
skilled _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
flocked _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
city. _ _ O
But _ _ O
while _ _ O
the _ _ O
miles _ _ O
of _ _ O
dan _ _ B-FOOD
dan _ _ I-FOOD
noodles _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
mountains _ _ O
of _ _ O
Sichuan _ _ O
peppercorns _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
exhilarating, _ _ O
they _ _ O
have _ _ O
tended _ _ O
to _ _ O
overshadow _ _ O
the _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
of _ _ O
another _ _ O
great _ _ O
chile-haunted _ _ O
region, _ _ O
Hunan. _ _ O
Part _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
problem _ _ O
is _ _ O
nomenclature. _ _ O
The _ _ O
word _ _ O
Hunan _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
front _ _ O
window _ _ O
tends _ _ O
to _ _ O
say _ _ O
as _ _ O
much _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
actual _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
inside _ _ O
as _ _ O
pandas _ _ O
and _ _ O
bamboo _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
sign. _ _ O
At _ _ O
first _ _ O
glance _ _ O
it _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
distinguish _ _ O
Hunan _ _ O
Garden, _ _ O
say, _ _ O
from _ _ O
Hunan _ _ O
House _ _ O
until _ _ O
you _ _ O
see _ _ O
the _ _ O
menus _ _ O
and _ _ O
learn _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
former _ _ O
name _ _ O
signifies _ _ O
egg _ _ O
rolls _ _ O
while _ _ O
the _ _ O
latter _ _ O
promises _ _ O
the _ _ O
red-braised _ _ O
pork _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mao _ _ O
used _ _ O
to _ _ O
dote _ _ O
on. _ _ O
Fake _ _ O
Hunans _ _ O
outnumber _ _ O
real _ _ O
ones, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
reason _ _ O
to _ _ O
celebrate _ _ O
the _ _ O
appearance _ _ O
of _ _ O
Hunan _ _ O
Slurp _ _ O
. _ _ O
Operating _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
East _ _ O
Village _ _ O
since _ _ O
May, _ _ O
Hunan _ _ O
Slurp _ _ O
lives _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
both _ _ O
halves _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
name. _ _ O
When _ _ O
people _ _ O
in _ _ O
Hunan _ _ O
get _ _ O
hungry _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
noodles, _ _ O
what _ _ O
they _ _ O
have _ _ O
in _ _ O
mind _ _ O
are _ _ O
mifen: _ _ O
long, _ _ O
white _ _ O
strands _ _ O
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
pounded _ _ O
rice, _ _ O
so _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
they _ _ O
may _ _ O
slither _ _ O
right _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
chopsticks _ _ O
of _ _ O
inexperienced _ _ O
slurpers. _ _ O
Chances _ _ O
for _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
to _ _ O
practice _ _ O
their _ _ O
antiskid _ _ O
chopstick _ _ O
techniques _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
limited, _ _ O
generally _ _ O
speaking, _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
rice _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
of _ _ O
other _ _ O
parts _ _ O
of _ _ O
Asia. _ _ O
When _ _ O
you _ _ O
could _ _ O
find _ _ O
Hunanese _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
around _ _ O
town, _ _ O
they _ _ O
tended _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
tucked _ _ O
away _ _ O
on _ _ O
larger _ _ O
menus _ _ O
with _ _ O
so _ _ O
many _ _ O
other _ _ O
Hunanese _ _ O
opportunities _ _ O
that _ _ O
they _ _ O
were _ _ O
rarely _ _ O
given _ _ O
a _ _ O
chance _ _ O
to _ _ O
slither. _ _ O
Hunan _ _ O
Slurp _ _ O
offers _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
those _ _ O
opportunities, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chef _ _ O
and _ _ O
proprietor, _ _ O
Chao _ _ O
Wang, _ _ O
comes _ _ O
from _ _ O
Hunan's _ _ O
second-largest _ _ O
city, _ _ O
Hengyang, _ _ O
and _ _ O
fills _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
with _ _ O
both _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
Hunanese _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
and _ _ O
his _ _ O
own _ _ O
innovations. _ _ O
But _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
heart _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
[Read _ _ O

of _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
new _ _ O

New _ _ O

City _ _ O
(for _ _ O
now).] _ _ O
They _ _ O
peek _ _ O
out _ _ O
from _ _ O
underneath _ _ O
slices _ _ O
of _ _ O
beef, _ _ O
tofu _ _ O
and _ _ O
barbecued _ _ O
pork, _ _ O
all _ _ O
fanned _ _ O
out _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
hand _ _ O
of _ _ O
poker, _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
soup-less _ _ O
wonder _ _ O
called _ _ O
Hometown _ _ O
Lu _ _ O
Fen. _ _ O
The _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
is _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
bottom _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
bowl, _ _ O
and _ _ O
should _ _ O
absolutely _ _ O
be _ _ O
augmented _ _ O
with _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
red _ _ O
chiles _ _ O
in _ _ O
oil _ _ O
served _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
dish _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
side. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
string _ _ O
bean _ _ O
mifen, _ _ O
the _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
weave _ _ O
around _ _ O
a _ _ O
fried _ _ O
egg _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
scattering _ _ O
of _ _ O
ground _ _ O
Berkshire _ _ O
pork, _ _ O
stir-fried _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
crackle _ _ O
with _ _ O
little _ _ O
rounds _ _ O
of _ _ O
sliced, _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
green _ _ O
beans. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
slick _ _ O
of _ _ O
chile _ _ O
oil _ _ O
on _ _ O
top, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
pale _ _ O
broth _ _ O
looks _ _ O
harmless _ _ O
enough, _ _ O
but _ _ O
once _ _ O
the _ _ O
soup _ _ O
is _ _ O
stirred _ _ O
together _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
take _ _ O
the _ _ O
crease _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
pair _ _ O
of _ _ O
newly _ _ O
pressed _ _ O
trousers. _ _ O
A _ _ O
little _ _ O
red _ _ O
sheaf _ _ O
of _ _ O
dried _ _ O
chile _ _ O
threads _ _ O
bobbing _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
wild _ _ O
pepper _ _ O
and _ _ O
beef _ _ O
soup _ _ O
gives _ _ O
you _ _ O
an _ _ O
idea _ _ O
what _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
in _ _ O
for, _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
name _ _ O
hasn't _ _ O
already _ _ O
given _ _ O
away _ _ O
the _ _ O
game. _ _ O
But _ _ O
with _ _ O
Hunan _ _ O
Slurp's _ _ O
noodles, _ _ O
as _ _ O
with _ _ O
Hunanese _ _ O
food _ _ O
generally, _ _ O
heat _ _ O
is _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
message; _ _ O
it's _ _ O
never _ _ O
the _ _ O
medium. _ _ O
Stock _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
cook _ _ O
what _ _ O
pitch _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
opera _ _ O
singer, _ _ O
goes _ _ O
a _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
proverb. _ _ O
Hunan _ _ O
Slurp's _ _ O
soup _ _ O
stocks _ _ O
are _ _ O
rounded _ _ O
and _ _ O
cloudy _ _ O
from _ _ O
long-boiled _ _ O
bones _ _ O
and _ _ O
meat, _ _ O
and _ _ O
they _ _ O
tend _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
better _ _ O
the _ _ O
longer _ _ O
they _ _ O
linger _ _ O
with _ _ O
their _ _ O
toppings. _ _ O
(So _ _ O
do _ _ O
the _ _ O
noodles.) _ _ O
A _ _ O
master _ _ O
class _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
art _ _ O
of _ _ O
broth _ _ O
subtlety _ _ O
is _ _ O
provided _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
two-part _ _ O
soup _ _ O
that _ _ O
goes _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
under-promising _ _ O
name _ _ O
fish _ _ O
fillet _ _ O
mifen. _ _ O
Part _ _ O
One _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
oversize _ _ O
ceramic _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
milky _ _ O
white _ _ O
pork-and-fish _ _ O
stock _ _ O
strewn _ _ O
with _ _ O
flower _ _ O
petals, _ _ O
pea _ _ O
shoots, _ _ O
purple _ _ O
basil _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
herbs. _ _ O
It _ _ O
arrives _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
wooden _ _ O
tray _ _ O
next _ _ O
to _ _ O
Part _ _ O
Two, _ _ O
the _ _ O
noodles, _ _ O
which _ _ O
get _ _ O
their _ _ O
own _ _ O
bowl. _ _ O
The _ _ O
broth's _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
was _ _ O
elusive _ _ O
at _ _ O
first, _ _ O
more _ _ O
a _ _ O
texture _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
taste. _ _ O
Within _ _ O
minutes _ _ O
the _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
fish _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
broth, _ _ O
together _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
herbs, _ _ O
had _ _ O
transformed _ _ O
it _ _ O
into _ _ O
something _ _ O
splendid. _ _ O
Like _ _ O
many _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
new _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
that _ _ O
have _ _ O
sprouted _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
East _ _ O
Village, _ _ O
Hunan _ _ O
Slurp _ _ O
pays _ _ O
attention _ _ O
to _ _ O
appearances. _ _ O
Under _ _ O
a _ _ O
backlighted _ _ O
logo _ _ O
that _ _ O
spells _ _ O
out _ _ O
SLURP _ _ O
in _ _ O
elongated, _ _ O
noodly _ _ O
letters, _ _ O
a _ _ O
sheet _ _ O
of _ _ O

on _ _ O
First _ _ O

the _ _ O
long, _ _ O
tunneled _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room, _ _ O
designed _ _ O
by _ _ O

. _ _ O
The _ _ O
interior _ _ O
is _ _ O
sheathed _ _ O
in _ _ O
wooden _ _ O
slats _ _ O
that _ _ O
run _ _ O
up _ _ O
one _ _ O
wall, _ _ O

their _ _ O
way _ _ O
across _ _ O
the _ _ O
ceiling _ _ O
and _ _ O
fall _ _ O
down _ _ O
the _ _ O
opposite _ _ O
wall. _ _ O
Depending _ _ O
on _ _ O
your _ _ O
frame _ _ O
of _ _ O
mind, _ _ O
eating _ _ O
at _ _ O
Hunan _ _ O
Slurp _ _ O
can _ _ O
feel _ _ O
like _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
rack _ _ O
of _ _ O
drying _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
or _ _ O
finding _ _ O
yourself _ _ O
inside _ _ O
the _ _ O
belly _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
tidy _ _ O
whale. _ _ O
A _ _ O
glassed-in _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
lies _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
back, _ _ O
its _ _ O
shelves _ _ O
stacked _ _ O
with _ _ O
colorfully _ _ O
glazed _ _ O
modern _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
plates _ _ O
and _ _ O
bowls _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
won't _ _ O
find _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant-supply _ _ O
shops _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
Bowery. _ _ O
Once _ _ O
you _ _ O
leave _ _ O
the _ _ O
noodle _ _ O
section _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
behind, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
possible _ _ O
to _ _ O
find _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
that _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
necessarily _ _ O
live _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
standard _ _ O
set _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
crockery. _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
told _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
bands _ _ O
of _ _ O
cumin-seasoned _ _ O
beef _ _ O
speared _ _ O
with _ _ O
toothpicks _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
and _ _ O
well-browned, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
ones _ _ O
I _ _ O
got _ _ O
were _ _ O
gray _ _ O
and _ _ O
floppy. _ _ O
And _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweet-and-sour _ _ O
spareribs, _ _ O
an _ _ O
appetizer, _ _ O
were _ _ O
far _ _ O
more _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
than _ _ O
sour, _ _ O
and _ _ O
tough, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
On _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
available _ _ O
evidence, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Wang's _ _ O
palate _ _ O
skews _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
sweet. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
unusual _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
Hunanese _ _ O
kitchen, _ _ O
but _ _ O
only _ _ O
those _ _ O
spareribs _ _ O
were _ _ O
off-puttingly _ _ O
sugary. _ _ O
A _ _ O
multicolored _ _ O
salad _ _ O
of _ _ O
chilled _ _ O
cherry _ _ O
tomatoes _ _ O
was _ _ O
bright _ _ O
and _ _ O
refreshing _ _ O
despite _ _ O
a _ _ O
fruity _ _ O
marination _ _ O
in _ _ O
plum _ _ O
juice. _ _ O
(A _ _ O
similar _ _ O
dish _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
turns _ _ O
up _ _ O
at _ _ O
Hao _ _ O
Noodle _ _ O
and _ _ O
Tea _ _ O
by _ _ O
Madam _ _ O
Zhu's _ _ O
Kitchen _ _ O
, _ _ O
where _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
sweeter, _ _ O
and _ _ O
still _ _ O
very _ _ O
enjoyable.) _ _ O
And _ _ O
the _ _ O
hint _ _ O
of _ _ O
sugar _ _ O
in _ _ O
stir-fried _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
did _ _ O
not _ _ O
soften _ _ O
the _ _ O
toothy _ _ O
bite _ _ O
of _ _ O
young _ _ O
ginger, _ _ O
or _ _ O
hide _ _ O
the _ _ O
ginger's _ _ O
natural _ _ O
sweetness, _ _ O
either. _ _ O
You _ _ O
may _ _ O
not _ _ O
notice _ _ O
the _ _ O
bias _ _ O
toward _ _ O
sweetness _ _ O
anyway, _ _ O
given _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen's _ _ O
open _ _ O
embrace _ _ O
of _ _ O
chiles. _ _ O
An _ _ O
electrical _ _ O
current _ _ O
of _ _ O
heat _ _ O
crackles _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
dim-sum-style _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
feet, _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
until _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
falling-off-the-toe _ _ O
tender. _ _ O
Bright _ _ O
green _ _ O
chiles _ _ O
animate _ _ O
a _ _ O
stir-fry _ _ O
of _ _ O
julienne _ _ O
potatoes, _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
so _ _ O
fast _ _ O
they're _ _ O
still _ _ O
stiff. _ _ O
They _ _ O
also _ _ O
bring _ _ O
not _ _ O
just _ _ O
spice _ _ O
but _ _ O
crunch _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
classic _ _ O
Hunanese _ _ O
sauté _ _ O
of _ _ O
pork _ _ O
and _ _ O
garlic _ _ O
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
an _ _ O
egg _ _ O
fried _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
ruffled, _ _ O
golden _ _ O
crisp. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chiles _ _ O
knocked _ _ O
around _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
very _ _ O
hot _ _ O
wok _ _ O
with _ _ O
sweet, _ _ O
juicy _ _ O
cabbage _ _ O
are _ _ O
small, _ _ O
red, _ _ O
sun-dried _ _ O
and _ _ O
noticeably _ _ O
fruity _ _ O
under _ _ O
their _ _ O
mouth-zapping _ _ O
heat. _ _ O
The _ _ O
spice _ _ O
level _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
subdued _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
excellent _ _ O
stir-fry _ _ O
of _ _ O
pork _ _ O
and _ _ O
smoked _ _ O
tofu, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it's _ _ O
almost _ _ O
undetectable _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
very _ _ O
likable _ _ O
preparation _ _ O
of _ _ O
skinny _ _ O
eggplant _ _ O
sections _ _ O
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
discs _ _ O
of _ _ O
bell _ _ O
pepper; _ _ O
the _ _ O
skins _ _ O
are _ _ O
left _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
eggplants, _ _ O
which _ _ O
gives _ _ O
the _ _ O
appetizer _ _ O
something _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
appearance _ _ O
of _ _ O
tuna _ _ O
maki _ _ O
wrapped _ _ O
with _ _ O
purple _ _ O
seaweed. _ _ O
Meals _ _ O
tend _ _ O
to _ _ O
move _ _ O
quickly. _ _ O
For _ _ O
this _ _ O
you _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
thankful _ _ O
on _ _ O
busy _ _ O
nights _ _ O
when _ _ O
those _ _ O
wood _ _ O
slats _ _ O
go _ _ O
from _ _ O
attractive _ _ O
design _ _ O
elements _ _ O
to _ _ O
unnervingly _ _ O
effective _ _ O
sounding _ _ O
boards. _ _ O
As _ _ O
in _ _ O
other _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
neighborhood, _ _ O
the _ _ O
crowd _ _ O
tends _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
young, _ _ O
bright, _ _ O
quick _ _ O
and _ _ O
eager _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
on _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
rest _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
evening. _ _ O
As _ _ O
the _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
rush _ _ O
ends, _ _ O
the _ _ O
howl _ _ O
subsides. _ _ O
Maybe _ _ O
ice _ _ O
cream _ _ O
is _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
agenda, _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
classic _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
soup _ _ O
of _ _ O
mung _ _ O
beans _ _ O
and _ _ O
barley _ _ O
in _ _ O
syrup. _ _ O
Or _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
a _ _ O
pot _ _ O
of _ _ O
tea, _ _ O
loose-leaf, _ _ O
brewed _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
while _ _ O
you _ _ O
think _ _ O
about _ _ O
chiles _ _ O
and _ _ O
rice _ _ O
and _ _ O
pork _ _ O
and _ _ O
wonder _ _ O
how _ _ O
many _ _ O
more _ _ O
Hunanese _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
persuaded _ _ O
to _ _ O
settle _ _ O
down _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ O
York. _ _ O

During _ _ O
the _ _ O
five _ _ O
years _ _ O
Village _ _ B-EST
Cafe _ _ I-EST
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
open, _ _ O
I _ _ O
must _ _ O
have _ _ O
driven _ _ O
the _ _ O
length _ _ O
of _ _ O
Coney _ _ B-LOC
Island _ _ I-LOC
Avenue _ _ I-LOC
in _ _ O
Brooklyn _ _ B-LOC
a _ _ O
dozen _ _ O
times _ _ O
without _ _ O
noticing _ _ O
it. _ _ O
At _ _ O
best _ _ O
I _ _ O
might _ _ O
have _ _ O
spotted _ _ O
the _ _ O
tiny _ _ O
parking _ _ O
lot _ _ O
in _ _ O
Midwood, _ _ B-LOC
with _ _ O
tattered _ _ O
red, _ _ O
blue _ _ O
and _ _ O
silver _ _ O
streamers _ _ O
flapping _ _ O
over _ _ O
its _ _ O
10 _ _ O
or _ _ O
so _ _ O
spaces, _ _ O
giving _ _ O
it _ _ O
the _ _ O
appearance _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
world's _ _ O
smallest _ _ O
used-car _ _ O
dealership. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
back _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
wide, _ _ O
single-story _ _ O
structure _ _ O
that _ _ O
looks _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
trailer _ _ O
office _ _ O
where _ _ O
you _ _ O
would _ _ O
sit _ _ O
down _ _ O
to _ _ O
discuss _ _ O
loan _ _ O
options _ _ O
with _ _ O
Marty _ _ O
from _ _ O
financing. _ _ O
But _ _ O
that _ _ O
building _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
Azerbaijani _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
stands _ _ O
out _ _ O
among _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
outposts _ _ O
of _ _ O
former _ _ O
Soviet _ _ B-LOC
republics _ _ I-LOC
that _ _ O
stretch _ _ O
north _ _ O
from _ _ O
Brighton _ _ B-LOC
Beach, _ _ I-LOC
and _ _ O
each _ _ O
time _ _ O
I've _ _ O
gone _ _ O
inside _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
given _ _ O
not _ _ O
a _ _ O
credit _ _ O
check, _ _ O
but _ _ O
a _ _ O
test _ _ O
of _ _ O
my _ _ O
appetite's _ _ O
limits. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
just _ _ O
because _ _ O
almost _ _ O
every _ _ O
platter _ _ O
of _ _ O
food _ _ O
that _ _ O
leaves _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
at _ _ O
Village _ _ B-EST
Cafe _ _ I-EST
seems _ _ O
intended _ _ O
to _ _ O
feed _ _ O
an _ _ O
actual _ _ O
village. _ _ O
I _ _ O
run _ _ O
into _ _ O
trouble _ _ O
because _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
so _ _ O
many _ _ O
things _ _ O
I _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
order _ _ O
and _ _ O
so _ _ O
few _ _ O
things _ _ O
I _ _ O
am _ _ O
willing _ _ O
to _ _ O
leave _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
meal _ _ O
winds _ _ O
down. _ _ O
There _ _ O
will _ _ O
never _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
time _ _ O
when _ _ O
I _ _ O
go _ _ O
to _ _ O
Village _ _ B-EST
Cafe _ _ I-EST
and _ _ O
decide _ _ O
not _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
one _ _ O
qutab, _ _ B-DISH
if _ _ O
not _ _ O
all _ _ O
three. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu _ _ O
gives _ _ O
the _ _ O
name _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
delicate _ _ O
Azerbaijani _ _ B-CUISINE
flatbread, _ _ B-FOOD
the _ _ O
diameter _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
pita _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
thinner, _ _ O
as _ _ O
kutaby. _ _ B-FOOD
Either _ _ O
way, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
very _ _ O
good _ _ O
when _ _ O
stuffed _ _ O
with _ _ O
minced, _ _ B-FOOD
quietly _ _ I-FOOD
spiced _ _ I-FOOD
chicken _ _ I-FOOD
or _ _ O
lamb. _ _ B-FOOD
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
exceptional _ _ O
when _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
greens: _ _ B-FOOD
spinach, _ _ B-FOOD
scallions, _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
dill _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
cilantro, _ _ O
two _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
herbs _ _ O
that _ _ O
turn _ _ O
up _ _ O
again _ _ O
and _ _ O
again _ _ O
in _ _ O
Azerbaijani _ _ O
cooking. _ _ O
I _ _ O
will _ _ O
always _ _ O
want _ _ O
the _ _ O
crimped _ _ O
dumplings, _ _ O
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
and _ _ O
shape _ _ O
of _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
drumettes, _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
English _ _ O
menu _ _ O
calls _ _ O
ravioli _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
servers _ _ O
call _ _ O
pelmeni. _ _ O
Filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
or _ _ O
lamb, _ _ O
these _ _ O
dumplings _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
boiled, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
urge _ _ O
to _ _ O
ask _ _ O
for _ _ O
them _ _ O
fried _ _ O
is _ _ O
overwhelming, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
fried _ _ O
ones _ _ O
are _ _ O
better _ _ O
dunked _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
tomato-pepper _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
would _ _ O
call _ _ O
salsa _ _ O
if _ _ O
I _ _ O
were _ _ O
not _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
Azerbaijani _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
There _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
liver _ _ O
on _ _ O
my _ _ O
table, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
Maybe _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
Turkish _ _ O
style, _ _ O
little _ _ O
fried _ _ O
cubes _ _ O
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
tart _ _ O
purple _ _ O
dusting _ _ O
of _ _ O
ground _ _ O
sumac. _ _ O
Or _ _ O
the _ _ O
liver _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
added _ _ O
to _ _ O
bits _ _ O
of _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
hearts, _ _ O
kidney _ _ O
and _ _ O
testicles, _ _ O
and _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
with _ _ O
onions _ _ O
and _ _ O
potato _ _ O
cubes _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
fantastically _ _ O
oily _ _ O
hash _ _ O
called _ _ O
djiz _ _ O
biz. _ _ O
Whether _ _ O
I _ _ O
will _ _ O
eat _ _ O
guru _ _ O
hingal _ _ O
will _ _ O
depend _ _ O
on _ _ O
how _ _ O
far _ _ O
in _ _ O
advance _ _ O
I've _ _ O
planned _ _ O
my _ _ O
meal, _ _ O
because _ _ O
it _ _ O
generally _ _ O
has _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
ordered _ _ O
a _ _ O
day _ _ O
ahead. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
noodle _ _ O
dish: _ _ O
very _ _ O
thin, _ _ O
wide _ _ O
sheets _ _ O
of _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
of _ _ O
onions _ _ O
and _ _ O
ground _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
fried _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
own _ _ O
fat _ _ O
until _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
magnificently _ _ O
crunchy. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
poured _ _ O
chile _ _ O
oil _ _ O
over _ _ O
guru _ _ O
hingal, _ _ O
it _ _ O
would _ _ O
taste _ _ O
Sichuanese; _ _ O
stew _ _ O
the _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
with _ _ O
tomatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
you _ _ O
could _ _ O
mistake _ _ O
the _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
for _ _ O
Bolognese. _ _ O
But _ _ O
it's _ _ O
from _ _ O
Azerbaijan, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it's _ _ O
good _ _ O
with _ _ O
yogurt. _ _ O
And _ _ O
I _ _ O
will _ _ O
have _ _ O
soup, _ _ O
even _ _ O
if _ _ O
nobody _ _ O
else _ _ O
does, _ _ O
because _ _ O
Village _ _ O
Cafe's _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
understands _ _ O
how _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
it. _ _ O
The _ _ O
kufta-bozbash _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
strong, _ _ O
well-skimmed _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
broth _ _ O
with _ _ O
chickpeas _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
single, _ _ O
tender _ _ O
lamb-rice _ _ O
meatball, _ _ O
as _ _ O
big _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
apple. _ _ O
The _ _ O
broth _ _ O
for _ _ O
dushbara _ _ O
soup _ _ O
is _ _ O
similar, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
ballast _ _ O
is _ _ O
provided _ _ O
by _ _ O
miniature _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
dumplings _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
of _ _ O
M&Ms. _ _ O
Cilantro _ _ O
and _ _ O
dried _ _ O
mint _ _ O
are _ _ O
added _ _ O
to _ _ O
both _ _ O
soups _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
minute, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
mint _ _ O
is _ _ O
especially _ _ O
helpful. _ _ O
Village _ _ O
Cafe's _ _ O
hot _ _ O
borscht, _ _ O
strong _ _ O
and _ _ O
decidedly _ _ O
unvegetarian, _ _ O
outperforms _ _ O
some _ _ O
I've _ _ O
had _ _ O
in _ _ O
Brighton _ _ O
Beach. _ _ O
Instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
sour _ _ O
cream, _ _ O
it _ _ O
comes _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
spoonful _ _ O
of _ _ O
yogurt. _ _ O
The _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
of _ _ O
Azerbaijan _ _ O
often _ _ O
echoes _ _ O
those _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
neighbors _ _ O
Georgia, _ _ O
Armenia _ _ O
and _ _ O
Iran, _ _ O
but _ _ O
other _ _ O
dishes, _ _ O
like _ _ O
borscht, _ _ O
were _ _ O
hauled _ _ O
down _ _ O
from _ _ O
Eastern _ _ O
Europe _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
strong _ _ O
arms _ _ O
of _ _ O
Mother _ _ O
Russia. _ _ O
We _ _ O
can _ _ O
also _ _ O
thank _ _ O
Russia _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
insane _ _ O
music _ _ O
videos _ _ O
that _ _ O
play _ _ O
on _ _ O
Village _ _ O
Cafe's _ _ O
two _ _ O
televisions, _ _ O
typically _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
volume _ _ O
off _ _ O
while _ _ O
American _ _ O
pop _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
'80s _ _ O
plays _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
sound _ _ O
system. _ _ O
You _ _ O
sit _ _ O
at _ _ O
what _ _ O
appear _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
varnished _ _ O
picnic _ _ O
tables _ _ O
with _ _ O
chairs _ _ O
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
benches. _ _ O
The _ _ O
rest _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
décor _ _ O
looks _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
Brighton _ _ O
Beach _ _ O
yard _ _ O
sale: _ _ O
a _ _ O
mushroom _ _ O
cookie _ _ O
jar, _ _ O
an _ _ O
embroidered _ _ O
peasant _ _ O
smock, _ _ O
a _ _ O
camouflage _ _ O
cap, _ _ O
a _ _ O
samovar _ _ O
or _ _ O
two, _ _ O
a _ _ O
collection _ _ O
of _ _ O
beaded _ _ O
handbags, _ _ O
several _ _ O
ceramic _ _ O
cows, _ _ O
three _ _ O
statues _ _ O
of _ _ O
fat _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
with _ _ O
toques _ _ O
and _ _ O
mustaches, _ _ O
and _ _ O
two _ _ O
giant _ _ O
forks _ _ O
mounted _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
wall. _ _ O
For _ _ O
atmosphere, _ _ O
Village _ _ O
Cafe _ _ O
is _ _ O
roundly _ _ O
beaten _ _ O
by _ _ O
my _ _ O
second-favorite _ _ O
Azerbaijani _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
Brooklyn, _ _ O
Old _ _ O
Baku _ _ O
in _ _ O
Kensington. _ _ O
Walk _ _ O
past _ _ O
the _ _ O
awning _ _ O
that _ _ O
says _ _ O
"private _ _ O
club," _ _ O
past _ _ O
the _ _ O
curtained _ _ O
booths _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
front _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room, _ _ O
past _ _ O
the _ _ O
open _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
where _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
scoop _ _ O
burning _ _ O
coals _ _ O
to _ _ O
keep _ _ O
the _ _ O
fire _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
kebabs _ _ O
going _ _ O
strong, _ _ O
and _ _ O
you _ _ O
enter _ _ O
a _ _ O
courtyard _ _ O
from _ _ O
another _ _ O
country. _ _ O
Almost _ _ O
everybody _ _ O
at _ _ O
Old _ _ O
Baku _ _ O
is _ _ O
smoking _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
arbor _ _ O
of _ _ O
grape _ _ O
vines _ _ O
that _ _ O
weave _ _ O
around _ _ O
strings _ _ O
of _ _ O
white _ _ O
lights. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
go _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
fall, _ _ O
you _ _ O
might _ _ O
be _ _ O
brought _ _ O
a _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
purple _ _ O
grapes, _ _ O
newly _ _ O
picked _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
feet _ _ O
away. _ _ O
But _ _ O
Village _ _ O
Cafe _ _ O
gains _ _ O
its _ _ O
edge _ _ O
on _ _ O
Old _ _ O
Baku _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen. _ _ O
The _ _ O
stewed _ _ O
fruit _ _ O
ladled _ _ O
over _ _ O
saffron _ _ O
rice _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
plov, _ _ O
for _ _ O
instance, _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
richer _ _ O
and _ _ O
more _ _ O
varied _ _ O
compilation _ _ O
of _ _ O
dried _ _ O
plums, _ _ O
apricots, _ _ O
chestnuts _ _ O
and _ _ O
deeply _ _ O
browned _ _ O
lamb. _ _ O
The _ _ O
salads _ _ O
are _ _ O
brighter, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
get _ _ O
over _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
names. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu _ _ O
was _ _ O
evidently _ _ O
written _ _ O
by _ _ O
someone _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
weakness _ _ O
for _ _ O
poetry, _ _ O
so _ _ O
the _ _ O
salads _ _ O
are _ _ O
called _ _ O
things _ _ O
like _ _ O
"Journey _ _ O
to _ _ O
Baku," _ _ O
"Winter _ _ O
Fun" _ _ O
and _ _ O
"Unexpected _ _ O
Guests." _ _ O
The _ _ O
Journey _ _ O
to _ _ O
Baku _ _ O
is _ _ O
worth _ _ O
taking; _ _ O
it's _ _ O
a _ _ O
sharply _ _ O
seasoned, _ _ O
smoky _ _ O
eggplant _ _ O
mash _ _ O
with _ _ O
peppers _ _ O
and _ _ O
tomatoes. _ _ O
The _ _ O
kidney _ _ O
beans _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
lobio _ _ O
salad _ _ O
are _ _ O
creamy, _ _ O
salty _ _ O
and _ _ O
well-oiled _ _ O
under _ _ O
their _ _ O
topping _ _ O
of _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
walnuts _ _ O
and _ _ O
cilantro. _ _ O
Main _ _ O
course _ _ O
names _ _ O
incline _ _ O
toward _ _ O
the _ _ O
allusive _ _ O
as _ _ O
well, _ _ O
with _ _ O
one _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
cutlet _ _ O
called _ _ O
"Miracle _ _ O
of _ _ O
Village" _ _ O
and _ _ O
another _ _ O
-- _ _ O
buried _ _ O
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
white _ _ O
pillow _ _ O
of _ _ O
cheese _ _ O
and _ _ O
cream _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
-- _ _ O
that _ _ O
goes _ _ O
by _ _ O
"Mother _ _ O
In _ _ O
Laws _ _ O
Chicken." _ _ O
But _ _ O
really, _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
place _ _ O
to _ _ O
go _ _ O
once _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
amenities _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
polished _ _ O
off _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
kebabs. _ _ O
The _ _ O
quail _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
wizened. _ _ O
The _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
testicles _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
hint _ _ O
of _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
in _ _ O
their _ _ O
lightly _ _ O
browned _ _ O
surfaces _ _ O
will _ _ O
always _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
niche _ _ O
proposition. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
ribs, _ _ O
the _ _ O
marinated _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
chops _ _ O
known _ _ O
as _ _ O
chalahac _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
flatbread-wrapped _ _ O
Azerbaijani _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
kofte _ _ O
called _ _ O
lulya _ _ O
kebabs _ _ O
(made _ _ O
from _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
or _ _ O
lamb) _ _ O
are _ _ O
extremely _ _ O
good. _ _ O
The _ _ O
vegetable _ _ O
skewer _ _ O
choices _ _ O
begin _ _ O
and _ _ O
end _ _ O
with _ _ O
blistered _ _ O
tomatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
softly _ _ O
collapsing _ _ O
eggplant. _ _ O
Both _ _ O
are _ _ O
worthwhile. _ _ O
So _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
side _ _ O
dish _ _ O
called _ _ O
"homemade _ _ O
potatoes," _ _ O
if _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
any _ _ O
room _ _ O
left _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
table. _ _ O
Sliced _ _ O
and _ _ O
fried _ _ O
with _ _ O
onions, _ _ O
they _ _ O
narrowly _ _ O
beat _ _ O
out _ _ O
the _ _ O
pretty _ _ O
good _ _ O
fries. _ _ O
A _ _ O
cup _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
of _ _ O
strong _ _ O
dark _ _ O
tea _ _ O
will _ _ O
speed _ _ O
your _ _ O
recovery _ _ O
from _ _ O
this _ _ O
onslaught. _ _ O
Dessert _ _ O
may _ _ O
not. _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
something _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
said _ _ O
for _ _ O
trying _ _ O
a _ _ O
Napoleon _ _ O
made _ _ O
like _ _ O
baklava _ _ O

Shrinking _ _ O
modesty _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
normal _ _ O
attitude _ _ O
for _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O

The _ _ O

its _ _ O

Manhatta _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O

the _ _ O

floor _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O

It _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
least _ _ O
show-offy _ _ O
skyscraper _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
you've _ _ O
ever _ _ O
seen. _ _ O
The _ _ O
whole _ _ O
operation _ _ O
is _ _ O
very _ _ O
orderly _ _ O
and _ _ O
well _ _ O
behaved, _ _ O
apart _ _ O
from _ _ O
its _ _ O
refusal _ _ O
to _ _ O
spell _ _ O
its _ _ O
own _ _ O
name _ _ O
correctly. _ _ O
(The _ _ O

is _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
Lenni _ _ O

name _ _ O
Manahatta, _ _ B-LOC
or _ _ O
Mannahatta, _ _ B-LOC
meaning _ _ O
"island _ _ O

many _ _ O
hills," _ _ O
but _ _ O
without _ _ O
the _ _ O
second _ _ O
"a" _ _ O
the _ _ O
name _ _ O
just _ _ O
looks _ _ O
incomplete. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
child _ _ O
named _ _ O
Henr.) _ _ O
A _ _ O
dedicated _ _ O
door _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
corner _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
building's _ _ O
main _ _ O
entrance _ _ O
brings _ _ O
you _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
foyer _ _ O
that, _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O
sleek _ _ O
chairs _ _ O
and _ _ O
coffee _ _ O
tables, _ _ O
looks _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
lobby _ _ O
of _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
those _ _ O
1960s _ _ O
white-brick _ _ O
apartment _ _ O
buildings _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
East _ _ O
40s _ _ O
and _ _ O
50s. _ _ O
When _ _ O
you _ _ O
get _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
elevator _ _ O
-- _ _ O
it _ _ O
goes _ _ O
to _ _ O
just _ _ O
one _ _ O
floor, _ _ O
the _ _ O
top _ _ O
-- _ _ O
a _ _ O
short _ _ O
walk _ _ O
leads _ _ O
to _ _ O
another _ _ O
sparsely _ _ O
furnished _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
area, _ _ O
this _ _ O
one _ _ O
looking _ _ O
out _ _ O
the _ _ O
windows _ _ O
toward _ _ O
the _ _ O
harbor _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
Verrazzano-Narrows _ _ B-LOC
Bridge. _ _ I-LOC
When _ _ O
the _ _ O
lounge _ _ O
hasn't _ _ O
been _ _ O
rented _ _ O
out _ _ O
for _ _ O
parties _ _ O
and _ _ O
sealed _ _ O
off, _ _ O
it's _ _ O
busier _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
foyer _ _ O
downstairs, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
still _ _ O
appears _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
designed _ _ O
for _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
are _ _ O
waiting _ _ O
for _ _ O
their _ _ O
dates _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
back _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
restroom. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
direction _ _ O
are _ _ O
Manhatta's _ _ B-EST
bar, _ _ O
a _ _ O
longish _ _ O
counter _ _ O
whose _ _ O
seats _ _ O
face _ _ O
uptown, _ _ O
and _ _ O
its _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room, _ _ O
which _ _ O
looks _ _ O
both _ _ O
north _ _ O
and _ _ O
east _ _ O
toward _ _ O
Brooklyn. _ _ B-LOC
The _ _ O
color _ _ O
scheme, _ _ O
navy-blue _ _ O
leather _ _ O
and _ _ O
dark _ _ O
wood, _ _ O
might _ _ O
strike _ _ O
the _ _ O
Knickerbocker _ _ B-EST
Club _ _ I-EST
's _ _ I-EST
board _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
too _ _ O
conservative. _ _ O
An _ _ O
open _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
dropped _ _ O
down _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
middle _ _ O
of _ _ O
all _ _ O
this, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
overall _ _ O
design _ _ O
strategy _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
sit _ _ O
back _ _ O
and _ _ O
let _ _ O
the _ _ O
windows _ _ O
do _ _ O
the _ _ O
work. _ _ O
Danny _ _ O
Meyer, _ _ O
whose _ _ O
Union _ _ O
Square _ _ O
Hospitality _ _ O
Group _ _ O
runs _ _ O
Manhatta _ _ B-EST
through _ _ O
a _ _ O
management _ _ O
contract _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
building's _ _ O
owner, _ _ O
told _ _ O
The _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
Times _ _ O
last _ _ O
year _ _ O
that _ _ O
Manhatta _ _ B-EST
would _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
as _ _ O
flamboyant _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
typical _ _ O
top-floor _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
"Those _ _ O
kinds _ _ O
of _ _ O
places _ _ O
often _ _ O
do _ _ O
not _ _ O
live _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
expectations; _ _ O
they _ _ O
try _ _ O
too _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
live _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
view," _ _ O
he _ _ O
said. _ _ O
"I _ _ O
expect _ _ O
to _ _ O
conceive _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
ground-floor _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
place _ _ O
people _ _ O
might _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
visit _ _ O
regularly." _ _ O
You _ _ O
can't _ _ O
blame _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Meyer _ _ O
for _ _ O
not _ _ O
wanting _ _ O
to _ _ O
open _ _ O
a _ _ O
mediocre _ _ O
splashy _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
but _ _ O
Manhatta _ _ B-EST
flirts _ _ O
dangerously _ _ O
with _ _ O
being _ _ O
a _ _ O
mediocre _ _ O
unsplashy _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Jason _ _ O
Pfeifer, _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
quite _ _ O
let _ _ O
that _ _ O
happen. _ _ O
His _ _ O
French _ _ B-CUISINE
menu, _ _ O
grounded _ _ O
in _ _ O
seasonal _ _ O
flavors, _ _ O
is _ _ O
fairly _ _ O
priced _ _ O
at _ _ O
$78, _ _ O
including _ _ O
tip, _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
three-course _ _ O
prix _ _ O
fixe. _ _ O
A _ _ O
good _ _ O
amount _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
very _ _ O
likable, _ _ O
but _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
more _ _ O
spongy _ _ O
patches _ _ O
than _ _ O
there _ _ O
probably _ _ O
should _ _ O
be. _ _ O
At _ _ O
their _ _ O
best, _ _ O
Manhatta's _ _ B-EST
better _ _ O
appetizers _ _ O
and _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses _ _ O
are _ _ O
fleshed _ _ O
out _ _ O
with _ _ O
fruits _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
vegetables _ _ B-FOOD
so _ _ O
ripe _ _ O
and _ _ O
pristine _ _ O
they _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
come _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
Greenmarket _ _ O
stall _ _ O
that _ _ O
only _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Pfeifer _ _ O
can _ _ O
see. _ _ O
A _ _ O

salad _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
fluffy _ _ I-DISH
curds _ _ I-DISH
of _ _ I-DISH
feta _ _ I-DISH
was _ _ O
an _ _ O
exploration _ _ O
of _ _ O
melonic _ _ O
potential; _ _ O
each _ _ O
section _ _ O
of _ _ O
fruit _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
different, _ _ O
some _ _ O
infused _ _ O
with _ _ O
citrus, _ _ O
others _ _ O
dripping _ _ O
with _ _ O
unfiltered _ _ O
garden-patch _ _ O
sweetness, _ _ O
all _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
tangy _ _ O
with _ _ O
white _ _ O
balsamic _ _ O
vinegar. _ _ O
An _ _ O
admirably _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
brick _ _ O
of _ _ O
halibut _ _ O
was _ _ O
paired _ _ O
with _ _ O
bittersweet _ _ O
fennel _ _ O
bulbs _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
mustard _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
gentle _ _ O
but _ _ O
effective _ _ O
bite. _ _ O
Raw _ _ O

course _ _ O
of _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
were _ _ O
their _ _ O
charming _ _ O
selves, _ _ O
and _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
better _ _ O
for _ _ O
their _ _ O
slinky _ _ O
dressing _ _ O
of _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
jus. _ _ O
Sweet _ _ O
black _ _ O
figs _ _ O
stood _ _ O
in _ _ O
for _ _ O
apples _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
memorable _ _ O
little _ _ O
tarte _ _ O
Tatin _ _ O
garnished _ _ O
with _ _ O
raw _ _ O
pale-green _ _ O
figs. _ _ O

Gently _ _ O
marinated _ _ O
hen-of-the-woods _ _ O

counterpoint _ _ O

sheep _ _ O

But _ _ O
generous _ _ O
applications _ _ O
of _ _ O
produce _ _ O
don't _ _ O
always _ _ O
save _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
from _ _ O
seeming _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
safe, _ _ O
conservative _ _ O
and _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
dated. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Pfeifer, _ _ O
who _ _ O
spent _ _ O
eight _ _ O
years _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
at _ _ O
Maialino _ _ O
, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Meyer's _ _ O
Roman-inspired _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
is _ _ O
now _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
French _ _ O
food _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
post-nouvelle _ _ O
mode _ _ O
that _ _ O
Daniel _ _ O
Boulud _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
artfully _ _ O
fomenting _ _ O
for _ _ O
years. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Boulud _ _ O
has _ _ O
earned _ _ O
the _ _ O
right _ _ O
to _ _ O
keep _ _ O
working _ _ O
in _ _ O
that _ _ O
groove _ _ O
as _ _ O
long _ _ O
as _ _ O
he _ _ O
likes, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it's _ _ O
strange _ _ O
to _ _ O
find _ _ O
a _ _ O
young _ _ O
chef _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
new, _ _ O
high-profile _ _ O
destination _ _ O
doing _ _ O
it _ _ O
when _ _ O
others _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
are _ _ O
pushing _ _ O
ahead _ _ O
with _ _ O
contemporary _ _ O
interpretations _ _ O
of _ _ O
French _ _ O
cuisine. _ _ O
And _ _ O
when _ _ O
Manhatta _ _ O
turns _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
classics, _ _ O
its _ _ O
use _ _ O
of _ _ O
French _ _ O
idioms _ _ O
seems _ _ O
skin-deep _ _ O
compared _ _ O
with _ _ O
Laetitia _ _ O
Rouabah's _ _ O
light _ _ O
touch _ _ O
and _ _ O
sophisticated _ _ O
technique _ _ O
at _ _ O
Benoit _ _ O
, _ _ O
or _ _ O
Marie-Aude _ _ O
Rose's _ _ O
painstaking _ _ O
elevations _ _ O
of _ _ O
cafe _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
at _ _ O
La _ _ O
Mercerie _ _ O
, _ _ O
or _ _ O
Daniel _ _ O
Rose's _ _ O
intelligent, _ _ O
neoclassical _ _ O
excavations _ _ O
of _ _ O
silver-cloche _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
at _ _ O
Le _ _ O
Coucou _ _ O
. _ _ O
Where _ _ O
Le _ _ O
Coucou _ _ O
brought _ _ O
back _ _ O
quenelles _ _ O
as _ _ O
helium-light _ _ O
pike _ _ O
dumplings _ _ O
in _ _ O
dizzyingly _ _ O
rich _ _ O
lobster-brandy _ _ O
sauce, _ _ O
Manhatta _ _ O
turns _ _ O
them _ _ O
into _ _ O
quivering _ _ O
balls _ _ O
of _ _ O
pudding _ _ O
distantly _ _ O
scented _ _ O
with _ _ O
seafood. _ _ O
Of _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
ways _ _ O
a _ _ O
modern _ _ O
chef _ _ O
might _ _ O
grapple _ _ O
with _ _ O
cassoulet, _ _ O
the _ _ O
sublimely _ _ O
burly _ _ O
Languedocian _ _ O
assault _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
digestive _ _ O
system, _ _ O
upending _ _ O
it _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
and _ _ O
golden _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
paillard _ _ O
has _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
strangest. _ _ O
Manhatta _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
to _ _ O
update _ _ O
veal _ _ O
blanquette _ _ O
with _ _ O
meat _ _ O
that's _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
rather _ _ O
than _ _ O
stewed, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
is _ _ O
so _ _ O
blandly _ _ O
milky _ _ O
that _ _ O
it's _ _ O
hardly _ _ O
there. _ _ O
And _ _ O
while _ _ O
modern _ _ O
desserts _ _ O
can _ _ O
stray _ _ O
into _ _ O
savory _ _ O
territory _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
they _ _ O
did _ _ O
in _ _ O
Escoffier's _ _ O
day, _ _ O
a _ _ O
vanilla _ _ O
soufflé _ _ O
with _ _ O
butterscotch _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
probably _ _ O
shouldn't _ _ O
taste _ _ O
salty. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
was _ _ O
dispiriting, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
never _ _ O
got _ _ O
up _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
bad _ _ O
mood. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
grace _ _ O
notes _ _ O
throughout _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
dark, _ _ O
shiny _ _ O
little _ _ O
canelés _ _ O
that _ _ O
show _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
dessert. _ _ O
This _ _ O
being _ _ O
a _ _ O
Union _ _ O
Square _ _ O
Hospitality _ _ O
production, _ _ O
the _ _ O
servers _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
trained _ _ O
mind _ _ O
readers. _ _ O
A _ _ O
pair _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
mismatched _ _ O
binoculars _ _ O
scattered _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
materialized _ _ O
just _ _ O
when _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
trying _ _ O
to _ _ O
locate _ _ O
the _ _ O
clock _ _ O
tower _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Consolidated _ _ O
Edison _ _ O
Building; _ _ O
before _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
had _ _ O
a _ _ O
chance _ _ O
to _ _ O
point _ _ O
out _ _ O
a _ _ O
fruit _ _ O
fly _ _ O
in _ _ O
my _ _ O
wine _ _ O
(did _ _ O
it _ _ O
ride _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
me _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
elevator?) _ _ O
a _ _ O
sommelier _ _ O
spirited _ _ O
the _ _ O
glass _ _ O
away _ _ O
and _ _ O
brought _ _ O
a _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
one. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Meyer _ _ O
was _ _ O
probably _ _ O
right _ _ O
to _ _ O
take _ _ O
a _ _ O
dialed-down _ _ O
approach _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
top-floor _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
genre. _ _ O
It _ _ O
dates _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
more _ _ O
innocent _ _ O
age, _ _ O
when _ _ O
people _ _ O
could _ _ O
look _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
financial _ _ O
district's _ _ O
unblinking _ _ O
grids _ _ O
of _ _ O
lighted _ _ O
windows _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
bland _ _ O
face _ _ O
of _ _ O
high-stakes _ _ O
cheating _ _ O
that _ _ O
we've _ _ O
come _ _ O
to _ _ O
recognize _ _ O
from _ _ O
"Margin _ _ O
Call" _ _ O
and _ _ O
"Billions." _ _ O
At _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
financial _ _ O
crisis, _ _ O
Manhatta's _ _ O
building _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
headquarters _ _ O
of _ _ O
JPMorgan _ _ O
Chase _ _ O
-- _ _ O
a _ _ O
relatively _ _ O
minor _ _ O
player _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
three-card-monte _ _ O
game _ _ O
of _ _ O
mortgage-backed _ _ O
securities, _ _ O
but _ _ O
a _ _ O
player _ _ O
nonetheless. _ _ O
Ten _ _ O
years _ _ O
have _ _ O
gone _ _ O
by, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it's _ _ O
still _ _ O
too _ _ O
soon _ _ O
for _ _ O
revolving _ _ O
dance _ _ O
floors. _ _ O

the _ _ O
place _ _ O
to _ _ O
myself _ _ O
was _ _ O
unjust. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
year _ _ O
since _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Wilcox _ _ O
took _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
-- _ _ O
at _ _ O
first _ _ O
his _ _ O
work _ _ O
there _ _ O
was _ _ O
termed _ _ O
a _ _ O
residency _ _ O
or _ _ O
pop-up, _ _ O
but _ _ O
in _ _ O
June _ _ O
the _ _ O
owner, _ _ O
Idan _ _ O
Elkon, _ _ O
announced _ _ O
that _ _ O
he'd _ _ O
put _ _ O
a _ _ O
ring _ _ O
on _ _ O
it _ _ O
and _ _ O
made _ _ O
the _ _ O
arrangement _ _ O
permanent _ _ O
-- _ _ O
he _ _ O
has _ _ O
firmly _ _ O
placed _ _ O
it _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
top _ _ O
tier _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
city's _ _ O
Japanese _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurants. _ _ O
On _ _ O
the _ _ O
basis _ _ O
of _ _ O
sushi _ _ B-FOOD
alone, _ _ O
Shoji _ _ B-EST
has _ _ O
few _ _ O
plausible _ _ O
rivals, _ _ O
and _ _ O
for _ _ O
sushi _ _ B-FOOD
embedded _ _ O
within _ _ O
a _ _ O
longer, _ _ O
kaiseki-derived _ _ B-TYPE
menu, _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
no _ _ O
parallel. _ _ O
There _ _ O
should _ _ O
be _ _ O
no _ _ O
empty _ _ O
seats, _ _ O
no _ _ O
matter _ _ O
how _ _ O
many _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
are _ _ O
off _ _ O
lolling _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
beach. _ _ O
Taking _ _ O
a _ _ O
selfish _ _ O
view, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
I _ _ O
wasn't _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
unhappy _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
only _ _ O
customer. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Wilcox, _ _ O
who _ _ O
grew _ _ O
up _ _ O
in _ _ O
Virginia, _ _ B-LOC
cooked _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
kaiseki _ _ B-TYPE
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
Kyoto _ _ B-LOC
called _ _ O
Kikunoi _ _ O
for _ _ O
seven _ _ O
years _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
spent _ _ O
three _ _ O
more _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
traditionalist _ _ O
sushi _ _ B-TYPE
parlor _ _ I-TYPE
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Ginza _ _ B-LOC
district _ _ O
of _ _ O
Tokyo. _ _ B-LOC
You _ _ O
might _ _ O
think _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
equivalent _ _ O
of _ _ O
earning _ _ O
a _ _ O
master's _ _ O
degree _ _ O
followed _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
Ph.D. _ _ O
in _ _ O
Japanese _ _ B-CUISINE
cuisine, _ _ O
and _ _ O
one _ _ O
side _ _ O
benefit _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
meal _ _ O
across _ _ O
the _ _ O
counter _ _ O
from _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Wilcox _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
chance _ _ O
to _ _ O
hear _ _ O
what _ _ O
he _ _ O
learned _ _ O
studying _ _ O
abroad. _ _ O
Show _ _ O
some _ _ O
curiosity _ _ O
and _ _ O
you _ _ O
could _ _ O
get _ _ O
a _ _ O
short _ _ O
education _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
mineral-rich _ _ O
clay _ _ O
used _ _ O
by _ _ O
potters _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
town _ _ O
of _ _ O
Shigaraki, _ _ B-LOC
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
various _ _ O
aliases _ _ O
and _ _ O
false _ _ O
names _ _ O
under _ _ O
which _ _ O
a _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
delicious, _ _ O
pink-fleshed _ _ O
fish _ _ B-FOOD
known _ _ O
as _ _ O
akamutsu _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
Japan _ _ B-LOC
travels _ _ O
under _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
away _ _ O
from _ _ O
home. _ _ O
On _ _ O
this _ _ O
August _ _ O
night, _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
about _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
a _ _ O
two-hour _ _ O
schooling _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
pleasures _ _ O
of _ _ O
summer _ _ O
sushi. _ _ B-FOOD
Mr. _ _ O
Wilcox's _ _ O
opening _ _ O
move _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
squiggle _ _ O
of _ _ O
what _ _ O
looked _ _ O
like _ _ O
short, _ _ O
thick _ _ O
noodles _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
turned _ _ O
out _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
lengths _ _ O
of _ _ O
chilled _ _ O
eggplant; _ _ B-FOOD
Mr. _ _ O
Wilcox _ _ O
had _ _ O
given _ _ O
them _ _ O
a _ _ O
cool _ _ O
bath _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
light _ _ O
sauce _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
icy _ _ O
coils _ _ O
of _ _ O
somen _ _ B-FOOD
noodles _ _ I-FOOD
are _ _ O
dipped _ _ O
in _ _ O
summer. _ _ O
Laid _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
top _ _ O
were _ _ O
two _ _ O
tongues _ _ O
of _ _ O
bafun _ _ O
sea _ _ O
urchin, _ _ O
a _ _ O
species _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
ripe _ _ O
persimmon. _ _ O
With _ _ O
one _ _ O
dish, _ _ O
he _ _ O
had _ _ O
shooed _ _ O
away _ _ O
the _ _ O
heat _ _ O
outside, _ _ O
shown _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
uncanny _ _ O
harmony _ _ O
of _ _ O
urchin _ _ O
and _ _ O
eggplant, _ _ O
and _ _ O
introduced _ _ O
a _ _ O
minor _ _ O
theme _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
night, _ _ O
the _ _ O
summer _ _ O
urchin _ _ O
harvest _ _ O
in _ _ O
Japan. _ _ O
This _ _ O
overture _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
way, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Wilcox _ _ O
lifted _ _ O
what _ _ O
appeared _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
machete. _ _ O
This _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
hamo _ _ O
knife, _ _ O
a _ _ O
heavy _ _ O
swath _ _ O
of _ _ O
sharp _ _ O
steel _ _ O
that _ _ O
can _ _ O
reduce _ _ O
the _ _ O
daggertooth _ _ O
pike _ _ O
conger's _ _ O
dozens _ _ O
of _ _ O
tiny _ _ O
bones _ _ O
to _ _ O
edible _ _ O
smithereens; _ _ O
before _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
one _ _ O
was _ _ O
forged _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
19th _ _ O
century, _ _ O
he _ _ O
explained, _ _ O
the _ _ O
eel _ _ O
had _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
fully _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
and _ _ O
separated _ _ O
from _ _ O
its _ _ O
skeleton. _ _ O
This _ _ O
hamo _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
quickly _ _ O
scorched _ _ O
on _ _ O
one _ _ O
side _ _ O
and _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
lick _ _ O
of _ _ O
wasabi _ _ O
and _ _ O
puréed _ _ O
salt-cured _ _ O
plums _ _ O
thinned _ _ O
with _ _ O
dashi. _ _ O
Sashimi _ _ O
came _ _ O
next _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
form _ _ O
of _ _ O
shioko, _ _ O
or _ _ O
kanpachi _ _ O
caught _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
young _ _ O
and _ _ O
its _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
is _ _ O
leaner _ _ O
and _ _ O
softer _ _ O
than _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
get _ _ O
later _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
year. _ _ O
This _ _ O
was _ _ O
followed _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
local _ _ O
fish _ _ O
that _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
spring _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Wilcox _ _ O
had _ _ O
told _ _ O
me _ _ O
he _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
like, _ _ O
striped _ _ O
bass. _ _ O
He _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
working _ _ O
with _ _ O
it, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
salting _ _ O
it _ _ O
overnight _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
grilling _ _ O
it _ _ O
until _ _ O
the _ _ O
skin _ _ O
crackled. _ _ O
Now _ _ O
I _ _ O
don't _ _ O
want _ _ O
striped _ _ O
bass _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
any _ _ O
other _ _ O
way. _ _ O
After _ _ O
this _ _ O
was _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Wilcox's _ _ O
nod _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
kaiseki _ _ O
tradition _ _ O
known _ _ O
as _ _ O
takiawase, _ _ O
a _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
simmered _ _ O
vegetables _ _ O
and, _ _ O
in _ _ O
this _ _ O
case, _ _ O
seafood: _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
potato, _ _ O
some _ _ O
Japanese _ _ O
eggplant, _ _ O
a _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
pink _ _ O
ginger _ _ O
shoot _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
flavorful _ _ O
piece _ _ O
of _ _ O
octopus _ _ O
I _ _ O
have _ _ O
ever _ _ O
put _ _ O
in _ _ O
my _ _ O
mouth. _ _ O
After _ _ O
my _ _ O
first _ _ O
meal _ _ O
at _ _ O
Shoji _ _ O
I _ _ O
learned _ _ O
to _ _ O
hope _ _ O
that _ _ O
chawan _ _ O
mushi, _ _ O
a _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
steaming-hot _ _ O
tofu _ _ O
custard, _ _ O
was _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
In _ _ O
spring _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Wilcox _ _ O
made _ _ O
it _ _ O
with _ _ O
spot _ _ O
prawns, _ _ O
but _ _ O
tonight, _ _ O
in _ _ O
homage _ _ O
to _ _ O
clambake _ _ O
season, _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
serving _ _ O
lobster _ _ O
chawan _ _ O
mushi. _ _ O
To _ _ O
this _ _ O
point, _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
had _ _ O
faithfully _ _ O
followed _ _ O
kaiseki's _ _ O
ritualized _ _ O
sequence _ _ O
of _ _ O
courses _ _ O
and _ _ O
its _ _ O
stopwatch-precise _ _ O
attention _ _ O
to _ _ O
seasonality. _ _ O
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
about _ _ O
to _ _ O
veer _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
different _ _ O
direction, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
suggest _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Wilcox _ _ O
could _ _ O
open _ _ O
a _ _ O
kaiseki _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
would _ _ O
set _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
standard _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
city. _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
not _ _ O
sure _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
would _ _ O
support _ _ O
it, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
spectacular _ _ O
while _ _ O
it _ _ O
lasted. _ _ O
The _ _ O
different _ _ O
direction, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
was _ _ O
sushi. _ _ O
Accounting _ _ O
for _ _ O
just _ _ O
about _ _ O
half _ _ O
the _ _ O
Shoji _ _ O
menu, _ _ O
the _ _ O
sushi _ _ O
portion _ _ O
is _ _ O
briefer _ _ O
and _ _ O
offers _ _ O
less _ _ O
variety _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
full _ _ O
monty _ _ O
at, _ _ O
say, _ _ O
Sushi _ _ O
Amane _ _ O
or _ _ O
Ginza _ _ O
Sushi _ _ O
Onodera _ _ O
. _ _ O
But _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
not _ _ O
sure _ _ O
any _ _ O
competitor _ _ O
outflanks _ _ O
Shoji _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
it _ _ O
does _ _ O
serve, _ _ O
or _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
timeliness _ _ O
with _ _ O
which _ _ O
it _ _ O
serves _ _ O
up _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
the _ _ O
specimens _ _ O
most _ _ O
worth _ _ O
tracking _ _ O
down _ _ O
at _ _ O
any _ _ O
given _ _ O
moment. _ _ O
In _ _ O
spring, _ _ O
when _ _ O
bioluminescent _ _ O
firefly _ _ O
squid _ _ O
are _ _ O
spawning _ _ O
in _ _ O
Japanese _ _ O
bays, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Wilcox _ _ O
gets _ _ O
them. _ _ O
In _ _ O
August, _ _ O
when _ _ O
cuttlefish _ _ O
are _ _ O
thumbnail _ _ O
size, _ _ O
unbelievably _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
and _ _ O
as _ _ O
meltingly _ _ O
soft _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
thinnest _ _ O
sheet _ _ O
of _ _ O
nova _ _ O
at _ _ O
Russ _ _ O
& _ _ O
Daughters _ _ O
, _ _ O
he _ _ O
will _ _ O
lay _ _ O
three _ _ O
of _ _ O
those _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
single _ _ O
finger _ _ O
of _ _ O
rice. _ _ O
He _ _ O
tracks _ _ O
bluefin _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
caught _ _ O
from _ _ O
healthy _ _ O
stocks, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
o-toro _ _ O
from _ _ O
Ireland _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
served _ _ O
last _ _ O
spring _ _ O
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
so _ _ O
seductive _ _ O
it _ _ O
could _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
captioned _ _ O
"the _ _ O
guy _ _ O
she _ _ O
told _ _ O
you _ _ O
not _ _ O
to _ _ O
worry _ _ O
about." _ _ O
While _ _ O
in _ _ O
Japan, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Wilcox _ _ O
learned _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
ikura _ _ O
from _ _ O
sacs _ _ O
of _ _ O
salmon _ _ O
roe, _ _ O
a _ _ O
slow _ _ O
process _ _ O
that _ _ O
requires _ _ O
massaging _ _ O
the _ _ O
eggs _ _ O
apart _ _ O
by _ _ O
hand _ _ O
in _ _ O
many _ _ O
changes _ _ O
of _ _ O
water. _ _ O
Normally _ _ O
the _ _ O
roe _ _ O
is _ _ O
then _ _ O
heavily _ _ O
cured _ _ O
with _ _ O
sugar _ _ O
and _ _ O
salt, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
roe _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
serving _ _ O
last _ _ O
month _ _ O
was _ _ O
very _ _ O
lightly _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
before _ _ O
being _ _ O
spooned _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
shot _ _ O
glass _ _ O
and _ _ O
served _ _ O
as _ _ O
is _ _ O
-- _ _ O
sticky, _ _ O
fatty, _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
and _ _ O
fresh. _ _ O
After _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
piece _ _ O
of _ _ O
fish, _ _ O
the _ _ O
kaiseki _ _ O
format _ _ O
kicks _ _ O
in _ _ O
again _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
soup, _ _ O
which _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
as _ _ O
simple _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
classic _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
miso _ _ O
or _ _ O
may _ _ O
break _ _ O
with _ _ O
tradition, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
extraordinary _ _ O
corn _ _ O
soup _ _ O
I _ _ O
ate _ _ O
in _ _ O
August. _ _ O
There _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
something _ _ O
cold _ _ O
and _ _ O
refreshing, _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
a _ _ O
granita _ _ O
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
ginger _ _ O
or _ _ O
matcha, _ _ O
and _ _ O
finally _ _ O
a _ _ O
more _ _ O
substantial _ _ O
dessert. _ _ O
Sometimes _ _ O
this _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
sort _ _ O
of _ _ O
tart _ _ O
with _ _ O
seasonal _ _ O
fruit _ _ O
-- _ _ O
candied _ _ O
kumquats, _ _ O
maybe, _ _ O
or _ _ O
white _ _ O
peaches _ _ O
and _ _ O
blueberries _ _ O
-- _ _ O
arranged _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
mochi _ _ O
wafer _ _ O
called _ _ O
monaka. _ _ O
For _ _ O
all _ _ O
this _ _ O
the _ _ O
charge _ _ O
is _ _ O
$252, _ _ O
service _ _ O
included. _ _ O
A _ _ O
shorter _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
available _ _ O
at _ _ O
$190, _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
longer _ _ O
one _ _ O
at _ _ O
$295, _ _ O
again _ _ O
with _ _ O
service _ _ O
included. _ _ O
That _ _ O
service _ _ O
is _ _ O
somewhat _ _ O
minimal; _ _ O
lately _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
meant _ _ O
a _ _ O
single _ _ O
employee _ _ O
assiduously _ _ O
refilling _ _ O
water _ _ O
glasses _ _ O
and _ _ O
taking _ _ O
orders _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
drinks _ _ O
list _ _ O
whose _ _ O
cheapest _ _ O
item _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
$12 _ _ O
bottle _ _ O
of _ _ O
beer. _ _ O
Could _ _ O
my _ _ O
server _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
more _ _ O
adept _ _ O
at _ _ O
deciphering _ _ O
the _ _ O
wines, _ _ O
sakes, _ _ O
shochus _ _ O
and _ _ O
Haitian _ _ O
rums _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Elkon _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Wilcox _ _ O
have _ _ O
put _ _ O
together? _ _ O
Perhaps, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
wouldn't _ _ O
necessarily _ _ O
want _ _ O
the _ _ O
scene _ _ O
cluttered _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
sommelier _ _ O
in _ _ O
full _ _ O
pocket-square-and-cuff-links _ _ O
regalia. _ _ O
More _ _ O
employees _ _ O
hovering _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
counter _ _ O
might _ _ O
take _ _ O
away _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O

in _ _ O
their _ _ O

we _ _ O
would _ _ O
have _ _ O
exhibitions _ _ O
of _ _ O
coffee _ _ O
and _ _ O

pulling _ _ O

the _ _ O
art _ _ O
of _ _ O

coaxing _ _ O
the _ _ O

it _ _ O

founded _ _ O

three _ _ O

a _ _ O
homage _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
coffee _ _ O
and _ _ O
tea _ _ O

of _ _ O
Malaysia, _ _ O
where _ _ O
she _ _ O
grew _ _ O
up. _ _ O
A _ _ O
typical _ _ O
Malaysian _ _ O
kopitiam _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
ramshackle _ _ O
hangout _ _ O
where _ _ O
people _ _ O
drop _ _ O
in _ _ O
to _ _ O
read _ _ O
the _ _ O
morning _ _ O
paper, _ _ O
grab _ _ O
breakfast, _ _ O
catch _ _ O
up _ _ O
on _ _ O
neighborhood _ _ O
gossip _ _ O
and _ _ O
do _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
things _ _ O
that _ _ O
classically _ _ O
accompany _ _ O
a _ _ O
cup _ _ O
of _ _ O
tea _ _ O
or _ _ O
coffee. _ _ O
Something _ _ O
of _ _ O
that _ _ O
spirit _ _ O
pervades _ _ O
Kopitiam, _ _ O
too. _ _ O

The _ _ O
original _ _ O
Kopitiam, _ _ O
reviewed _ _ O
by _ _ O
Ligaya _ _ O
Mishan _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
2015 _ _ O

City _ _ O
column, _ _ O
was _ _ O
situated _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
corner _ _ O
on _ _ O
Canal _ _ O
Street _ _ O
and _ _ O
had _ _ O
just _ _ O
four _ _ O
seats _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
single _ _ O
counter. _ _ O
In _ _ O
June, _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Pang _ _ O
and _ _ O
her _ _ O
new _ _ O
business _ _ O
partner, _ _ O
Moonlynn _ _ O
Tsai, _ _ O
relocated _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
larger, _ _ O
if _ _ O
still _ _ O
fairly _ _ O
intimate, _ _ O
space _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
steps _ _ O
above _ _ O
the _ _ O
sidewalk. _ _ O
You _ _ O
order _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
counter _ _ O
and _ _ O
receive _ _ O
a _ _ O
number _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
metal _ _ O
stand, _ _ O
a _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
promissory _ _ O
note _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
and _ _ O
beverages. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
show _ _ O
up _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
weekday _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
morning _ _ O
or _ _ O
afternoon, _ _ O
when _ _ O
seats _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
come _ _ O
by _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
room _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
languid, _ _ O
unhurried _ _ O
air, _ _ O
you _ _ O
could _ _ O
get _ _ O
just _ _ O
a _ _ O
cup _ _ O
of _ _ O
bek-kopi _ _ O
and _ _ O
linger _ _ O
over _ _ O
it _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
newspaper. _ _ O
You _ _ O
will _ _ O
probably _ _ O
want _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
that, _ _ O
though. _ _ O
From _ _ O
9 _ _ O
a.m., _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
doors _ _ O
open, _ _ O
until _ _ O
10 _ _ O
p.m., _ _ O
when _ _ O
they _ _ O
close, _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
get _ _ O
nasi _ _ O
lemak, _ _ O
Malaysia's _ _ O
national _ _ O
dish _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
particular _ _ O
favorite _ _ O
at _ _ O
breakfast. _ _ O
I _ _ O
don't _ _ O
know _ _ O
another _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
fragrances _ _ O
of _ _ O
coconut _ _ O
and _ _ O
pandan _ _ O
leaf _ _ O
infuse _ _ O
the _ _ O
rice _ _ O
as _ _ O
elegantly, _ _ O
or _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
tiny _ _ O
dried _ _ O
fish, _ _ O
which _ _ O
Kopitiam _ _ O
fries _ _ O
with _ _ O
peanuts, _ _ O
form _ _ O
a _ _ O
caramelized _ _ O
crust _ _ O
that _ _ O
erases _ _ O
the _ _ O
distinction _ _ O
between _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
and _ _ O
savory. _ _ O
Or _ _ O
your _ _ O
breakfast _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
two _ _ O
eggs _ _ O
boiled _ _ O
just _ _ O
long _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
turn _ _ O
the _ _ O
whites _ _ O
opaque _ _ O
while _ _ O
leaving _ _ O
the _ _ O
yolks _ _ O
free _ _ O
to _ _ O
billow _ _ O
into _ _ O
mushroom-soy _ _ O
broth _ _ O
underneath. _ _ O
Or _ _ O
it _ _ O
might _ _ O
be _ _ O
fish _ _ O
ball _ _ O
soup, _ _ O
grape-size _ _ O
globes _ _ O
of _ _ O
ground _ _ O
fish _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
cloudy _ _ O
white _ _ O
broth; _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
grains _ _ O
of _ _ O
white _ _ O
pepper _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
surface _ _ O
aren't _ _ O
intense _ _ O
enough _ _ O
for _ _ O
you, _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
stir _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
fish _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
spiced _ _ O
with _ _ O
bird's _ _ O
eye _ _ O
chiles. _ _ O
Rice _ _ O
vermicelli _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
added, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
soup _ _ O
is _ _ O
easier _ _ O
to _ _ O
appreciate _ _ O
in _ _ O
pure _ _ O
liquid _ _ O
form. _ _ O
For _ _ O
mornings _ _ O
when _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
but _ _ O
a _ _ O
cannonball _ _ O
dive _ _ O
into _ _ O
sugar _ _ O
will _ _ O
do, _ _ O
Kopitiam _ _ O
is _ _ O
ready _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
sculptural _ _ O
pile _ _ O
of _ _ O
thick-cut _ _ O
French _ _ O
toast _ _ O
battered _ _ O
with _ _ O
Milo _ _ O
malt-chocolate _ _ O
powder, _ _ O
a _ _ O
Malaysian _ _ O
passion, _ _ O
with _ _ O
streams _ _ O
of _ _ O
sweetened _ _ O
condensed _ _ O
milk _ _ O
playing _ _ O
the _ _ O
part _ _ O
that _ _ O
in _ _ O
this _ _ O
country _ _ O
is _ _ O
normally _ _ O
taken _ _ O
by _ _ O
maple _ _ O
syrup. _ _ O
Eat _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole _ _ O
stack _ _ O
and _ _ O
you _ _ O
will _ _ O
know _ _ O
the _ _ O
answer _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
musical _ _ O
question _ _ O
posed _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
Cramps: _ _ O
How _ _ O
far _ _ O
can _ _ O
too _ _ O
far _ _ O
go? _ _ O
At _ _ O
10:30 _ _ O
a.m. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Pang, _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
adds _ _ O
a _ _ O
gang _ _ O
of _ _ O
new _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
breakfast _ _ O
crew, _ _ O
and _ _ O
all _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
stick _ _ O
around _ _ O
until _ _ O
closing _ _ O
time. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
little _ _ O
oysters _ _ O
embedded _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
thin _ _ O
browned _ _ O
omelet, _ _ O
rice _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
chilled _ _ O
sesame-oil _ _ O
broth _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
growl _ _ O
of _ _ O
chile _ _ O
heat _ _ O
and _ _ O
spicy _ _ O
skate _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
in _ _ O
banana _ _ O
leaves, _ _ O
the _ _ O
classic _ _ O
acoustic _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
that _ _ O
Max _ _ O
Ng _ _ O
plays _ _ O
with _ _ O
amplifiers _ _ O
and _ _ O
wah-wah _ _ O
pedals _ _ O
at _ _ O
Momofuku _ _ O
Ssam _ _ O
Bar _ _ O
. _ _ O
Any _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O
could _ _ O
make _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
meal. _ _ O
But _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
inviting _ _ O
aspects _ _ O
of _ _ O
Kopitiam _ _ O
is _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Pang's _ _ O
fidelity _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
Malaysian _ _ O
love _ _ O
of _ _ O
snacks. _ _ O
Pandan _ _ O
leaves _ _ O
wrapped _ _ O
around _ _ O
a _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
sausage; _ _ O
ground _ _ O
five-spice _ _ O
pork _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
inside _ _ O
bean-curd _ _ O
skins _ _ O
and _ _ O
fried; _ _ O
fried _ _ O
strips _ _ O
of _ _ O
mackerel _ _ O
sausage _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
curry-leaf _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
-- _ _ O
any _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
fine _ _ O
appetizer, _ _ O
but _ _ O
each _ _ O
could _ _ O
just _ _ O
as _ _ O
easily _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
entire _ _ O
goal _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
between-meals _ _ O
stop _ _ O
at _ _ O
Kopitiam. _ _ O
For _ _ O
that _ _ O
matter, _ _ O
so _ _ O
could _ _ O
the _ _ O
small _ _ O
sweets _ _ O
like _ _ O
pulut: _ _ O
triangular, _ _ O
pandan-wrapped _ _ O
bundles _ _ O
of _ _ O
sticky _ _ O
rice _ _ O
tinted _ _ O
with _ _ O
blue _ _ O
morning _ _ O
glory _ _ O
flowers _ _ O
and _ _ O
spread _ _ O
with _ _ O
toasted _ _ O
coconut _ _ O
sugar _ _ O
or _ _ O
house-made _ _ O
coconut _ _ O
jam. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Pang _ _ O
is _ _ O
devoted _ _ O
to _ _ O
cakes _ _ O
as _ _ O
well. _ _ O
You _ _ O
get _ _ O
the _ _ O
sense _ _ O
that _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
were _ _ O
physically _ _ O
possible, _ _ O
she'd _ _ O
bake _ _ O
every _ _ O
cake _ _ O
she _ _ O
knows _ _ O
every _ _ O
day, _ _ O
but _ _ O
she _ _ O
settles _ _ O
for _ _ O
one _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
unpredictable _ _ O
rotation. _ _ O
You _ _ O
may _ _ O
find _ _ O
the _ _ O
caramel-brown _ _ O
honeycomb _ _ O
cake, _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O
intriguing _ _ O
structure _ _ O
of _ _ O
hollow _ _ O
vertical _ _ O
columns _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
bottom, _ _ O
or _ _ O
you _ _ O
may _ _ O
find _ _ O
her _ _ O
coconut _ _ O
cake, _ _ O
or _ _ O
there _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
some _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
surprise. _ _ O
Snacks _ _ O
and _ _ O
sweets _ _ O
tend _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
edged _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
spotlight _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
restaurants, _ _ O
where _ _ O
there's _ _ O
always _ _ O
pressure _ _ O
to _ _ O
order _ _ O
something _ _ O
big. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is, _ _ O
after _ _ O
all, _ _ O
a _ _ O
city _ _ O
that _ _ O
turned _ _ O
the _ _ O
casual _ _ O
tapas _ _ O
bar _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
peculiar _ _ O
genre _ _ O
known _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
tapas _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
such _ _ O
pressure _ _ O
inside _ _ O
Kopitiam, _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
on _ _ O
weekdays. _ _ O
Weekend _ _ O
brunch _ _ O
is _ _ O
another _ _ O
story, _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
often _ _ O
is. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
same, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
crowds _ _ O
thicken. _ _ O
A _ _ O
sign-in _ _ O
sheet _ _ O
is _ _ O
kept _ _ O
outside _ _ O
the _ _ O
door, _ _ O
next _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
pink _ _ O
pay _ _ O
phone _ _ O
(25 _ _ O
cents; _ _ O
it _ _ O
works), _ _ O
and _ _ O
hopeful _ _ O
customers _ _ O
sit _ _ O
on _ _ O
ceramic _ _ O
garden _ _ O
stools _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
top _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
stoop _ _ O
listening _ _ O
for _ _ O
their _ _ O
names. _ _ O
When _ _ O
you're _ _ O
finally _ _ O
called, _ _ O
you _ _ O
may _ _ O
feel _ _ O
silly _ _ O
getting _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
tannic _ _ O
milky _ _ O
tea _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
bundle _ _ O
of _ _ O
blue _ _ O
sticky _ _ O
rice. _ _ O
And _ _ O
when _ _ O
demand _ _ O
peaks, _ _ O
chaos _ _ O
can _ _ O
creep _ _ O
in, _ _ O
suggesting _ _ O
that _ _ O
Kopitiam _ _ O
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
figuring _ _ O
out _ _ O
the _ _ O
mechanics _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
larger _ _ O
space. _ _ O
Servers _ _ O
may _ _ O
pop _ _ O
by _ _ O
anxiously _ _ O
to _ _ O
ask, _ _ O
"Did _ _ O
you _ _ O
get _ _ O
all _ _ O
your _ _ O
food?" _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
answer _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
no. _ _ O
Drink _ _ O
orders _ _ O
may _ _ O
stack _ _ O
up. _ _ O
Once _ _ O
the _ _ O
white _ _ O
coffee _ _ O
was _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu; _ _ O
another _ _ O
time, _ _ O
no _ _ O
coffee _ _ O
at _ _ O
all _ _ O
was _ _ O
being _ _ O
poured; _ _ O
and _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
short _ _ O
time _ _ O
one _ _ O
day, _ _ O
both _ _ O
coffee _ _ O
and _ _ O
tea _ _ O
were _ _ O
unavailable, _ _ O
an _ _ O
awkward _ _ O
state _ _ O
of _ _ O
affairs _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
coffee _ _ O
and _ _ O
tea _ _ O
parlor. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
backlog _ _ O
of _ _ O
tickets, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
trickling _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
is _ _ O
almost _ _ O
unfailingly _ _ O
terrific. _ _ O
Maybe _ _ O
the _ _ O
stir-fried _ _ O
duck _ _ O
tongues _ _ O
I _ _ O
ate _ _ O
last _ _ O
time _ _ O
could _ _ O
have _ _ O
slid _ _ O
from _ _ O
their _ _ O
cartilaginous _ _ O
framework _ _ O
more _ _ O
easily. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
again, _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
I _ _ O
wasn't _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
right _ _ O
mood _ _ O
for _ _ O
duck _ _ O
tongues. _ _ O

Considering _ _ O
the _ _ O
history, _ _ O
the _ _ O
influence, _ _ O
the _ _ O
depth _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
sophistication _ _ O
of _ _ O
Iranian _ _ B-CUISINE
food, _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
always _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
unfair _ _ O
that _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
City _ _ I-LOC
has _ _ O
so _ _ O
few _ _ O
places _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat _ _ O
it. _ _ O
Unfair _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
and _ _ O
unfair _ _ O
to _ _ O
would-be _ _ O
eaters. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
want _ _ O
a _ _ O
symbol _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
state _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
City, _ _ I-LOC
Taste _ _ B-EST
of _ _ I-EST
Persia _ _ I-EST
NYC _ _ I-EST
will _ _ O
fit _ _ O
the _ _ O
bill. _ _ O
Until _ _ O
recently _ _ O
I _ _ O
might _ _ O
have _ _ O
called _ _ O
it _ _ O
the _ _ O
city's _ _ O
most _ _ O
promising _ _ O
Iranian _ _ B-CUISINE
kitchen, _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
word _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
weren't _ _ O
such _ _ O
a _ _ O
stretch. _ _ O
Taste _ _ B-EST
of _ _ I-EST
Persia _ _ I-EST
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
takeout _ _ O
operation _ _ O
squeezed _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
front _ _ O
window _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
Chelsea _ _ B-LOC
pizzeria, _ _ B-TYPE
except _ _ O
during _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O
months _ _ O
when _ _ O
fire _ _ O
damage _ _ O
forced _ _ O
it _ _ O
to _ _ O
take _ _ O
up _ _ O
temporary _ _ O
residence _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
holiday _ _ O
market. _ _ O
It _ _ O
does _ _ O
show _ _ O
off _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
pleasures _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Iranian _ _ O
table, _ _ O
but _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
itself. _ _ O
So _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
Brooklyn _ _ B-LOC
restaurant _ _ O
called _ _ O
Sofreh _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
which _ _ O
joined _ _ O
the _ _ O
Iranian _ _ B-CUISINE
ranks _ _ O
in _ _ O
June, _ _ O
would _ _ O
have _ _ O
caused _ _ O
a _ _ O
stir _ _ O
even _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
weren't _ _ O
quite _ _ O
as _ _ O
good _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
is. _ _ O
The _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
is _ _ O
spare _ _ O
and _ _ O
modern, _ _ O
with _ _ O
exposed _ _ O
rafters, _ _ O
molded _ _ O
plywood _ _ O
chairs _ _ O
and _ _ O
shades _ _ O
of _ _ O
soft _ _ O
white. _ _ O
You _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
look _ _ O
carefully _ _ O
to _ _ O
see _ _ O
the _ _ O
breaks _ _ O
with _ _ O
garden-variety _ _ O
minimalism, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
echoes _ _ O
of _ _ O
medieval _ _ O
arches _ _ O
behind _ _ O
the _ _ O
bar _ _ O
and _ _ O

so _ _ O
soon _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
end _ _ O
up _ _ O

This _ _ O
flatbread _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
of _ _ O
course _ _ O
ideal _ _ O
for _ _ O
tearing _ _ O
and _ _ O
swishing _ _ O

also _ _ O
spread _ _ O
with _ _ O

more _ _ O

Earlier _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
summer _ _ O
Sofreh _ _ O
offered _ _ O
an _ _ O
appetizer _ _ O
of _ _ O
dry, _ _ O
underseasoned _ _ O
beef _ _ O
meatballs _ _ O
with _ _ O
sour _ _ O
cherries. _ _ O
One _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
only _ _ O
things _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
warm _ _ O
up _ _ O
to, _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
replaced _ _ O
lately _ _ O
by _ _ O
beef _ _ O
kofte, _ _ O
made _ _ O
light _ _ O
and _ _ O
tender _ _ O
by _ _ O
rice _ _ O
and _ _ O
stewed _ _ O

peas. _ _ O
The _ _ O
kofte _ _ O
sit _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
gentle _ _ O
saffron-tomato _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
another _ _ O
natural _ _ O
partner _ _ O
for _ _ O
Sofreh's _ _ O
bread. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Alikhani, _ _ O
59, _ _ O
grew _ _ O
up _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
sprawling _ _ O
desert _ _ O
city _ _ O
Isfahan, _ _ O
and _ _ O
moved _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
United _ _ O
States _ _ O
in _ _ O
her _ _ O
early _ _ O
20s. _ _ O
For _ _ O
years _ _ O
she _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
Iranian _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
from _ _ O
memory, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
decades _ _ O
before _ _ O
she _ _ O
traveled _ _ O
back _ _ O
to _ _ O
Iran _ _ O
to _ _ O
learn _ _ O
more _ _ O
about _ _ O
its _ _ O
food _ _ O
in _ _ O
preparation _ _ O
for _ _ O
opening _ _ O
Sofreh. _ _ O
Her _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
ash, _ _ O
the _ _ O
herb _ _ O
and _ _ O
whole-wheat _ _ O
noodle _ _ O
stew, _ _ O
stands _ _ O
out _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
because _ _ O
it _ _ O
stays _ _ O
so _ _ O
close _ _ O
to _ _ O
tradition. _ _ O
Other _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
show _ _ O
the _ _ O
acclimatizing _ _ O
effect _ _ O
of _ _ O
New _ _ O
York. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
an _ _ O
article _ _ O
of _ _ O
faith _ _ O
for _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
that _ _ O
any _ _ O
dish _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
improved _ _ O
by _ _ O
putting _ _ O
a _ _ O
poached _ _ O
egg _ _ O
on _ _ O
it. _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
not _ _ O
so _ _ O
sure _ _ O
that _ _ O
Sofreh's _ _ O
smoked _ _ O
eggplant _ _ O
halves _ _ O
with _ _ O
their _ _ O
sweet, _ _ O
garlic-drenched _ _ O
tomato _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
need _ _ O
one, _ _ O
though. _ _ O
Is _ _ O
the _ _ O
watermelon _ _ O
feta _ _ O
salad _ _ O
familiar _ _ O
from _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
that _ _ O
have _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
to _ _ O
do _ _ O
with _ _ O
Iran? _ _ O
Maybe _ _ O
just _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit, _ _ O
but _ _ O
Sofreh's _ _ O
version _ _ O
stands _ _ O
out _ _ O
for _ _ O
its _ _ O
intriguing _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
of _ _ O
nigella _ _ O
seeds _ _ O
crushed _ _ O
into _ _ O
mint _ _ O
oil. _ _ O
And _ _ O
while _ _ O
the _ _ O
Shiraz _ _ O
salad _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
to _ _ O
fine _ _ O
bits _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
way _ _ O
that _ _ O
makes _ _ O
it _ _ O
something _ _ O
like _ _ O
Iran's _ _ O
answer _ _ O
to _ _ O
pico _ _ O
de _ _ O
gallo, _ _ O
its _ _ O
sour _ _ O
purple _ _ O
flecks _ _ O
of _ _ O
sumac _ _ O
distinguish _ _ O
it _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
herd _ _ O
of _ _ O
tomato-cucumber _ _ O
assemblages. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
fairly _ _ O
concise, _ _ O
and _ _ O
occasionally _ _ O
I _ _ O
wished _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
plunged _ _ O
into _ _ O
tradition _ _ O
with _ _ O
less _ _ O
restraint. _ _ O
For _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish _ _ O
called _ _ O
"catch _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
day," _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Alikhani _ _ O
has _ _ O
adapted _ _ O
ghalieh _ _ O
mahi, _ _ O
a _ _ O
tamarind-soured _ _ O
stew _ _ O
of _ _ O
fish _ _ O
and _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
herbs _ _ O
from _ _ O
southern _ _ O
Iran. _ _ O
In _ _ O
her _ _ O
version, _ _ O
a _ _ O
pan-seared _ _ O
hunk _ _ O
of _ _ O
whitefish _ _ O
-- _ _ O
halibut _ _ O
and _ _ O
cod _ _ O
have _ _ O
taken _ _ O
turns _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
role _ _ O
-- _ _ O
is _ _ O
set _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
long-cooked _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
Dark _ _ O
with _ _ O
caramelized _ _ O
onions _ _ O
and _ _ O
fried _ _ O
cilantro _ _ O
and _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
fenugreek _ _ O
leaves, _ _ O
the _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
is _ _ O
hypnotically _ _ O
complex. _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
a _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
under _ _ O
fish _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
as _ _ O
one _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
with _ _ O
fish _ _ O
so _ _ O
the _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
can _ _ O
get _ _ O
acquainted. _ _ O
A _ _ O
simple _ _ O
flattened _ _ O
and _ _ O
griddled _ _ O
half _ _ O
chicken, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
wonderful _ _ O
foil _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
topping _ _ O
of _ _ O
tart _ _ O
barberries _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
captivating _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
of _ _ O
dried _ _ O
Persian _ _ O
plums _ _ O
and _ _ O
saffron. _ _ O
And _ _ O
there's _ _ O
lovely _ _ O
simplicity _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
braised _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
shank _ _ O
with _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
garlic _ _ O
and _ _ O
sizzled _ _ O
onions; _ _ O
the _ _ O
turmeric- _ _ O
and _ _ O
cinnamon-scented _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
might _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
put _ _ O
on _ _ O
this _ _ O
earth _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
spooned _ _ O
over _ _ O
fluffy _ _ O
rice. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
shame _ _ O
in _ _ O
ending _ _ O
the _ _ O
meal _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
goblet _ _ O
of _ _ O
thick _ _ O
yogurt _ _ O
parfait _ _ O
with _ _ O
jam _ _ O
and _ _ O
pistachios. _ _ O
But _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
harder-to-find _ _ O
sweets, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
rose-water _ _ O
custard, _ _ O
grainy _ _ O
with _ _ O
rice _ _ O
flour, _ _ O
transformed _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
sort _ _ O
of _ _ O
tart _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
crust _ _ O
of _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
nuts. _ _ O
Saffron _ _ O
and _ _ O
rose-water _ _ O
ice _ _ O
cream _ _ O
is _ _ O
luxuriously _ _ O
rich _ _ O
despite _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
stray _ _ O
ice _ _ O
crystals. _ _ O
And _ _ O
the _ _ O
faloodeh, _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
world's _ _ O
oldest _ _ O
frozen _ _ O
desserts, _ _ O
will _ _ O
put _ _ O
to _ _ O
rest _ _ O
all _ _ O
doubts _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
wisdom _ _ O
of _ _ O

There _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
time _ _ O
when _ _ O
there _ _ O
was _ _ O
only _ _ O
one _ _ O
Nobu, _ _ B-EST
on _ _ O
Hudson _ _ B-LOC
Street _ _ I-LOC
in _ _ O
TriBeCa. _ _ B-LOC
When _ _ O
it _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
1994, _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O

of _ _ O

for _ _ O

it _ _ O
seemed _ _ O

that _ _ O
was _ _ O
all _ _ O

-- _ _ O
you _ _ O
either _ _ O

for _ _ O

by _ _ O
a _ _ O

in _ _ O

you _ _ O

the _ _ O

a _ _ O

on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
line _ _ O
three-deep _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
bar. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
because _ _ O
after _ _ O
the _ _ O
success _ _ O
of _ _ O
Nobu _ _ B-EST
in _ _ O
TriBeCa, _ _ B-LOC
Mr. _ _ O
Matsuhisa _ _ O
and _ _ O
his _ _ O
partners _ _ O
made _ _ O
a _ _ O
strategic _ _ O
decision. _ _ O
The _ _ O
food _ _ O
would _ _ O
stay _ _ O
roughly _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
-- _ _ O
more _ _ O
on _ _ O
this _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
minute _ _ O
-- _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O

would _ _ O
grow _ _ O
bigger, _ _ O
boozier, _ _ O
louder, _ _ O
more _ _ O
theatrical. _ _ O
If _ _ O
Nobu _ _ B-EST
did _ _ O
not _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
invent _ _ O
the _ _ O
Asian _ _ B-TYPE
Party _ _ I-TYPE
Temple _ _ I-TYPE
restaurant _ _ O
genre, _ _ O
it _ _ O
certainly _ _ O
drew _ _ O
the _ _ O
blueprints. _ _ O
At _ _ O
these _ _ O
new _ _ O
Nobus, _ _ B-EST
Mr. _ _ O
Matsuhisa's _ _ O
food _ _ O
was _ _ O
still _ _ O
a _ _ O
major _ _ O
event, _ _ O
but _ _ O
not _ _ O
necessarily _ _ O
the _ _ O
main _ _ O
event. _ _ O
And _ _ O
the _ _ O
question _ _ O
was _ _ O
not _ _ O
just _ _ O
whether _ _ O
you _ _ O
felt _ _ O
like _ _ O
eating _ _ O
at _ _ O
Nobu _ _ B-EST
but _ _ O
whether _ _ O
you _ _ O
felt _ _ O

The _ _ O

location _ _ O
in _ _ O
particular _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
reputation _ _ O
for _ _ O
intense _ _ O

that _ _ O
can _ _ O
drive _ _ O
away _ _ O
customers _ _ O
who _ _ O
merely _ _ O

All _ _ O
this _ _ O
was _ _ O

for _ _ O

in _ _ O

to _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
Nobu; _ _ B-EST
it _ _ O
opened _ _ O
last _ _ O
year _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
weeks _ _ O
after _ _ O
the _ _ O
original _ _ O
closed. _ _ O
The _ _ O
sushi _ _ B-TYPE
bar _ _ I-TYPE
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
heart _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
TriBeCa _ _ B-LOC
restaurant. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
behind _ _ O
it _ _ O
prepared _ _ O
or _ _ O
touched _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
half _ _ O
the _ _ O
food, _ _ O
and _ _ O
seats _ _ O
there _ _ O
were _ _ O
so _ _ O
coveted _ _ O
that _ _ O
during _ _ O
the _ _ O
1990s, _ _ O
when _ _ O
even _ _ O
celebrities _ _ O
complained _ _ O
about _ _ O
how _ _ O
hard _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
in, _ _ O
a _ _ O
mostly _ _ O
sushi _ _ B-TYPE
restaurant _ _ I-TYPE
called _ _ O
Next _ _ B-EST
Door _ _ I-EST
Nobu _ _ I-EST
was _ _ O
opened _ _ O
simply _ _ O
to _ _ O
contain _ _ O
the _ _ O
overflow. _ _ O
(It _ _ O
closed _ _ O
last _ _ O
year, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
and _ _ O
won't _ _ O
be _ _ O
replaced.) _ _ O
At _ _ O
Nobu _ _ B-EST
Downtown, _ _ I-EST
the _ _ O
upstairs _ _ O
sushi _ _ O
counter _ _ O
is _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
far _ _ O
side _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
cocktail _ _ O
bar _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
design _ _ O
firm _ _ O
Rockwell _ _ O
Group _ _ O
slipped _ _ O
in _ _ O
among _ _ O
the _ _ O
enormous _ _ O
fluted _ _ O
limestone _ _ O
columns _ _ O
that _ _ O
fill _ _ O
the _ _ O
building's _ _ O
ground _ _ O
floor _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
petrified _ _ O
forest. _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
just _ _ O
eaten _ _ O
a _ _ O
piece _ _ O
of _ _ O
Japanese _ _ B-CUISINE
scallop _ _ B-DISH
sushi _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
dangerous _ _ O
streak _ _ O
of _ _ O
wasabi _ _ B-FOOD
when _ _ O
an _ _ O
animated _ _ O
group _ _ O
of _ _ O
four _ _ O
new _ _ O
arrivals _ _ O
appeared _ _ O
next _ _ O
to _ _ O
me. _ _ O
The _ _ O
sushi _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
eyed _ _ O
them _ _ O
warily, _ _ O
because _ _ O
they _ _ O
appeared _ _ O
to _ _ O
intend _ _ O
to _ _ O
cluster _ _ O
around _ _ O
a _ _ O
single _ _ O
stool, _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
people _ _ O
do _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
bar. _ _ O
Soon _ _ O
it _ _ O
became _ _ O
apparent _ _ O
that _ _ O
they _ _ O
thought _ _ O
they _ _ O
were _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
bar. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
people _ _ O
they _ _ O
mistook _ _ O
for _ _ O
bartenders _ _ O
were _ _ O
all _ _ O
busy _ _ O
slicing _ _ O
raw _ _ O
fish, _ _ B-FOOD
so _ _ O
eventually _ _ O
the _ _ O
group _ _ O
moved _ _ O
on _ _ O
to _ _ O
look _ _ O
for _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
them _ _ O
a _ _ O
drink. _ _ O
Moments _ _ O
like _ _ O
this _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
tend _ _ O
to _ _ O
happen _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
original _ _ O
Nobu, _ _ B-EST
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
do _ _ O
bring _ _ O
Nobu _ _ B-EST
Downtown _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
line _ _ O
with _ _ O
Nobu _ _ B-EST
Fifty _ _ I-EST
Seven. _ _ I-EST
In _ _ O
business _ _ O
on _ _ O
57th _ _ B-LOC
Street _ _ I-LOC
since _ _ O
2005, _ _ O
Nobu _ _ B-EST
Fifty _ _ I-EST
Seven _ _ I-EST
is _ _ O
another _ _ O
two-story _ _ O
proposition. _ _ O
Between _ _ O
5 _ _ O
and _ _ O
7 _ _ O
p.m. _ _ O
its _ _ O
ground-floor _ _ O
lounge _ _ O
acts _ _ O
on _ _ O
young _ _ O
Midtown _ _ B-LOC
professionals _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
fishing _ _ O
nets _ _ O
evoked _ _ O
by _ _ O
Rockwell _ _ O
Group's _ _ O
design. _ _ O
At _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
the _ _ O
second _ _ O
scene _ _ O
took _ _ O
place, _ _ O
the _ _ O
bartenders _ _ O
looked _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
they _ _ O
were _ _ O
struggling _ _ O
not _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
caught. _ _ O
My _ _ O
cocktail, _ _ O
a _ _ O
Negroni-esque _ _ B-DISH
thing _ _ O
with _ _ O
sake _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
it _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
ferried _ _ O
to _ _ O
my _ _ O
upstairs _ _ O
table _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
downstairs _ _ O
bar, _ _ O
was _ _ O
neither _ _ O
shaken _ _ O
nor _ _ O
stirred; _ _ O
it _ _ O
was, _ _ O
in _ _ O
fact, _ _ O
almost _ _ O
hot. _ _ O
While _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
waiting _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
cocktail _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
cooled _ _ O
by _ _ O
its _ _ O
single _ _ O
ice _ _ O
cube, _ _ O
a _ _ O
server _ _ O
was _ _ O
struggling _ _ O
to _ _ O
open _ _ O
a _ _ O
bottle _ _ O
of _ _ O
Champagne _ _ B-FOOD
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
table _ _ O
of _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
10 _ _ O
men _ _ O
next _ _ O
to _ _ O
me. _ _ O
When _ _ O
the _ _ O
cork _ _ O
came _ _ O
out, _ _ O
he _ _ O
managed _ _ O
to _ _ O
spray _ _ O
the _ _ O
room _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
manner _ _ O
usually _ _ O
seen _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Super _ _ O
Bowl _ _ O
champions' _ _ O
locker _ _ O
room. _ _ O
Everybody _ _ O
nearby _ _ O
got _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
wet, _ _ O
including _ _ O
me _ _ O
and _ _ O
my _ _ O
guests, _ _ O
but _ _ O
nobody _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
to _ _ O
notice. _ _ O
Servers _ _ O
at _ _ O
both _ _ O
addresses _ _ O
have _ _ O
the _ _ O
brisk, _ _ O
well-drilled, _ _ O
impersonal _ _ O
and _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
numbed _ _ O
quality _ _ O
that _ _ O
comes _ _ O
of _ _ O
waiting _ _ O
on _ _ O
hundreds _ _ O
of _ _ O
people _ _ O
a _ _ O
day. _ _ O
At _ _ O
Nobu _ _ B-EST
Fifty-Seven, _ _ I-EST
one _ _ O
told _ _ O
me, _ _ O
"Our _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
kaiseki _ _ O
style, _ _ O
so _ _ O
it's _ _ O
like _ _ O
tapas. _ _ O
Everything _ _ O
is _ _ O
meant _ _ O
for _ _ O
sharing." _ _ O
I _ _ O
must _ _ O
have _ _ O
looked _ _ O
confused _ _ O
because _ _ O
he _ _ O
added, _ _ O
"Some _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
are _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
bigger _ _ O
than _ _ O
others." _ _ O
Nobu _ _ B-EST
Fifty-Seven _ _ I-EST
was _ _ O
given _ _ O
three _ _ O
stars _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
last _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
Times _ _ O
review _ _ O
, _ _ O
by _ _ O
Frank _ _ O
Bruni _ _ O
in _ _ O
2005. _ _ O
That's _ _ O
what _ _ O
Ruth _ _ O
Reichl _ _ O
gave _ _ O
the _ _ O
original _ _ O
in _ _ O
1995. _ _ O
After _ _ O
three _ _ O
recent _ _ O
visits _ _ O
to _ _ O
each _ _ O
location, _ _ O
I _ _ O
decided _ _ O
that, _ _ O
apart _ _ O
from _ _ O
minor _ _ O
menu _ _ O
variations, _ _ O
any _ _ O
qualitative _ _ O
difference _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
between _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O
branches _ _ O
is _ _ O
too _ _ O
subtle _ _ O
for _ _ O
me _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
out. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
uptown _ _ O
are _ _ O
Taku _ _ O
Sato _ _ O
and _ _ O
Matt _ _ O
Hoyle. _ _ O
Downtown _ _ O
was _ _ O
led _ _ O
by _ _ O
Ricky _ _ O
Estrellado _ _ O
and _ _ O
Ryo _ _ O
Hasegawa _ _ O
until _ _ O
June, _ _ O
when _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Estrellado _ _ O
died _ _ O
suddenly. _ _ O
His _ _ O
successor _ _ O
has _ _ O
not _ _ O
been _ _ O
named. _ _ O
Both _ _ O
kitchens _ _ O
are _ _ O
models _ _ O
of _ _ O
superior _ _ O
ingredient _ _ O
shopping _ _ O
and _ _ O
consistent _ _ O
performance. _ _ O
When _ _ O
those _ _ O
classic _ _ O
Nobu _ _ B-EST
dishes _ _ O
appear, _ _ O
they _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
time _ _ O
you _ _ O
had _ _ O
them. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
case _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
mayo-bathed _ _ B-DISH
fried _ _ I-DISH
shrimp, _ _ I-DISH
that _ _ O
may _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
an _ _ O
entirely _ _ O
good _ _ O
thing. _ _ O
And _ _ O
I _ _ O
still _ _ O
think _ _ O
the _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
caviar _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
crowns _ _ O
tuna, _ _ B-FOOD
or _ _ O
salmon, _ _ B-FOOD
or _ _ O
yellowtail _ _ B-FOOD
tartare _ _ I-FOOD
gets _ _ O
elbowed _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
wasabi-soy _ _ B-FOOD
sauce. _ _ I-FOOD
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
tiradito, _ _ B-DISH
slices _ _ O
of _ _ O
yellowtail _ _ B-FOOD
squirted _ _ O
with _ _ O
lemon _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ I-FOOD
yuzu _ _ I-FOOD
juice, _ _ I-FOOD
then _ _ O
dotted _ _ O
with _ _ O
puréed _ _ B-FOOD
rocoto _ _ I-FOOD
pepper, _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
always _ _ O
wonderfully _ _ O
bracing. _ _ O
The _ _ O
candylike _ _ O
black _ _ B-DISH
cod _ _ I-DISH
is _ _ O
as _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
deny _ _ O
as _ _ O
ever, _ _ O
even _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
extra _ _ O
sweetening _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Matsuhisa _ _ O
gives _ _ O
this _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
Japanese _ _ B-CUISINE
dish _ _ O
strikes _ _ O
me _ _ O
as _ _ O
somewhat _ _ O
shameless. _ _ O
The _ _ O
sashimi _ _ B-DISH
salad _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
lobster _ _ B-DISH
shiitake _ _ I-DISH
salads _ _ I-DISH
are _ _ O
both _ _ O
better _ _ O
than _ _ O
any _ _ O
salad _ _ B-FOOD
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
global _ _ O
chain _ _ O
has _ _ O
the _ _ O
right _ _ O
to _ _ O
be. _ _ O
I _ _ O
don't _ _ O
know _ _ O
who _ _ O
orders _ _ O
the _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
marked _ _ O
Nobu _ _ O
Now, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
tried _ _ O
a _ _ O
few. _ _ O
Umami _ _ B-DISH
Chilean _ _ I-DISH
sea _ _ I-DISH
bass: _ _ I-DISH
not _ _ O
worth _ _ O
it, _ _ O
even _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
exotic _ _ O
return _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
fish _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
hasn't _ _ O
been _ _ O
seen _ _ O
much _ _ O
since _ _ O
the _ _ O
'90s. _ _ O
Kumamoto _ _ B-DISH
shooters: _ _ I-DISH
a _ _ O
thrilling _ _ O
series _ _ O
of _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
that _ _ O
will _ _ O
recall _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
you _ _ O
felt _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
time _ _ O
you _ _ O
ate _ _ O
at _ _ O
Nobu. _ _ B-EST
Michele _ _ O
Goldsmith's _ _ O
desserts, _ _ O
served _ _ O
both _ _ O
uptown _ _ O
and _ _ O
downtown, _ _ O
are _ _ O
modern _ _ O
and _ _ O
playful _ _ O
and _ _ O
don't _ _ O
try _ _ O
too _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
follow _ _ O
the _ _ O
theme, _ _ O
whatever _ _ O
that _ _ O
is. _ _ O
Over _ _ O
the _ _ O
years, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Hudson _ _ B-LOC
Street _ _ I-LOC
Nobu _ _ B-EST
became _ _ O
something _ _ O
unusual, _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
could _ _ O
serve _ _ O
tourists _ _ O
and _ _ O
families _ _ O
from _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
corner _ _ O
with _ _ O
equal _ _ O
aplomb. _ _ O
But _ _ O
a _ _ O
meal _ _ O
at _ _ O
Nobu _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
among _ _ O
the _ _ O
best, _ _ O
although _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
cheapest, _ _ O
ways _ _ O
to _ _ O
introduce _ _ O
children _ _ O
to _ _ O
raw _ _ O
fish. _ _ B-FOOD
And _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
sushi _ _ O
bar _ _ O
can _ _ O
still _ _ O
provide _ _ O
the _ _ O
intimacy _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
rest _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
place _ _ O
lacks. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
behind _ _ O
the _ _ O
counter _ _ O
may _ _ O
not _ _ O
draw _ _ O
the _ _ O
kinmedai _ _ O
cultists _ _ O
who _ _ O
flock _ _ O
to _ _ O
Sushi _ _ B-EST
Zo _ _ I-EST
or _ _ O
Sushi _ _ B-EST
Ginza _ _ I-EST
Onodera _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
know _ _ O
what _ _ O
they're _ _ O
doing, _ _ O
and _ _ O
they _ _ O
light _ _ O
up _ _ O
when _ _ O
they _ _ O
get _ _ O
a _ _ O
customer _ _ O

Real _ _ O

to _ _ O
illuminate _ _ O
the _ _ O

before _ _ O
they'd _ _ O

around, _ _ O
they _ _ O
simply _ _ O

the _ _ O

with _ _ O

of _ _ O

the _ _ O

used _ _ O
by _ _ O
Hudson _ _ B-LOC

the _ _ O

soon _ _ O
not _ _ O

an _ _ O

will _ _ O

all _ _ O

it _ _ O

the _ _ O

a _ _ O

just _ _ O

To _ _ O

of _ _ O

Henry _ _ B-LOC

a _ _ O
private _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
I _ _ O
am _ _ O
telling _ _ O
you _ _ O
all _ _ O
this _ _ O
because _ _ O
that _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
Legacy _ _ B-EST
Records, _ _ I-EST
is _ _ O
unusually _ _ O
good _ _ O
and _ _ O
very _ _ O
popular _ _ O
and _ _ O
if _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
invites _ _ O
you _ _ O
there, _ _ O
you _ _ O
should _ _ O
know _ _ O
why _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O

down _ _ O
the _ _ O

the _ _ O

go _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
hosed _ _ O
down _ _ O
at _ _ O
night. _ _ O
And _ _ O
you _ _ O
will _ _ O
also _ _ O
know _ _ O
why _ _ O
Legacy _ _ B-EST
Records _ _ I-EST
seems _ _ O
eager _ _ O
to _ _ O
suggest _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
local _ _ O
roots _ _ O
-- _ _ O
so _ _ O
eager _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
essentially _ _ O
ginned _ _ O
up _ _ O
a _ _ O
history _ _ O
for _ _ O
itself _ _ O
that _ _ O
brings _ _ O
together _ _ O
sloppy _ _ O
research _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
superficial _ _ O
tribute _ _ O
to _ _ O
black _ _ O
culture. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
not _ _ O
a _ _ O
combination _ _ O
that _ _ O
will _ _ O
appeal _ _ O
to _ _ O
everybody. _ _ O
Like _ _ O
the _ _ O
bar _ _ B-TYPE
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
wine _ _ B-TYPE
store, _ _ I-TYPE
Legacy _ _ B-EST
Records _ _ I-EST
is _ _ O
run _ _ O
by _ _ O
Delicious _ _ O
Hospitality, _ _ O
the _ _ O
company _ _ O
behind _ _ O
Pasquale _ _ O
Jones _ _ O
and _ _ O
Charlie _ _ O
Bird _ _ O
. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu, _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
in _ _ O
those _ _ O
two _ _ O
restaurants, _ _ O
is _ _ O
essentially _ _ O
Italian, _ _ B-CUISINE
but _ _ O
less _ _ O
rustic _ _ O
and _ _ O
more _ _ O
expensive. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
time _ _ O
the _ _ O
group _ _ O
has _ _ O
routinely _ _ O
charged _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
$30, _ _ O
and _ _ O
as _ _ O
much _ _ O
as _ _ O
$46, _ _ O
for _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses. _ _ O
(The _ _ O
prices, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
ones _ _ O
at _ _ O
Pasquale _ _ B-EST
Jones _ _ I-EST
but _ _ O
not _ _ O
Charlie _ _ B-EST
Bird, _ _ I-EST
include _ _ O
service.) _ _ O
I _ _ O

for _ _ O
sure _ _ O
whether _ _ O

the _ _ O

to _ _ O
better _ _ O
purveyors, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
do _ _ O
know _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
taken _ _ O
aback, _ _ O
often, _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
raw _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
at _ _ O
Legacy _ _ B-EST
Records. _ _ I-EST
There _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
raw _ _ B-DISH
sea _ _ I-DISH
scallop, _ _ I-DISH
so _ _ O
intensely _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
that _ _ O
its _ _ O
slices _ _ O
clung _ _ O
together _ _ O
stickily; _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Hardy _ _ O
had _ _ O
dressed _ _ O
it _ _ O
with _ _ O
dots _ _ O
of _ _ O
yogurt, _ _ B-FOOD
tiny _ _ O
oval _ _ O
basil _ _ B-FOOD
leaves, _ _ I-FOOD
toasted _ _ O
almonds _ _ O
and _ _ O
tart _ _ O
little _ _ O
pink _ _ O
cells _ _ O
of _ _ O
finger _ _ O
lime. _ _ O
There _ _ O
was _ _ O
chilled _ _ O
Dungeness _ _ O
crab, _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
pristine _ _ O
white _ _ O
chunks _ _ O
under _ _ O
sea _ _ O
urchin _ _ O
foam, _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
spooned _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
shot _ _ O
glass. _ _ O
And _ _ O
tiles _ _ O
of _ _ O
yellowfin _ _ O
tuna _ _ O
belly, _ _ O
not _ _ O
as _ _ O
fatty _ _ O
as _ _ O
bluefin _ _ O
but _ _ O
very _ _ O
rich _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
same, _ _ O
under _ _ O
bits _ _ O
of _ _ O
salted _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
peel _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
splash _ _ O
of _ _ O
colatura, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
fish _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
Again _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses, _ _ O
I _ _ O
stopped _ _ O
and _ _ O
wondered: _ _ O
Where _ _ O
did _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Hardy _ _ O
find _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
(with _ _ O
snap _ _ O
peas _ _ O
and _ _ O
smoked _ _ O
cream) _ _ O
that _ _ O
tasted _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
had _ _ O
never _ _ O
eaten _ _ O
anything _ _ O
but _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
herbs? _ _ O
How _ _ O
did _ _ O
he _ _ O
find _ _ O
a _ _ O
rib-eye _ _ O
that's _ _ O
so _ _ O
tender _ _ O
and _ _ O
deeply _ _ O
flavorful _ _ O
without _ _ O
being _ _ O
flabby? _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Hardy _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
quick _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
of _ _ O
what _ _ O
the _ _ O
market _ _ O
says _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
month _ _ O
of _ _ O
spring _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
calendar _ _ O
says _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
last. _ _ O
Creamy _ _ O
new-crop _ _ O
potatoes _ _ O
deserve _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
appreciation _ _ O
before _ _ O
they're _ _ O
sent _ _ O
off _ _ O
to _ _ O
root _ _ O
cellars, _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Hardy _ _ O
built _ _ O
a _ _ O
fine _ _ O
appetizer _ _ O
around _ _ O
them _ _ O
with _ _ O
leggy _ _ O
broccoli _ _ O
sprouts _ _ O
and _ _ O
melting _ _ O
chunks _ _ O
of _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
mozzarella _ _ O
spiked _ _ O
with _ _ O
anchovy. _ _ O
Charred _ _ O
snap _ _ O
peas _ _ O
made _ _ O
a _ _ O
tangy _ _ O
salad _ _ O
together _ _ O
with _ _ O
ramps _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
peppery _ _ O
buttermilk _ _ O
dressing. _ _ O
But _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
English _ _ O
peas _ _ O
were _ _ O
swallowed _ _ O
up _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
too-sharp _ _ O
risotto; _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
with _ _ O
prosciutto, _ _ O
the _ _ O
rice _ _ O
took _ _ O
on _ _ O
more _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
ham's _ _ O
saltiness _ _ O
than _ _ O
its _ _ O
sweetness. _ _ O
Legacy _ _ O
Records _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
say _ _ O
anything _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
original, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
finesse _ _ O
that's _ _ O
new _ _ O
for _ _ O
this _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
group. _ _ O
There's _ _ O
an _ _ O
exceptional _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
pigeon, _ _ O
neatly _ _ O
carved _ _ O
and _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
swooshes _ _ O
of _ _ O
nettle _ _ O
purée. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
as _ _ O
impressive _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
that's _ _ O
becoming _ _ O
a _ _ O
breakout _ _ O
star _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant: _ _ O
a _ _ O
duck _ _ O
breast, _ _ O
its _ _ O
skin _ _ O
rubbed _ _ O
with _ _ O
pepper, _ _ O
chiles, _ _ O
honey _ _ O
and _ _ O
fennel _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
until _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
deep, _ _ O
crusty _ _ O
bark _ _ O
that _ _ O
a _ _ O
Texas _ _ O
pitmaster _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
proud _ _ O
of. _ _ O
Ordering _ _ O
wine _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
event _ _ O
in _ _ O
itself. _ _ O
Robert _ _ O
Bohr _ _ O
and _ _ O
Grant _ _ O
Reynolds, _ _ O
who _ _ O
are _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Hardy's _ _ O
partners _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
resident _ _ O
wine _ _ O
soothsayers, _ _ O
have _ _ O
seen _ _ O
to _ _ O
it _ _ O
that _ _ O
cultists _ _ O
can _ _ O
rub _ _ O
elbows _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
Agraparts, _ _ O
Raveneaus _ _ O
and _ _ O
Gajas, _ _ O
while _ _ O
the _ _ O
rest _ _ O
of _ _ O
us _ _ O
will _ _ O
still _ _ O
find _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
bottles _ _ O
under _ _ O
$100 _ _ O
from _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
expensive _ _ O
arable _ _ O
land _ _ O
on _ _ O
earth. _ _ O
Oddly _ _ O
enough, _ _ O
the _ _ O
wine _ _ O
list _ _ O
makes _ _ O
less _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
impression _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
ones _ _ O
at _ _ O
Charlie _ _ O
Bird _ _ O
and _ _ O
Pasquale _ _ O
Jones, _ _ O
simply _ _ O
because _ _ O
you'd _ _ O
expect _ _ O
an _ _ O
ambitious _ _ O
cellar _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
this _ _ O
expensive. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
again _ _ O
you _ _ O
might _ _ O
also _ _ O
expect _ _ O
a _ _ O
smart, _ _ O
artful _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
menu; _ _ O
if _ _ O
so, _ _ O
you're _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
luck. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
ice _ _ O
cream _ _ O
with _ _ O
strawberries, _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark _ _ O
chocolate _ _ O
meringue _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
selection _ _ O
of _ _ O
gelati, _ _ O
served _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
cone; _ _ O
all _ _ O
perfectly _ _ O
pleasant, _ _ O
but _ _ O
there's _ _ O
more _ _ O
wit _ _ O
and _ _ O
creativity _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
excellent _ _ O
cocktail _ _ O
roster _ _ O
administered _ _ O
by _ _ O
Jeff _ _ O
Bell. _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
sure _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
are _ _ O
reluctant _ _ O
to _ _ O
go _ _ O
to _ _ O
Legacy _ _ O
Records _ _ O
because _ _ O
of _ _ O
how _ _ O
relentlessly _ _ O
noisy _ _ O
this _ _ O
team's _ _ O
downtown _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
are. _ _ O
But _ _ O
they _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
sent _ _ O
the _ _ O
acoustics _ _ O
to _ _ O
obedience _ _ O
school, _ _ O
because _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
sound _ _ O
waves _ _ O
do _ _ O
what _ _ O
they're _ _ O
told: _ _ O
Conversations _ _ O
stay _ _ O
at _ _ O
their _ _ O
own _ _ O
tables, _ _ O
while _ _ O
the _ _ O
music _ _ O
stays _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
background. _ _ O
Ken _ _ O
Fulk, _ _ O
who _ _ O
designed _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
public _ _ O
spaces _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
building, _ _ O
covered _ _ O
some _ _ O
wall _ _ O
panels _ _ O
with _ _ O
grasscloth, _ _ O
put _ _ O
glove-soft _ _ O
leather _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
tabletops, _ _ O
and _ _ O
found _ _ O
other _ _ O
ways _ _ O
to _ _ O
dampen _ _ O
the _ _ O
noise. _ _ O
Legacy _ _ O
Records _ _ O
certainly _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
look _ _ O
like _ _ O
any _ _ O
other _ _ O
restaurant; _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Fulk _ _ O
went _ _ O
to _ _ O
extremes, _ _ O
using _ _ O
some _ _ O
motifs _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
1980s _ _ O
-- _ _ O
emphatic _ _ O
grids, _ _ O
metallic _ _ O
finishes, _ _ O
whites _ _ O
and _ _ O
country-club _ _ O
greens _ _ O
-- _ _ O
that _ _ O
not _ _ O
everybody _ _ O
is _ _ O
ready _ _ O
to _ _ O
see _ _ O
resurrected. _ _ O
Hanging _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
bar _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
2006 _ _ O
photograph _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O

name _ _ O
-- _ _ O
taken, _ _ O
we _ _ O
are _ _ O
told, _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
recording _ _ O
studio _ _ O
that _ _ O
once _ _ O
stood _ _ O
on _ _ O
this _ _ O
site _ _ O
-- _ _ O
Legacy _ _ O
Records _ _ O
tries _ _ O
to _ _ O
present _ _ O
itself _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
homage _ _ O
to _ _ O
another _ _ O
era _ _ O
in _ _ O
music. _ _ O
If _ _ O
Legacy _ _ O
Recording _ _ O
Studios _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
used _ _ O
by _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Gaye, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Wonder _ _ O
and _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Ross, _ _ O
that _ _ O
homage _ _ O
might _ _ O
make _ _ O
sense. _ _ O
But _ _ O
it _ _ O
didn't. _ _ O
Lasting _ _ O
just _ _ O
from _ _ O
2001 _ _ O
to _ _ O
2009, _ _ O
the _ _ O
studio _ _ O
was _ _ O
built _ _ O
for _ _ O
and _ _ O
mostly _ _ O
used _ _ O
by _ _ O
orchestras, _ _ O
Broadway _ _ O
cast _ _ O
recordings _ _ O
and _ _ O
commercials. _ _ O
Legacy _ _ O
Records _ _ O
has _ _ O
taken _ _ O
this _ _ O
shred _ _ O
of _ _ O
history _ _ O
and _ _ O
turned _ _ O
it _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
fantasy _ _ O
of _ _ O
black _ _ O
American _ _ O
music. _ _ O
Exhibited _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
museum _ _ O
or _ _ O
gallery, _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Thomas's _ _ O
photo _ _ O
might _ _ O
be _ _ O
taken _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
comment _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
different _ _ O
postures _ _ O
and _ _ O
personas _ _ O
available _ _ O
to _ _ O
black _ _ O
women. _ _ O
Hanging _ _ O
it _ _ O
next _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
counter _ _ O
where _ _ O
pastries _ _ O
and _ _ O
coffee _ _ O
are _ _ O
sold _ _ O
by _ _ O
day _ _ O
strips _ _ O
out _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
meaning; _ _ O
it _ _ O
looks _ _ O
like _ _ O
an _ _ O
attempt _ _ O
to _ _ O
buy _ _ O
a _ _ O
personality _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
have _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
own. _ _ O
If _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
gets _ _ O
to _ _ O
decide _ _ O
who _ _ O
can _ _ O
use _ _ O
black _ _ O
culture _ _ O
for _ _ O
what _ _ O
purposes, _ _ O
it _ _ O
surely _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
me. _ _ O
But _ _ O
Legacy _ _ O
Records _ _ O
uses _ _ O
it _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
gratuitous _ _ O
and _ _ O
offhanded _ _ O
way _ _ O
that _ _ O
made _ _ O
me _ _ O
uncomfortable. _ _ O
Stevie _ _ O

will _ _ O
always _ _ O

cool, _ _ O
but _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
dreamed _ _ O
up _ _ O

At _ _ O
some _ _ O
fateful _ _ O
moment _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
13th _ _ O
century _ _ O
when _ _ O
Kublai _ _ O
Khan _ _ O
was _ _ O
preparing _ _ O
to _ _ O
lead _ _ O
the _ _ O
Mongol _ _ O
hordes _ _ O
into _ _ O
battle, _ _ O
hunger _ _ O
struck. _ _ O
With _ _ O
no _ _ O
time _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
a _ _ O
roast _ _ B-FOOD
or _ _ O
stew, _ _ B-FOOD
the _ _ O
legend _ _ O
goes, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Great _ _ O
Khan's _ _ O
chef _ _ O
carved _ _ O
very _ _ O
thin _ _ O
slices _ _ O
of _ _ O
raw _ _ O
mutton _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
plunged _ _ O
them _ _ O
into _ _ O
hot _ _ O
broth _ _ B-FOOD
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
seconds. _ _ O
Besides _ _ O
serving _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
inspiration _ _ O
to _ _ O
those _ _ O
of _ _ O
us _ _ O
who _ _ O
believe _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
always _ _ O
time _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat, _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef's _ _ O
impromptu _ _ O
recipe _ _ O
is _ _ O
said _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
given _ _ O
China _ _ B-LOC
its _ _ O
ancient _ _ O
and _ _ O
delicious _ _ O
hot _ _ B-FOOD
pot _ _ I-FOOD
tradition. _ _ O
Hot _ _ O
pots _ _ O
did _ _ O
not _ _ O
jump _ _ O
to _ _ O
Japan _ _ B-LOC
until _ _ O
shortly _ _ O
after _ _ O
World _ _ O
War _ _ O
II, _ _ O
when _ _ O
kelp _ _ B-FOOD
joined _ _ O
the _ _ O
broth _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
name _ _ O
was _ _ O
changed, _ _ O
onomatopoetically, _ _ O
to _ _ O
shabu _ _ B-DISH
shabu. _ _ I-DISH
But _ _ O
like _ _ O
hot _ _ B-FOOD
pots _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
China, _ _ B-LOC
shabu _ _ B-FOOD
shabu _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
do-it-yourself _ _ O
bash _ _ O
where _ _ O
everybody _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
gets _ _ O
to _ _ O
dunk _ _ O
and _ _ O
swish _ _ O
the _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
they _ _ O
like _ _ O
best. _ _ O
Chefs _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
required. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
on _ _ O
Delancey _ _ B-LOC
Street _ _ I-LOC
last _ _ O
fall, _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
shabu _ _ B-TYPE
shabu _ _ I-TYPE
restaurant _ _ O
appeared _ _ O
where _ _ O
a _ _ O
chef _ _ O
standing _ _ O
behind _ _ O
a _ _ O
counter _ _ O
does _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
for _ _ O
no _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
eight _ _ O
people _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
time. _ _ O
Her _ _ O
name _ _ O
is _ _ O
Mako _ _ O
Okano. _ _ O
Out _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
style _ _ O
of _ _ O
dining _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
always _ _ O
been _ _ O
a _ _ O
big, _ _ O
informal _ _ O
free-for-all, _ _ O
she _ _ O
has _ _ O
built _ _ O
a _ _ O
quiet, _ _ O
refined, _ _ O
intimate _ _ O
spot _ _ O
called _ _ O
Shabushabu _ _ B-EST
Macoron _ _ I-EST
. _ _ O
Usually _ _ O
backed _ _ O
up _ _ O
by _ _ O
two _ _ O
other _ _ O
women, _ _ O
but _ _ O
occasionally _ _ O
working _ _ O
solo, _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Okano _ _ O
moves _ _ O
deliberately. _ _ O
She _ _ O
will _ _ O
gesture _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
place _ _ O
mat, _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
night's _ _ O
eight _ _ O
or _ _ O
10 _ _ O
courses _ _ O
are _ _ O
written _ _ O
out _ _ O
in _ _ O
Japanese, _ _ O
right _ _ O
to _ _ O
left, _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
to _ _ O
another _ _ O
slip _ _ O
of _ _ O
paper _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
courses _ _ O
printed _ _ O
in _ _ O
English, _ _ O
again _ _ O
right _ _ O
to _ _ O
left. _ _ O
The _ _ O
price _ _ O
is _ _ O
$128. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
no _ _ O
choices _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
made. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Okano _ _ O
has _ _ O
modeled _ _ O
her _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
on _ _ O
omakase _ _ B-TYPE
sushi _ _ I-TYPE
bars, _ _ I-TYPE
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
calls _ _ O
the _ _ O
tune. _ _ O
When _ _ O
I _ _ O
first _ _ O
arrived, _ _ O
I _ _ O
admit _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
couldn't _ _ O
see _ _ O
the _ _ O
point _ _ O
of _ _ O
having _ _ O
a _ _ O
chef _ _ O
do _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
when _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
perfectly _ _ O
able _ _ O
to _ _ O
do _ _ O
my _ _ O
own _ _ O
dunking _ _ O
and _ _ O
swishing. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Okano _ _ O
quickly _ _ O
poured _ _ O
two _ _ O
or _ _ O
three _ _ O
mouthfuls _ _ O
of _ _ O
yeasty, _ _ O
warm _ _ O
unfiltered _ _ O
sake _ _ B-FOOD
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
saucer. _ _ O
This _ _ O
arrived _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
snack _ _ O
-- _ _ O
cured _ _ B-DISH
salmon _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ I-DISH
salmon _ _ I-DISH
roe _ _ I-DISH
seasoned _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
fermented _ _ I-DISH
rice _ _ I-DISH
-- _ _ O
that _ _ O
artfully _ _ O
underscored _ _ O
the _ _ O
sake's _ _ B-FOOD
flavor. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
she _ _ O
turned _ _ O
and _ _ O
quietly _ _ O
addressed _ _ O
a _ _ O
sauté _ _ O
pan _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
stove. _ _ O
When _ _ O
she _ _ O
turned _ _ O
around _ _ O
again _ _ O
she _ _ O
had _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
an _ _ O
omelet _ _ B-DISH
and _ _ O
flicked _ _ O
it _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
roll _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Japanese _ _ B-CUISINE
style. _ _ O
Served _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
hot, _ _ O
clear _ _ O
dashi, _ _ B-FOOD
the _ _ O
egg _ _ B-FOOD
was _ _ O
as _ _ O
tender _ _ O
and _ _ O
delicate _ _ O
as _ _ O
its _ _ O
garnish, _ _ O
a _ _ O
tiny _ _ O
piece _ _ O
of _ _ O
mitsuba _ _ O
stem _ _ O
tied _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
knot. _ _ O
Next _ _ O
she _ _ O
poached _ _ O
two _ _ O
pieces _ _ O
of _ _ O
abalone _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
seconds _ _ O
each _ _ O
in _ _ O
abalone _ _ O
broth. _ _ O
One _ _ O
she _ _ O
dabbed _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
small, _ _ O
intense _ _ O
blip _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Japanese _ _ O
spice _ _ O
paste _ _ O
yuzu _ _ O
kosho. _ _ O
Over _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
she _ _ O
spooned _ _ O
a _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
abalone's _ _ O
liver. _ _ O
I _ _ O
ate _ _ O
them _ _ O
both, _ _ O
and _ _ O
was _ _ O
flooded _ _ O
first _ _ O
with _ _ O
pleasure _ _ O
then _ _ O
with _ _ O
embarrassment _ _ O
that _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
thought _ _ O
simmered _ _ O
food _ _ O
wasn't _ _ O
worth _ _ O
a _ _ O
chef's _ _ O
time. _ _ O
By _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
eaten _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
tongue _ _ O
of _ _ O
sea _ _ O
urchin _ _ O
combined _ _ O
with _ _ O
silky _ _ O
rags _ _ O
of _ _ O
yuba _ _ O
still _ _ O
dripping _ _ O
with _ _ O
soy _ _ O
milk, _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
on _ _ O
board _ _ O
for _ _ O
anything _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Okano _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
to _ _ O
cook. _ _ O
For _ _ O
some _ _ O
time _ _ O
the _ _ O
bubbles _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
iron _ _ O
pot _ _ O
of _ _ O
dashi _ _ O
set _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
countertop _ _ O
burner _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
getting _ _ O
bigger _ _ O
and _ _ O
faster. _ _ O
Thin _ _ O
strips _ _ O
of _ _ O
Wagyu _ _ O
beef, _ _ O
streaked _ _ O
with _ _ O
so _ _ O
much _ _ O
fat _ _ O
they _ _ O
looked _ _ O
like _ _ O
stained _ _ O
glass, _ _ O
were _ _ O
stretched _ _ O
out _ _ O
on _ _ O
black _ _ O
slate _ _ O
with _ _ O
pinkish _ _ O
bands _ _ O
of _ _ O
pork _ _ O
belly. _ _ O
Raw _ _ O
vegetables _ _ O
-- _ _ O
cabbage, _ _ O
lettuce, _ _ O
enoki _ _ O
and _ _ O
shiitake _ _ O
mushrooms, _ _ O
half _ _ O
a _ _ O
brussels _ _ O
sprout _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
cherry _ _ O
tomato _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
wooden _ _ O
spear _ _ O
-- _ _ O
waited _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
nearby _ _ O
plate. _ _ O
Before _ _ O
I _ _ O
knew _ _ O
it _ _ O
she _ _ O
had _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
piece _ _ O
of _ _ O
beef _ _ O
-- _ _ O
was _ _ O
it _ _ O
the _ _ O
A5 _ _ O
from _ _ O
Miyazaki _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
A4 _ _ O
from _ _ O
Kagoshima? _ _ O
The _ _ O
flesh _ _ O
had _ _ O
twisted _ _ O
itself _ _ O
around, _ _ O
and _ _ O
now _ _ O
dusk-gray _ _ O
outer _ _ O
curls _ _ O
hid _ _ O
inner _ _ O
curves _ _ O
of _ _ O
faded _ _ O
pink. _ _ O
The _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
moved _ _ O
in _ _ O
rapid _ _ O
waves: _ _ O
first _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
clinging, _ _ O
savory _ _ O
drops _ _ O
of _ _ O
dashi, _ _ O
then _ _ O
some _ _ O
already-melted _ _ O
beef _ _ O
fat, _ _ O
followed _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
lean _ _ O
meat _ _ O
itself, _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
and _ _ O
refined. _ _ O
Finally _ _ O
came _ _ O
a _ _ O
second _ _ O
helping _ _ O
of _ _ O
fat, _ _ O
freshly _ _ O
melted _ _ O
now. _ _ O
When _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Okano _ _ O
fished _ _ O
out _ _ O
a _ _ O
piece _ _ O
of _ _ O
beef, _ _ O
she _ _ O
would _ _ O
suggest _ _ O
seasoning _ _ O
it _ _ O
with _ _ O
one _ _ O
or _ _ O
more _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
almost _ _ O
comically _ _ O
large _ _ O
assortment _ _ O
of _ _ O
condiments _ _ O
and _ _ O
purées _ _ O
that _ _ O
she _ _ O
makes _ _ O
herself. _ _ O
She _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
to _ _ O
favor _ _ O
her _ _ O
ponzu, _ _ O
and _ _ O
so _ _ O
do _ _ O
I; _ _ O
it's _ _ O
more _ _ O
radiant _ _ O
with _ _ O
yuzu _ _ O
than _ _ O
any _ _ O
I've _ _ O
had _ _ O
before. _ _ O
I _ _ O
also _ _ O
liked _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
soy _ _ O
once _ _ O
I _ _ O
learned _ _ O
to _ _ O
doctor _ _ O
it _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
drops _ _ O
of _ _ O
what _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Okano _ _ O
calls _ _ O
"gravy _ _ O
sauce," _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark _ _ O
liquid _ _ O
that _ _ O
makes _ _ O
meat _ _ O
taste _ _ O
meatier. _ _ O
Many _ _ O
dismal _ _ O
meals _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
saved _ _ O
if _ _ O
I _ _ O
carried _ _ O
an _ _ O
eyedropper _ _ O
of _ _ O
gravy _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
around _ _ O
with _ _ O
me. _ _ O
Swabbing _ _ O
the _ _ O
pork _ _ O
belly _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
sticky, _ _ O
thick _ _ O
sesame _ _ O
paste _ _ O
with _ _ O
toasted _ _ O
sesame _ _ O
seeds _ _ O
produces _ _ O
an _ _ O
effect _ _ O
similar _ _ O
to, _ _ O
but _ _ O
more _ _ O
subtle _ _ O
than, _ _ O
the _ _ O
combination _ _ O
of _ _ O
peanut _ _ O
butter _ _ O
and _ _ O
bacon. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
even _ _ O
better _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
smear _ _ O
of _ _ O
salted _ _ O
plum, _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
drops _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
yuzu-olive _ _ O
oil _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
that _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
jetted _ _ O
in _ _ O
from _ _ O
Italy. _ _ O
The _ _ O
vegetables _ _ O
were _ _ O
spotless _ _ O
and _ _ O
fresh. _ _ O
A _ _ O
meal _ _ O
without _ _ O
them _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
off _ _ O
kilter, _ _ O
perhaps _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
degree _ _ O
that _ _ O
would _ _ O
cause _ _ O
grumbling _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
digestive _ _ O
system, _ _ O
but _ _ O
on _ _ O
their _ _ O
own _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
a _ _ O
reason _ _ O
to _ _ O
go _ _ O
to _ _ O
Shabushabu _ _ O
Macoron. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
meatballs _ _ O
are, _ _ O
though. _ _ O
So _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
green _ _ O
tea _ _ O
soba _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
that _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Okano _ _ O
somehow _ _ O
manages _ _ O
to _ _ O
cook _ _ O
in _ _ O
between _ _ O
everything _ _ O
else _ _ O
without _ _ O
seeming _ _ O
to _ _ O
leave _ _ O
the _ _ O
few _ _ O
square _ _ O
feet _ _ O
behind _ _ O
the _ _ O
counter. _ _ O
Soba _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
standard _ _ O
with _ _ O
shabu _ _ O
shabu, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
something _ _ O
she _ _ O
has _ _ O
experience _ _ O
making _ _ O
from _ _ O
her _ _ O
time _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
at _ _ O
Cocoron _ _ O
, _ _ O
a _ _ O
soba-ya _ _ O
across _ _ O
Delancey _ _ O
Street. _ _ O
When _ _ O
she _ _ O
began _ _ O
talking _ _ O
about _ _ O
her _ _ O
dream _ _ O
of _ _ O
opening _ _ O
what _ _ O
she _ _ O
hoped _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
world's _ _ O
first _ _ O
omakase _ _ O
shabu _ _ O
shabu _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
Cocoron's _ _ O
owners _ _ O
listened. _ _ O
When _ _ O
she _ _ O
came _ _ O
back _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
dunk-and-swish _ _ O
tour _ _ O
of _ _ O
Japan, _ _ O
they _ _ O
signed _ _ O
on _ _ O
as _ _ O
her _ _ O
partners. _ _ O
At _ _ O
times, _ _ O
it _ _ O
seems _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Okano _ _ O
can't _ _ O
believe _ _ O
it _ _ O
all _ _ O
worked _ _ O
out. _ _ O
After _ _ O
she'd _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
me _ _ O
three _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
identical _ _ O
meals, _ _ O
I _ _ O
wondered _ _ O
if _ _ O
she'd _ _ O
still _ _ O
be _ _ O
as _ _ O
giddy _ _ O
a _ _ O
year _ _ O
from _ _ O
now. _ _ O
Will _ _ O
she _ _ O
be _ _ O
able _ _ O
to _ _ O
change _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
seasons _ _ O
to _ _ O
keep _ _ O
things _ _ O
interesting? _ _ O
Can _ _ O
she _ _ O
stash _ _ O
surprise _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
below _ _ O
the _ _ O
counter _ _ O
for _ _ O
repeat _ _ O
customers, _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
sushi _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
do? _ _ O
None _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O
questions _ _ O
occurred _ _ O
to _ _ O
me _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
two _ _ O
times _ _ O
I _ _ O
ate _ _ O
at _ _ O
her _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
I _ _ O
just _ _ O
sat _ _ O
there _ _ O
in _ _ O
something _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
state _ _ O
of _ _ O
wonder _ _ O
while _ _ O
she _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
for _ _ O
me. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is, _ _ O
bizarrely, _ _ O
a _ _ O
rare _ _ O
experience _ _ O
at _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
counters, _ _ O
where _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
are _ _ O
often _ _ O
intent _ _ O
on _ _ O
intricacies _ _ O
of _ _ O
plating. _ _ O
The _ _ O
physical _ _ O
setting _ _ O
of _ _ O
Shabushabu _ _ O
Macoron _ _ O
strongly _ _ O
suggests _ _ O
a _ _ O
shoestring _ _ O
budget _ _ O
-- _ _ O
the _ _ O
paper _ _ O
towel _ _ O
roll _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
restroom _ _ O
hangs _ _ O
from _ _ O
what _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
an _ _ O
actual _ _ O
shoestring _ _ O
-- _ _ O
but _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
there _ _ O
while _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Okano _ _ O
stands _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
inches _ _ O
away _ _ O
and _ _ O
makes _ _ O
your _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
luxurious _ _ O
experiences _ _ O

Ever _ _ O
since _ _ O
Rich _ _ O
Torrisi _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mario _ _ O
Carbone _ _ O
began _ _ O
rehabilitating _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-DISH
Parm _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
Neapolitan _ _ B-DISH
cookies _ _ I-DISH
around _ _ O
2010, _ _ O
I've _ _ O
been _ _ O
waiting _ _ O
for _ _ O
other _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
to _ _ O
carry _ _ O
the _ _ O
torch _ _ O
of _ _ O
Italian-American _ _ B-CUISINE
food _ _ O
boldly _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
future. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
major _ _ O
branch _ _ O
of _ _ O
American _ _ B-CUISINE
cuisine, _ _ O
too _ _ O
important _ _ O
for _ _ O
its _ _ O
fate _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
left _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
Olive _ _ B-EST
Garden. _ _ I-EST
For _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
part, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
the _ _ O
torch _ _ O
has _ _ O
gone _ _ O
uncarried. _ _ O
I _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
told _ _ O
that _ _ O
Palizzi _ _ B-EST
Social _ _ I-EST
Club, _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
Philadelphia, _ _ B-LOC
may _ _ O
qualify, _ _ O
but _ _ O
because _ _ O
Palizzi _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
veritable _ _ O
club _ _ O
-- _ _ O
members _ _ O
and _ _ O
guests _ _ O
only, _ _ O
no _ _ O
new _ _ O
applications _ _ O
accepted _ _ O
-- _ _ O
I _ _ O
don't _ _ O
expect _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat _ _ O
there _ _ O
before _ _ O
the _ _ O
nation's _ _ O
tricentennial. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
in _ _ O
October, _ _ O
a _ _ O
place _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
West _ _ B-LOC
Village _ _ I-LOC
that _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
to _ _ O
hit _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
right _ _ O
tropes. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
called _ _ O
Don _ _ B-EST
Angie _ _ I-EST
. _ _ O
Two _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
share _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
-- _ _ O
Angela _ _ O
Rito _ _ O
and _ _ O
her _ _ O
husband, _ _ O
Scott _ _ O
Tacinelli _ _ O
-- _ _ O
and _ _ O
they _ _ O
make _ _ O
versions _ _ O
of _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-DISH
scarpariello _ _ I-DISH
, _ _ O
antipasto _ _ B-DISH
salad _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
braciole. _ _ B-DISH
The _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
brings _ _ O
back _ _ O
the _ _ O
high-glitz _ _ O
Italian _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurant _ _ O
décor _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
1970s _ _ O
and _ _ O
'80s, _ _ O
the _ _ O
period _ _ O
when _ _ O
Formica _ _ O
and _ _ O
oil _ _ O
paintings _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Bay _ _ B-LOC
of _ _ I-LOC
Naples _ _ I-LOC
went _ _ O
out _ _ O
and _ _ O
mirrors _ _ O
with _ _ O
gold _ _ O
pinstripes _ _ O
came _ _ O
in. _ _ O
The _ _ O
floor _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
black-and-white _ _ O
checkerboard. _ _ O
The _ _ O
bar _ _ O
is _ _ O
made _ _ O
of _ _ O
polished _ _ O
marble _ _ O
the _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
beef _ _ B-DISH
carpaccio. _ _ I-DISH
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
house _ _ O
Chianti, _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
comes _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
straw-covered _ _ O
bottle. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
hope _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
red-sauce _ _ O
renaissance, _ _ O
after _ _ O
all. _ _ O
Unfortunately, _ _ O
more _ _ O
or _ _ O
less _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
day _ _ O
it _ _ O
opened, _ _ O
having _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
at _ _ O
Don _ _ B-EST
Angie _ _ I-EST
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
only _ _ O
marginally _ _ O
less _ _ O
difficult _ _ O
than _ _ O
eating _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
private _ _ O
club. _ _ O
That _ _ O
has _ _ O
something _ _ O
to _ _ O
do _ _ O
with _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Rito's _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Tacinelli's _ _ O
knack _ _ O
for _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
things _ _ O
that _ _ O
Instagram _ _ O
can't _ _ O
resist. _ _ O
The _ _ O
two _ _ O
spent _ _ O
three _ _ O
years _ _ O
running _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
at _ _ O
Quality _ _ B-EST
Italian _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
Midtown, _ _ B-LOC
where _ _ O
they _ _ O
engineered, _ _ O
among _ _ O
other _ _ O
pieces _ _ O
of _ _ O
shutterbait, _ _ O
a _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-DISH
Parm _ _ I-DISH
that _ _ O
looked _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
pizza. _ _ B-FOOD
There _ _ O
was _ _ O
some _ _ O
wonderful _ _ O
stuff _ _ O
at _ _ O
Quality _ _ B-EST
Italian _ _ I-EST
and _ _ O
some _ _ O
less _ _ O
wonderful _ _ O
stuff, _ _ O
and _ _ O
almost _ _ O
all _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
either _ _ O
arrived _ _ O
on _ _ O
trolleys _ _ O
or _ _ O
was _ _ O
prepared _ _ O
at _ _ O
tableside _ _ O
or _ _ O
set _ _ O
on _ _ O
fire _ _ O
while _ _ O
you _ _ O
watched. _ _ O
The _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
group _ _ O
behind _ _ O
Quality _ _ B-EST
Italian, _ _ I-EST
Quality _ _ O
Branded _ _ O
, _ _ O
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
backing _ _ O
Don _ _ B-EST
Angie. _ _ I-EST
So _ _ O
as _ _ O
I _ _ O
resigned _ _ O
myself _ _ O
to _ _ O
eating _ _ O
at _ _ O
Don _ _ B-EST
Angie _ _ I-EST
close _ _ O
to _ _ O
5:30 _ _ O
p.m., _ _ O
when _ _ O
I _ _ O
managed _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
an _ _ O
unreserved _ _ O
table, _ _ O
I _ _ O
also _ _ O
braced _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
dose _ _ O
of _ _ O
abracadabra. _ _ O
It _ _ O
arrived _ _ O
right _ _ O
on _ _ O
schedule _ _ O
with _ _ O
my _ _ O
first _ _ O
drink, _ _ O
which _ _ O
a _ _ O
server _ _ O
strained _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
glass _ _ O
through _ _ O
a _ _ O
coffee _ _ O
filter _ _ O
cone _ _ O
lined _ _ O
with _ _ O
espresso _ _ B-FOOD
ice. _ _ I-FOOD
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
called _ _ O
Americano, _ _ B-DISH
Americano, _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
combined _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
three _ _ O
meanings _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
word: _ _ O
a _ _ O
highball, _ _ B-DISH
an _ _ O
Italian _ _ B-CUISINE
aperitif _ _ B-FOOD
wine _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
diluted _ _ O
shot _ _ O
of _ _ O
espresso. _ _ B-FOOD
The _ _ O
Americano _ _ B-DISH
highball, _ _ I-DISH
so _ _ O
simple _ _ O
that _ _ O
just _ _ O
about _ _ O
any _ _ O
bartender _ _ O
can _ _ O
make _ _ O
it, _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
need _ _ O
much _ _ O
improvement. _ _ O
But _ _ O
I _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
admit _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
coffee _ _ B-FOOD
did _ _ O
give _ _ O
it _ _ O
some _ _ O
ballast. _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
also _ _ O
happy _ _ O
to _ _ O
report _ _ O
that _ _ O
this _ _ O
was _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
bits _ _ O
of _ _ O

I _ _ O

at _ _ O
Don _ _ B-EST
Angie. _ _ I-EST
Ms. _ _ O
Rito _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Tacinelli _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
tricks _ _ O
up _ _ O
their _ _ O
sleeves, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
save _ _ O
them _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen. _ _ O
The _ _ O
result _ _ O
is _ _ O
food _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
creative _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
more _ _ O
interesting _ _ O
and _ _ O
more _ _ O
consistently _ _ O
successful _ _ O
way _ _ O
than _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
at _ _ O
Quality _ _ B-EST
Italian. _ _ I-EST
And _ _ O
it _ _ O
arrives _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
without _ _ O
the _ _ O
aid _ _ O
of _ _ O
trolleys. _ _ O
When _ _ O
you _ _ O
get _ _ O
a _ _ O
Caesar _ _ B-DISH
salad, _ _ I-DISH
the _ _ O
server _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
whip _ _ O
together _ _ O
the _ _ O
dressing _ _ B-FOOD
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
spot. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
been _ _ O
done _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen, _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
replaced _ _ O
romaine _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
tender _ _ O
chrysanthemum _ _ B-FOOD
leaves _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
taste _ _ O
like _ _ O
some _ _ O
newly _ _ O
discovered _ _ O
herb. _ _ O
(The _ _ O
feathery _ _ O
leaves _ _ O
firmly _ _ O
grip _ _ O
the _ _ O
dressing _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
fluffy _ _ O
rasped _ _ O
cheese, _ _ B-FOOD
too.) _ _ O
I _ _ O
can't _ _ O
remember _ _ O
seeing _ _ O
chrysanthemum _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
Italian _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurant _ _ O
before, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
shows _ _ O
the _ _ O
chefs' _ _ O
skill _ _ O
for _ _ O
cross-pollinating _ _ O
with _ _ O
other _ _ O
cuisines, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
Asian _ _ B-CUISINE
ones. _ _ O
While _ _ O
the _ _ O
Torrisi-Carbone _ _ B-EST
axis _ _ O
is _ _ O
generally _ _ O
faithful _ _ O
to _ _ O
Italian-American _ _ B-CUISINE
standards, _ _ O
using _ _ O
more _ _ O
expensive _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
and _ _ O
more _ _ O
modern _ _ O
techniques _ _ O
but _ _ O
leaving _ _ O
the _ _ O
basic _ _ O
ideas _ _ O
intact, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Rito-Tacinelli _ _ O
approach _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
radical. _ _ O
They _ _ O
trample _ _ O
on _ _ O
tradition _ _ O
when _ _ O
they _ _ O
feel _ _ O
like _ _ O
it. _ _ O
Prosciutto _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
honeydew _ _ B-FOOD
melon _ _ I-FOOD
are _ _ O
tossed _ _ O
with _ _ O
candied _ _ B-FOOD
hazelnuts _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
mint _ _ B-FOOD
leaves _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
lime, _ _ B-FOOD
tamarind _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ I-FOOD
fish-sauce _ _ I-FOOD
dressing. _ _ I-FOOD
This _ _ O
very _ _ O
good _ _ O
salad, _ _ B-FOOD
which _ _ O
obviously _ _ O
glances _ _ O
toward _ _ O
Southeast _ _ B-LOC
Asia, _ _ I-LOC
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
smart _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
handle _ _ O
an _ _ O
antipasto _ _ O
standby _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
usually _ _ O
pointless _ _ O
except _ _ O
when _ _ O
melons _ _ B-FOOD
are _ _ O
in _ _ O
season. _ _ O
Their _ _ O
garlic _ _ B-DISH
bread _ _ I-DISH
turns _ _ O
out _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
very _ _ O
thin _ _ O
disc _ _ O
with _ _ O
garlic _ _ B-FOOD
chives _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
melted _ _ O
cheese _ _ O
inside _ _ O
and _ _ O
sesame _ _ O
seeds _ _ O
on _ _ O
top. _ _ O
Lightweight, _ _ O
salty _ _ O
and _ _ O
irresistible, _ _ O
it's _ _ O
modeled _ _ O
on _ _ O
Ligurian _ _ O
focaccia _ _ O
di _ _ O
recco, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
may _ _ O
also _ _ O
bring _ _ O
to _ _ O
mind _ _ O
Turkish _ _ O
gozleme, _ _ O
Azeri _ _ O
kutab _ _ O
or _ _ O
even _ _ O
a _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
scallion _ _ O
pancake. _ _ O
There's _ _ O
China _ _ O
again, _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
pepperoni _ _ O
fried _ _ O
rice _ _ O
served _ _ O
under _ _ O
barbecued _ _ O
squid. _ _ O
Ignore _ _ O
the _ _ O
squid _ _ O
unless _ _ O
you _ _ O
like _ _ O
it _ _ O
leathery, _ _ O
and _ _ O
just _ _ O
focus _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
rice, _ _ O
stirring _ _ O
it _ _ O
with _ _ O
labneh _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
heat _ _ O
starts _ _ O
to _ _ O
rise. _ _ O
The _ _ O
dish _ _ O
everybody _ _ O
has _ _ O
seen _ _ O
on _ _ O
Instagram _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
called _ _ O
caramelle. _ _ O
In _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
it _ _ O
means _ _ O
caramel, _ _ O
as _ _ O
in _ _ O
candy, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
shape _ _ O
will _ _ O
remind _ _ O
most _ _ O
Americans _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
elongated _ _ O
Tootsie _ _ O
Roll, _ _ O
with _ _ O
twists _ _ O
at _ _ O
either _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
drum _ _ O
that's _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
buffalo _ _ O
ricotta. _ _ O
Cameras _ _ O
come _ _ O
out _ _ O
because _ _ O
the _ _ O
dough _ _ O
is _ _ O
striped, _ _ O
with _ _ O
black _ _ O
sesame-flour _ _ O
bands _ _ O
alternating _ _ O
with _ _ O
ordinary _ _ O
egg _ _ O
pasta. _ _ O
The _ _ O
sesame _ _ O
barely _ _ O
registers; _ _ O
the _ _ O
fun _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
sauce, _ _ O
a _ _ O
peppered, _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
cantaloupe _ _ O
that _ _ O
tastes _ _ O
like _ _ O
it's _ _ O
still _ _ O
percolating. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
that _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
Don _ _ O
Angie's _ _ O
lasting _ _ O
contribution _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
sciences _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
garganelli _ _ O
with _ _ O
meatball _ _ O
ragù. _ _ O
The _ _ O
central _ _ O
problem _ _ O
of _ _ O
red-sauce _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
is _ _ O
this: _ _ O
Pasta _ _ O
and _ _ O
meatballs _ _ O
are _ _ O
always _ _ O
served _ _ O
together, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
remain _ _ O
stubbornly _ _ O
separate. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Rito _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Tacinelli _ _ O
have _ _ O
found _ _ O
a _ _ O
way _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
conundrum _ _ O
by _ _ O
crushing _ _ O
meatballs _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
tomato-guanciale _ _ O
ragù. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
not _ _ O
quite _ _ O
as _ _ O
simple _ _ O
as _ _ O
I've _ _ O
made _ _ O
it _ _ O
sound, _ _ O
but _ _ O
you _ _ O
don't _ _ O
know _ _ O
that _ _ O
when _ _ O
you're _ _ O
eating _ _ O
it; _ _ O
you _ _ O
just _ _ O
think _ _ O
you're _ _ O
magically _ _ O
eating _ _ O
meatballs _ _ O
and _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
time. _ _ O
They've _ _ O
also _ _ O
tried _ _ O
to _ _ O
salvage _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
scarpariello, _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
almost _ _ O
always _ _ O
overcooked. _ _ O
Their _ _ O
solution _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
a _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
pie _ _ O
with _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
meat _ _ O
pressed _ _ O
down _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
crust _ _ O
made _ _ O
of _ _ O
sausage. _ _ O
The _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
are _ _ O
accurate, _ _ O
and _ _ O
for _ _ O
once _ _ O
it's _ _ O
not _ _ O
dry, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it's _ _ O
not _ _ O
as _ _ O
engaging _ _ O
as _ _ O
other _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
veal _ _ O
cutlet _ _ O
with _ _ O
speck _ _ O
and _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
mustard _ _ O
seeds, _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
fillet _ _ O
of _ _ O
orata _ _ O
next _ _ O
to _ _ O
herbed _ _ O
fregola, _ _ O
with _ _ O
buttermilk _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
Reworking _ _ O
tiramisù _ _ O
almost _ _ O
never _ _ O
improves _ _ O
it, _ _ O
but _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
change _ _ O
of _ _ O
pace _ _ O
I _ _ O
did _ _ O
like _ _ O
how _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
at _ _ O
Don _ _ O
Angie _ _ O
shifted _ _ O
the _ _ O
emphasis _ _ O
from _ _ O
espresso _ _ O
to _ _ O
bittersweet _ _ O
cocoa. _ _ O
There's _ _ O
a _ _ O
delicious, _ _ O
if _ _ O
more _ _ O
conventional, _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
tender, _ _ O
light _ _ O
zeppole _ _ O
with _ _ O
tangy _ _ O
whipped _ _ O
robiola _ _ O
under _ _ O
an _ _ O
Andy _ _ O
Warhol _ _ O
mop _ _ O
of _ _ O
spun _ _ O
sugar _ _ O
that _ _ O
people _ _ O
go _ _ O
wild _ _ O
for. _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
charmed _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
smaller, _ _ O
quieter _ _ O
dessert: _ _ O
a _ _ O
mochi _ _ O
cake _ _ O
stuffed _ _ O
with _ _ O
fior _ _ O
di _ _ O
latte _ _ O
ice _ _ O
cream, _ _ O
with _ _ O
sea _ _ O
salt _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
fragrant _ _ O
scribble _ _ O
of _ _ O
olive _ _ O
oil. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
like _ _ O
eating _ _ O
a _ _ O
mozzarella _ _ O
ball _ _ O
that _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
to _ _ O
become _ _ O
a _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
grew _ _ O
up, _ _ O
and _ _ O
did. _ _ O

Anthony _ _ O
Bourdain _ _ O
entered _ _ O
the _ _ O
literary _ _ O
stage _ _ O
with _ _ O
an _ _ O
inside _ _ O
tip, _ _ O
delivered _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
gruff _ _ O
whisper _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
racetrack _ _ O
tout: _ _ O
Don't _ _ O
order _ _ O
fish _ _ B-FOOD
on _ _ O
Mondays. _ _ O
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
part _ _ O
that _ _ O
everybody _ _ O
remembered _ _ O
from _ _ O
his _ _ O
first _ _ O
published _ _ O
work, _ _ O
a _ _ O
long _ _ O
essay _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
unglamorous _ _ O
and _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
unsavory _ _ O
work _ _ O
of _ _ O
cooks _ _ O
and _ _ O
dishwashers _ _ O
that _ _ O
ran _ _ O
in _ _ O
The _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorker _ _ O
in _ _ O
1999 _ _ O
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
made _ _ O
it _ _ O
almost _ _ O
impossible _ _ O
for _ _ O
waiters _ _ O
to _ _ O
sell _ _ O
seafood _ _ B-FOOD
between _ _ O
Sunday _ _ O
and _ _ O
Tuesday _ _ O
for _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
a _ _ O
decade. _ _ O
And _ _ O
the _ _ O
advice _ _ O
gave _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Bourdain, _ _ O
a _ _ O
journeyman _ _ O
cook _ _ O
and _ _ O
chef _ _ O
nobody _ _ O
had _ _ O
heard _ _ O
of, _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
career. _ _ O
Before _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
found _ _ O
dead _ _ O
on _ _ O
Friday _ _ O
, _ _ O
in _ _ O
what _ _ O
the _ _ O
authorities _ _ O
were _ _ O
treating _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
suicide, _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
witty, _ _ O
connected _ _ O
guide _ _ O
who, _ _ O
in _ _ O
memoirs, _ _ O
cookbooks _ _ O
and _ _ O
television _ _ O
shows, _ _ O
would _ _ O
tell _ _ O
you _ _ O
things _ _ O
that _ _ O
others _ _ O
wouldn't. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
glossy, _ _ O
cheerful, _ _ O
relentlessly _ _ O
promotional _ _ O
realms _ _ O
of _ _ O
food _ _ O
and _ _ O
travel _ _ O
writing, _ _ O
that _ _ O
left _ _ O
him _ _ O
a _ _ O
fair _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
truths _ _ O
he _ _ O
could _ _ O
claim _ _ O
as _ _ O
his _ _ O
own, _ _ O
and _ _ O
he _ _ O
took _ _ O
full _ _ O
advantage _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
situation. _ _ O
A _ _ O
close _ _ O
reader _ _ O
of _ _ O
Orwell _ _ O
, _ _ O
he _ _ O
modeled _ _ O
that _ _ O
first _ _ O
essay _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
book _ _ O
that _ _ O
grew _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
it, _ _ O
"Kitchen _ _ O
Confidential: _ _ O
Adventures _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Culinary _ _ O
Underbelly," _ _ O
on _ _ O
Orwell's _ _ O
"Down _ _ O
and _ _ O
Out _ _ O
in _ _ O
Paris _ _ O
and _ _ O
London." _ _ O
While _ _ O
other _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
writers _ _ O
had _ _ O
helped _ _ O
build _ _ O
the _ _ O
cult _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
creative, _ _ O
artistic _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Bourdain _ _ O
made _ _ O
folk _ _ O
heroes _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
dishwasher _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
line _ _ O
cook _ _ O
-- _ _ O
a _ _ O
job _ _ O
description _ _ O
previously _ _ O
known _ _ O
only _ _ O
to _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
employees. _ _ O
He _ _ O
described _ _ O
their _ _ O
lives _ _ O
and _ _ O
their _ _ O
day-to-day _ _ O
work _ _ O
in _ _ O
concrete, _ _ O
indelible _ _ O
detail. _ _ O
When _ _ O
kitchens _ _ O
were _ _ O
being _ _ O
wrapped _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
shimmering _ _ O
gauze _ _ O
of _ _ O
glamour, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Bourdain _ _ O
got _ _ O
busy _ _ O
unwrapping _ _ O
them, _ _ O
revealing _ _ O
the _ _ O
injuries _ _ O
and _ _ O
addictions, _ _ O
low _ _ O
wages _ _ O
and _ _ O
high _ _ O
tempers _ _ O
that _ _ O
took _ _ O
a _ _ O
toll _ _ O
on _ _ O
workers. _ _ O
Among _ _ O
other _ _ O
things, _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
writers _ _ O
to _ _ O
tell _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
public _ _ O
that _ _ O
many _ _ O
high-profile _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
restaurants _ _ O
would _ _ O
cease _ _ O
to _ _ O
function _ _ O
without _ _ O
the _ _ O
work _ _ O
and _ _ O
talents _ _ O
of _ _ O
Mexican _ _ O
employees. _ _ O
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
almost _ _ O
a _ _ O
casual _ _ O
aside, _ _ O
yet _ _ O
it _ _ O
suddenly _ _ O
opened _ _ O
new _ _ O
subjects _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
purview _ _ O
of _ _ O
food _ _ O
writing: _ _ O
immigration _ _ O
policy, _ _ O
labor _ _ O
conditions, _ _ O
racism. _ _ O
He _ _ O
identified _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
grunts, _ _ O
portraying _ _ O
himself _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
slinger _ _ O
of _ _ O
cheap _ _ O
steaks _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
French _ _ B-FOOD
fries. _ _ I-FOOD
The _ _ O
grunts, _ _ O
in _ _ O
turn, _ _ O
identified _ _ O
with _ _ O
him, _ _ O
not _ _ O
because _ _ O
of _ _ O
his _ _ O
contributions _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
chef _ _ O
-- _ _ O
who _ _ O
can _ _ O
name _ _ O
an _ _ O
Anthony _ _ O
Bourdain _ _ O
dish? _ _ O
-- _ _ O
but _ _ O
because _ _ O
he _ _ O
told _ _ O
the _ _ O
world _ _ O
what _ _ O
the _ _ O
work _ _ O
was _ _ O
really _ _ O
like. _ _ O
And _ _ O
once _ _ O
he _ _ O
left _ _ O
kitchens _ _ O
behind _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
career _ _ O
in _ _ O
travel _ _ O
television, _ _ O
he _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
lead _ _ O
his _ _ O
camera _ _ O
crews _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
tour _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O

of _ _ O

Mr. _ _ O
Bourdain _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
blood-and-organs _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
guy, _ _ O
and _ _ O
he _ _ O
became _ _ O
identified _ _ O
with _ _ O
his _ _ O
unflinching, _ _ O
at _ _ O
times _ _ O
ostentatious, _ _ O
descriptions _ _ O
of _ _ O
life, _ _ O
death, _ _ O
sex _ _ O
and _ _ O
digestion. _ _ O
Footage _ _ O
of _ _ O
fly-speckled _ _ O
goats' _ _ O
heads _ _ O
in _ _ O
open-air _ _ O
markets _ _ O
was _ _ O
to _ _ O
his _ _ O
travel _ _ O
shows _ _ O
what _ _ O
harbor _ _ O
sunsets _ _ O
were _ _ O
for _ _ O
other _ _ O
programs. _ _ O
Although _ _ O
he _ _ O
wasn't _ _ O
immune _ _ O
to _ _ O
hyperbole, _ _ O
he _ _ O
had _ _ O
an _ _ O
old-school _ _ O
chain-smoking _ _ O

hatred _ _ O
of _ _ O
self-serving _ _ O
hypocrisy, _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
in _ _ O

At _ _ O
times _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Bourdain's _ _ O
capacity _ _ O
as _ _ O
truth-teller _ _ O
could _ _ O
bleed _ _ O
into _ _ O
other, _ _ O
less _ _ O
salutary _ _ O
roles: _ _ O
the _ _ O
attention-seeking _ _ O
bully, _ _ O
the _ _ O
purveyor _ _ O
of _ _ O
well-polished _ _ O
shtick, _ _ O
the _ _ O
lecture-circuit _ _ O
fixture _ _ O
who, _ _ O
on _ _ O
cue, _ _ O
would _ _ O
curse _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
line _ _ O
cook _ _ O
who _ _ O
has _ _ O
just _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
tip _ _ O
of _ _ O
his _ _ O
finger. _ _ O
"I _ _ O
do _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
speaking _ _ O
engagements _ _ O
and _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
I _ _ O
feel _ _ O
like _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
being _ _ O
paid _ _ O
to _ _ O
curse _ _ O
in _ _ O
front _ _ O
of _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
haven't _ _ O
heard _ _ O
it _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
while," _ _ O
he _ _ O
said _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
2008 _ _ O
interview _ _ O
. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
few _ _ O
months, _ _ O
as _ _ O
accusations _ _ O
of _ _ O
sexual _ _ O
harassment _ _ O
and _ _ O
predatory _ _ O
behavior _ _ O
have _ _ O
shaken _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
industry _ _ O
, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Bourdain's _ _ O
swaggering _ _ O
accounts _ _ O
of _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
life _ _ O
have _ _ O
come _ _ O
in _ _ O
for _ _ O
re-evaluation. _ _ O
He _ _ O
certainly _ _ O
took _ _ O
pleasure _ _ O
in _ _ O
telling _ _ O
outsiders _ _ O
what _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
like. _ _ O
Was _ _ O
there _ _ O
some _ _ O
pride _ _ O
in _ _ O
there, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
in _ _ O
belonging _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
band _ _ O
of _ _ O
misfits _ _ O
and _ _ O
rule-breakers? _ _ O
Had _ _ O
he _ _ O
helped _ _ O
to _ _ O
popularize _ _ O
a _ _ O
workplace _ _ O
culture _ _ O
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
misogyny _ _ O
and _ _ O
abuse _ _ O
were _ _ O
overlooked, _ _ O
tolerated _ _ O
and _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
even _ _ O
celebrated? _ _ O
"To _ _ O
the _ _ O
extent _ _ O
which _ _ O
my _ _ O
work _ _ O
in _ _ O
‘Kitchen _ _ O
Confidential' _ _ O
celebrated _ _ O
or _ _ O
prolonged _ _ O
a _ _ O
culture _ _ O
that _ _ O
allowed _ _ O
the _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
grotesque _ _ O
behaviors _ _ O
we're _ _ O
hearing _ _ O
about _ _ O
all _ _ O
too _ _ O
frequently _ _ O
is _ _ O
something _ _ O
I _ _ O
think _ _ O
about _ _ O
daily, _ _ O
with _ _ O
real _ _ O
remorse," _ _ O
he _ _ O
wrote _ _ O
on _ _ O
Medium _ _ O
in _ _ O
December. _ _ O
Having _ _ O
regularly _ _ O
heaped _ _ O
disgust _ _ O
and _ _ O
outrage _ _ O
on _ _ O
Harvey _ _ O
Weinstein _ _ O
(who _ _ O
was _ _ O
accused _ _ O
of _ _ O
rape _ _ O
by _ _ O
Asia _ _ O
Argento, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Bourdain's _ _ O
partner), _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
also _ _ O
confronted _ _ O
with _ _ O
serious _ _ O
and _ _ O
deeply _ _ O
unsettling _ _ O
allegations _ _ O
about _ _ O
Mario _ _ O
Batali _ _ O
, _ _ O
a _ _ O
friend. _ _ O
"In _ _ O
these _ _ O
current _ _ O
circumstances, _ _ O
one _ _ O
must _ _ O
pick _ _ O
a _ _ O
side," _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Bourdain _ _ O
wrote. _ _ O
"I _ _ O
stand _ _ O
unhesitatingly _ _ O
and _ _ O
unwaveringly _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
women." _ _ O
But _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
feminist _ _ O
perspective _ _ O
was _ _ O
relatively _ _ O
new _ _ O
to _ _ O
his _ _ O
repertory, _ _ O
speaking _ _ O
out _ _ O
about _ _ O
sexual _ _ O
abuse _ _ O
was _ _ O
not. _ _ O
Long _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
in _ _ O
"Kitchen _ _ O
Confidential," _ _ O
he _ _ O
had _ _ O
written _ _ O
about _ _ O
a _ _ O
union _ _ O
shop _ _ O
steward _ _ O
who _ _ O
had _ _ O
inserted _ _ O
his _ _ O
fingers _ _ O
into _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Bourdain's _ _ O
rectum _ _ O
every _ _ O
day, _ _ O
in _ _ O
front _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
workers. _ _ O
Experiences _ _ O
like _ _ O
this _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
common _ _ O
for _ _ O
male _ _ O
cooks, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
commonly _ _ O
discussed _ _ O
in _ _ O
public. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Bourdain _ _ O
was _ _ O
too _ _ O
unsettled, _ _ O
his _ _ O
moral _ _ O
compass _ _ O
too _ _ O
twitchy, _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
written _ _ O
an _ _ O
account _ _ O
of _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
life _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
purely _ _ O
celebratory _ _ O
or _ _ O
purely _ _ O
accusatory. _ _ O
"Life _ _ O
is _ _ O
complicated. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
nuance. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
unsatisfying," _ _ O
he _ _ O
once _ _ O
said. _ _ O
"If _ _ O
I _ _ O
believe _ _ O
in _ _ O
anything, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
doubt." _ _ O

anybody _ _ O

to _ _ O

about _ _ O
the _ _ O

where _ _ O
the _ _ O
price _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O

is _ _ O
somewhere _ _ O
between _ _ O

If _ _ O
you _ _ O
were _ _ O
already _ _ O
inclined _ _ O
to _ _ O
think _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
Japanese _ _ B-CUISINE
seafood _ _ B-FOOD
game, _ _ O
like _ _ O
so _ _ O
many _ _ O
other _ _ O

in _ _ O

is _ _ O
rigged _ _ O
in _ _ O
favor _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O

these _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
won't _ _ O
change _ _ O
your _ _ O
mind. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
next _ _ O
time _ _ O
you _ _ O
despair _ _ O
of _ _ O
ever _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
another _ _ O
slice _ _ O
of _ _ O
yellowtail, _ _ B-FOOD
I'd _ _ O
suggest _ _ O
dropping _ _ O
into _ _ O
an _ _ O
izakaya _ _ B-TYPE
called _ _ O
Wokuni _ _ B-EST
for _ _ O
lunch _ _ O
or _ _ O
dinner. _ _ O
A _ _ O
short _ _ O
detour _ _ O
from _ _ O
Grand _ _ B-LOC
Central _ _ I-LOC
Terminal, _ _ I-LOC
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
in _ _ O
business _ _ O
since _ _ O
October. _ _ O
So _ _ O
far _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
not _ _ O
drawn _ _ O
much _ _ O
attention _ _ O
to _ _ O
itself. _ _ O
Given _ _ O
the _ _ O
mixed _ _ O
messages _ _ O
it _ _ O
sends _ _ O
out, _ _ O
this _ _ O
is _ _ O
understandable. _ _ O
It _ _ O
has _ _ O
soaring _ _ O
ceilings, _ _ O
a _ _ O
backlit _ _ O
bar _ _ O
with _ _ O
shelves _ _ O
so _ _ O
high _ _ O
the _ _ O
topmost _ _ O
bottles _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
reached _ _ O
only _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
gymnast, _ _ O
an _ _ O
undulating _ _ O
wall _ _ O
of _ _ O
overlapping _ _ O
tiles _ _ O
that _ _ O
suggests _ _ O
Frank _ _ O
Gehry _ _ O
in _ _ O
his _ _ O
fish-scale _ _ O
period, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
constant _ _ O
dance _ _ O
beat _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
background _ _ O
that _ _ O
won't _ _ O
stop _ _ O
no _ _ O
matter _ _ O
how _ _ O
hard _ _ O
you _ _ O
cry. _ _ O
In _ _ O
other _ _ O
words, _ _ O
it _ _ O
looks _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
Asian _ _ B-TYPE
fusion _ _ I-TYPE
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
lobby _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
W _ _ B-LOC
hotel _ _ I-LOC
built _ _ O
around _ _ O
1999. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu _ _ O
sings _ _ O
another _ _ O
tune, _ _ O
though. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
full _ _ O
of _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
izakaya _ _ B-TYPE
dishes _ _ O
like _ _ O
tofu _ _ B-DISH
agedashi _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-DISH
karaage, _ _ I-DISH
rounded _ _ O
out _ _ O
by _ _ O
sashimi _ _ B-DISH
and _ _ O
grilled _ _ B-DISH
skewers. _ _ I-DISH
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
twist, _ _ O
though: _ _ O
Wokuni _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
much, _ _ O
much _ _ O
more _ _ O
interested _ _ O
in _ _ O
seafood _ _ B-FOOD
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
average _ _ O
izakaya. _ _ B-TYPE
As _ _ O
a _ _ O
rule, _ _ O
the _ _ O
fish _ _ B-FOOD
at _ _ O
Wokuni _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
exceptionally _ _ O
good _ _ O
and _ _ O
almost _ _ O
bizarrely _ _ O
fresh, _ _ O
shipped _ _ O
daily _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
Tsukiji _ _ B-LOC
fish _ _ O
market _ _ O
in _ _ O
Tokyo _ _ B-LOC
or _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
fish _ _ O
farm _ _ O
in _ _ O
Nagasaki _ _ B-LOC
owned _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
parent _ _ O
company, _ _ O
Tokyo _ _ O
Ichiban _ _ O
Foods _ _ O
. _ _ O
(Its _ _ O
admirable _ _ O
motto: _ _ O
"We _ _ O
are _ _ O
changing _ _ O
the _ _ O
dietary _ _ O
culture _ _ O
in _ _ O
Japan _ _ O
with _ _ O
persistence.") _ _ O
Raw _ _ O
or _ _ O
cooked, _ _ O
the _ _ O
seafood _ _ B-FOOD
at _ _ O
Wokuni _ _ B-LOC
sets _ _ O
it _ _ O
apart _ _ O
from _ _ O
other _ _ O
izakayas _ _ B-TYPE
in _ _ O
New _ _ B-DISH
York, _ _ I-DISH
best _ _ O
seen _ _ O
as _ _ O
embassies _ _ O
of _ _ O
Japanese _ _ O
drinking _ _ O
culture _ _ O
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
plays _ _ O
the _ _ O
role _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
ambassador's _ _ O
chauffeur. _ _ O
Sushi _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
rare _ _ O
at _ _ O
standard _ _ O
izakayas, _ _ B-TYPE
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
made _ _ O
and _ _ O
sold _ _ O
at _ _ O
Wokuni, _ _ B-EST
at _ _ O
very _ _ O
moderate _ _ O
prices. _ _ O
While _ _ O
many _ _ O
omakase _ _ B-TYPE
chefs _ _ O
age _ _ O
their _ _ O
fish _ _ B-FOOD
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
it _ _ O
supple _ _ O
and _ _ O
relaxed, _ _ O
the _ _ O
sushi _ _ B-FOOD
at _ _ O
Wokuni _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
almost _ _ O
insolently _ _ O
fresh. _ _ O
And _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
merely _ _ O
get _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
$5 _ _ O
pieces _ _ O
of _ _ O
king _ _ B-DISH
yellowtail _ _ I-DISH
sushi, _ _ I-DISH
or _ _ O
$6 _ _ O
pieces _ _ O
of _ _ O
sea _ _ B-DISH
bream _ _ I-DISH
sushi, _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
a _ _ O
slice _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
of _ _ O
golden-eye _ _ B-DISH
snapper _ _ I-DISH
sushi _ _ I-DISH
at _ _ O
$9 _ _ O
each, _ _ O
you _ _ O
won't _ _ O
regret _ _ O
it. _ _ O
The _ _ O
fish _ _ B-FOOD
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
shiny. _ _ O
It _ _ O
will _ _ O
probably _ _ O
be _ _ O
chewy. _ _ O
The _ _ O
pinks _ _ O
and _ _ O
reds _ _ O
and _ _ O
ivories _ _ O
and _ _ O
whites _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
flesh _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
as _ _ O
distinct _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
they'd _ _ O
been _ _ O
painted _ _ O
on _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
nail-polish _ _ O
brush. _ _ O
But _ _ O
sushi _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
highest _ _ O
use _ _ O
of _ _ O
Wokuni's _ _ B-DISH
seafood. _ _ B-FOOD
What _ _ O
the _ _ O
place _ _ O
lacks _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
seasonal _ _ O
fish _ _ O
that _ _ O
can _ _ O
make _ _ O
a _ _ O
sushi _ _ O
excursion _ _ O
really _ _ O
memorable: _ _ O
gizzard _ _ O
shad, _ _ O
striped _ _ O
jack, _ _ O
firefly _ _ O
squid. _ _ O
When _ _ O
it _ _ O
comes _ _ O
to _ _ O
sashimi, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
this _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
much _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
liability, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
firmness _ _ O
of _ _ O
Wokuni's _ _ O
fish _ _ O
becomes _ _ O
a _ _ O
point _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
favor. _ _ O
Before _ _ O
ordering _ _ O
sashimi _ _ O
-- _ _ O
or, _ _ O
in _ _ O
fact, _ _ O
anything _ _ O
else _ _ O
-- _ _ O
check _ _ O
the _ _ O
daily _ _ O
specials _ _ O
posted _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Kuniaki _ _ O
Yoshizawa. _ _ O
They _ _ O
will _ _ O
almost _ _ O
always _ _ O
include _ _ O
several _ _ O
cuts _ _ O
of _ _ O
bluefin _ _ O
from _ _ O
farm-raised _ _ O
fish. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
come _ _ O
very _ _ O
early _ _ O
for _ _ O
lunch _ _ O
and _ _ O
manage _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
the _ _ O
Wokuni _ _ O
don, _ _ O
a _ _ O
special _ _ O
that _ _ O
centers _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
sashimi _ _ O
rice _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
and _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
tempura, _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
strike _ _ O
you _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
incredible _ _ O
bargain _ _ O
at _ _ O
$24. _ _ O
The _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
makes _ _ O
only _ _ O
five _ _ O
Wokuni-dons _ _ O
a _ _ O
day, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
so _ _ O
chances _ _ O
are _ _ O
you _ _ O
will _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
content _ _ O
yourself _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
kaisen-don, _ _ O
and _ _ O
chances _ _ O
are _ _ O
that _ _ O
even _ _ O
though _ _ O
it _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
include _ _ O
tempura, _ _ O
the _ _ O
$18 _ _ O
you _ _ O
pay _ _ O
will _ _ O
still _ _ O
seem _ _ O
like _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
raw-fish _ _ O
deals _ _ O
in _ _ O
town. _ _ O
Things _ _ O
get _ _ O
even _ _ O
more _ _ O
intriguing _ _ O
when _ _ O
Wokuni's _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
comes _ _ O
into _ _ O
contact _ _ O
with _ _ O
heat. _ _ O
Again, _ _ O
the _ _ O
specials _ _ O
should _ _ O
be _ _ O
your _ _ O
starting _ _ O
point. _ _ O
There _ _ O
may _ _ O
well _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
yellowtail _ _ O
collar. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
habit _ _ O
of _ _ O
ordering _ _ O
this _ _ O
at _ _ O
your _ _ O
favorite _ _ O
izakaya, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
good _ _ O
bet _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
surprised _ _ O
by _ _ O
how _ _ O
much _ _ O
cleaner _ _ O
and _ _ O
sweeter _ _ O
it _ _ O
tastes _ _ O
here. _ _ O
Bluefin _ _ O
collars _ _ O
and _ _ O
jaws _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
served _ _ O
often _ _ O
enough _ _ O
for _ _ O
anybody _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
habit _ _ O
of _ _ O
ordering _ _ O
them. _ _ O
The _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
collar _ _ O
at _ _ O
Wokuni _ _ O
one _ _ O
recent _ _ O
night _ _ O
was _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
greatest _ _ O
pieces _ _ O
of _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
fish _ _ O
I've _ _ O
had _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
long _ _ O
time, _ _ O
every _ _ O
bit _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
worth _ _ O
chasing _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
hollows _ _ O
of _ _ O
bone, _ _ O
skin _ _ O
and _ _ O
cartilage _ _ O
where _ _ O
it _ _ O
hid. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
always _ _ O
available, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
bluefin _ _ O
tail _ _ O
is, _ _ O
carved _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
steak _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
backbone _ _ O
sliced _ _ O
open _ _ O
so _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
get _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
teaspoonful _ _ O
of _ _ O
hot, _ _ O
clear _ _ O
jelly _ _ O
inside _ _ O
the _ _ O
spine. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Yoshizawa _ _ O
has _ _ O
had _ _ O
the _ _ O
surprising _ _ O
idea _ _ O
of _ _ O
treating _ _ O
the _ _ O
angles _ _ O
and _ _ O
corners _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
sea _ _ O
bream's _ _ O
body _ _ O
like _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
wings. _ _ O
Tucked _ _ O
into _ _ O
triangles, _ _ O
fried _ _ O
until _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
and _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
lemon, _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
meant _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
gnawned _ _ O
on _ _ O
between _ _ O
sips _ _ O
of _ _ O
sake. _ _ O
On _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
hand, _ _ O
ei _ _ O
hire, _ _ O
a _ _ O
frequent _ _ O
special _ _ O
of _ _ O
cured, _ _ O
dried _ _ O
skate _ _ O
fin _ _ O
cut _ _ O
into _ _ O
squares, _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
chewy _ _ O
and _ _ O
likable _ _ O
sidekick _ _ O
to _ _ O
beer. _ _ O
Fish _ _ O
and _ _ O
chips, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
will _ _ O
go _ _ O
with _ _ O
either _ _ O
-- _ _ O
the _ _ O
fish _ _ O
species _ _ O
changes _ _ O
from _ _ O
night _ _ O
to _ _ O
night, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
tends _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
extremely _ _ O
fresh, _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
and _ _ O
light _ _ O
on _ _ O
batter. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chips, _ _ O
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
Japanese _ _ O
mountain _ _ O
yam, _ _ O
were _ _ O
never _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
and _ _ O
always _ _ O
needed _ _ O
more _ _ O
salt. _ _ O
Sometimes _ _ O
salt _ _ O
came _ _ O
with _ _ O
them, _ _ O
and _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
it _ _ O
didn't. _ _ O
Those _ _ O
yam _ _ O
fries _ _ O
are _ _ O
an _ _ O
example _ _ O
of _ _ O
what _ _ O
happens _ _ O
once _ _ O
you _ _ O
venture _ _ O
away _ _ O
from _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
at _ _ O
Wokuni: _ _ O
The _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
aren't _ _ O
doing _ _ O
the _ _ O
heavy _ _ O
lifting _ _ O
anymore, _ _ O
and _ _ O
everything _ _ O
tastes _ _ O
sort _ _ O
of, _ _ O
well, _ _ O
ordinary. _ _ O
Certain _ _ O
things _ _ O
are _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
right _ _ O
side _ _ O
of _ _ O
ordinary, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
fried _ _ O
tofu _ _ O
in _ _ O
dashi; _ _ O
the _ _ O
warm _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
omelet, _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
when _ _ O
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
freshwater _ _ O
eel; _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
tender, _ _ O
ghost-white _ _ O
baby _ _ O
sardines _ _ O
with _ _ O
grated _ _ O
daikon. _ _ O
Others _ _ O
are _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
wrong _ _ O
side, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
scallops _ _ O
in _ _ O
butter _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
monkfish _ _ O
liver _ _ O
that _ _ O
strongly _ _ O
recalled _ _ O
canned _ _ O
cat _ _ O
food. _ _ O
If _ _ O
I _ _ O
worked _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
neighborhood, _ _ O
I _ _ O
would _ _ O
eagerly _ _ O
return _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
once _ _ O
a _ _ O
week, _ _ O
sticking _ _ O
as _ _ O
closely _ _ O
as _ _ O
possible _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
fish _ _ O
specials. _ _ O
I _ _ O
doubt _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
get _ _ O
bored, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
would _ _ O
keep _ _ O
my _ _ O
eye _ _ O
out _ _ O
for _ _ O
something _ _ O
that _ _ O
Wokuni _ _ O
could _ _ O
put _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu, _ _ O
but _ _ O
so _ _ O
far _ _ O
hasn't. _ _ O
The _ _ O
parent _ _ O
company _ _ O
runs _ _ O
a _ _ O
farm _ _ O
that _ _ O
raises _ _ O
tiger _ _ O
blowfish, _ _ O
and _ _ O
about _ _ O
50 _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
in _ _ O
Japan _ _ O
that _ _ O
serve _ _ O
it. _ _ O
Tiger _ _ O
blowfish _ _ O
is _ _ O
supposed _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
delicious _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
fugu. _ _ O
I _ _ O
think _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
could _ _ O
make _ _ O
it _ _ O
feel _ _ O
appreciated _ _ O
on _ _ O
Lexington _ _ O
Avenue. _ _ O

I _ _ O
was _ _ O
drinking _ _ O
gin _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
pineapple _ _ O
juice _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
bar _ _ O
of _ _ O
Gabriel _ _ O
Stulman's _ _ O
newest _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
Simon _ _ O
& _ _ O
the _ _ O
Whale _ _ O
, _ _ O
and _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
folds _ _ O
of _ _ O
tongue _ _ O
pastrami _ _ O
laid _ _ O
over _ _ O
caramelized _ _ O
cauliflower, _ _ O
a _ _ O
combination _ _ O
that _ _ O
paid _ _ O
off _ _ O
against _ _ O
long _ _ O
odds, _ _ O
when _ _ O
applause _ _ O
broke _ _ O
out _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
entrance. _ _ O
I _ _ O
hadn't _ _ O
heard _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
drop _ _ O
a _ _ O
glass _ _ O
or _ _ O
sing _ _ O
"Happy _ _ O
Birthday," _ _ O
so _ _ O
I _ _ O
asked _ _ O
the _ _ O
woman _ _ O
next _ _ O
to _ _ O
me, _ _ O
who _ _ O
had _ _ O
eaten _ _ O
there _ _ O
three _ _ O
or _ _ O
four _ _ O
times _ _ O
already, _ _ O
if _ _ O
she _ _ O
knew _ _ O
what _ _ O
the _ _ O
sudden _ _ O
ovation _ _ O
was _ _ O
about. _ _ O
"Have _ _ O
you _ _ O
been _ _ O
to _ _ O
Gabe's _ _ O
other _ _ O
places?" _ _ O
she _ _ O
asked. _ _ O
"They _ _ O
like _ _ O
to _ _ O
clap _ _ O
for _ _ O
people." _ _ O
I _ _ O
hadn't _ _ O
noticed _ _ O
that, _ _ O
but _ _ O
there _ _ O
were _ _ O
other _ _ O
Stulman _ _ O
touches _ _ O
that _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
transferred _ _ O
from _ _ O
Bar _ _ O
Sardine, _ _ O
Jeffrey's _ _ O
Grocery _ _ O
, _ _ O
Fedora _ _ O
and _ _ O
Joseph _ _ O
Leonard _ _ O
to _ _ O
Simon _ _ O
& _ _ O
the _ _ O
Whale _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
February. _ _ O
Case _ _ O
studies _ _ O
in _ _ O
how _ _ O
to _ _ O
maximize _ _ O
miniature _ _ O
spaces, _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
intimate _ _ O
neighborhood _ _ O
hangouts _ _ O
with _ _ O
elevator-size _ _ O
kitchens _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
and _ _ O
cocktails _ _ O
are _ _ O
more _ _ O
interesting _ _ O
than _ _ O
ought _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
achievable _ _ O
under _ _ O
such _ _ O
conditions. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
a _ _ O
genre _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Stulman _ _ O
understands _ _ O
as _ _ O
well _ _ O
as _ _ O
anybody _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
city. _ _ O
With _ _ O
76 _ _ O
seats _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
new _ _ O
Freehand _ _ O
hotel _ _ O
on _ _ O
East _ _ O
23rd _ _ O
Street, _ _ O
Simon _ _ O
& _ _ O
the _ _ O
Whale _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
those. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
an _ _ O
Army _ _ O
mess _ _ O
hall _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
standards _ _ O
of _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Stulman's _ _ O
Happy _ _ O
Cooking _ _ O
Hospitality _ _ O
group. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
design _ _ O
firm _ _ O
Roman _ _ O
and _ _ O
Williams _ _ O
has _ _ O
styled _ _ O
it _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
California _ _ O
Craftsman _ _ O
house _ _ O
and _ _ O
subdivided _ _ O
it _ _ O
into _ _ O
niches _ _ O
and _ _ O
corners _ _ O
with _ _ O
open _ _ O
cabinets. _ _ O
It _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
display _ _ O
its _ _ O
size _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
Upland _ _ O
, _ _ O
another _ _ O
Roman _ _ O
and _ _ O
Williams _ _ O
project _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
blocks _ _ O
north, _ _ O
does. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
the _ _ O
bar _ _ O
is _ _ O
personably _ _ O
scaled; _ _ O
it's _ _ O
configured _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
horseshoe. _ _ O
Extensive _ _ O
personal _ _ O
research _ _ O
suggests _ _ O
this _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
possible _ _ O
shape _ _ O
a _ _ O
bar _ _ O
can _ _ O
have. _ _ O
Like _ _ O
all _ _ O
of _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Stulman's _ _ O
places, _ _ O
Simon _ _ O
& _ _ O
the _ _ O
Whale _ _ O
is _ _ O
thick _ _ O
with _ _ O
high-volume _ _ O
conversations _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
full, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
pretty _ _ O
much _ _ O
all _ _ O
night _ _ O
long. _ _ O
Like _ _ O
Jeffrey's _ _ O
Grocery _ _ O
and _ _ O
Joseph _ _ O
Leonard, _ _ O
its _ _ O
name _ _ O
comes _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
relative _ _ O
-- _ _ O
in _ _ O
this _ _ O
case, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Stulman's _ _ O
6-year-old _ _ O
son, _ _ O
who _ _ O
apparently _ _ O
received _ _ O
an _ _ O
impressive _ _ O
collection _ _ O
of _ _ O
whale-decorated _ _ O
baby _ _ O
gifts. _ _ O
Also _ _ O
familiar _ _ O
to _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Stulman's _ _ O
regulars _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
style _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
servers. _ _ O
They're _ _ O
young, _ _ O
talkative, _ _ O
fresh-faced, _ _ O
enthusiastic, _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
new _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
and _ _ O
haven't _ _ O
yet _ _ O
grown _ _ O
the _ _ O
protective _ _ O
exoskeleton _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
hardened _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorker. _ _ O
Our _ _ O
waiter _ _ O
one _ _ O
night _ _ O
showered _ _ O
us _ _ O
with _ _ O
recommendations _ _ O
for _ _ O
dishes, _ _ O
all _ _ O
of _ _ O
which _ _ O
he _ _ O
loved. _ _ O
We _ _ O
asked _ _ O
him _ _ O
about _ _ O
things _ _ O
he _ _ O
hadn't _ _ O
mentioned. _ _ O
He _ _ O
loved _ _ O
those, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
He _ _ O
loved _ _ O
the _ _ O
cocktails, _ _ O
a _ _ O
Happy _ _ O
Cooking _ _ O
strong _ _ O
suit, _ _ O
and _ _ O
was _ _ O
especially _ _ O
keen _ _ O
on _ _ O
one _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
mezcal. _ _ O
"Mezcal _ _ O
never _ _ O
hurt _ _ O
anybody," _ _ O
he _ _ O
said _ _ O
brightly. _ _ O
Extensive _ _ O
personal _ _ O
research _ _ O
suggests _ _ O
this _ _ O
is _ _ O
untrue. _ _ O
One _ _ O
place _ _ O
where _ _ O
Simon _ _ O
& _ _ O
the _ _ O
Whale _ _ O
allows _ _ O
itself _ _ O
to _ _ O
spread _ _ O
out _ _ O
beyond _ _ O
the _ _ O
normal _ _ O
boundaries _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Stulman _ _ O
kingdom _ _ O
is _ _ O
breads _ _ O
and _ _ O
desserts. _ _ O
The _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
shares _ _ O
a _ _ O
baker, _ _ O
Zoe _ _ O
Kanan, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Charmaine _ _ O
McFarlane, _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
hotel's _ _ O
second-floor _ _ O
cafe, _ _ O
Studio, _ _ O
also _ _ O
run _ _ O
by _ _ O
Happy _ _ O
Cooking. _ _ O
Both _ _ O
are _ _ O
very _ _ O
good _ _ O
at _ _ O
their _ _ O
jobs. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Kanan _ _ O
makes _ _ O
the _ _ O
black, _ _ O
thick-crusted _ _ O
barley-rye _ _ O
bread _ _ O
flecked _ _ O
with _ _ O
anise _ _ O
seeds _ _ O
that _ _ O
comes _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
halfhearted _ _ O
taramosalata _ _ O
and, _ _ O
more _ _ O
excitingly, _ _ O
a _ _ O
swipe _ _ O
of _ _ O
butter _ _ O
creamed _ _ O
with _ _ O
seaweed _ _ O
powder. _ _ O
The _ _ O
long _ _ O
thin _ _ O
toast, _ _ O
crackling _ _ O
with _ _ O
grains _ _ O
and _ _ O
seeds _ _ O
that _ _ O
sits _ _ O
under _ _ O
cured _ _ O
and _ _ O
smoked _ _ O
Arctic _ _ O
char _ _ O
and _ _ O
smoked _ _ O
sour _ _ O
cream? _ _ O
Hers. _ _ O
The _ _ O
poppy-seed _ _ O
torpedo _ _ O
roll _ _ O
that _ _ O
helps _ _ O
lift _ _ O
the _ _ O
fish _ _ O
sandwich _ _ O
with _ _ O
carrot-squash _ _ O
slaw _ _ O
above _ _ O
the _ _ O
ordinary? _ _ O
Also _ _ O
hers, _ _ O
although _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
fair _ _ O
the _ _ O
long, _ _ O
flat _ _ O
fries _ _ O
also _ _ O
do _ _ O
their _ _ O
part. _ _ O
And _ _ O
if _ _ O
your _ _ O
spirits _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
sunk, _ _ O
as _ _ O
mine _ _ O
have, _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
skimpy _ _ O
and _ _ O
uninspired _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
choices _ _ O
around _ _ O
town _ _ O
these _ _ O
days, _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
McFarlane _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
an _ _ O
answered _ _ O
prayer. _ _ O
No _ _ O
mere _ _ O
afterthought, _ _ O
her _ _ O
panna _ _ O
cotta _ _ O
sits _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
low _ _ O
base _ _ O
of _ _ O
semolina _ _ O
cake _ _ O
and _ _ O
is _ _ O
decked _ _ O
out _ _ O
with _ _ O
pink _ _ O
grapefruit _ _ O
fillets _ _ O
and _ _ O
grapefruit _ _ O
marmalade _ _ O
spiced _ _ O
with _ _ O
red _ _ O
juniper _ _ O
berries. _ _ O
A _ _ O
cooling _ _ O
evergreen _ _ O
moat _ _ O
of _ _ O
pine _ _ O
ice _ _ O
surrounds _ _ O
an _ _ O
earthy _ _ O
rye _ _ O
pudding _ _ O
that's _ _ O
enriched _ _ O
with _ _ O
brown _ _ O
butter; _ _ O
pears _ _ O
fried _ _ O
in _ _ O
honey _ _ O
are _ _ O
splayed _ _ O
out _ _ O
on _ _ O
top, _ _ O
and _ _ O
some _ _ O
acerbic _ _ O
cranberries _ _ O
prevent _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole _ _ O
thing _ _ O
from _ _ O
cloying. _ _ O
I _ _ O
defy _ _ O
you _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat _ _ O
it _ _ O
without _ _ O
smiling. _ _ O
I _ _ O
can't _ _ O
say _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
as _ _ O
taken _ _ O
with _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
knotweed-rhubarb _ _ O
compote _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
topping _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
buckwheat _ _ O
cake _ _ O
as _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
McFarlane _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
be, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
offers _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
astonishing _ _ O
ice _ _ O
creams _ _ O
around. _ _ O
Made _ _ O
with _ _ O
beeswax, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
as _ _ O
deeply _ _ O
aromatic _ _ O
as _ _ O
honey _ _ O
but _ _ O
not _ _ O
as _ _ O
sweet, _ _ O
and _ _ O
its _ _ O
texture _ _ O
is _ _ O
intensely _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
but _ _ O
not _ _ O
at _ _ O
all _ _ O
waxy. _ _ O
The _ _ O
rest _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
hands _ _ O
of _ _ O
Matt _ _ O
Griffin, _ _ O
until _ _ O
recently _ _ O
in _ _ O
charge _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
at _ _ O
Fedora _ _ O
and _ _ O
Bar _ _ O
Sardine. _ _ O
He _ _ O
does _ _ O
a _ _ O
neat _ _ O
balancing _ _ O
trick _ _ O
here, _ _ O
giving _ _ O
his _ _ O
adventurous _ _ O
side _ _ O
free _ _ O
rein _ _ O
at _ _ O
times _ _ O
while _ _ O
more _ _ O
often _ _ O
using _ _ O
it _ _ O
to _ _ O
add _ _ O
interest _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
standards _ _ O
a _ _ O
hotel _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
probably _ _ O
needs. _ _ O
A _ _ O
winningly _ _ O
over-the-top _ _ O
recent _ _ O
special _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
custard-soaked _ _ O
pain _ _ O
perdu _ _ O
under _ _ O
bacon _ _ O
jus, _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
cabbage _ _ O
and _ _ O
speck, _ _ O
like _ _ O
some _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
demented _ _ O
Reuben-croque _ _ O
monsieur _ _ O
hybrid. _ _ O
Liver _ _ O
and _ _ O
onions _ _ O
turned _ _ O
out _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
less _ _ O
thrilling _ _ O
snack: _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
onions _ _ O
with _ _ O
deep-fried _ _ O
and _ _ O
overcooked _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
livers. _ _ O
Until _ _ O
it _ _ O
swam _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu, _ _ O
there _ _ O
was _ _ O
an _ _ O
intriguing _ _ O
sideways _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
squid _ _ O
ink _ _ O
risotto _ _ O
that _ _ O
had _ _ O
beech _ _ O
mushrooms _ _ O
and _ _ O
very _ _ O
tender _ _ O
squid _ _ O
confit _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
black _ _ O
porridge _ _ O
of _ _ O
barley. _ _ O
Now _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
spring _ _ O
peas, _ _ O
swirled _ _ O
with _ _ O
mint _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
for _ _ O
just-firm _ _ O
shrimp; _ _ O
the _ _ O
combination _ _ O
suggested _ _ O
pasta, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
glad _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
it _ _ O
without _ _ O
any _ _ O
starch _ _ O
getting _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
clear, _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
flavors. _ _ O
If _ _ O
it's _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
you _ _ O
want, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Griffin _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
glossy, _ _ O
chile-speckled _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
spaghetti _ _ O
acqua _ _ O
pazza _ _ O
with _ _ O
littleneck _ _ O
clams _ _ O
and _ _ O
cherry _ _ O
tomatoes, _ _ O
and _ _ O
while _ _ O
the _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
is _ _ O
thicker _ _ O
and _ _ O
glossier _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
normal _ _ O
acqua _ _ O
pazza, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
very _ _ O
good. _ _ O
What _ _ O
he _ _ O
calls _ _ O
a _ _ O
pork-collar _ _ O
Milanese _ _ O
is _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
millimeters _ _ O
too _ _ O
thick _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
name, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I'll _ _ O
take _ _ O
it. _ _ O
The _ _ O
cut _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
flavorful _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
normal _ _ O
cutlet, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
apricot _ _ O
mostarda _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
pungent _ _ O
and _ _ O
welcome _ _ O
counterpoint. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
can't _ _ O
finish _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole _ _ O
thing, _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
taken _ _ O
away _ _ O
and _ _ O
replaced _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
plastic _ _ O
action _ _ O
figure _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
sports _ _ O
hero. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
your _ _ O
claim _ _ O
check. _ _ O
Mine _ _ O
was _ _ O
Don _ _ O
Mattingly, _ _ O
and _ _ O
I _ _ O
wondered _ _ O
if _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
the _ _ O
applause _ _ O
was _ _ O
for _ _ O
him. _ _ O
No, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Stulman _ _ O
said _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
phone _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
days _ _ O
later. _ _ O
The _ _ O
woman _ _ O
he _ _ O
bought _ _ O
Fedora _ _ O
from, _ _ O
who _ _ O
has _ _ O
since _ _ O
died, _ _ O
was _ _ O
89 _ _ O
when _ _ O
she _ _ O
sold _ _ O
it _ _ O
and _ _ O
was _ _ O
still _ _ O
showing _ _ O
up _ _ O
each _ _ O
night. _ _ O
When _ _ O
she _ _ O
entered, _ _ O
people _ _ O
clapped. _ _ O
"We _ _ O
turned _ _ O
that _ _ O
into _ _ O
clapping _ _ O
for _ _ O
our _ _ O
friends," _ _ O
he _ _ O
said. _ _ O

A _ _ O

Torrisi _ _ O

Mario _ _ O

decorated _ _ O
with _ _ O

A _ _ O

at _ _ O
the _ _ O

of _ _ O

that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Zalaznick _ _ O
spray-painted _ _ O
in _ _ O
screaming _ _ O
pink: _ _ O
Dirty _ _ B-EST
French _ _ I-EST
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
cocky _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
It _ _ O
can _ _ O
also _ _ O
be _ _ O
an _ _ O
immensely _ _ O
enjoyable _ _ O
one. _ _ O
That _ _ O
sounds _ _ O
contradictory, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
self-confidence _ _ O
that _ _ O
can _ _ O
get _ _ O
on _ _ O
your _ _ O
nerves _ _ O
also _ _ O
allows _ _ O
this _ _ O
crew _ _ O
to _ _ O
mess _ _ O
around _ _ O
with _ _ O
French _ _ B-CUISINE
cuisine _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
hugely _ _ O
energizing _ _ O
lack _ _ O
of _ _ O
respect. _ _ O
In _ _ O
unnatural _ _ O
crossbreeding _ _ O
experiments, _ _ O
they _ _ O
force _ _ O
bistro _ _ B-CUISINE
cooking _ _ O
to _ _ O
mate _ _ O
with _ _ O
haute _ _ B-CUISINE
cuisine. _ _ I-CUISINE
To _ _ O
make _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
less _ _ O
stuffy _ _ O
and _ _ O
formal, _ _ O
they _ _ O
bring _ _ O
back _ _ O
stuffy _ _ O
formalities _ _ O
like _ _ O
cut-glass _ _ O
wine _ _ O
carafes _ _ O
and _ _ O
frilly _ _ O
oyster _ _ O
plates. _ _ O
They _ _ O
smudge _ _ O
the _ _ O
pages _ _ O
of _ _ O
Escoffier _ _ O
with _ _ O
strange _ _ O
foreign _ _ O
spices. _ _ O
It _ _ O
may _ _ O
sound _ _ O
like _ _ O
run-of-the-mill _ _ O
fusion, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
top-to-bottom _ _ O
remix, _ _ O
and _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
every _ _ O
weird _ _ O
mongrel _ _ O
idea _ _ O
leads _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
direction _ _ O
of _ _ O
more _ _ O

baguette _ _ B-FOOD
à _ _ I-FOOD

a _ _ O
flatbread _ _ B-DISH
inspired _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O

Mr. _ _ O

one _ _ O
loaf _ _ O
after _ _ O
another, _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
North _ _ O

of _ _ O

It's _ _ O
no _ _ O
innovation, _ _ O
this _ _ O
bread, _ _ B-FOOD
just _ _ O
pita _ _ B-FOOD
dough _ _ I-FOOD
griddled _ _ O
in _ _ O
plenty _ _ O
of _ _ O
olive _ _ B-FOOD
oil, _ _ I-FOOD
buried _ _ O
under _ _ O
Provençal _ _ B-FOOD
herbs _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
sent _ _ O
out _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
snowbank _ _ O
of _ _ O
fromage _ _ B-FOOD
blanc, _ _ I-FOOD
but _ _ O
people _ _ O
tore _ _ O
it _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
greedy, _ _ O
greasy _ _ O
fingers _ _ O
at _ _ O
every _ _ O
table, _ _ O
mine _ _ O
included. _ _ O
Not _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
hide _ _ O
their _ _ O
training. _ _ O
(Mr. _ _ O

worked _ _ O
for _ _ O
years _ _ O
under _ _ O
Daniel _ _ O

takes _ _ O
the _ _ O
lead _ _ O
in _ _ O
this _ _ O

The _ _ O
mille-feuille _ _ B-DISH
is _ _ O
a _ _ O

an _ _ O

of _ _ O
ribbon-thin _ _ O
king _ _ B-FOOD
trumpet _ _ I-FOOD
mushroom _ _ I-FOOD
stems _ _ I-FOOD
folded _ _ O
over _ _ O

It _ _ O
looks _ _ O
like _ _ O
pastry _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
pulls _ _ O
apart _ _ O
like _ _ O
buttered _ _ B-FOOD
noodles, _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
drag _ _ O
them _ _ O
through _ _ O
a _ _ O
pool _ _ O
of _ _ O
green _ _ B-FOOD
curry, _ _ I-FOOD
the _ _ O
scene _ _ O
shifts _ _ O
to _ _ O
Thailand. _ _ B-LOC
It's _ _ O
a _ _ O
disorienting _ _ O
dish, _ _ O
and _ _ O
makes _ _ O
your _ _ O
head _ _ O
spin _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
wonderful _ _ O

The _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
creates _ _ O
a _ _ O
parallel _ _ O
world _ _ O
where _ _ O
French _ _ B-FOOD
pastry _ _ I-FOOD
turns _ _ O
into _ _ O
Thai _ _ B-FOOD
curry; _ _ I-FOOD
it's _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
have _ _ O
imagined _ _ O
an _ _ O
alternative _ _ O
history _ _ O
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
the _ _ O
leading _ _ O
kitchens _ _ O
of _ _ O
France _ _ B-LOC
turned _ _ O
left _ _ O
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
right _ _ O
several _ _ O
decades _ _ O

What _ _ O
if _ _ O
nouvelle _ _ B-CUISINE
cuisine _ _ I-CUISINE
had _ _ O
embraced _ _ O
maximalism _ _ O
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
minimalism, _ _ O
full-frontal _ _ O

of _ _ O
lean _ _ O

what _ _ O
if, _ _ O
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
teaching _ _ O
Americans _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
puff _ _ B-FOOD
pastry, _ _ I-FOOD
the _ _ O
country's _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
had _ _ O
taken _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
lessons _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
rest _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
French-speaking _ _ O
world? _ _ O
For _ _ O
one _ _ O
thing, _ _ O
they _ _ O
might _ _ O
have _ _ O

up _ _ O

Dirty _ _ B-EST
French's _ _ I-EST
glorious _ _ O

and _ _ O
preserved _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
and _ _ O
wheels _ _ O
of _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
eggplant, _ _ O
the _ _ O
slices _ _ O
of _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
loin _ _ O
are _ _ O
saddled _ _ O
with _ _ O
as _ _ O
much _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
as _ _ O
they _ _ O
can _ _ O
reasonably _ _ O
be _ _ O
asked _ _ O
to _ _ O
carry. _ _ O
Or, _ _ O
though _ _ O
this _ _ O
probably _ _ O
needed _ _ O
a _ _ O
push _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
roast-chicken _ _ O
gold _ _ O
rush _ _ O
started _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O

they _ _ O
might _ _ O
have _ _ O
hit _ _ O
upon _ _ O
Dirty _ _ O
French's _ _ O
$72 _ _ O
poultry _ _ O
feast. _ _ O
First _ _ O
to _ _ O
arrive _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
sneakily _ _ O
rich _ _ O
(translation: _ _ O
you _ _ O
can't _ _ O
see _ _ O
the _ _ O
foie _ _ O
gras) _ _ O
white _ _ O
meat _ _ O
in _ _ O
mustard-herb _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
the _ _ O
bird's _ _ O
hindquarters _ _ O
show _ _ O
up _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
cutting _ _ O
board. _ _ O
They've _ _ O
been _ _ O
soaked _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
Vietnamese _ _ O
marinade _ _ O
of _ _ O
soy, _ _ O
fish _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
and _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
grass, _ _ O
slowly _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
in _ _ O
melted _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
fat _ _ O
(oh _ _ O
yes _ _ O
they _ _ O
have), _ _ O
then _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
and _ _ O
freshened _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
lime _ _ O
zest. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
comes _ _ O
with _ _ O
crepes, _ _ O
irrelevantly; _ _ O
just _ _ O
pick _ _ O
up _ _ O
a _ _ O
drumstick _ _ O
and _ _ O
get _ _ O
to _ _ O
work _ _ O
on _ _ O
that _ _ O
burnished _ _ O
skin. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
have _ _ O
an _ _ O
instinct _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
right _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
too _ _ O
much, _ _ O
but _ _ O
some _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
trip _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
wrong _ _ O
kind. _ _ O
A _ _ O
deeply _ _ O
aromatic _ _ O
and _ _ O
fairly _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
bouillabaisse _ _ O
was _ _ O
thick _ _ O
with _ _ O
octopus, _ _ O
mussels, _ _ O
monkfish _ _ O
and _ _ O
one _ _ O
small, _ _ O
whole, _ _ O
wonderful _ _ O
red _ _ O
mullet. _ _ O
Cuttlefish _ _ O
ink _ _ O
took _ _ O
the _ _ O
broth _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
outer _ _ O
edge _ _ O
of _ _ O
intensity, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
medicinal _ _ O
taste _ _ O
of _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
marjoram _ _ O
in _ _ O
some _ _ O
spoonfuls _ _ O
went _ _ O
beyond _ _ O
it. _ _ O
And _ _ O
while _ _ O
duck _ _ O
heart _ _ O
kebabs _ _ O
unloaded _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
added _ _ O
brawn _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O

and _ _ O
lardons _ _ O
salad, _ _ O
the _ _ O
blast _ _ O
of _ _ O
mustard _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
dressing _ _ O
was _ _ O
an _ _ O
excessive _ _ O
use _ _ O
of _ _ O
force. _ _ O
A _ _ O
programmatic _ _ O

of _ _ O
the _ _ O

Something _ _ O
Clearly _ _ O

Under _ _ O

of _ _ O

-- _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
guarantee _ _ O
a _ _ O
sprinkling _ _ O
of _ _ O
magical _ _ O
pixie _ _ O
dust _ _ O
on _ _ O
every _ _ O
plate. _ _ O
Baked _ _ O
clams _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
perplexed _ _ O
by _ _ O
their _ _ O
thick _ _ O
jackets _ _ O
of _ _ O
almonds _ _ O
and _ _ O
Ethiopian _ _ O
spices, _ _ O
and _ _ O
so _ _ O
was _ _ O
I. _ _ O
A _ _ O
beautifully _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
trout _ _ O
meunière _ _ O
was _ _ O
speckled _ _ O
with _ _ O
sesame _ _ O
seeds _ _ O
and _ _ O
herbs, _ _ O
a _ _ O
mix _ _ O
that _ _ O
came _ _ O
across _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
oddly _ _ O
neutered _ _ O
za'atar. _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
eat _ _ O
extraordinarily _ _ O
well _ _ O
by _ _ O
calling _ _ O
your _ _ O
shots _ _ O
and _ _ O
rolling _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
loose, _ _ O
genial _ _ O
decadence _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
place. _ _ O
The _ _ O
mood _ _ O
is _ _ O
set _ _ O
when _ _ O
a _ _ O
server _ _ O
comes _ _ O
over _ _ O
and _ _ O
says, _ _ O
in _ _ O
as _ _ O
laid-back _ _ O
a _ _ O
tone _ _ O
as _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
can _ _ O
manage _ _ O
while _ _ O

original _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
next _ _ O
year _ _ O
while _ _ O
continuing _ _ O

The _ _ O

whether _ _ O
this _ _ O

A _ _ O
little _ _ O
skepticism _ _ O
is _ _ O
in _ _ O
order _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
hear _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O

history _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
chef _ _ O
running _ _ O
a _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
time. _ _ O
As _ _ O
frequent _ _ O
diners _ _ O
know _ _ O
from _ _ O
sad _ _ O
experience, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is, _ _ O
in _ _ O
fact, _ _ O
possible _ _ O
to _ _ O
cook _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
acclaimed _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
without _ _ O
picking _ _ O
up _ _ O
any _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
qualities _ _ O
that _ _ O
it's _ _ O
acclaimed _ _ O
for. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
when _ _ O
actual _ _ O
skills _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
learned, _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
always _ _ O
obvious. _ _ O
Or, _ _ O
occasionally, _ _ O
they're _ _ O
all _ _ O
too _ _ O
obvious, _ _ O
and _ _ O
you'll _ _ O
catch _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O

trying _ _ O
to _ _ O
replicate _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
originally _ _ O
assembled _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
team _ _ O
of _ _ O
40. _ _ O
One _ _ O
interesting _ _ O
thing _ _ O
about _ _ O
Soogil _ _ O
Lim _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
almost _ _ O
draw _ _ O
a _ _ O
straight _ _ O
line _ _ O
from _ _ O
his _ _ O
résumé _ _ O
to _ _ O
what's _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
at _ _ O
his _ _ O
four-month-old _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
East _ _ B-LOC
Village, _ _ I-LOC
Soogil _ _ B-EST
. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
easy _ _ O
to _ _ O
spot _ _ O
the _ _ O
imprint _ _ O
of _ _ O
Hooni _ _ O
Kim's _ _ O
Hanjan _ _ O
, _ _ O
where _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
executive _ _ O
chef _ _ O
for _ _ O
four _ _ O
years. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Lim _ _ O
lived _ _ O
in _ _ O
South _ _ B-LOC
Korea _ _ I-LOC
until _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
28, _ _ O
so _ _ O
what _ _ O
he _ _ O
learned _ _ O
at _ _ O
Hanjan _ _ B-EST
was _ _ O
not _ _ O
how _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
the _ _ O
country's _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
food _ _ O
but _ _ O
how _ _ O
to _ _ O
rework _ _ O
it _ _ O
into _ _ O
appealing, _ _ O
contemporary _ _ O
small _ _ O
plates. _ _ O
Daniel _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
where _ _ O
he _ _ O
spent _ _ O
seven _ _ O
years _ _ O
and _ _ O
reached _ _ O
the _ _ O
rank _ _ O
of _ _ O
sous-chef, _ _ O
turns _ _ O
up _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
French _ _ B-CUISINE
techniques _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Lim _ _ O
leans _ _ O
on, _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
presentations _ _ O
that _ _ O
carry _ _ O
an _ _ O
echo _ _ O
of _ _ O
nouvelle _ _ B-CUISINE
cuisine, _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
tender _ _ O
braised _ _ B-DISH
short _ _ I-DISH
rib, _ _ I-DISH
in _ _ O
his _ _ O
fondness _ _ O
for _ _ O
foie _ _ B-FOOD
gras _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
in _ _ O
his _ _ O
preference _ _ O
for _ _ O
skillfully _ _ O
modulating _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
rather _ _ O
than _ _ O
tossing _ _ O
umami _ _ O
grenades. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
also _ _ O
apparent, _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
look _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room, _ _ O
that _ _ O
in _ _ O
his _ _ O
earlier _ _ O
jobs _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Lim _ _ O
spent _ _ O
most _ _ O
of _ _ O
his _ _ O
time _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen; _ _ O
the _ _ O
lineage _ _ O
you _ _ O
taste _ _ O
in _ _ O
his _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
show _ _ O
up _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
design. _ _ O
Soogil _ _ B-EST
(SOO-gil) _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
evoke _ _ O
a _ _ O
rambunctious _ _ O
Korean _ _ B-CUISINE
pub _ _ B-TYPE
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
Hanjan _ _ B-EST
does. _ _ O
Nor _ _ O
is _ _ O
it _ _ O
a _ _ O
carpeted _ _ O
and _ _ O
tableclothed _ _ O
luxury _ _ B-TYPE
liner, _ _ I-TYPE
like _ _ O
Daniel. _ _ B-EST
Under _ _ O
the _ _ O
guidance _ _ O
of _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Lim's _ _ O
wife, _ _ O
Sasook _ _ O
Youn, _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
done _ _ O
in _ _ O
what _ _ O
we _ _ O
now _ _ O
recognize _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
all-purpose _ _ O
Modern _ _ O
Asian _ _ O
style _ _ O
-- _ _ O
a _ _ O
long _ _ O
banquette _ _ O
of _ _ O
blond _ _ O
wood _ _ O
against _ _ O
one _ _ O
wall, _ _ O
a _ _ O
dining _ _ O
counter _ _ O
facing _ _ O
another _ _ O
wall, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
long _ _ O
communal _ _ O
table _ _ O
with _ _ O
benches _ _ O
running _ _ O
down _ _ O
the _ _ O
middle, _ _ O
all _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
plank _ _ O
floor. _ _ O
A _ _ O
few _ _ O
framed _ _ O
prints _ _ O
by _ _ O
Suzy _ _ O
Taekyung _ _ O
Kim, _ _ O
a _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
artist _ _ O
from _ _ O
South _ _ B-LOC
Korea, _ _ I-LOC
are _ _ O
suspended _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
banquettes. _ _ O
French _ _ O
windows _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
street _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
thrown _ _ O
open _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
weather _ _ O
ever _ _ O
cooperates. _ _ O
Hanging _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
back _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
curtain. _ _ O
Once _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
while _ _ O
it _ _ O
parts _ _ O
just _ _ O
wide _ _ O
enough _ _ O
for _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Lim's _ _ O
face _ _ O
to _ _ O
appear _ _ O
while _ _ O
he _ _ O
scans _ _ O
the _ _ O
tables. _ _ O
Sometimes _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
full. _ _ O
They _ _ O
should _ _ O
be _ _ O
full _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
time, _ _ O
because _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
like _ _ O
this _ _ O
does _ _ O
not _ _ O
just _ _ O
sprout _ _ O
up _ _ O
through _ _ O
every _ _ O
crack _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
sidewalk, _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
at _ _ O
prices _ _ O
that, _ _ O
with _ _ O
one _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
exceptions, _ _ O
don't _ _ O
go _ _ O
over _ _ O
$20. _ _ O
A _ _ O
good _ _ O
window _ _ O
into _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Lim's _ _ O
mind _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
bindaetteok _ _ B-DISH
appetizer. _ _ O
Usually _ _ O
these _ _ O
mung _ _ B-FOOD
bean _ _ I-FOOD
pancakes _ _ I-FOOD
present _ _ O
as _ _ O
flat, _ _ O
starchy _ _ O
discs _ _ O
whose _ _ O
golden _ _ O
surfaces _ _ O
hint _ _ O
at _ _ O
crunchiness _ _ O
without _ _ O
actually _ _ O
delivering _ _ O
it. _ _ O
The _ _ O
ones _ _ O
at _ _ O
Soogil, _ _ B-EST
fried _ _ O
in _ _ O
pork _ _ O
fat, _ _ O
have _ _ O
golden _ _ O
crusts _ _ O
like _ _ O
veal _ _ B-FOOD
cutlets; _ _ I-FOOD
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
you've _ _ O
speared _ _ O
a _ _ O
piece _ _ O
with _ _ O
some _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
kimchi _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
dunked _ _ O
it _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
dipping _ _ B-FOOD
sauce, _ _ I-FOOD
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
expected _ _ O
flavors, _ _ O
plus _ _ O
a _ _ O
formidable _ _ O
crunch _ _ O
to _ _ O
sweeten _ _ O
the _ _ O
deal. _ _ O
He _ _ O
tinkers _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
glass _ _ B-FOOD
noodle _ _ I-FOOD
dish _ _ O
called _ _ O
japchae _ _ B-DISH
in _ _ O
less _ _ O
radical _ _ O
fashion. _ _ O
The _ _ O
noodles _ _ B-FOOD
themselves, _ _ O
shaped _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
swirl _ _ O
with _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
shreds _ _ O
of _ _ O
vegetables _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
oyster _ _ B-FOOD
mushrooms, _ _ I-FOOD
have _ _ O
drunk _ _ O
in _ _ O
more _ _ O
soy _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
sesame _ _ B-FOOD
flavor _ _ O
than _ _ O
they _ _ O
typically _ _ O
do. _ _ O
And _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Lim _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
tripled, _ _ O
at _ _ O
least, _ _ O
the _ _ O
amount _ _ O
of _ _ O
bulgogi, _ _ B-FOOD
a _ _ O
point _ _ O
he _ _ O
emphasizes _ _ O
by _ _ O
mounding _ _ O
the _ _ O
meat _ _ B-FOOD
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
noodles _ _ B-FOOD
so _ _ O
it _ _ O
looks _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
sloppy _ _ B-FOOD
Joe _ _ I-FOOD
missing _ _ O
its _ _ O
top _ _ O
bun. _ _ B-FOOD
The _ _ O
care _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
pays _ _ O
to _ _ O
technique _ _ O
is _ _ O
obvious _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
seafood _ _ B-FOOD
dishes; _ _ O
I've _ _ O
never _ _ O
had _ _ O
one _ _ O
that _ _ O
wasn't _ _ O
perfectly _ _ O
cooked. _ _ O
Monkfish, _ _ B-FOOD
which _ _ O
can _ _ O
come _ _ O
off _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
rubber _ _ O
replica _ _ O
of _ _ O
some _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
anatomy _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
rather _ _ O
not _ _ O
think _ _ O
about, _ _ O
gets _ _ O
wrapped _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
cabbage _ _ B-FOOD
or _ _ O
lettuce _ _ B-FOOD
leaf, _ _ O
gently _ _ O
poached, _ _ O
and _ _ O
sliced _ _ O
into _ _ O
neat _ _ O
little _ _ O
wheels. _ _ O
Arranged _ _ O
over _ _ O
stir-fried _ _ B-FOOD
vegetables _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
sea _ _ O
of _ _ O
fermented _ _ B-FOOD
chile _ _ I-FOOD
sauce, _ _ I-FOOD
it's _ _ O
terrific, _ _ O
and _ _ O
about _ _ O
as _ _ O
French _ _ B-CUISINE
as _ _ O
Korean _ _ B-CUISINE
cooking _ _ O
should _ _ O
be _ _ O
allowed _ _ O
to _ _ O
get. _ _ O
An _ _ O
almost _ _ O
silky _ _ O
consistency _ _ O
marks _ _ O
the _ _ O
mackerel _ _ B-DISH
that _ _ O
Soogil _ _ B-EST
serves, _ _ O
nigiri-style, _ _ O
over _ _ O
wads _ _ O
of _ _ O
rice _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
with _ _ O
ssamjang _ _ B-FOOD
(standing _ _ O
in _ _ O
for _ _ O
wasabi?) _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
wrapped _ _ O
in _ _ O
chard _ _ B-FOOD
leaves. _ _ I-FOOD
The _ _ O
tender _ _ O
Manila _ _ B-FOOD
clams, _ _ I-FOOD
squid _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
shrimp _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
spicy _ _ B-DISH
tofu-seafood _ _ I-DISH
stew _ _ O
kept _ _ O
more _ _ O
of _ _ O
their _ _ O
natural _ _ O
juiciness _ _ O
than _ _ O
usual, _ _ O
although _ _ O
very _ _ O
firm _ _ O
shellfish _ _ B-FOOD
isn't _ _ O
necessarily _ _ O
a _ _ O
defect _ _ O
in _ _ O
that _ _ O
dish. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Lim _ _ O
herds _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
soft _ _ B-FOOD
tofu _ _ I-FOOD
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
flan _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
bottom _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
bowl, _ _ O
rather _ _ O
than _ _ O
letting _ _ O
cubes _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
fend _ _ O
for _ _ O
themselves _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
broth _ _ O
-- _ _ O
a _ _ O
move _ _ O
that _ _ O
nicely _ _ O
heightens _ _ O
the _ _ O
contrast _ _ O
of _ _ O
tofu _ _ O
and _ _ O
chiles. _ _ O
The _ _ O
least _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
thing _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
must _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
foie _ _ O
gras _ _ O
terrine, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it's _ _ O
also _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
only _ _ O
disappointments, _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O
crumbly _ _ O
Melba _ _ O
toasts _ _ O
and _ _ O
washed-out _ _ O
green-plum _ _ O
jelly. _ _ O
A _ _ O
dish _ _ O
called _ _ O
nurungji _ _ O
gras _ _ O
is _ _ O
something _ _ O
else _ _ O
entirely: _ _ O
a _ _ O
fine _ _ O
seared _ _ O
hunk _ _ O
of _ _ O
foie _ _ O
gras _ _ O
laid _ _ O
over _ _ O
spinach _ _ O
and _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
mushrooms _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
springy, _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
sizzled _ _ O
rice _ _ O
cake. _ _ O
Slabs _ _ O
of _ _ O
pork _ _ O
belly _ _ O
are _ _ O
braised _ _ O
until _ _ O
the _ _ O
fat _ _ O
streaks _ _ O
are _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
liquid. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
they're _ _ O
given _ _ O
a _ _ O
meaningful _ _ O
sear _ _ O
and _ _ O
served _ _ O
alongside _ _ O
a _ _ O
stripe _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
I've _ _ O
never _ _ O
had _ _ O
before, _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
fermented _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
and _ _ O
green _ _ O
plums _ _ O
and _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
red _ _ O
peppers: _ _ O
spicy, _ _ O
salty, _ _ O
sour _ _ O
and _ _ O
hot. _ _ O
The _ _ O
dish _ _ O
that _ _ O
breaks _ _ O
the _ _ O
$20 _ _ O
barrier _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
short _ _ O
rib. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you've _ _ O
had _ _ O
Daniel's _ _ O
braised _ _ O
short _ _ O
ribs _ _ O
, _ _ O
the _ _ O
tenderness _ _ O
and _ _ O
concentration _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
familiar _ _ O
to _ _ O
you, _ _ O
although _ _ O
Soogil's _ _ O
version _ _ O
is _ _ O
pointedly _ _ O
suffused _ _ O
with _ _ O
soy _ _ O
rather _ _ O
than _ _ O
red _ _ O
wine. _ _ O
Underlining _ _ O
the _ _ O
French _ _ O
connection, _ _ O
this _ _ O
block _ _ O
of _ _ O
beef _ _ O
is _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
carrots, _ _ O
potatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
winter _ _ O
squash. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
eat _ _ O
it _ _ O
by _ _ O
yourself, _ _ O
you _ _ O
could _ _ O
make _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
of _ _ O
it. _ _ O
After _ _ O
which _ _ O
you _ _ O
should _ _ O
probably _ _ O
investigate _ _ O
something _ _ O
that _ _ O
goes _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
name _ _ O
Jenga _ _ O
Tower. _ _ O
Cigarettes _ _ O
of _ _ O
fried _ _ O
dough, _ _ O
chewy _ _ O
like _ _ O
rice _ _ O
sticks, _ _ O
are _ _ O
stacked _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
log _ _ O
cabin, _ _ O
then _ _ O
dusted _ _ O
with _ _ O
sugar _ _ O
and _ _ O
misugaru, _ _ O
the _ _ O
powdered _ _ O
grain _ _ O
and _ _ O
bean _ _ O
blend _ _ O
Koreans _ _ O
use _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
instant _ _ O
breakfast _ _ O
drink. _ _ O
You _ _ O
pull _ _ O
out _ _ O
a _ _ O
stick _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
until _ _ O
the _ _ O
tower _ _ O
falls _ _ O
and _ _ O
brings _ _ O
down _ _ O
the _ _ O
scoop _ _ O
of _ _ O
honey-and-chestnut _ _ O
gelato _ _ O
balanced _ _ O
on _ _ O
top. _ _ O
The _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
could _ _ O
take _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
lessons _ _ O
in _ _ O
balance _ _ O
from _ _ O
that _ _ O
dessert. _ _ O
The _ _ O
lights _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
dimmed _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
clicks. _ _ O
The _ _ O
pop _ _ O
music, _ _ O
while _ _ O
not _ _ O
actively _ _ O
awful, _ _ O
is _ _ O
just _ _ O
odd _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
subliminally _ _ O
distracting. _ _ O
Soogil _ _ O
can't _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
find _ _ O
the _ _ O
right _ _ O
tone _ _ O
for _ _ O
service, _ _ O
either. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
nights _ _ O
it's _ _ O
very _ _ O
familiar _ _ O
and _ _ O
on _ _ O
others, _ _ O
peculiarly _ _ O
fussy _ _ O
-- _ _ O
a _ _ O
server _ _ O
insisted _ _ O
on _ _ O
giving _ _ O
the _ _ O
book _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
brought _ _ O
a _ _ O
chair _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
own. _ _ O
These _ _ O
are _ _ O
minor _ _ O
snags, _ _ O
but _ _ O
sorting _ _ O
them _ _ O
out _ _ O
is _ _ O
tricky, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
for _ _ O
first-time _ _ O
restaurateurs. _ _ O
Somewhere _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
middle _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
relaxed, _ _ O
confident _ _ O
style _ _ O
that _ _ O
will _ _ O
match _ _ O
the _ _ O
spirit _ _ O
of _ _ O

a _ _ O
half-mile _ _ O
away _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
soaring, _ _ O
stately _ _ O
lobby _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Martha _ _ B-LOC
Washington _ _ I-LOC
Hotel. _ _ I-LOC
Marta _ _ B-EST
has _ _ O
Roman _ _ B-CUISINE
appetizers _ _ O
and _ _ O
entire _ _ O
Roman _ _ B-CUISINE
dishes _ _ O
repurposed _ _ O
as _ _ O
toppings _ _ O
for _ _ O
pizzas _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
thin _ _ O
crusts _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Roman _ _ B-CUISINE
style. _ _ O
Hold _ _ O
on, _ _ O
you _ _ O
say. _ _ O
Thin-crust _ _ B-FOOD
pies _ _ I-FOOD
are _ _ O
wall _ _ O
to _ _ O
wall _ _ O
around _ _ O
here. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
house _ _ O
style _ _ O
of _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York, _ _ I-LOC
a _ _ O
city _ _ O
to _ _ O
which _ _ O
people _ _ O
actually _ _ O
do _ _ O
travel _ _ O
for _ _ O
pizza. _ _ B-FOOD
The _ _ O
style _ _ O
came _ _ O
from _ _ O
Naples _ _ B-LOC
with _ _ O
America's _ _ B-LOC
earliest _ _ O
pizzaioli _ _ B-TYPE
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
century _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it's _ _ O
been _ _ O
rejuvenated _ _ O
by _ _ O
modern _ _ O
obsessives _ _ O
who _ _ O
precisely _ _ O
calibrate _ _ O
their _ _ O
flour _ _ B-FOOD
blends. _ _ O
What _ _ O
do _ _ O
we _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
learn _ _ O
from _ _ O
Rome? _ _ B-LOC
Let's _ _ O
keep _ _ O
local _ _ O
pride _ _ O
in _ _ O
check _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
minute. _ _ O
Marta's _ _ B-EST
crusts _ _ B-FOOD
are _ _ O
even _ _ O
thinner _ _ O
than _ _ O
what _ _ O
we _ _ O
think _ _ O
of _ _ O
as _ _ O
thin. _ _ O
Cooks _ _ O
in _ _ O
gray _ _ O
baseball _ _ O
caps _ _ O
press _ _ O
the _ _ O
dough _ _ B-FOOD
flat _ _ O
with _ _ O
rolling _ _ O
pins _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
marble _ _ O
counter. _ _ O
Slipped _ _ O
onto _ _ O
the _ _ O
floor _ _ O
of _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
hulking _ _ O
ovens _ _ O
whose _ _ O
black-tiled _ _ O
chimneys _ _ O
disappear _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
hotel's _ _ O
second _ _ O
floor, _ _ O
the _ _ O
pies _ _ B-FOOD
bake _ _ O
next _ _ O
to _ _ O
flickering _ _ O
stacks _ _ O
of _ _ O
firewood. _ _ O
The _ _ O
crust _ _ B-FOOD
at _ _ O
first-rank _ _ O
Roman _ _ B-CUISINE
pizzerias _ _ B-TYPE
like _ _ O
Da _ _ B-EST
Remo _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
Testaccio _ _ B-LOC
is _ _ O
often _ _ O
compared _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
cracker, _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
crackers _ _ B-FOOD
crumble. _ _ O
This _ _ O
doesn't. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
crust _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
loaf _ _ O
of _ _ O
peasant _ _ O
bread _ _ B-FOOD
from _ _ O
which _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
soft _ _ O
crumbs _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
stripped. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
durably _ _ O
crisp, _ _ O
unbendingly _ _ O
flat, _ _ O
and _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
hold _ _ O
a _ _ O
slice _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
edge, _ _ O
the _ _ O
rest _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
juts _ _ O
out _ _ O
above _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
cliff. _ _ O
Because _ _ O
everything _ _ O
I _ _ O
know _ _ O
about _ _ O
cliffs _ _ O
was _ _ O
learned _ _ O
from _ _ O
Wile _ _ O
E. _ _ O
Coyote, _ _ O
I _ _ O
kept _ _ O
waiting _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
tip _ _ O
on _ _ O
each _ _ O
Marta _ _ B-EST
slice _ _ O
to _ _ O
give _ _ O
way, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
never _ _ O
did. _ _ O
The _ _ O
pleasure _ _ O
of _ _ O
biting _ _ O
down _ _ O
on _ _ O
this _ _ O
pizza _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
both _ _ O
physical _ _ O
and _ _ O
auditory. _ _ O
The _ _ O
noise _ _ O
detonates _ _ O
along _ _ O
the _ _ O
jaw _ _ O
and _ _ O
plows _ _ O
right _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
inner _ _ O
ear. _ _ O
Every _ _ O
bite _ _ O
sounds _ _ O
and _ _ O
feels _ _ O
like _ _ O
that. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
soupy _ _ O
middle _ _ O
of _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
dough _ _ B-FOOD
under _ _ O
wet _ _ O
tomatoes. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
pure _ _ O
crunch, _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
way. _ _ O
What _ _ O
you _ _ O
lose _ _ O
with _ _ O
this _ _ O
style _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
soft, _ _ O
springy, _ _ O
baguette-like _ _ O
curls _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
edges _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
Neapolitan _ _ O
pizza. _ _ O
The _ _ O
outer _ _ O
crusts _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
Marta _ _ O
pie _ _ O
don't _ _ O
puff _ _ O
up; _ _ O
they _ _ O
stay _ _ O
hard _ _ O
and _ _ O
round, _ _ O
like _ _ O
grissini. _ _ O
When _ _ O
a _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
crust _ _ O
is _ _ O
all _ _ O
crackle, _ _ O
what's _ _ O
on _ _ O
top _ _ O
has _ _ O
to _ _ O
bring _ _ O
the _ _ O
flavor. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
where _ _ O
you _ _ O
see _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Anderer _ _ O
thinking _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
cook. _ _ O
He _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
great _ _ O
pizza-fied _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
carbonara, _ _ O
with _ _ O
dots _ _ O
of _ _ O
egg _ _ O
and _ _ O
grated _ _ O
pecorino _ _ O
over _ _ O
crumbled, _ _ O
starchy _ _ O
potatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
baconlike _ _ O
curls _ _ O
of _ _ O
guanciale. _ _ O
For _ _ O
a _ _ O
while, _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
doing _ _ O
an _ _ O
enjoyable _ _ O
two-dimensional _ _ O
trippa _ _ O
alla _ _ O
Romana, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
spreading _ _ O
the _ _ O
rich, _ _ O
chile-boosted _ _ O
tomato _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
pie _ _ O
and _ _ O
arranging _ _ O
tender, _ _ O
not _ _ O
too _ _ O
chewy _ _ O
bands _ _ O
of _ _ O
tripe _ _ O
on _ _ O
top. _ _ O
In _ _ O
a _ _ O
more _ _ O
classical _ _ O
vein, _ _ O
the _ _ O
margherita, _ _ O
spread _ _ O
with _ _ O
flavorful _ _ O
tomatoes _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
more _ _ O
pulp _ _ O
than _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
and _ _ O
punctuated _ _ O
with _ _ O
mozzarella, _ _ O
is _ _ O
superb. _ _ O
At _ _ O
$16, _ _ O
the _ _ O
buffalo _ _ O
mozzarella, _ _ O
richer _ _ O
and _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
faint _ _ O
taste _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
barnyard _ _ O
or _ _ O
wherever _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
water _ _ O
buffaloes _ _ O
pass _ _ O
the _ _ O
time, _ _ O
is _ _ O
worth _ _ O
the _ _ O
$4 _ _ O
upgrade _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
cow's _ _ O
milk _ _ O
variety. _ _ O
And _ _ O
if _ _ O
$18 _ _ O
seems _ _ O
high _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
funghi _ _ O
pizza, _ _ O
note _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
funghi _ _ O
in _ _ O
question _ _ O
are _ _ O
quartered _ _ O
chanterelles _ _ O
and _ _ O
frilly _ _ O
hen-of-the-woods, _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
with _ _ O
thyme _ _ O
and _ _ O
just _ _ O
enough _ _ O
salt. _ _ O
Like _ _ O
almost _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
toppings, _ _ O
the _ _ O
mushrooms _ _ O
are _ _ O
beautifully _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
with _ _ O
an _ _ O
insinuation _ _ O
of _ _ O
smoke; _ _ O
only _ _ O
the _ _ O
shoulder _ _ O
ham, _ _ O
layered _ _ O
between _ _ O
fontina _ _ O
and _ _ O
arugula, _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
to _ _ O
want _ _ O
more _ _ O
time _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
oven, _ _ O
or _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
it _ _ O
needed _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
sliced _ _ O
thin, _ _ O
so _ _ O
the _ _ O
edges _ _ O
could _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
and _ _ O
curl. _ _ O
Few _ _ O
pizzerias _ _ O
invest _ _ O
heavily _ _ O
in _ _ O
atmospherics, _ _ O
because _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
love _ _ O
it _ _ O
come _ _ O
and _ _ O
go _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
minutes. _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
it's _ _ O
a _ _ O
surprise _ _ O
just _ _ O
how _ _ O
little _ _ O
atmosphere _ _ O
the _ _ O
Union _ _ O
Square _ _ O
Hospitality _ _ O
Group _ _ O
has _ _ O
tried _ _ O
to _ _ O
conjure _ _ O
at _ _ O
Marta. _ _ O
The _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room, _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O
majestic _ _ O
high _ _ O
ceilings _ _ O
and _ _ O
blocky _ _ O
fluted _ _ O
columns, _ _ O
has _ _ O
the _ _ O
cold, _ _ O
empty _ _ O
monumentality _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
19th-century _ _ O
bank. _ _ O
There's _ _ O
some _ _ O
energy _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
counter _ _ O
that _ _ O
faces _ _ O
the _ _ O
ovens, _ _ O
but _ _ O
very _ _ O
little _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
rows _ _ O
of _ _ O
square _ _ O
tables _ _ O
behind _ _ O
it. _ _ O
The _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
is _ _ O
open _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
hotel _ _ O
lobby, _ _ O
and _ _ O
after _ _ O
a _ _ O
while, _ _ O
the _ _ O
comings _ _ O
and _ _ O
goings _ _ O
can _ _ O
make _ _ O
you _ _ O
feel _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
you're _ _ O
eating _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
waiting _ _ O
room _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
train _ _ O
station. _ _ O
Lingering _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
long _ _ O
series _ _ O
of _ _ O
courses _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
advised. _ _ O
Marta _ _ O
works _ _ O
best _ _ O
when _ _ O
treated _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
pizzeria, _ _ O
not _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
Main _ _ O
courses _ _ O
are _ _ O
available, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
as _ _ O
trustworthy _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
pies. _ _ O
Pork _ _ O
ribs _ _ O
managed _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
both _ _ O
charred _ _ O
and _ _ O
undercooked, _ _ O
while _ _ O
a _ _ O
slow-roasted _ _ O
short _ _ O
rib _ _ O
needed _ _ O
a _ _ O
more _ _ O
potent _ _ O
infusion _ _ O
of _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
than _ _ O
gremolata _ _ O
could _ _ O
give _ _ O
it. _ _ O
The _ _ O
mixed _ _ O
grill _ _ O
of _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
chops, _ _ O
ribs _ _ O
and _ _ O
sausage _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
magnificent _ _ O
exception, _ _ O
but _ _ O
in _ _ O
general _ _ O
the _ _ O
larger _ _ O
plates _ _ O
are _ _ O
best _ _ O
for _ _ O
those _ _ O
who _ _ O
can't _ _ O
eat _ _ O
pizza. _ _ O
(Marta _ _ O
does _ _ O
not _ _ O
make _ _ O
gluten-free _ _ O
dough.) _ _ O
A _ _ O
quick _ _ O
appetizer _ _ O
while _ _ O
the _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
bakes _ _ O
is _ _ O
absolutely _ _ O
recommended, _ _ O
though. _ _ O
Wood _ _ O
smoke _ _ O
wraps _ _ O
around _ _ O
rabbit _ _ O
meatballs, _ _ O
heavily _ _ O
peppered _ _ O
and _ _ O
herbed. _ _ O
The _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
does _ _ O
fine _ _ O
work _ _ O
with _ _ O
hot _ _ O
oil, _ _ O
swathing _ _ O
vegetable _ _ O
fritters _ _ O
or _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
fritto _ _ O
misto _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
translucently _ _ O
thin, _ _ O
light-gold _ _ O
batter _ _ O
and _ _ O
gently _ _ O
browning _ _ O
the _ _ O
bread _ _ O
crumbs _ _ O
around _ _ O
green _ _ O
supplì _ _ O
shaped _ _ O
from _ _ O
very _ _ O
good _ _ O
basil _ _ O
risotto. _ _ O
After _ _ O
pizza, _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
affogato _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
right, _ _ O
an _ _ O
ice _ _ O
cream _ _ O
sandwich _ _ O
that's _ _ O
harder _ _ O
to _ _ O
like _ _ O
than _ _ O
it _ _ O
should _ _ O
be _ _ O
(the _ _ O
salted _ _ O
chocolate _ _ O
cookies _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
thinner _ _ O
or _ _ O
softer, _ _ O
the _ _ O
pistachios _ _ O
crisper) _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
cup _ _ O
of _ _ O
tiramisù _ _ O
that's _ _ O
bracingly _ _ O
drenched _ _ O
in _ _ O
espresso. _ _ O
It _ _ O
costs _ _ O
just _ _ O
$5, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
helpful _ _ O
because _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
and _ _ O
fried _ _ O
food _ _ O
both _ _ O
need _ _ O
bubbles. _ _ O
Marta _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
sparkling _ _ O
wines, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
real _ _ O
action _ _ O
is _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
stockpile _ _ O
of _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
40 _ _ O
Champagnes, _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
$66 _ _ O
Roger _ _ O
Pouillon _ _ O
Cuvée _ _ O
de _ _ O
Réserve _ _ O
to _ _ O
some _ _ O
$300-plus _ _ O
vintage _ _ O
treats. _ _ O
Nobody _ _ O
goes _ _ O
to _ _ O
Rome _ _ O
for _ _ O
Champagne _ _ O
with _ _ O
pizza, _ _ O
either, _ _ O
but _ _ O
this _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
Rome. _ _ O

Some _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
hit _ _ O
the _ _ O
ground _ _ O
at _ _ O
full _ _ O
tilt. _ _ O
This _ _ O
review _ _ O
concerns _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
others, _ _ O
a _ _ O
place _ _ O
that _ _ O
stumbled _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
start, _ _ O
as _ _ O
ungainly _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
day-old _ _ O
giraffe, _ _ O
and _ _ O
only _ _ O
recently _ _ O
found _ _ O
its _ _ O
footing. _ _ O
Bar _ _ B-LOC
Bolonat _ _ I-LOC
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
West _ _ B-LOC
Village _ _ I-LOC
in _ _ O
March _ _ O
in _ _ O
what _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
an _ _ O
auspicious _ _ O
location, _ _ O
a _ _ O
corner _ _ O
spot _ _ O
looking _ _ O
out _ _ O
on _ _ O
Abingdon _ _ B-LOC
Square _ _ I-LOC
Park _ _ I-LOC
through _ _ O
yards _ _ O
of _ _ O
windows. _ _ O
Two _ _ O
months _ _ O
in, _ _ O
Einat _ _ O
Admony, _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
and _ _ O
owner, _ _ O
was _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
verge _ _ O
of _ _ O
closing _ _ O
it, _ _ O
she _ _ O
said _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
phone _ _ O
interview. _ _ O
Nearly _ _ O
half _ _ O
of _ _ O
her _ _ O
54 _ _ O
seats _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
taken _ _ O
away _ _ O
after _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
ruled _ _ O
that _ _ O
one _ _ O
wing _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
was _ _ O
an _ _ O
unpermitted _ _ O
sidewalk _ _ O
enclosure. _ _ O
The _ _ O
disputed _ _ O
area _ _ O
was _ _ O
quarantined _ _ O
behind _ _ O
a _ _ O
velvet _ _ O
rope, _ _ O
although _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
imagine _ _ O
a _ _ O
crowd _ _ O
lining _ _ O
up _ _ O
for _ _ O
admission _ _ O
to _ _ O
this _ _ O
patch _ _ O
of _ _ O
bare _ _ O
cement _ _ O
floor. _ _ O
This _ _ O
put _ _ O
a _ _ O
strain _ _ O
on _ _ O
revenues, _ _ O
no _ _ O
doubt, _ _ O
and _ _ O
made _ _ O
the _ _ O
place _ _ O
look _ _ O
pretty _ _ O
weird. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
with _ _ O
reduced _ _ O
capacity, _ _ O
Bar _ _ B-EST
Bolonat _ _ I-EST
was _ _ O
afflicted _ _ O
by _ _ O
suboptimal _ _ O
acoustics. _ _ O
When _ _ O
I _ _ O
ate _ _ O
there _ _ O
early _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
summer, _ _ O
the _ _ O
screeching _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
could _ _ O
have _ _ O
crushed _ _ O
scrap _ _ O
metal. _ _ O
It _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
crushed _ _ O
my _ _ O
desire _ _ O
to _ _ O
come _ _ O
back, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
held _ _ O
on _ _ O
because _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Admony _ _ O
was _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
something _ _ O
original _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen. _ _ O
The _ _ O
daughter _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
Iranian _ _ O
mother _ _ O
and _ _ O
Yemenite _ _ O
father, _ _ O
she _ _ O
was _ _ O
combining _ _ O
the _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
of _ _ O
contemporary _ _ O
multiethnic _ _ O
Israel, _ _ O
where _ _ O
she _ _ O
grew _ _ O
up, _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
idioms _ _ O
of _ _ O
modern _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York, _ _ I-LOC
where _ _ O
she _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
since _ _ O
getting _ _ O
a _ _ O
job _ _ O
in _ _ O
Bobby _ _ O
Flay _ _ O
's _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
at _ _ O
Bolo _ _ B-EST
in _ _ O
1999. _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
never _ _ O
tasted _ _ O
anything _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
like _ _ O
her _ _ O
shrimp _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
Yemenite _ _ B-CUISINE
curry, _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
fiery _ _ O
shot _ _ O
of _ _ O
green _ _ B-FOOD
zhug _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
round _ _ O
of _ _ O
fried _ _ B-FOOD
bread _ _ I-FOOD
called _ _ O
malawach _ _ B-FOOD
to _ _ O
soak _ _ O
up _ _ O
the _ _ O
spicy, _ _ O
turmeric-gold _ _ B-FOOD
coconut _ _ I-FOOD
milk. _ _ I-FOOD
I _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
more _ _ O
food _ _ O
like _ _ O
this _ _ O
in _ _ O
my _ _ O
life, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
wasn't _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
big _ _ O
hurry _ _ O
to _ _ O
face _ _ O
the _ _ O
decibels _ _ O
again. _ _ O
Now, _ _ O
with _ _ O
sound-absorbing _ _ O
tiles _ _ O
up _ _ O
above, _ _ O
Bar _ _ B-EST
Bolonat _ _ I-EST
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
quieter _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
though _ _ O
it's _ _ O
not _ _ O
entirely _ _ O
library-like. _ _ O
(One _ _ O
small _ _ O
section _ _ O
of _ _ O
ceiling, _ _ O
without _ _ O
tiles, _ _ O
is _ _ O
angled _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
soundboard _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
grand _ _ O
piano, _ _ O

the _ _ O

makes _ _ O
this _ _ O
racetrack-shaped _ _ O

so _ _ O

is _ _ O
the _ _ O

at _ _ O

of _ _ O

as _ _ O
they're _ _ O
ready. _ _ O
Or _ _ O
so _ _ O
the _ _ O
servers _ _ O
say. _ _ O
The _ _ O

is _ _ O
split _ _ O
into _ _ O
small, _ _ O
medium _ _ O
and _ _ O
large _ _ O
plates. _ _ O
As _ _ O
common _ _ O
sense _ _ O
would _ _ O
tell _ _ O
you _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
servers _ _ O
weren't _ _ O
telling _ _ O
you _ _ O
otherwise, _ _ O
the _ _ O
bigger _ _ O
ones, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O

with _ _ I-DISH
dates _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ I-DISH
chestnuts _ _ I-DISH
until _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
pull-apart _ _ O
tender, _ _ O
are _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
easier _ _ O
to _ _ O
split _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
few _ _ O

of _ _ O

with _ _ I-DISH
dried _ _ I-DISH
pomegranate _ _ I-DISH

and _ _ I-DISH
juice. _ _ I-DISH
The _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
could _ _ O
do _ _ O
more _ _ O
to _ _ O
help _ _ O
by, _ _ O
say, _ _ O
carving _ _ O
the _ _ O
pomegranate-glazed _ _ B-DISH
poussin _ _ I-DISH
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
sending _ _ O
it _ _ O
out _ _ O
whole _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
serrated _ _ O
knife. _ _ O
The _ _ O
bit _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
dishes' _ _ O
showing _ _ O
up _ _ O
at _ _ O
random _ _ O
times _ _ O
is _ _ O
misleading, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
but _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
good _ _ O
way. _ _ O
My _ _ O
table _ _ O
was _ _ O
never _ _ O
laden _ _ O
down _ _ O
with _ _ O
more _ _ O
plates _ _ O
than _ _ O
it _ _ O
could _ _ O
hold. _ _ O
This _ _ O
ought _ _ O
to _ _ O
go _ _ O
without _ _ O
saying, _ _ O
but _ _ O
in _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
these _ _ O
days _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
does. _ _ O
Apart _ _ O
from _ _ O
one _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
unscheduled _ _ O
leaves _ _ O
of _ _ O
absence _ _ O
one _ _ O
night, _ _ O
the _ _ O
service _ _ O
was _ _ O
generally _ _ O
excellent, _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
professional _ _ O
bearing _ _ O
that _ _ O
signals _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Admony's _ _ O
intent _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
Israeli _ _ B-CUISINE
cuisine _ _ O
taken _ _ O
seriously. _ _ O
The _ _ O
white _ _ O
napkins, _ _ O
polished _ _ O
stemware, _ _ O
sheer _ _ O
curtains _ _ O
and _ _ O
understated _ _ O
modern _ _ O
furniture _ _ O
are _ _ O
all _ _ O
a _ _ O
determined _ _ O
bid _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
kinds _ _ O
of _ _ O
diners _ _ O
who _ _ O
would _ _ O
steer _ _ O
clear _ _ O
of _ _ O
anything _ _ O
resembling _ _ O
a _ _ O
hummus _ _ B-TYPE
hut. _ _ I-TYPE
For _ _ O
dessert, _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Admony _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
homey, _ _ O
from-scratch _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
Milky, _ _ O
a _ _ O
chocolate _ _ B-FOOD
pudding _ _ I-FOOD
brand _ _ O
so _ _ O
central _ _ O
to _ _ O
Israeli _ _ O
life _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
became _ _ O
the _ _ O
symbol _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
protest _ _ O
this _ _ O
fall _ _ O
against _ _ O
the _ _ O
high _ _ O
cost _ _ O
of _ _ O
living. _ _ O
The _ _ O
halvah _ _ B-DISH
crème _ _ I-DISH
brûlée _ _ I-DISH
tastes _ _ O
more _ _ O
like _ _ O
butterscotch _ _ B-FOOD
than _ _ O
sesame, _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
worth _ _ O
getting _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
tuft _ _ O
of _ _ O
halvah _ _ B-FOOD
floss _ _ I-FOOD
on _ _ O
top. _ _ O
The _ _ O
most _ _ O
entertaining _ _ O
and _ _ O
probably _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
fried _ _ O
envelope _ _ O
of _ _ O
baklava _ _ B-DISH
with _ _ O
ice _ _ B-FOOD
cream _ _ I-FOOD
sealed _ _ O
inside, _ _ O
although _ _ O
the _ _ O
ice _ _ B-FOOD
cream _ _ I-FOOD
should _ _ O
be _ _ O
colder _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
pastry _ _ B-FOOD
hotter _ _ O
if _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Admony _ _ O
wants _ _ O
to _ _ O
live _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
high _ _ O
standards _ _ O
once _ _ O
set _ _ O
by _ _ O

dinner _ _ O
at _ _ O

in _ _ O

to _ _ O

up _ _ O
by _ _ O

a _ _ O
dozen _ _ O
of _ _ O
Helen _ _ O
You's _ _ O
dumplings. _ _ B-FOOD
For _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
eight _ _ O
years, _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
You _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
and _ _ O
proprietor _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Tianjin _ _ B-EST
Dumpling _ _ I-EST
House, _ _ I-EST
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
so _ _ O
much _ _ O
a _ _ O
house _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
narrow _ _ O
shaft _ _ O
of _ _ O
elbow _ _ O
room _ _ O
behind _ _ O
a _ _ O
sneeze _ _ O
guard _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
basement _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
Chinese _ _ B-CUISINE
food-vendors' _ _ O
market _ _ O
on _ _ O
Main _ _ B-LOC
Street. _ _ I-LOC
The _ _ O
first _ _ O
dumpling _ _ B-FOOD
of _ _ O
hers _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
tried _ _ O
had _ _ O
a _ _ O
sea-bass _ _ B-FOOD
stuffing _ _ I-FOOD
cut _ _ O
with _ _ O
minced _ _ O
ginger, _ _ O
which _ _ O
gave _ _ O
bracing _ _ O
clarity _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
few _ _ O
drops _ _ O
of _ _ O
broth _ _ O
sealed _ _ O
inside. _ _ O
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
so _ _ O
satisfying _ _ O
that _ _ O
at _ _ O
first _ _ O
I _ _ O
felt _ _ O
no _ _ O
need _ _ O
to _ _ O
branch _ _ O
out. _ _ O
The _ _ O
dumplings _ _ O
were _ _ O
irresistibly _ _ O
priced, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
at _ _ O
about _ _ O
$5 _ _ O
a _ _ O
dozen, _ _ O
and _ _ O
I _ _ O
began _ _ O
to _ _ O
experiment _ _ O
with _ _ O
new _ _ O
ones: _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
and _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
zucchini _ _ O
humming _ _ O
with _ _ O
Sichuan _ _ O
peppercorns, _ _ O
maybe, _ _ O
or _ _ O
pork _ _ O
with _ _ O
threads _ _ O
of _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
dill. _ _ O
These _ _ O
were _ _ O
wildly _ _ O
good, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
One _ _ O
day, _ _ O
I _ _ O
noticed _ _ O
a _ _ O
sign _ _ O
inviting _ _ O
me _ _ O
to _ _ O
pick _ _ O
my _ _ O
own _ _ O
custom _ _ O
dumpling _ _ O
fillings _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
grid _ _ O
of _ _ O
24 _ _ O
ingredients. _ _ O
This _ _ O
paralyzed _ _ O
me. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
You _ _ O
clearly _ _ O
had _ _ O
a _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
genius _ _ O
for _ _ O
creating _ _ O
miniature _ _ O
worlds _ _ O
of _ _ O
flavor. _ _ O
Who _ _ O
was _ _ O
I _ _ O
to _ _ O
tell _ _ O
her _ _ O
what _ _ O
she _ _ O
ought _ _ O
to _ _ O
fold _ _ O
into _ _ O
her _ _ O
circles _ _ O
of _ _ O
dough? _ _ O
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
had _ _ O
handed _ _ O
me _ _ O
a _ _ O
box _ _ O
of _ _ O
feathers, _ _ O
bones, _ _ O
beaks _ _ O
and _ _ O
flesh _ _ O
and _ _ O
said, _ _ O
"Here, _ _ O
build _ _ O
a _ _ O
parrot." _ _ O
What _ _ O
I _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
was _ _ O
more _ _ O
of _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
You's _ _ O
recipes, _ _ O
not _ _ O
mine, _ _ O
and _ _ O
I _ _ O
got _ _ O
my _ _ O
wish _ _ O
earlier _ _ O
this _ _ O
year _ _ O
when _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
You _ _ O
opened _ _ O
Dumpling _ _ O
Galaxy _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
blocks _ _ O
from _ _ O
her _ _ O
original _ _ O
stall. _ _ O
Dumpling _ _ O
Galaxy _ _ O
sits _ _ O
back _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
street, _ _ O
inside _ _ O
a _ _ O
shiny _ _ O
new _ _ O
mall _ _ O
it _ _ O
shares _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
Korean-French _ _ O
bakery _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
purveyor _ _ O
of _ _ O
sparkly _ _ O
false _ _ O
eyelashes. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
You _ _ O
designed _ _ O
the _ _ O
striking, _ _ O
modern _ _ O
interior _ _ O
herself, _ _ O
splashing _ _ O
bold _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
red _ _ O
across _ _ O
walls _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
basket-weave _ _ O
relief _ _ O
and _ _ O
building _ _ O
deep _ _ O
semiprivate _ _ O
booths, _ _ O
each _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O
own _ _ O
TV _ _ O
screen _ _ O
showing _ _ O
highlights _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
100 _ _ O
dumplings _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Dumpling _ _ O
Channel _ _ O
goes _ _ O
heavy _ _ O
on _ _ O
cross-section _ _ O
shots _ _ O
that _ _ O
reveal _ _ O
the _ _ O
central _ _ O
core _ _ O
of _ _ O
filling. _ _ O
Take _ _ O
a _ _ O
good _ _ O
look, _ _ O
because _ _ O
this _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
sight _ _ O
you _ _ O
should _ _ O
never _ _ O
see _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
meal _ _ O
at _ _ O
Dumpling _ _ O
Galaxy. _ _ O
Resist _ _ O
the _ _ O
exploratory _ _ O
nibble. _ _ O
Dip _ _ O
one _ _ O
side _ _ O
in _ _ O
black _ _ O
vinegar _ _ O
and _ _ O
soy, _ _ O
and _ _ O
paint _ _ O
it _ _ O
with _ _ O
chile _ _ O
oil _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
like, _ _ O
then _ _ O
pocket _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole _ _ O
thing _ _ O
in _ _ O
your _ _ O
mouth. _ _ O
It _ _ O
won't _ _ O
gush _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
waterfall _ _ O
of _ _ O
broth. _ _ O
It _ _ O
will, _ _ O
however, _ _ O
hold _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
drops _ _ O
of _ _ O
liquid _ _ O
shed _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
filling _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
dumpling _ _ O
boiled. _ _ O
Those _ _ O
drops _ _ O
belong _ _ O
to _ _ O
you. _ _ O
Sometimes _ _ O
those _ _ O
juices _ _ O
taste _ _ O
like _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
green _ _ O
herbs, _ _ O
as _ _ O
when _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
You _ _ O
mixes _ _ O
cilantro _ _ O
with _ _ O
minced _ _ O
lamb, _ _ O
or _ _ O
dill _ _ O
with _ _ O
excellent _ _ O
softly _ _ O
scrambled _ _ O
eggs. _ _ O
Sometimes _ _ O
they _ _ O
combine _ _ O
those _ _ O
qualities _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
whiplash _ _ O
of _ _ O
heat, _ _ O
as _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
head-twistingly _ _ O
good _ _ O
spicy _ _ O
beef _ _ O
dumpling, _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
with _ _ O
scallions, _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
red _ _ O
and _ _ O
green _ _ O
chiles, _ _ O
and _ _ O
searing _ _ O
dried _ _ O
chile _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
As _ _ O
a _ _ O
young _ _ O
girl _ _ O
in _ _ O
Tianjin, _ _ O
China, _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
You _ _ O
was _ _ O
taught _ _ O
to _ _ O
cook _ _ O
by _ _ O
her _ _ O
mother _ _ O
and _ _ O
grandparents. _ _ O
Her _ _ O
dumplings _ _ O
are _ _ O
sturdy, _ _ O
knobby, _ _ O
domestic _ _ O
creatures _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Northern _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
tradition. _ _ O
Sometimes _ _ O
you _ _ O
see _ _ O
the _ _ O
ghostly _ _ O
outline _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
fillings _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
shiny _ _ O
white _ _ O
skins, _ _ O
and _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
you _ _ O
can't. _ _ O
But _ _ O
her _ _ O
dumplings _ _ O
are _ _ O
stuffed _ _ O
to _ _ O
order, _ _ O
and _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
You _ _ O
fine-tunes _ _ O
them _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
sensitivity _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
natural _ _ O
cook _ _ O
who _ _ O
listens _ _ O
to _ _ O
her _ _ O
ingredients. _ _ O
Mixing _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
with _ _ O
two _ _ O
varieties _ _ O
of _ _ O
celery, _ _ O
the _ _ O
more _ _ O
bitter _ _ O
and _ _ O
self-assured _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweeter, _ _ O
shyer _ _ O
Western _ _ O
kind, _ _ O
and _ _ O
using _ _ O
both _ _ O
stalks _ _ O
and _ _ O
leaves, _ _ O
she _ _ O
builds _ _ O
exhilarating _ _ O
harmonies. _ _ O
It _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
miracle _ _ O
on _ _ O
Main _ _ O
Street _ _ O
if _ _ O
all _ _ O
100 _ _ O
varieties _ _ O
at _ _ O
Dumpling _ _ O
Galaxy _ _ O
were _ _ O
equally _ _ O
lovable. _ _ O
They _ _ O
aren't. _ _ O
The _ _ O
one _ _ O
with _ _ O
shrimp, _ _ O
scallops _ _ O
and _ _ O
crab _ _ O
meat _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
deliver _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
luxury _ _ O
it _ _ O
promised. _ _ O
Steamed _ _ O
har _ _ O
gow _ _ O
were _ _ O
less _ _ O
juicy _ _ O
than _ _ O
those _ _ O
wheeled _ _ O
around _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
dim _ _ O
sum _ _ O
carts. _ _ O
My _ _ O
strategy _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
seek _ _ O
out _ _ O
the _ _ O
proprietary _ _ O
blends, _ _ O
which _ _ O
justify _ _ O
prices _ _ O
that _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
higher _ _ O
(as _ _ O
much _ _ O
as _ _ O
$7.95 _ _ O
for _ _ O
six) _ _ O
than _ _ O
those _ _ O
at _ _ O
other _ _ O
places _ _ O
in _ _ O
Flushing, _ _ O
including _ _ O
Tianjin _ _ O
Dumpling _ _ O
House. _ _ O
I've _ _ O
eaten _ _ O
entire _ _ O
meals _ _ O
that _ _ O
delivered _ _ O
less _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
single _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
You's _ _ O
dumplings _ _ O
stuffed _ _ O
with _ _ O
terrific _ _ O
little _ _ O
meatballs _ _ O
of _ _ O
duck _ _ O
and _ _ O
shiitakes. _ _ O
And _ _ O
if _ _ O
those _ _ O
hadn't _ _ O
cheered _ _ O
me _ _ O
up, _ _ O
the _ _ O
fried _ _ O
dumplings _ _ O
would. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
You _ _ O
pours _ _ O
watery _ _ O
cornstarch _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
pan, _ _ O
which _ _ O
bubbles _ _ O
and _ _ O
browns _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
shatteringly _ _ O
thin, _ _ O
dumpling-studded _ _ O
pancake. _ _ O
Cracking _ _ O
that _ _ O
crust, _ _ O
I _ _ O
felt _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
happiest _ _ O
guy _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
galaxy. _ _ O
That _ _ O
feeling _ _ O
wavered _ _ O
whenever _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
to _ _ O
lean _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
my _ _ O
booth _ _ O
with _ _ O
one _ _ O
arm _ _ O
extended _ _ O
for _ _ O
minutes _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
time _ _ O
to _ _ O
ask _ _ O
for _ _ O
water _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
check _ _ O
or _ _ O
for _ _ O
empty _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
cleared. _ _ O
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
like _ _ O
hailing _ _ O
a _ _ O
cab _ _ O
on _ _ O
Broadway _ _ O
at _ _ O
5 _ _ O
p.m., _ _ O
but _ _ O
less _ _ O
effective. _ _ O
As _ _ O
time _ _ O
dragged _ _ O
on, _ _ O
I _ _ O
wondered _ _ O
why _ _ O
nobody _ _ O
had _ _ O
invented _ _ O
Uber _ _ O
for _ _ O
waiters. _ _ O
Looking _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
tables _ _ O
of _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
families, _ _ O
I _ _ O
noticed _ _ O
that _ _ O
their _ _ O
dumpling _ _ O
consumption _ _ O
was _ _ O
considerably _ _ O
less _ _ O
piggish _ _ O
than _ _ O
mine. _ _ O
They _ _ O
might _ _ O
share _ _ O
a _ _ O
single _ _ O
order, _ _ O
a _ _ O
mere _ _ O
six _ _ O
dumplings, _ _ O
before _ _ O
moving _ _ O
on _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
from _ _ O
Northern _ _ O
China, _ _ O
Hunan _ _ O
and _ _ O
Fujian _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
rest _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
(One _ _ O
cook _ _ O
specializes _ _ O
in _ _ O
each _ _ O
region.) _ _ O
I _ _ O
came _ _ O
to _ _ O
see _ _ O
the _ _ O
wisdom _ _ O
of _ _ O
allowing _ _ O
fish _ _ O
and _ _ O
vegetables _ _ O
to _ _ O
supplement _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
boiled _ _ O
flour _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
ingesting. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Hunanese _ _ O
preserved _ _ O
pork _ _ O
stir-fried _ _ O
with _ _ O
stubby _ _ O
lengths _ _ O
of _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
long _ _ O
beans _ _ O
was _ _ O
superb, _ _ O
both _ _ O
fiery _ _ O
and _ _ O
tart. _ _ O
Triple _ _ O
delight _ _ O
vegetables _ _ O
(green _ _ O
chiles, _ _ O
barely _ _ O
tender _ _ O
potato _ _ O
and _ _ O
eggplant _ _ O
so _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
it _ _ O
may _ _ O
as _ _ O
well _ _ O
be _ _ O
pudding) _ _ O
was _ _ O
an _ _ O
unusually _ _ O
good _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Dongbei _ _ O
standby. _ _ O
Whole _ _ O
fish _ _ O
with _ _ O
spicy _ _ O
bean _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
hit _ _ O
at _ _ O
my _ _ O
table, _ _ O
even _ _ O
if _ _ O
we _ _ O
did _ _ O
use _ _ O
the _ _ O
marvelous _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
to _ _ O
obscure _ _ O
the _ _ O
fish's _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
muddy _ _ O
flavor. _ _ O
You _ _ O
can _ _ O
find _ _ O
these _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
elsewhere, _ _ O
but _ _ O
no _ _ O
other _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
offers _ _ O
such _ _ O
an _ _ O
embarrassment _ _ O
of _ _ O
dumpling _ _ O
riches, _ _ O
including _ _ O
dessert. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
dumplings _ _ O
are _ _ O
pinched _ _ O
in _ _ O
dough _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
savory _ _ O
ones, _ _ O
such _ _ O
as _ _ O
tart _ _ O
dried _ _ O
hawthorn _ _ O
berries _ _ O
with _ _ O
white _ _ O
wood _ _ O
ears, _ _ O
or _ _ O
pear _ _ O
with _ _ O
eight _ _ O
treasures, _ _ O
which _ _ O
I _ _ O
now _ _ O
think _ _ O
of _ _ O
as _ _ O
fruitcake _ _ O
pirogi. _ _ O
Others, _ _ O
called _ _ O
tang _ _ O
yuan, _ _ O
are _ _ O
tinted _ _ O
orbs _ _ O
of _ _ O
dough _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
springy _ _ O
and _ _ O
chewy, _ _ O
like _ _ O
mochi. _ _ O
My _ _ O
favorite _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
pumpkin-flavored _ _ O
globe _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
sugary _ _ O
paste _ _ O
of _ _ O
black _ _ O
sesame _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
core. _ _ O
These _ _ O
orange _ _ O
globes _ _ O
arrived, _ _ O
not _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
plate _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
others, _ _ O
but _ _ O
bobbing _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
thick, _ _ O
clear, _ _ O
steaming _ _ O
soup. _ _ O
I _ _ O
could _ _ O
stare _ _ O
at _ _ O
ingredient _ _ O
lists _ _ O
all _ _ O
day _ _ O
and _ _ O
never _ _ O
come _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
parrot _ _ O
like _ _ O
this. _ _ O

The _ _ O
deepest _ _ O
form _ _ O
of _ _ O
vicarious _ _ O
pleasure, _ _ O
if _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
noblest, _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
kind _ _ O
we _ _ O
feel _ _ O
when _ _ O
most _ _ O
of _ _ O
our _ _ O
joy _ _ O
in _ _ O
someone _ _ O
else's _ _ O
achievement _ _ O
comes _ _ O
from _ _ O
not _ _ O
having _ _ O
done _ _ O
any _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
work _ _ O
ourselves. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
happiness _ _ O
of _ _ O
thinking _ _ O
about _ _ O
a _ _ O
friend's _ _ O
newborn _ _ O
baby _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
get _ _ O
into _ _ O
bed _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
full _ _ O
night's _ _ O
rest; _ _ O
the _ _ O
thrill _ _ O
of _ _ O
knowing _ _ O
that _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
exact _ _ O
moment _ _ O
when _ _ O
your _ _ O
marathon-running _ _ O
co-worker _ _ O
is _ _ O
gasping _ _ O
across _ _ O
the _ _ O
finish _ _ O
line _ _ O
in _ _ O
Central _ _ B-LOC
Park, _ _ I-LOC
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
at _ _ O
home, _ _ O
not _ _ O
running; _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
joy _ _ O
of _ _ O
skipping _ _ O
over _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
articles _ _ O
on _ _ O
turkey _ _ O
thermometers _ _ O
and _ _ O
lump-free _ _ O
gravy _ _ B-FOOD
because _ _ O
it's _ _ O
not _ _ O
your _ _ O
turn _ _ O
to _ _ O
host. _ _ O
Of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
Thanksgiving _ _ O
guest, _ _ O
you _ _ O
still _ _ O
have _ _ O
work _ _ O
to _ _ O
do. _ _ O
The _ _ O
altruistic _ _ O
way _ _ O
of _ _ O
looking _ _ O
at _ _ O
this _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
should _ _ O
try _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
the _ _ O
host's _ _ O
job _ _ O
easier. _ _ O
This _ _ O
assignment _ _ O
began _ _ O
back _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
accepted _ _ O
the _ _ O
invitation. _ _ O
That _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
moment _ _ O
to _ _ O
mention _ _ O
your _ _ O
allergies _ _ O
and _ _ O
to _ _ O
ask _ _ O
what _ _ O
you _ _ O
could _ _ O
bring _ _ O
with _ _ O
you. _ _ O
Now, _ _ O
with _ _ O
just _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
days _ _ O
to _ _ O
go, _ _ O
it's _ _ O
time _ _ O
to _ _ O
take _ _ O
stock. _ _ O
Are _ _ O
your _ _ O
white _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ I-FOOD
sparkling _ _ I-FOOD
wines _ _ I-FOOD
chilled, _ _ O
and _ _ O
do _ _ O
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
keep _ _ O
the _ _ O
bottles _ _ O
cold _ _ O
while _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
getting _ _ O
there? _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
bringing _ _ O
your _ _ O
famous _ _ O
yam _ _ B-DISH
lollipops, _ _ I-DISH
will _ _ O
they _ _ O
be _ _ O
ready _ _ O
to _ _ O
serve, _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
ovenproof _ _ O
serving _ _ O
dish _ _ O
that _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
warmed _ _ O
up _ _ O
while _ _ O
the _ _ O
turkey _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
resting? _ _ O
Don't _ _ O
count _ _ O
on _ _ O
free _ _ O
counter _ _ O
space. _ _ O
Nathalie _ _ O
Dupree _ _ O
, _ _ O
a _ _ O
cookbook _ _ O
writer _ _ O
and _ _ O
veteran _ _ O
host _ _ O
in _ _ O
Charleston, _ _ B-LOC
S.C., _ _ I-LOC
ruefully _ _ O
recalled _ _ O
the _ _ O
year _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
showed _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
boiled _ _ B-FOOD
potatoes _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
proceeded _ _ O
to _ _ O
mash _ _ O
them _ _ O
on _ _ O
site. _ _ O
"Splattering _ _ O
potatoes _ _ B-FOOD
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
wall _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
time _ _ O
when _ _ O
everything _ _ O
else _ _ O
is _ _ O
going _ _ O
on _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
welcome," _ _ O
she _ _ O
said. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
absolutely _ _ O
must _ _ O
use _ _ O
the _ _ O
host's _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
to _ _ O
finish _ _ O
the _ _ O
yam _ _ B-DISH
lollipops, _ _ I-DISH
today _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
good _ _ O
time _ _ O
to _ _ O
confirm _ _ O
that _ _ O
it's _ _ O
O.K. _ _ O
While _ _ O
you're _ _ O
at _ _ O
it, _ _ O
ask _ _ O
if _ _ O
there's _ _ O
something _ _ O
more _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
bring. _ _ O
"I _ _ O
certainly _ _ O
don't _ _ O
always _ _ O
know, _ _ O
and _ _ O
would _ _ O
guess _ _ O
many _ _ O
a _ _ O
host _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
always _ _ O
know, _ _ O
what _ _ O
I _ _ O
need _ _ O
until _ _ O
closer _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
event," _ _ O
said _ _ O
Eric _ _ O
Diesel, _ _ O
who _ _ O
writes _ _ O
about _ _ O
food _ _ O
and _ _ O
lifestyle _ _ O
on _ _ O
his _ _ O
Urban _ _ O
Home _ _ O
Blog _ _ O
, _ _ O
and _ _ O
who _ _ O
has _ _ O
helped _ _ O
organize _ _ O
some _ _ O
sprawling _ _ O
Thanksgiving _ _ O
feasts _ _ O
with _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
30 _ _ O
guests. _ _ O
By _ _ O
the _ _ O
day _ _ O
before _ _ O
the _ _ O
holiday, _ _ O
he _ _ O
said, _ _ O
the _ _ O
host _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
much _ _ O
better _ _ O
idea _ _ O
of _ _ O
what's _ _ O
missing: _ _ O
cocktail _ _ O
napkins, _ _ O
folding _ _ O
chairs, _ _ O
ice _ _ O
or, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Diesel _ _ O
suggested, _ _ O
piles _ _ O
of _ _ O
plastic _ _ O
containers _ _ O
for _ _ O
sending _ _ O
guests _ _ O
home _ _ O
with _ _ O
surplus _ _ O
food. _ _ O
The _ _ O
last _ _ O
items _ _ O
should _ _ O
be _ _ O
brought _ _ O
only _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
host _ _ O
wants _ _ O
them _ _ O
and _ _ O
only _ _ O
if _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
enough _ _ O
for _ _ O
everybody. _ _ O
One _ _ O
woman _ _ O
whose _ _ O
annual _ _ O
spread _ _ O
starts _ _ O
with _ _ O
two _ _ O
turkeys _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
eight _ _ O
pies _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
goes _ _ O
on _ _ O
from _ _ O
there _ _ O
said _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
egregious _ _ O
guests _ _ O
of _ _ O
all _ _ O
time _ _ O
-- _ _ O
worse _ _ O
even _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
relative's _ _ O
new _ _ O
girlfriend _ _ O
who _ _ O
entertained _ _ O
the _ _ O
multitudes _ _ O
with _ _ O
tales _ _ O
of _ _ O
their _ _ O
fantastic _ _ O
sexual _ _ O
escapades _ _ O
-- _ _ O
were _ _ O
the _ _ O
couple _ _ O
who _ _ O
brought _ _ O
just _ _ O
enough _ _ O
Tupperware _ _ O
for _ _ O
themselves. _ _ O
"We _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
get _ _ O
leftovers _ _ O
from _ _ O
Alan's _ _ O
mom," _ _ O
they _ _ O
explained. _ _ O
(The _ _ O
hostess, _ _ O
though _ _ O
still _ _ O
seething, _ _ O
asked _ _ O
that _ _ O
her _ _ O
name _ _ O
be _ _ O
withheld.) _ _ O
These _ _ O
suggestions _ _ O
help _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
altruistic _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
your _ _ O
mission. _ _ O
But _ _ O
remember _ _ O
that _ _ O
your _ _ O
highest _ _ O
priority _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
sure _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
invited _ _ O
back _ _ O
so _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
enjoy _ _ O
the _ _ O
delicious _ _ O
sensation _ _ O
of _ _ O
not _ _ O
hosting _ _ O
again _ _ O
next _ _ O
Thanksgiving. _ _ O
Here, _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
bribe _ _ O
is _ _ O
helpful. _ _ O
A _ _ O
bottle _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
too _ _ O
good _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
mob _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
pressed _ _ O
discreetly _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
host's _ _ O
hands _ _ O
as _ _ O
you _ _ O
murmur, _ _ O
"This _ _ O
is _ _ O
for _ _ O
tomorrow." _ _ O
The _ _ O
more _ _ O
thought _ _ O
you _ _ O
put _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
bribe, _ _ O
the _ _ O
better _ _ O
the _ _ O
odds _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
effective _ _ O
a _ _ O
year _ _ O
from _ _ O
now. _ _ O
"Somebody _ _ O
brought _ _ O
me _ _ O
a _ _ O
nice _ _ O
box _ _ O
of _ _ O
stationery," _ _ O
said _ _ O
John _ _ O
Winterman, _ _ O
the _ _ O
general _ _ O
manager _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Manhattan _ _ B-LOC
restaurant _ _ O
Bâtard _ _ B-EST
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
polished _ _ O
host _ _ O
at _ _ O
home, _ _ O
when _ _ O
asked _ _ O
about _ _ O
gifts _ _ O
from _ _ O
guests _ _ O
he _ _ O
has _ _ O
invited _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
once. _ _ O
"Somebody _ _ O
brought _ _ O
me _ _ O
a _ _ O
chile _ _ O
pepper _ _ O
plant, _ _ O
which _ _ O
we _ _ O
used, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course." _ _ O
Flowers _ _ O
growing _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
pot _ _ O
(cyclamens _ _ O
look _ _ O
dapper _ _ O
at _ _ O
this _ _ O
time _ _ O
of _ _ O
year) _ _ O
beat _ _ O
cut _ _ O
stems, _ _ O
which _ _ O
will _ _ O
send _ _ O
the _ _ O
host _ _ O
rooting _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
cupboards _ _ O
with _ _ O
gravy-splattered _ _ O
hands _ _ O
to _ _ O
find _ _ O
an _ _ O
empty _ _ O
vase. _ _ O
Your _ _ O
shot _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
repeat _ _ O
performance _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
seriously _ _ O
jeopardized _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
spill _ _ O
Burgundy _ _ B-FOOD
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
heirloom _ _ O
table _ _ O
linens, _ _ O
so _ _ O
a _ _ O
light, _ _ O
alcohol-absorbent _ _ O
lunch _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
advisable _ _ O
if _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
served _ _ O
late _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
day. _ _ O
On _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
principle, _ _ O
pregaming _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
shots _ _ O
before _ _ O
you _ _ O
arrive _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
risky _ _ O
maneuver. _ _ O
You _ _ O
should _ _ O
be _ _ O
relatively _ _ O
sober _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
present _ _ O
your _ _ O
host _ _ O
gift _ _ O
and _ _ O
size _ _ O
up _ _ O
the _ _ O
situation. _ _ O
"Tune _ _ O
into _ _ O
how _ _ O
the _ _ O
event _ _ O
is _ _ O
going _ _ O
and _ _ O
plug _ _ O
into _ _ O
whoever _ _ O
needs _ _ O
something," _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Diesel _ _ O
said. _ _ O
"If _ _ O
the _ _ O
cook _ _ O
is _ _ O
hiding _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
ask, _ _ O
‘Can _ _ O
I _ _ O
help, _ _ O
or _ _ O
do _ _ O
you _ _ O
need _ _ O
me _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
out _ _ O
there _ _ O
so _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
in _ _ O
here?' _ _ O
" _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
shooed _ _ O
away, _ _ O
he _ _ O
said, _ _ O
appoint _ _ O
yourself _ _ O
coat-check _ _ O
clerk, _ _ O
bartender _ _ O
or _ _ O
babysitter. _ _ O
Or _ _ O
talk _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
stray _ _ O
great-aunt _ _ O
who's _ _ O
on _ _ O
her _ _ O
own. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
given _ _ O
a _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
assignment, _ _ O
make _ _ O
sure _ _ O
you _ _ O
understand _ _ O
it _ _ O
down _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
detail, _ _ O
unlike _ _ O
the _ _ O
guest _ _ O
of _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Dupree's _ _ O
who _ _ O
piled _ _ O
potatoes _ _ B-FOOD
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
turkey _ _ O
platter. _ _ O
If _ _ O
the _ _ O
host _ _ O
refuses _ _ O
help, _ _ O
that _ _ O
should _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
taken _ _ O
for _ _ O
an _ _ O
invitation _ _ O
to _ _ O
stand _ _ O
in _ _ O
front _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
refrigerator _ _ O
and _ _ O
chat, _ _ O
even _ _ O
if _ _ O
that's _ _ O
what _ _ O
you'd _ _ O
do _ _ O
on _ _ O
another, _ _ O
looser _ _ O
day. _ _ O
On _ _ O
Thanksgiving, _ _ O
home _ _ O
kitchens _ _ O
are _ _ O
almost _ _ O
as _ _ O
busy _ _ O
and _ _ O
focused _ _ O
as _ _ O
professional _ _ O
ones, _ _ O
and _ _ O
you _ _ O
shouldn't _ _ O
enter _ _ O
the _ _ O
combat _ _ O
zone _ _ O
any _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
you _ _ O
would _ _ O
bust _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
swinging _ _ O
doors _ _ O
at _ _ O
Jean-Georges _ _ B-EST
during _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
service _ _ O
shouting: _ _ O
"Yo, _ _ O
J. _ _ O
G.! _ _ O
What _ _ O
up, _ _ O
dog?" _ _ O
Most _ _ O
of _ _ O
all, _ _ O
encourage _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooks _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
sidelines. _ _ O
Bite _ _ O
your _ _ O
tongue _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
notice _ _ O
the _ _ O
gravy _ _ B-FOOD
hasn't _ _ O
been _ _ O
degreased _ _ O
as _ _ O
thoroughly _ _ O
as _ _ O
you _ _ O
think _ _ O
it _ _ O
should _ _ O
be. _ _ O
"It's _ _ O
so _ _ O
important _ _ O
not _ _ O
to _ _ O
give _ _ O
any _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
advice _ _ O
on _ _ O
anything," _ _ O
said _ _ O
Denis _ _ O
Gainty, _ _ O
a _ _ O
professor _ _ O
of _ _ O
Japanese _ _ O
history _ _ O
at _ _ O
Georgia _ _ O
State _ _ O
University. _ _ O
"You _ _ O
need _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
cheerleader _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
that's _ _ O
being _ _ O
produced _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
host. _ _ O
I _ _ O
have _ _ O
lots _ _ O
of _ _ O
opinions _ _ O
about _ _ O
brining, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
realize _ _ O
I _ _ O
need _ _ O
to _ _ O
steer _ _ O
the _ _ O
conversation _ _ O
to _ _ O
safer _ _ O
topics, _ _ O
like _ _ O
religion _ _ O
and _ _ O
homosexuality." _ _ O
At _ _ O
last, _ _ O
the _ _ O
turkey _ _ B-FOOD
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
carved _ _ O
and _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
finally _ _ O
enjoy _ _ O
the _ _ O
fruits _ _ O
of _ _ O
someone _ _ O
else's _ _ O
labor. _ _ O
The _ _ O
urge _ _ O
to _ _ O
cash _ _ O
in _ _ O
with _ _ O
soaring _ _ O
mountain _ _ O
ranges _ _ O
of _ _ O
your _ _ O
favorite _ _ O
foods _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
strong. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
to _ _ O
recall _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
playing _ _ O
the _ _ O
long _ _ O
game. _ _ O
If _ _ O
the _ _ O
stuffing _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
gone _ _ O
before _ _ O
everyone _ _ O
has _ _ O
had _ _ O
a _ _ O
crack _ _ O
at _ _ O
it, _ _ O
the _ _ O
host _ _ O
can't _ _ O
make _ _ O
more _ _ O
but _ _ O
can _ _ O
easily _ _ O
look _ _ O
around _ _ O
and _ _ O
identify _ _ O
the _ _ O
looters. _ _ O
For _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
two _ _ O
decades, _ _ O
Tom _ _ B-EST
& _ _ I-EST
Jerry's _ _ I-EST
bar _ _ B-TYPE
in _ _ O
downtown _ _ O
Manhattan _ _ B-LOC
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
the _ _ O
site _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
open-house _ _ O
Thanksgiving _ _ O
to _ _ O
which _ _ O
any _ _ O
local _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
employees _ _ O
with _ _ O
nowhere _ _ O
else _ _ O
to _ _ O
go _ _ O
are _ _ O
invited. _ _ O
Daniel _ _ O
O'Connor, _ _ O
an _ _ O
architect _ _ O
who _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
hosts, _ _ O
said _ _ O
the _ _ O
event _ _ O
is _ _ O
notable _ _ O
for _ _ O
its _ _ O
spirit _ _ O
of _ _ O
cooperation _ _ O
and _ _ O
sharing. _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
not _ _ O
everyone _ _ O
plays _ _ O
along. _ _ O
"You _ _ O
really _ _ O
see _ _ O
the _ _ O
divide _ _ O
when _ _ O
it's _ _ O
leftover _ _ O
time," _ _ O
he _ _ O
said. _ _ O
"You _ _ O
have _ _ O
some _ _ O
people _ _ O
literally _ _ O
taking _ _ O
an _ _ O
entire _ _ O
turkey _ _ B-FOOD
home, _ _ O
not _ _ O
a _ _ O
piece _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
turkey. _ _ B-FOOD
Or _ _ O
taking _ _ O
a _ _ O
whole _ _ O
pie. _ _ B-FOOD
There's _ _ O
always _ _ O
someone _ _ O
like _ _ O
that." _ _ O
As _ _ O
you _ _ O
load _ _ O
your _ _ O
plate, _ _ O
remember _ _ O
the _ _ O
Wall _ _ B-LOC
Street _ _ I-LOC
saying: _ _ O
Pigs _ _ O
get _ _ O
fat; _ _ O
hogs _ _ O
get _ _ O
slaughtered. _ _ O
While _ _ O
taking _ _ O
modest _ _ O
initial _ _ O
portions, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
it's _ _ O
important _ _ O
to _ _ O
act _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
never _ _ O
encountered _ _ O
such _ _ O
bounty. _ _ O
Leo _ _ O
Carey, _ _ O
a _ _ O
senior _ _ O
editor _ _ O
at _ _ O
The _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorker, _ _ O
who _ _ O
was _ _ O
born _ _ O
in _ _ O
England _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
has _ _ O
successfully _ _ O
extracted _ _ O
an _ _ O
invitation _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
Boston _ _ B-LOC
family _ _ O
for _ _ O
15 _ _ O
consecutive _ _ O
Thanksgivings, _ _ O
noticed _ _ O
this _ _ O
American _ _ O
technique _ _ O
of _ _ O
complimenting _ _ O
the _ _ O
host _ _ O
early _ _ O
on. _ _ O
"Everyone _ _ O
self-consciously, _ _ O
self-mockingly _ _ O
but _ _ O
also _ _ O
weirdly _ _ O
proudly, _ _ O
talks _ _ O
about _ _ O
gluttony," _ _ O
he _ _ O
said. _ _ O
"But _ _ O
the _ _ O
literal _ _ O
amounts _ _ O
of _ _ O
food _ _ O
consumed _ _ O
haven't _ _ O
struck _ _ O
me _ _ O
as _ _ O
totally _ _ O
unprecedented." _ _ O
Compliments _ _ O
should _ _ O
be _ _ O
delivered _ _ O
between _ _ O
mouthfuls _ _ O
and _ _ O
scattered _ _ O
far _ _ O
and _ _ O
wide. _ _ O
Keep _ _ O
in _ _ O
mind _ _ O
that _ _ O
there _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
many _ _ O
cooks _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
each _ _ O
one _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
prospective _ _ O
source _ _ O
for _ _ O
next _ _ O
year's _ _ O
invitation. _ _ O
Most _ _ O
of _ _ O
all, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
remember _ _ O
that _ _ O
no _ _ O
dish _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
American _ _ B-CUISINE
canon _ _ O
provokes _ _ O
more _ _ O
performance _ _ O
anxiety _ _ O
than _ _ O
roast _ _ O
turkey, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
host _ _ O
needs _ _ O
to _ _ O
hear _ _ O
that _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
effort _ _ O
was _ _ O
worth _ _ O
it. _ _ O
One _ _ O
year _ _ O
when _ _ O
I _ _ O
invited _ _ O
people _ _ O
to _ _ O
my _ _ O
house _ _ O
for _ _ O
Thanksgiving, _ _ O
I _ _ O
suggested, _ _ O
in _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
those _ _ O
fits _ _ O
of _ _ O
neurotic _ _ O
self-deprecation _ _ O
that _ _ O
hosts _ _ O
are _ _ O
prone _ _ O
to, _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
white _ _ B-FOOD
meat _ _ I-FOOD
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
dry. _ _ O
A _ _ O
guest _ _ O
I _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
know _ _ O
very _ _ O
well _ _ O
agreed. _ _ O
Amateur _ _ O
move. _ _ O
When _ _ O
you _ _ O
don't _ _ O
roast _ _ O
it _ _ O
yourself, _ _ O
the _ _ O
turkey _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
always _ _ O
perfect. _ _ O

inside _ _ O
the _ _ O

of _ _ O

a _ _ O

of _ _ O
rooms _ _ O
like _ _ O
this _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
few _ _ O
years. _ _ O
And _ _ O
I've _ _ O
seen _ _ O
any _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
resembling _ _ O
these: _ _ O
the _ _ O
Nike _ _ O
swooshes _ _ O
of _ _ O
ultra-blended _ _ O
vegetable _ _ B-FOOD
purées; _ _ I-FOOD
the _ _ O
green _ _ O
leaves _ _ B-FOOD
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
of _ _ O
chipmunk _ _ O
ears _ _ O
arranged _ _ O
just _ _ O
so _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
deviled _ _ B-FOOD
egg; _ _ I-FOOD
the _ _ O
row _ _ O
of _ _ O
scallops _ _ B-FOOD
all _ _ O
crouched _ _ O
together _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
hiding _ _ O
from _ _ O
some _ _ O
scallop-hating _ _ O
predator _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
side _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
plate. _ _ O
Clearly _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chen _ _ O
and _ _ O
I _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
following _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
Instagram _ _ O
feeds. _ _ O
That _ _ O
egg, _ _ B-FOOD
though. _ _ O
Wait _ _ O
a _ _ O
minute. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
something _ _ O
different. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
half _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
hard-cooked _ _ B-FOOD
white, _ _ I-FOOD
deep-fried _ _ O
in _ _ O
panko. _ _ B-FOOD
Spooned _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
divot _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
dot _ _ O
of _ _ O
deviled _ _ B-FOOD
yolk, _ _ I-FOOD
sharp _ _ O
with _ _ O
pickles _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
Dijon _ _ B-FOOD
mustard. _ _ I-FOOD
On _ _ O
top _ _ O
of _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
spoonful _ _ O
of _ _ O
fried _ _ B-FOOD
garlic _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
dried _ _ B-FOOD
chiles _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
their _ _ O
spicy _ _ B-FOOD
red _ _ I-FOOD
oil. _ _ I-FOOD
It's _ _ O
fun _ _ O
to _ _ O
feel _ _ O
the _ _ O
temperatures _ _ O
and _ _ O
textures, _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
and _ _ O
crackling _ _ O
and _ _ O
slippery, _ _ O
meet _ _ O
in _ _ O
your _ _ O
mouth, _ _ O
and _ _ O
to _ _ O
taste _ _ O
the _ _ O
strange _ _ O
collision _ _ O
of _ _ O
church-picnic-style _ _ O
eggs _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
condiment. _ _ O
How _ _ O
can _ _ O
half _ _ O
an _ _ O
egg _ _ O
do _ _ O
three _ _ O
or _ _ O
four _ _ O
things _ _ O
at _ _ O
once? _ _ O
Later, _ _ O
a _ _ O
server _ _ O
points _ _ O
a _ _ O
siphon _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
crook _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
octopus _ _ O
leg. _ _ O
Out _ _ O
comes _ _ O
a _ _ O
suede-colored _ _ O
snowdrift. _ _ O
He _ _ O
says _ _ O
it's _ _ O
brown-butter-and-potato _ _ O
espuma. _ _ O
I _ _ O
say _ _ O
it's _ _ O
foam _ _ O
and _ _ O
I _ _ O
say _ _ O
the _ _ O
hell _ _ O
with _ _ O
it. _ _ O
I _ _ O
focus _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
octopus, _ _ O
which _ _ O
crunches _ _ O
emphatically _ _ O
and _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
rounded, _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
fruity _ _ O
flavor. _ _ O
With _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
chewy, _ _ O
chunky, _ _ O
lightly _ _ O
gingered _ _ O
XO _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
Chopped _ _ O
caramelized _ _ O
pork _ _ O
and _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
sausage _ _ O
give _ _ O
it _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweetness _ _ O
of _ _ O
bacon; _ _ O
fish _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
and _ _ O
dried _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
take _ _ O
it _ _ O
broader _ _ O
and _ _ O
deeper. _ _ O
I _ _ O
can't _ _ O
get _ _ O
enough _ _ O
of _ _ O
it. _ _ O
The _ _ O
foam _ _ O
will _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
ignored _ _ O
forever, _ _ O
though. _ _ O
While _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
original _ _ O
notion, _ _ O
it _ _ O
does _ _ O
add _ _ O
something, _ _ O
unlike _ _ O
most _ _ O
foams. _ _ O
What _ _ O
it _ _ O
adds _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
fluffy _ _ O
wave _ _ O
of _ _ O
toasted _ _ O
butter, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
frosting _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
caramel _ _ O
cake _ _ O
minus _ _ O
the _ _ O
sugar _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
heft. _ _ O
The _ _ O
dish _ _ O
is _ _ O
peculiarly _ _ O
good; _ _ O
it _ _ O
makes _ _ O
an _ _ O
extraordinary _ _ O
indulgence _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
octopus. _ _ O
And _ _ O
it _ _ O
shows _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
clear _ _ O
and _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
point _ _ O
of _ _ O
view _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chen _ _ O
brings _ _ O
to _ _ O
his _ _ O
cooking, _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
when _ _ O
he _ _ O
interprets _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
flavors. _ _ O
Before _ _ O
working _ _ O
at _ _ O
Eleven _ _ O
Madison _ _ O
Park _ _ O
and _ _ O
Commerce, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chen _ _ O
was _ _ O
an _ _ O
accountant. _ _ O
The _ _ O
idea _ _ O
was _ _ O
to _ _ O
stay _ _ O
as _ _ O
far _ _ O
from _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
as _ _ O
possible, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
came _ _ O
from _ _ O
his _ _ O
parents. _ _ O
After _ _ O
moving _ _ O
from _ _ O
China _ _ O
to _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
City, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Chens _ _ O
operated _ _ O
a _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
outside _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
city. _ _ O
They _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
something _ _ O
higher _ _ O
for _ _ O
Thomas _ _ O
(he _ _ O
was _ _ O
Tommy _ _ O
at _ _ O
home, _ _ O
but _ _ O
on _ _ O
his _ _ O
parents' _ _ O
lips _ _ O
the _ _ O
nickname _ _ O
came _ _ O
out _ _ O
"tow _ _ O
me," _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
how _ _ O
Tuome _ _ O
is _ _ O
pronounced), _ _ O
but _ _ O
after _ _ O
shepherding _ _ O
balance _ _ O
sheets _ _ O
by _ _ O
day _ _ O
and _ _ O
attending _ _ O
culinary _ _ O
school _ _ O
by _ _ O
night, _ _ O
he _ _ O
came _ _ O
to _ _ O
see _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
higher _ _ O
calling. _ _ O
A _ _ O
little _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
two _ _ O
months _ _ O
in, _ _ O
Tuome _ _ O
is _ _ O
already _ _ O
starting _ _ O
to _ _ O
feel _ _ O
mature. _ _ O
The _ _ O
one-page _ _ O
wine _ _ O
list _ _ O
is _ _ O
seriously _ _ O
eclectic, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it's _ _ O
not _ _ O
too _ _ O
cool _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
Napa _ _ O
Valley _ _ O
cabernet _ _ O
and _ _ O
an _ _ O
Anderson _ _ O
Valley _ _ O
chardonnay. _ _ O
The _ _ O
servers _ _ O
take _ _ O
their _ _ O
jobs _ _ O
seriously, _ _ O
although _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
not _ _ O
sure _ _ O
the _ _ O
point _ _ O
has _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
underlined _ _ O
by _ _ O
forcing _ _ O
them _ _ O
all _ _ O
to _ _ O
wear _ _ O
tailored _ _ O
T-shirts _ _ O
the _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
wet _ _ O
cement. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chen _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
need _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
his _ _ O
staff _ _ O
look _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
modern _ _ O
dance _ _ O
troupe _ _ O
to _ _ O
tell _ _ O
people _ _ O
Tuome _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
your _ _ O
average _ _ O
East _ _ O
Village _ _ O
spot; _ _ O
his _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
does _ _ O
that _ _ O
for _ _ O
him. _ _ O
(And _ _ O
the _ _ O
East _ _ O
Village _ _ O
average _ _ O
is _ _ O
getting _ _ O
higher _ _ O
every _ _ O
year.) _ _ O
He _ _ O
has _ _ O
terrific _ _ O
control _ _ O
over _ _ O
salt, _ _ O
spices, _ _ O
texture _ _ O
and _ _ O
contrast, _ _ O
weaving _ _ O
them _ _ O
together _ _ O
until _ _ O
you _ _ O
ask, _ _ O
why _ _ O
hasn't _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
done _ _ O
this _ _ O
before? _ _ O
Adding _ _ O
slick _ _ O
duck _ _ O
fat _ _ O
to _ _ O
packets _ _ O
of _ _ O
Cantonese _ _ O
sticky _ _ O
rice _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
in _ _ O
lotus _ _ O
leaves _ _ O
seems _ _ O
like _ _ O
an _ _ O
obvious _ _ O
good _ _ O
idea. _ _ O
So _ _ O
does _ _ O
the _ _ O
extra _ _ O
crackle _ _ O
he _ _ O
puts _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
sausage _ _ O
bits _ _ O
to _ _ O
save _ _ O
the _ _ O
rice _ _ O
from _ _ O
gummy _ _ O
monotony. _ _ O
But _ _ O
they _ _ O
aren't _ _ O
obvious _ _ O
until _ _ O
you _ _ O
taste _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chen's _ _ O
version. _ _ O
A _ _ O
few _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
show _ _ O
off _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chen's _ _ O
technical _ _ O
command _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
his _ _ O
originality. _ _ O
The _ _ O
scoop _ _ O
of _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
liver _ _ O
mousse _ _ O
with _ _ O
maple _ _ O
syrup _ _ O
pooled _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
hollow _ _ O
on _ _ O
top, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
gravy _ _ O
on _ _ O
mashed _ _ O
potatoes, _ _ O
is _ _ O
exquisitely _ _ O
done, _ _ O
but _ _ O
feels _ _ O
familiar. _ _ O
Another _ _ O
dish _ _ O
fell _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
focus _ _ O
between _ _ O
meals, _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
carrot-miso _ _ O
purée _ _ O
accompanying _ _ O
seared _ _ O
scallops _ _ O
lost _ _ O
its _ _ O
savory, _ _ O
salty _ _ O
depth _ _ O
and _ _ O
became _ _ O
merely _ _ O
sweet. _ _ O
And _ _ O
there's _ _ O
one _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
like _ _ O
to _ _ O
forget, _ _ O
a _ _ O
dully _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
squash _ _ O
soup _ _ O
impaled _ _ O
with _ _ O
frogs' _ _ O
legs _ _ O
that _ _ O
were _ _ O
both _ _ O
mushy _ _ O
and _ _ O
stringy. _ _ O
But _ _ O
a _ _ O
striking _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
at _ _ O
Tuome _ _ O
are _ _ O
memorable _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
right _ _ O
reasons. _ _ O
Serving _ _ O
sous-vide _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
on _ _ O
soupy _ _ O
rice _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
with _ _ O
garlic _ _ O
chives _ _ O
and _ _ O
shiitakes, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chen _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
try _ _ O
to _ _ O
sex _ _ O
up _ _ O
his _ _ O
homey _ _ O
inspiration, _ _ O
congee; _ _ O
he _ _ O
just _ _ O
makes _ _ O
it _ _ O
more _ _ O
layered _ _ O
and _ _ O
modern, _ _ O
surrounding _ _ O
the _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark _ _ O
basil _ _ O
jus, _ _ O
and _ _ O
lets _ _ O
the _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
quietly _ _ O
win _ _ O
you _ _ O
over. _ _ O
I _ _ O
wish _ _ O
he _ _ O
would _ _ O
take _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
approach _ _ O
with _ _ O
pork _ _ O
belly _ _ O
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
forcing _ _ O
it _ _ O
to _ _ O
do _ _ O
double-duty _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
marketing _ _ O
event. _ _ O
Right _ _ O
now _ _ O
it's _ _ O
called _ _ O
the _ _ O
Pig _ _ O
Out _ _ O
(a _ _ O
name _ _ O
meant _ _ O
for _ _ O
hashtagging), _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
marches _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
$49 _ _ O
feast _ _ O
for _ _ O
two, _ _ O
10 _ _ O
bite-size _ _ O
squares _ _ O
of _ _ O
pork _ _ O
belly _ _ O
riding _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
slate _ _ O
shingle _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
parade _ _ O
of _ _ O
sauces _ _ O
and _ _ O
bowls _ _ O
of _ _ O
spicy-peanut _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
following _ _ O
behind. _ _ O
The _ _ O
crashing _ _ O
cymbals _ _ O
can't _ _ O
disguise _ _ O
how _ _ O
easily _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish, _ _ O
and _ _ O
its _ _ O
price, _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
divided _ _ O
in _ _ O
half. _ _ O
But _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chen _ _ O
has _ _ O
done _ _ O
something _ _ O
amazing _ _ O
to _ _ O
this _ _ O
pig. _ _ O
His _ _ O
inspiration _ _ O
may _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
Cantonese _ _ O
roast _ _ O
pork, _ _ O
but _ _ O
these _ _ O
compressed, _ _ O
intensely _ _ O
flavorful _ _ O
squares _ _ O
of _ _ O
well-rendered _ _ O
belly _ _ O
partake _ _ O
of _ _ O
Peking _ _ O
duck, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
After _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
topped _ _ O
the _ _ O
reflective _ _ O
pane _ _ O
of _ _ O
skin _ _ O
with _ _ O
ginger-scallion _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
drops _ _ O
of _ _ O
sambal _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
squeeze _ _ O
bottle, _ _ O
I _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
to _ _ O
tuck _ _ O
the _ _ O
pork _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
bun _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
crepe, _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
chew _ _ O
and _ _ O
crunch _ _ O
and _ _ O
chew _ _ O
and _ _ O
crunch _ _ O
some _ _ O
more. _ _ O
Forget _ _ O
the _ _ O
gimmick. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
ideas _ _ O
in _ _ O
this _ _ O
dish, _ _ O
and _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
all _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chen's. _ _ O

Halfway _ _ O
through _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
at _ _ O
Blue _ _ B-EST
Hill, _ _ I-EST
my _ _ O
server _ _ O
presented _ _ O
me _ _ O
with _ _ O
two _ _ O
squashes. _ _ B-FOOD
One _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
common _ _ O
football-size _ _ O
butternut _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
weighs _ _ O
down _ _ O
shopping _ _ O
bags _ _ O
at _ _ O
this _ _ O
time _ _ O
of _ _ O
year. _ _ O
The _ _ O
other _ _ O
had _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
shape _ _ O
but _ _ O
was _ _ O
about _ _ O
as _ _ O
big _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
sparrow. _ _ O
I _ _ O
held _ _ O
it _ _ O
in _ _ O
my _ _ O
palm. _ _ O
It _ _ O
felt _ _ O
good _ _ O
in _ _ O
there. _ _ O
Without _ _ O
thinking _ _ O
about _ _ O
what _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
doing, _ _ O
I _ _ O
began _ _ O
petting _ _ O
it. _ _ O
The _ _ O
couple _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
next _ _ O
table _ _ O
asked _ _ O
if _ _ O
they _ _ O
could _ _ O
see _ _ O
my _ _ O
tiny _ _ O
squash, _ _ O
and _ _ O
I _ _ O
let _ _ O
them _ _ O
stroke _ _ O
its _ _ O
smooth, _ _ O
cool _ _ O
skin. _ _ O
Before _ _ O
things _ _ O
got _ _ O
too _ _ O
weird, _ _ O
our _ _ O
server _ _ O
took _ _ O
my _ _ O
pet _ _ O
squash _ _ B-FOOD
back _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen. _ _ O
When _ _ O
it _ _ O
came _ _ O
back, _ _ O
it _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
and _ _ O
cut _ _ O
in _ _ O
half. _ _ O
Specks _ _ O
of _ _ O
white _ _ B-FOOD
pepper _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
strands _ _ O
of _ _ O
grated _ _ B-FOOD
chestnut _ _ I-FOOD
lay _ _ O
against _ _ O
its _ _ O
dark _ _ O
orange _ _ O
insides. _ _ O
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
sweeter _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
normal _ _ O
butternut, _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
what _ _ O
I _ _ O
mostly _ _ O
noticed _ _ O
was _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
tasted _ _ O
squashier, _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
compressed. _ _ O
Selective _ _ O
breeding _ _ O
was _ _ O
responsible, _ _ O
our _ _ O
server _ _ O
explained. _ _ O
Dan _ _ O
Barber, _ _ O
Blue _ _ B-EST
Hill's _ _ I-EST
executive _ _ O
chef _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
co-owner _ _ O
with _ _ O
his _ _ O
brother, _ _ O
David, _ _ O
had _ _ O
asked _ _ O
a _ _ O
Cornell _ _ O
agriculture _ _ O
professor _ _ O
to _ _ O
design _ _ O
a _ _ O
squash _ _ B-FOOD
for _ _ O
him, _ _ O
making _ _ O
it _ _ O
as _ _ O
small _ _ O
and _ _ O
tasty _ _ O
as _ _ O
possible. _ _ O
The _ _ O
result _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
898 _ _ B-FOOD
squash _ _ I-FOOD
, _ _ O
served _ _ O
exclusively _ _ O
at _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Barber's _ _ O
two _ _ O
restaurants, _ _ O
Blue _ _ B-EST
Hill _ _ I-EST
at _ _ O
Stone _ _ B-LOC
Barns _ _ I-LOC
in _ _ O
Pocantico _ _ B-LOC
Hills, _ _ I-LOC
N.Y., _ _ I-LOC
and _ _ O
this _ _ O
one, _ _ O
just _ _ O
off _ _ O
Washington _ _ B-LOC
Square _ _ I-LOC
Park. _ _ I-LOC
Mr. _ _ O
Barber _ _ O
opened _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
in _ _ O
Manhattan _ _ B-LOC
first, _ _ O
in _ _ O
2000, _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
idea _ _ O
of _ _ O
using _ _ O
local _ _ O
seasonal _ _ O
produce, _ _ O
including _ _ O
some _ _ O
from _ _ O
his _ _ O
family's _ _ O
farm _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Berkshires. _ _ B-LOC
This _ _ O
put _ _ O
him _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
company _ _ O
of, _ _ O
oh, _ _ O
several _ _ O
hundred _ _ O
other _ _ O
chefs. _ _ O
A _ _ O
few _ _ O
years _ _ O
later, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
chosen _ _ O
to _ _ O
lead _ _ O
an _ _ O
ambitious _ _ O
project _ _ O
at _ _ O
Stone _ _ B-EST
Barns _ _ I-EST
that _ _ O
combined _ _ O
a _ _ O
farm _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
with _ _ O
research _ _ O
and _ _ O
education _ _ O
programs. _ _ O
It _ _ O
turned _ _ O
out _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
born _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
job. _ _ O
Patient, _ _ O
intense, _ _ O
curious, _ _ O
enthusiastic, _ _ O
articulate, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Barber _ _ O
has _ _ O
become _ _ O
a _ _ O
dirt _ _ O
poet _ _ O
and _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
philosopher _ _ O
whose _ _ O
time _ _ O
outside _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
pigs _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
beans _ _ O
has _ _ O
had _ _ O
a _ _ O
deep, _ _ O
lasting _ _ O
effect _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
he _ _ O
cooks. _ _ O
Today _ _ O
no _ _ O
other _ _ O
chef _ _ O
has _ _ O
the _ _ O
information _ _ O
he _ _ O
keeps _ _ O
in _ _ O
his _ _ O
head _ _ O
(how _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
pure _ _ O
carbon _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
cow's _ _ O
femur) _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
vegetables _ _ B-FOOD
he _ _ O
puts _ _ O
in _ _ O
his _ _ O
ovens _ _ O
(sparrow-size _ _ B-FOOD
squash). _ _ I-FOOD
To _ _ O
get _ _ O
the _ _ O
Full _ _ B-DISH
Barber, _ _ I-DISH
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
go _ _ O
to _ _ O
Stone _ _ B-EST
Barns _ _ I-EST
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
$198 _ _ O
menu-free, _ _ O
open-ended _ _ O
meal _ _ O
that _ _ O
may _ _ O
include, _ _ O
if _ _ O
you're _ _ O
lucky, _ _ O
a _ _ O
tour _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
manure _ _ O
shed _ _ O
where _ _ O
hot _ _ O
compost _ _ O
is _ _ O
put _ _ O
to _ _ O
work _ _ O
as _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
fuel. _ _ O
The _ _ O
original _ _ O
Blue _ _ B-EST
Hill _ _ I-EST
sits _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
English _ _ O
basement _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
townhouse _ _ O
in _ _ O
Greenwich _ _ B-LOC
Village, _ _ I-LOC
a _ _ O
historically _ _ O
tolerant _ _ O
neighborhood _ _ O
whose _ _ O
tolerance _ _ O
does _ _ O
not _ _ O
extend _ _ O
to _ _ O
manure _ _ O
sheds. _ _ O
The _ _ O
city _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
afford _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
or _ _ O
space _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
leisurely _ _ O
unfurling _ _ O
of _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Barber's _ _ O
complete _ _ O
vision _ _ O
of _ _ O
how _ _ O
our _ _ O
appetites _ _ O
should _ _ O
fit _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
land _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
climate. _ _ O
The _ _ O
low-ceilinged _ _ O
space _ _ O
is _ _ O
too _ _ O
much _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
saloon, _ _ O
the _ _ O
tables _ _ O
too _ _ O
close _ _ O
together, _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
many _ _ O
ardent _ _ O
admirers _ _ O
too _ _ O
accustomed _ _ O
to _ _ O
treating _ _ O
it _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
place _ _ O
to _ _ O
catch _ _ O
up _ _ O
over _ _ O
an _ _ O
excellent _ _ O
weeknight _ _ O
dinner. _ _ O
If _ _ O
Blue _ _ B-EST
Hill _ _ I-EST
had _ _ O
as _ _ O
many _ _ O
cooks _ _ O
and _ _ O
servers _ _ O
as _ _ O
its _ _ O
more _ _ O
favored _ _ O
sister _ _ O
upstate, _ _ O
they _ _ O
would _ _ O
probably _ _ O
iron _ _ O
out _ _ O
wrinkles _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
long, _ _ O
stranded _ _ O
layovers _ _ O
between _ _ O
courses; _ _ O
the _ _ O
wineglasses _ _ O
that _ _ O
sat _ _ O
empty _ _ O
and _ _ O
were _ _ O
finally _ _ O
cleared _ _ O
with _ _ O
no _ _ O
offer _ _ O
of _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
ones; _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
$23 _ _ O
glass _ _ O
of _ _ O
Rully _ _ B-DISH
poured _ _ O
ice-cold, _ _ O
so _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
clenched _ _ O
and _ _ O
astringent. _ _ O
It _ _ O
also _ _ O
seems _ _ O
far _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
character _ _ O
that _ _ O
this _ _ O
intensely _ _ O
local _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
sells _ _ O
just _ _ O
two _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
wines _ _ B-FOOD
on _ _ O
its _ _ O
Francophilic _ _ O
(and _ _ O
not _ _ O
very _ _ O
value-minded) _ _ O
list, _ _ O
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
its _ _ O
only _ _ O
cider _ _ O
comes _ _ O
from _ _ O
California _ _ B-LOC
when _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
cider _ _ B-FOOD
revival _ _ O
going _ _ O
on _ _ O
in _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Barber's _ _ O
own, _ _ O
apple-rich _ _ O
state. _ _ O
But _ _ O
while _ _ O
it _ _ O
may _ _ O
give _ _ O
you _ _ O
only _ _ O
a _ _ O
Half _ _ B-DISH
Barber, _ _ I-DISH
Blue _ _ B-EST
Hill _ _ I-EST
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
an _ _ O
exceptional _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Barber's _ _ O
long _ _ O
search _ _ O
for _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
town _ _ O
pays _ _ O
off _ _ O
downtown, _ _ O
where _ _ O
you _ _ O
find _ _ O
yourself _ _ O
thinking, _ _ O
again _ _ O
and _ _ O
again, _ _ O
that _ _ O
each _ _ O
new _ _ O
ingredient _ _ O
may _ _ O
well _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
example _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
kind _ _ O
you've _ _ O
ever _ _ O
tasted. _ _ O
For _ _ O
this _ _ O
reason _ _ O
and _ _ O
others, _ _ O
Blue _ _ B-EST
Hill _ _ I-EST
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
few _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
restaurants _ _ O
that _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
better _ _ O
and _ _ O
more _ _ O
original _ _ O
as _ _ O
time _ _ O
goes _ _ O
by. _ _ O
This _ _ O
was _ _ O
true _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
time _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
reviewed _ _ O
in _ _ O
The _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
Times, _ _ O
in _ _ O
2006, _ _ O
when _ _ O
Frank _ _ O
Bruni _ _ O
brought _ _ O
it _ _ O
from _ _ O
two _ _ O
stars _ _ O
to _ _ O
three, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
true _ _ O
now. _ _ O
Dinner _ _ O
at _ _ O
Blue _ _ B-EST
Hill _ _ I-EST
can _ _ O
go _ _ O
in _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
two _ _ O
directions: _ _ O
a _ _ O
four-course, _ _ O
$85 _ _ O
menu _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
choose, _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
longer, _ _ O
free-form _ _ O
"farmer's _ _ O
feast" _ _ O
chosen _ _ O
by _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Barber _ _ O
or _ _ O
his _ _ O
chef _ _ O
de _ _ O
cuisine, _ _ O
Shingoon _ _ O
Hong, _ _ O
for _ _ O
$98 _ _ O
or _ _ O
$125, _ _ O
depending _ _ O
on _ _ O
how _ _ O
hungry _ _ O
the _ _ O
farmer _ _ O
is. _ _ O
Either _ _ O
way, _ _ O
the _ _ O
night _ _ O
will _ _ O
include _ _ O
a _ _ O
couple _ _ O
of _ _ O
surprise _ _ O
cameos _ _ O
by _ _ O
fruits _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
vegetables _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
drop _ _ O
in _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
kooky _ _ O
neighbors _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
sitcom. _ _ O
A _ _ O
meal _ _ O
in _ _ O
September _ _ O
started _ _ O
with _ _ O
wispy _ _ O
young _ _ B-FOOD
fennel _ _ I-FOOD
stalks _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
had _ _ O
a _ _ O
clean _ _ O
and _ _ O
pure _ _ O
licorice _ _ B-FOOD
sweetness _ _ O
and _ _ O
ended _ _ O
with _ _ O
firm, _ _ O
green-skinned, _ _ O
yellow-fleshed _ _ O
plums _ _ B-FOOD
on _ _ O
ice. _ _ O
Both _ _ O
made _ _ O
me _ _ O
happy _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
come _ _ O
to _ _ O
Blue _ _ B-EST
Hill _ _ I-EST
then, _ _ O
not _ _ O
a _ _ O
week _ _ O
sooner _ _ O
or _ _ O
later, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
effect _ _ O
that _ _ O
certain _ _ O
fruits _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
vegetables _ _ B-FOOD
can _ _ O
have _ _ O
when _ _ O
they're _ _ O
picked _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
right _ _ O
time. _ _ O
In _ _ O
a _ _ O
more _ _ O
recent _ _ O
meal, _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
sent _ _ O
out _ _ O
a _ _ O
raw _ _ B-DISH
hakurei _ _ I-DISH
turnip _ _ I-DISH
as _ _ O
big _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
apple. _ _ B-FOOD
In _ _ O
fact, _ _ O
it _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
pushed _ _ O
through _ _ O
an _ _ O
apple _ _ O
slicer. _ _ O
I _ _ O
picked _ _ O
up _ _ O
a _ _ O
white _ _ O
wedge, _ _ O
swiped _ _ O
it _ _ O
through _ _ O
a _ _ O
pool _ _ O
of _ _ O
tarragon _ _ B-FOOD
vinaigrette _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
braced _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
harsh _ _ O
turnip _ _ B-FOOD
aftertaste _ _ O
that _ _ O
never _ _ O
came. _ _ O
I _ _ O
won't _ _ O
tell _ _ O
you _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
ate _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole _ _ O
thing, _ _ O
or _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
as _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
and _ _ O
juicy _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
apple, _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
came _ _ O
much _ _ O
closer _ _ O
than _ _ O
I _ _ O
would _ _ O
have _ _ O
thought _ _ O
possible. _ _ O
When _ _ O
it _ _ O
comes _ _ O
to _ _ O
actual _ _ O
cooking, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Barber's _ _ O
approach _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
intensify _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
pretty _ _ O
intense _ _ O
already. _ _ O
Looking _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
saturated _ _ O
orange _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
fat _ _ O
slabs _ _ O
of _ _ O
roasted _ _ B-DISH
carrot _ _ I-DISH
"cutlet," _ _ I-DISH
I _ _ O
could _ _ O
tell _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
taste _ _ O
richer _ _ O
and _ _ O
rounder _ _ O
than _ _ O
any _ _ O
carrot _ _ B-FOOD
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
met _ _ O
before. _ _ O
The _ _ O
approach _ _ O
works _ _ O
on _ _ O
things _ _ O
that _ _ O
once _ _ O
had _ _ O
a _ _ O
pulse, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
Grass-fed, _ _ O
dry-aged _ _ O
veal, _ _ B-DISH
carved _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
sampler _ _ O
of _ _ O
cuts, _ _ O
some _ _ O
fattier, _ _ O
some _ _ O
leaner, _ _ O
was _ _ O
ruddier _ _ O
and _ _ O
more _ _ O
bloody-tasting _ _ O
than _ _ O
most _ _ O
veal, _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
still _ _ O
had _ _ O
a _ _ O
focused, _ _ O
refined _ _ O
taste _ _ O
that _ _ O
set _ _ O
it _ _ O
apart _ _ O
from _ _ O
beef. _ _ B-FOOD
The _ _ O
caramelized _ _ O
outside _ _ O
edge _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
slowly _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
neck _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
Blue _ _ B-LOC
Hill _ _ I-LOC
Farm _ _ I-LOC
goat _ _ O
had _ _ O
a _ _ O
profoundly _ _ O
satisfying _ _ O
chew; _ _ O
the _ _ O
meat _ _ B-FOOD
hiding _ _ O
under _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
astoundingly _ _ O
tender _ _ O
and _ _ O
juicy. _ _ O
It _ _ O
had _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
primal _ _ O
pleasures _ _ O
of _ _ O
barbecue, _ _ O
and _ _ O
I _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
to _ _ O
tear _ _ O
into _ _ O
it _ _ O
with _ _ O
my _ _ O
hands. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
early _ _ O
days _ _ O
of _ _ O
Blue _ _ B-EST
Hill, _ _ I-EST
I _ _ O
respected _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
but _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
wallow _ _ O
around _ _ O
in _ _ O
it _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
I _ _ O
do _ _ O
now. _ _ O
The _ _ O
whole _ _ O
complicated _ _ O
web _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Barber _ _ O
oversees _ _ O
has _ _ O
many _ _ O
purposes, _ _ O
spinning _ _ O
off _ _ O
in _ _ O
all _ _ O
directions, _ _ O
but _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
just _ _ O
sit _ _ O
down _ _ O
to _ _ O
dinner, _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
believe _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
point _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
entire _ _ O
operation _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
provide _ _ O
you _ _ O
with _ _ O
one _ _ O
delicious _ _ O
taste _ _ O
after _ _ O
another. _ _ O
And _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
it _ _ O
is. _ _ O

If _ _ O
you _ _ O
remember _ _ O
David _ _ O
Waltuck's _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
at _ _ O
Chanterelle, _ _ B-EST
eating _ _ O
at _ _ O
his _ _ O
new _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
Élan, _ _ B-EST
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
unnerving. _ _ O
Chanterelle, _ _ B-EST
a _ _ O
downtown _ _ O
pioneer _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
1979, _ _ O
was _ _ O
an _ _ O
institution _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
it _ _ O
went _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
business _ _ O
, _ _ O
just _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
months _ _ O
short _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
30th _ _ O
anniversary. _ _ O
Like _ _ O
all _ _ O
institutions, _ _ O
it _ _ O
had _ _ O
become _ _ O
padded _ _ O
by _ _ O
ritual, _ _ O
tradition _ _ O
and _ _ O
reputation. _ _ O
You _ _ O
went _ _ O
there _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
but _ _ O
you _ _ O
also _ _ O
went _ _ O
because _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
supposed _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
city's _ _ O
greatest _ _ O
restaurants, _ _ O
holding _ _ O
four _ _ O
stars _ _ O
from _ _ O
The _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
Times _ _ O
at _ _ O
various _ _ O
points _ _ O
. _ _ O
You _ _ O
went _ _ O
to _ _ O
find _ _ O
out _ _ O
whether _ _ O
the _ _ O
artist _ _ O
who _ _ O
had _ _ O
drawn _ _ O
the _ _ O
cover _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
handwritten _ _ O
menu _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
next _ _ O
table. _ _ O
You _ _ O
went _ _ O
because _ _ O
Karen _ _ O
Waltuck, _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef's _ _ O
wife _ _ O
and _ _ O
partner, _ _ O
and _ _ O
her _ _ O
ballet _ _ O
corps _ _ O
of _ _ O
elegant, _ _ O
mildly _ _ O
bohemian _ _ O
servers _ _ O
knew _ _ O
how _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
you _ _ O
comfortable _ _ O
even _ _ O
if _ _ O
grand _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
like _ _ O
Chanterelle _ _ B-EST
weren't _ _ O
usually _ _ O
your _ _ O
thing. _ _ O
At _ _ O
Élan _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
which _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Waltuck _ _ O
opened _ _ O
with _ _ O
George _ _ O
Stinson _ _ O
north _ _ O
of _ _ O
Union _ _ B-LOC
Square _ _ I-LOC
this _ _ O
summer, _ _ O
the _ _ O
institutional _ _ O
padding _ _ O
is _ _ O
gone. _ _ O
Restaurants _ _ O
like _ _ O
Chanterelle _ _ B-EST
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
wine _ _ O
directory _ _ O
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
and _ _ O
mass _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Oxford _ _ O
English _ _ O
Dictionary, _ _ O
but _ _ O
Élan's _ _ B-EST
fits _ _ O
on _ _ O
four _ _ O
very _ _ O
tempting _ _ O
pages _ _ O
of _ _ O
reds _ _ O
and _ _ O
whites _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
$105, _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
short _ _ O
appendix _ _ O
of _ _ O
more-expensive _ _ O
bottles _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
heading _ _ O
"treat _ _ O
yourself." _ _ O
The _ _ O
one _ _ O
reminder _ _ O
of _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Waltuck's _ _ O
downtown-bohemian _ _ O
past _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
quintuple _ _ O
self-portrait _ _ O
by _ _ O
Chuck _ _ O
Close _ _ O
that _ _ O
hangs _ _ O
opposite _ _ O
the _ _ O
wide _ _ O
concrete _ _ O
bar, _ _ O
a _ _ O
black _ _ O
curtain _ _ O
from _ _ O
which _ _ O
disembodied _ _ O
Close _ _ O
heads _ _ O
stare _ _ O
grimly _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
darkness, _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
trick _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
haunted _ _ O
house. _ _ O
The _ _ O
monochromatic _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
is _ _ O
attractive _ _ O
enough, _ _ O
but _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
too _ _ O
bright _ _ O
by _ _ O
night _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
pinpoint _ _ O
lights _ _ O
beam _ _ O
straight _ _ O
down. _ _ O
Look _ _ O
along _ _ O
the _ _ O
banquette, _ _ O
and _ _ O
you _ _ O
see _ _ O
a _ _ O
row _ _ O
of _ _ O
shiny, _ _ O
illuminated _ _ O
noses. _ _ O
A _ _ O
heavy _ _ O
framed _ _ O
mirror _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
suspended _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
thick _ _ O
white _ _ O
rope, _ _ O
which _ _ O
somehow _ _ O
makes _ _ O
it _ _ O
look _ _ O
less _ _ O
secure. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
a _ _ O
reasonably _ _ O
quiet _ _ O
room, _ _ O
friendly _ _ O
to _ _ O
conversation, _ _ O
but _ _ O
not _ _ O
one _ _ O
whose _ _ O
innate _ _ O
beauty _ _ O
will _ _ O
draw _ _ O
you _ _ O
back. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is, _ _ O
in _ _ O
other _ _ O
words, _ _ O
little _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
environment _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
to _ _ O
hide _ _ O
behind. _ _ O
Standing _ _ O
out _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
open, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Waltuck's _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
is _ _ O
revealed _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
as _ _ O
variable, _ _ O
as _ _ O
prone _ _ O
to _ _ O
peaks _ _ O
and _ _ O
valleys, _ _ O
as _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
else's. _ _ O
This _ _ O
may _ _ O
rattle _ _ O
the _ _ O
Chanterelle _ _ B-EST
sentimentalists, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
liberated _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Waltuck. _ _ O
A _ _ O
chef _ _ O
with _ _ O
stars _ _ O
to _ _ O
defend _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
reputation _ _ O
to _ _ O
maintain _ _ O
does _ _ O
what _ _ O
politicians _ _ O
do _ _ O
in _ _ O
close _ _ O
elections: _ _ O
sticks _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
script, _ _ O
tries _ _ O
to _ _ O
stay _ _ O
predictable. _ _ O
At _ _ O
Élan, _ _ B-EST
Mr. _ _ O
Waltuck _ _ O
gets _ _ O
to _ _ O
play. _ _ O
He _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
ask _ _ O
himself _ _ O
whether _ _ O
a _ _ O
pair _ _ O
of _ _ O
pot _ _ B-DISH
stickers _ _ I-DISH
filled _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
mashed _ _ I-DISH
potatoes _ _ I-DISH
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
four-star _ _ O
dish. _ _ O
That's _ _ O
a _ _ O
boring _ _ O
question. _ _ O
The _ _ O
point _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
finding _ _ O
potatoes _ _ B-FOOD
inside _ _ O
crimped _ _ O
pan-fried _ _ B-FOOD
dumplings _ _ I-FOOD
surrounded _ _ I-FOOD
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
haze _ _ O
of _ _ O
shaved _ _ O
summer _ _ B-FOOD
truffles _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
funny, _ _ O
delicious _ _ O
surprise. _ _ O
He _ _ O
must _ _ O
be _ _ O
playing, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
when _ _ O
he _ _ O
stirs _ _ O
sea _ _ B-FOOD
urchin _ _ I-FOOD
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
deep _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
guacamole. _ _ B-FOOD
Avocado _ _ B-FOOD
doesn't _ _ O
need _ _ O
extra _ _ O
creaminess, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
takes _ _ O
extremely _ _ O
well _ _ O
to _ _ O
briny _ _ O
seafood, _ _ B-FOOD
as _ _ O
you _ _ O
find _ _ O
out _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
spread _ _ O
some _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
grease-free _ _ O
taro _ _ B-FOOD
chip. _ _ I-FOOD
Occasionally, _ _ O
what _ _ O
seems _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
fun _ _ O
idea _ _ O
will _ _ O
land _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
bag _ _ O
of _ _ O
wet _ _ O
laundry. _ _ O
Foie _ _ B-DISH
gras _ _ I-DISH
lollipops _ _ I-DISH
sound _ _ O
decadent, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
cold _ _ O
wad _ _ O
of _ _ O
dull _ _ O
liver _ _ B-FOOD
rolled _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
uncrunchy _ _ O
pistachios _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
grim _ _ O
treat. _ _ O
General _ _ B-DISH
Tso's _ _ I-DISH
sweetbreads _ _ I-DISH
are _ _ O
another _ _ O
game _ _ O
gone _ _ O
wrong. _ _ O
If _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweetbreads _ _ O
were _ _ O
ever _ _ O
crisp, _ _ O
they _ _ O
aren't _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
they've _ _ O
been _ _ O
stir-fried _ _ O
with _ _ O
bok _ _ O
choy _ _ O
and _ _ O
sloshed _ _ O
around _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
orange-chile _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
that _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
to _ _ O
need _ _ O
more _ _ O
spice _ _ O
and _ _ O
citrus _ _ O
tang. _ _ O
(This _ _ O
dish _ _ O
may _ _ O
fall _ _ O
into _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
my _ _ O
blind _ _ O
spots, _ _ O
because _ _ O
the _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
takeout _ _ O
classic _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
ring _ _ O
my _ _ O
doorbell, _ _ O
either.) _ _ O
Servers _ _ O
at _ _ O
Élan _ _ O
will _ _ O
announce _ _ O
conspiratorially _ _ O
that _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
"off _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
special," _ _ O
a _ _ O
burger _ _ O
of _ _ O
duck _ _ O
and _ _ O
foie _ _ O
gras, _ _ O
even _ _ O
though _ _ O
it's _ _ O
always _ _ O
available. _ _ O
The _ _ O
whispered _ _ O
hard _ _ O
sell _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
tired _ _ O
ploy _ _ O
to _ _ O
begin _ _ O
with, _ _ O
and _ _ O
this _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
mushy _ _ O
pile _ _ O
of _ _ O
meat _ _ O
sweetened _ _ O
with _ _ O
onion _ _ O
chutney _ _ O
and _ _ O
figs _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
spectacular _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
the _ _ O
gimmick _ _ O
pay _ _ O
off. _ _ O
At _ _ O
times, _ _ O
Élan _ _ O
seems _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
unfocused, _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Waltuck _ _ O
is _ _ O
hedging _ _ O
his _ _ O
bets _ _ O
by _ _ O
combining _ _ O
a _ _ O
grown-up _ _ O
bistro _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
gastro _ _ O
pub _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
crazed-carnivore _ _ O
style _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
decade. _ _ O
One _ _ O
of _ _ O
Élan's _ _ O
least _ _ O
pleasant _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
is _ _ O
scallop _ _ O
fettuccine _ _ O
dressed _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
that _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
pure _ _ O
duck _ _ O
fat. _ _ O
After _ _ O
one _ _ O
forkful, _ _ O
I _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
a _ _ O
salad. _ _ O
Fashions _ _ O
have _ _ O
changed _ _ O
since _ _ O
Chanterelle _ _ O
closed, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
but _ _ O
Élan _ _ O
is _ _ O
at _ _ O
its _ _ O
best _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
trying _ _ O
to _ _ O
keep _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
youngsters. _ _ O
The _ _ O
mere _ _ O
sight _ _ O
of _ _ O
tea-smoked _ _ O
salmon _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
may _ _ O
cause _ _ O
Asian _ _ O
fusion _ _ O
flashbacks. _ _ O
(Enormous _ _ O
Buddhas! _ _ O
Chopsticks _ _ O
as _ _ O
hairpins! _ _ O
Raw _ _ O
tuna _ _ O
served _ _ O
over _ _ O
bowls _ _ O
of _ _ O
live _ _ O
Siamese _ _ O
fighting _ _ O
fish!) _ _ O
But _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Waltuck's _ _ O
salmon _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
throwback. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
silky _ _ O
and _ _ O
elegant, _ _ O
given _ _ O
a _ _ O
sweet-sour _ _ O
depth _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
lightly _ _ O
curried _ _ O
tamarind _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
The _ _ O
dish _ _ O
that _ _ O
made _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Waltuck's _ _ O
name, _ _ O
the _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
sausage _ _ O
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
bits _ _ O
of _ _ O
scallops _ _ O
and _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
are _ _ O
bound _ _ O
together _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
subtle _ _ O
fish _ _ O
mousse, _ _ O
is _ _ O
back, _ _ O
looking _ _ O
hopelessly _ _ O
behind _ _ O
the _ _ O
times _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
sauerkraut _ _ O
beurre _ _ O
blanc. _ _ O
Do _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
fooled: _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
delicious _ _ O
things _ _ O
at _ _ O
Élan. _ _ O
I _ _ O
enjoyed _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Waltuck's _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
zucchini _ _ O
blossoms _ _ O
at _ _ O
Chanterelle _ _ O
and _ _ O
enjoyed _ _ O
them _ _ O
again _ _ O
at _ _ O
Élan, _ _ O
where _ _ O
they _ _ O
were _ _ O
stuffed _ _ O
with _ _ O
zucchini _ _ O
and _ _ O
Parmesan _ _ O
and _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
slow-cooked _ _ O
tomatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
very _ _ O
fresh, _ _ O
clean-tasting _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
crème _ _ O
fraîche. _ _ O
With _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
that _ _ O
call _ _ O
for _ _ O
lightness _ _ O
and _ _ O
delicacy, _ _ O
Élan _ _ O
comes _ _ O
into _ _ O
its _ _ O
own. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu _ _ O
changes _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
time, _ _ O
and _ _ O
at _ _ O
every _ _ O
meal, _ _ O
one _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
recipes _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
to _ _ O
need _ _ O
more _ _ O
time _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
test _ _ O
kitchen. _ _ O
A _ _ O
red-wine _ _ O
butter _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
with _ _ O
striped _ _ O
bass _ _ O
was _ _ O
very _ _ O
vague, _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
needed _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
reduced _ _ O
longer. _ _ O
But _ _ O
a _ _ O
special _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
night, _ _ O
fluffy _ _ O
fish _ _ O
quenelles _ _ O
bobbing _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
aromatic _ _ O
Thai _ _ O
soup, _ _ O
skillfully _ _ O
combined _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Waltuck's _ _ O
longstanding _ _ O
love _ _ O
for _ _ O
Asian _ _ O
traditions _ _ O
with _ _ O
his _ _ O
habit _ _ O
of _ _ O
jumping _ _ O
outside _ _ O
tradition _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
mood _ _ O
strikes. _ _ O
Diana _ _ O
Valenzuela, _ _ O
the _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
work _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
way. _ _ O
She _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
zigging _ _ O
in _ _ O
one _ _ O
direction, _ _ O
then _ _ O
she'll _ _ O
zag _ _ O
left _ _ O
on _ _ O
you. _ _ O
Panna _ _ O
cotta _ _ O
with _ _ O
Concord _ _ O
grape _ _ O
jam _ _ O
and _ _ O
fragile _ _ O
sheets _ _ O
of _ _ O
pine-nut _ _ O
brittle _ _ O
starts _ _ O
like _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
but _ _ O
ends _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
cheese _ _ O
course; _ _ O

But _ _ O
a _ _ O

of _ _ O

Morten _ _ O
Sohlberg _ _ O
designed _ _ O
the _ _ O
tables _ _ O
for _ _ O
Blenheim, _ _ B-EST
the _ _ O
West _ _ B-LOC
Village _ _ I-LOC
restaurant _ _ O
he _ _ O
and _ _ O
his _ _ O
wife _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
May. _ _ O
The _ _ O
concrete _ _ O
tops _ _ O
are _ _ O
polished _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
with _ _ O
beeswax, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
sides _ _ O
are _ _ O
edged _ _ O
with _ _ O
copper. _ _ O
The _ _ O
shapes _ _ O
look _ _ O
irregular, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
sides _ _ O
are _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
bowed _ _ O
so _ _ O
that _ _ O
a _ _ O
pair _ _ O
of _ _ O
two-tops _ _ O
can _ _ O
spoon _ _ O
against _ _ O
each _ _ O
other _ _ O
and _ _ O
become _ _ O
a _ _ O
four-top. _ _ O
"That's _ _ O
the _ _ O
idea, _ _ O
anyway," _ _ O
our _ _ O
server _ _ O
said. _ _ O
"But _ _ O
they _ _ O
don't _ _ O
all _ _ O
fit _ _ O
together." _ _ O
Blenheim _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
like _ _ O
that, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
A _ _ O
tremendous _ _ O
amount _ _ O
of _ _ O
thought _ _ O
and _ _ O
effort _ _ O
has _ _ O
gone _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
food, _ _ O
drinks _ _ O
and _ _ O
design, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
don't _ _ O
always _ _ O
connect. _ _ O
This _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
an _ _ O
issue _ _ O
since _ _ O
the _ _ O
beginning. _ _ O
The _ _ O
first _ _ O
chef _ _ O
left _ _ O
about _ _ O
three _ _ O
weeks _ _ O
in _ _ O
because _ _ O
of _ _ O
what _ _ O
the _ _ O
owners _ _ O
called _ _ O
"irreconcilable _ _ O
differences." _ _ O
In _ _ O
July, _ _ O
they _ _ O
hired _ _ O
Ryan _ _ O
Tate, _ _ O
who _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
at _ _ O
Le _ _ B-EST
Restaurant _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
TriBeCa _ _ B-LOC
until _ _ O
it _ _ O
suddenly _ _ O
closed. _ _ O
I _ _ O
admired _ _ O
the _ _ O
$100 _ _ O
set _ _ O
menus _ _ O
he _ _ O
served _ _ O
there _ _ O
enough _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
happily _ _ O
gave _ _ O
the _ _ O
place _ _ O
two _ _ O
stars _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
review _ _ O
last _ _ O
year. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Tate _ _ O
has _ _ O
set _ _ O
his _ _ O
ambitions _ _ O
even _ _ O
higher _ _ O
this _ _ O
time. _ _ O
Besides _ _ O
a _ _ O
sizable _ _ O
à _ _ O
la _ _ O
carte _ _ O
menu, _ _ O
he _ _ O
offers _ _ O
a _ _ O
$115, _ _ O
nine-course _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
loaded _ _ O
with _ _ O
extra _ _ O
dishes. _ _ O
At _ _ O
times, _ _ O
his _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
is _ _ O
as _ _ O
thoughtful _ _ O
and _ _ O
transporting _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
at _ _ O
Le _ _ B-EST
Restaurant, _ _ I-EST
but _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
higher _ _ O
degree _ _ O
of _ _ O
intricacy. _ _ O
At _ _ O
other _ _ O
times, _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
is _ _ O
obviously _ _ O
struggling _ _ O
to _ _ O
keep _ _ O
up. _ _ O
Meanwhile, _ _ O
the _ _ O
service _ _ O
runs _ _ O
the _ _ O
gamut _ _ O
from _ _ O
charming _ _ O
and _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
lost _ _ O
to _ _ O
nonexistent. _ _ O
On _ _ O
my _ _ O
first _ _ O
night _ _ O
there, _ _ O
the _ _ O
disparity _ _ O
between _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
widest _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
ever _ _ O
seen _ _ O
in _ _ O
any _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
That _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
only _ _ O
disconnect. _ _ O
When _ _ O
tables _ _ O
are _ _ O
set _ _ O
up _ _ O
outside _ _ O
next _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
cobblestone _ _ O
streets, _ _ O
Blenheim _ _ B-EST
looks _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
its _ _ O
only _ _ O
desire _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
your _ _ O
drop-in-and-hang-out _ _ O
corner _ _ O
tavern. _ _ O
The _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room, _ _ O
with _ _ O
an _ _ O
antique _ _ O
tree _ _ O
saw, _ _ O
a _ _ O
wooden _ _ O
yoke _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
whole _ _ O
array _ _ O
of _ _ O
carpentry _ _ O
tools _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
walls, _ _ O
looks _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
historical _ _ O
society _ _ O
of _ _ O
some _ _ O
upstate _ _ O
village, _ _ O
where _ _ O
it _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
only _ _ O
tourist _ _ O
attraction. _ _ O
Underlining _ _ O
the _ _ O
point, _ _ O
servers _ _ O
tell _ _ O
you _ _ O
right _ _ O
away _ _ O
that _ _ O
this _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
farm-to-table _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
that _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
are _ _ O
trucked _ _ O
in _ _ O
from _ _ O
Blenheim _ _ B-EST
Hill _ _ I-EST
Farm _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
Schoharie _ _ B-LOC
County, _ _ I-LOC
southwest _ _ O
of _ _ O
Albany, _ _ B-LOC
owned _ _ O
by _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Sohlberg _ _ O
and _ _ O
his _ _ O
wife, _ _ O
Min _ _ O
Ye. _ _ O
You _ _ O
might _ _ O
reasonably _ _ O
expect _ _ O
pork _ _ B-FOOD
cutlets, _ _ I-FOOD
creamed _ _ B-FOOD
corn, _ _ I-FOOD
maybe _ _ O
pie. _ _ B-FOOD
Mr. _ _ O
Tate _ _ O
has _ _ O
other _ _ O
ideas. _ _ O
Terrific _ _ O
ideas, _ _ O
often, _ _ O
even _ _ O
if _ _ O
they _ _ O
have _ _ O
as _ _ O
much _ _ O
business _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
rusticated _ _ O
farm-to-table _ _ B-TYPE
tavern _ _ I-TYPE
as _ _ O
white _ _ O
tie _ _ O
and _ _ O
spats. _ _ O
The _ _ O
stream _ _ O
in _ _ O
Schoharie _ _ B-LOC
County _ _ I-LOC
where _ _ O
tilefish _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
sea _ _ B-FOOD
urchin _ _ I-FOOD
splash _ _ O
around _ _ O
together _ _ O
hasn't _ _ O
been _ _ O
discovered _ _ O
yet, _ _ O
but _ _ O
at _ _ O
Blenheim _ _ B-EST
they _ _ O
swim _ _ O
happily _ _ O
side _ _ O
by _ _ O
side _ _ O
on _ _ O
one _ _ O
plate. _ _ O
The _ _ O
tilefish _ _ B-FOOD
falls _ _ O
into _ _ O
big, _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
white _ _ O
flakes _ _ O
that _ _ O
taste _ _ O
of _ _ O
shrimp. _ _ B-FOOD
The _ _ O
urchin _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
whipped _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
creamy, _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
briny _ _ O
sabayon _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
richer, _ _ O
more _ _ O
luxurious _ _ O
taramosalata. _ _ B-FOOD
Also _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
plate _ _ O
are _ _ O
fat _ _ O
blueberries _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
carrots _ _ B-FOOD
roasted _ _ O
in _ _ O
coffee _ _ B-FOOD
bean _ _ I-FOOD
oil. _ _ I-FOOD
I _ _ O
can't _ _ O
explain _ _ O
why _ _ O
blueberries _ _ B-FOOD
taste _ _ O
so _ _ O
good _ _ O
with _ _ O
sea _ _ B-FOOD
urchin _ _ I-FOOD
sabayon, _ _ I-FOOD
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
do. _ _ O
Alaskan _ _ B-FOOD
king _ _ I-FOOD
crab _ _ I-FOOD
meat _ _ I-FOOD
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
made _ _ O
almost _ _ O
as _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
and _ _ O
tender _ _ O
as _ _ O
some _ _ O
tropical _ _ B-FOOD
fruit, _ _ I-FOOD
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
midnight _ _ O
funk _ _ O
of _ _ O
squid _ _ B-FOOD
ink _ _ I-FOOD
sauce _ _ I-FOOD
brought _ _ O
it _ _ O
back _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
sea. _ _ O
With _ _ O
dense _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
chanterelles _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
wands _ _ O
of _ _ O
naturally _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
sea _ _ B-FOOD
bean _ _ I-FOOD
scattered _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
plate, _ _ O
this _ _ O
was _ _ O
an _ _ O
appetizer _ _ O
you _ _ O
could _ _ O
go _ _ O
quietly _ _ O
crazy _ _ O
over. _ _ O
And _ _ O
it _ _ O
would _ _ O
take _ _ O
a _ _ O
crazy _ _ O
person _ _ O
to _ _ O
complain _ _ O
that _ _ O
Alaskan _ _ B-FOOD
crab _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
sea _ _ B-FOOD
urchin _ _ I-FOOD
are _ _ O
insufficiently _ _ O
farm-to-table _ _ O
when _ _ O
they're _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
this _ _ O
skillfully. _ _ O
Not _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Tate _ _ O
turns _ _ O
his _ _ O
back _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
owners' _ _ O
land _ _ O
entirely. _ _ O
The _ _ O
carrots _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
chanterelles _ _ B-FOOD
come _ _ O
from _ _ O
Blenheim _ _ B-EST
Hill _ _ I-EST
Farm. _ _ I-EST
So _ _ O
does _ _ O
the _ _ O
pork _ _ B-DISH
loin, _ _ I-DISH
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
slowly _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
until _ _ O
it _ _ O
drips _ _ O
with _ _ O
juices _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
sent _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
cast _ _ O
of _ _ O
cool _ _ O
Southern _ _ B-CUISINE
characters: _ _ O
pickled _ _ B-FOOD
peaches, _ _ I-FOOD
okra _ _ B-FOOD
charred _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
husk, _ _ O
and _ _ O
sorghum _ _ B-FOOD
syrup, _ _ I-FOOD
like _ _ O
molasses _ _ B-FOOD
cut _ _ O
with _ _ O
espresso. _ _ B-FOOD
Those _ _ O
are _ _ O
Blenheim _ _ B-EST
lettuces _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
chips _ _ O
of _ _ O
smoked _ _ B-FOOD
Blenheim _ _ I-FOOD
ham _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
gloriously _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
and _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
salad, _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
that's _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
Blenheim _ _ B-FOOD
pork _ _ I-FOOD
fat _ _ I-FOOD
spackling _ _ O
the _ _ O
side _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
bowl. _ _ O
The _ _ O
lemon _ _ B-FOOD
balm, _ _ I-FOOD
thyme _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
pineapple _ _ B-FOOD
sage _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
sensational _ _ O
group _ _ O
of _ _ O
herb _ _ B-FOOD
sorbets: _ _ I-FOOD
Blenheim-grown. _ _ O
The _ _ O
gap _ _ O
between _ _ O
the _ _ O
farm-to-table _ _ B-TYPE
ethos _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Tate's _ _ O
style _ _ O
is _ _ O
minor _ _ O
compared _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
gulf _ _ O
between _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
Blenheim _ _ B-EST
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
currently _ _ O
sits _ _ O
at _ _ O
283 _ _ B-LOC
West _ _ I-LOC
12th _ _ I-LOC
Street. _ _ I-LOC
The _ _ O
same _ _ O
dish _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
stunning _ _ O
one _ _ O
night _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
contorted _ _ O
mess _ _ O
on _ _ O
another. _ _ O
The _ _ O
first _ _ O
time _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
the _ _ O
roasted _ _ B-DISH
king _ _ I-DISH
mushrooms _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
spaetzle _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ I-DISH
sauerkraut, _ _ I-DISH
the _ _ O
mushroom _ _ B-FOOD
stems _ _ I-FOOD
had _ _ O
something _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
and _ _ O
texture _ _ O
of _ _ O
weisswurst. _ _ B-FOOD
A _ _ O
German-inspired _ _ B-CUISINE
vegetarian _ _ B-DIET
main _ _ O
course _ _ O
with _ _ O
mushrooms _ _ B-FOOD
standing _ _ O
in _ _ O
for _ _ O
sausages _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
fantastic _ _ O
notion, _ _ O
and _ _ O
I _ _ O
couldn't _ _ O
wait _ _ O
to _ _ O
taste _ _ O
it _ _ O
again _ _ O
when _ _ O
I _ _ O
returned. _ _ O
But _ _ O
when _ _ O
I _ _ O
did, _ _ O
the _ _ O
stems _ _ B-FOOD
were _ _ O
watery _ _ O
inside _ _ O
and _ _ O
rubbery _ _ O
outside, _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
steamed _ _ B-FOOD
hot _ _ I-FOOD
dog _ _ I-FOOD
wrapped _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
balloon. _ _ O
An _ _ O
unusual _ _ O
dessert _ _ B-FOOD
soup _ _ I-FOOD
of _ _ O
cooked _ _ B-FOOD
barley _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ I-FOOD
Champagne _ _ I-FOOD
grapes _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
chilled _ _ O
barley-jasmine _ _ B-FOOD
tea _ _ I-FOOD
went _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
whack _ _ O
between _ _ O
visits, _ _ O
going _ _ O
from _ _ O
fascinating _ _ O
to _ _ O
weird. _ _ O
And _ _ O
there _ _ O
were _ _ O
glitches _ _ O
that _ _ O
were _ _ O
surprising _ _ O
in _ _ O
such _ _ O
a _ _ O
technique-focused _ _ O
kitchen. _ _ O
The _ _ O
grapefruit _ _ B-DISH
pearls _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
cured _ _ I-DISH
Tasmanian _ _ I-DISH
sea _ _ I-DISH
trout _ _ I-DISH
were _ _ O
meant _ _ O
to _ _ O
burst _ _ O
with _ _ O
juice, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
had _ _ O
solidified. _ _ O
Eating _ _ O
them _ _ O
was _ _ O
like _ _ O
chewing _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
drippings _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
grapefruit-scented _ _ O
candle. _ _ O
On _ _ O
Blenheim's _ _ B-EST
better _ _ O
nights, _ _ O
I _ _ O
might _ _ O
have _ _ O
ranked _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
among _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
exciting _ _ O
and _ _ O
interesting _ _ O
I've _ _ O
eaten _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
year. _ _ O
But _ _ O
it _ _ O
came _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
so _ _ O
very, _ _ O
very _ _ O
slowly _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
stay _ _ O
excited _ _ O
or _ _ O
interested. _ _ O
It _ _ O
took _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
three _ _ O
hours _ _ O
one _ _ O
night _ _ O
to _ _ O
order _ _ O
and _ _ O
eat _ _ O
appetizers, _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses _ _ O
and _ _ O
desserts. _ _ O
I _ _ O
wondered _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
was _ _ O
overwhelmed. _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
sure _ _ O
our _ _ O
server _ _ O
was. _ _ O
We _ _ O
had _ _ O
to _ _ O
flag _ _ O
him _ _ O
down _ _ O
to _ _ O
ask _ _ O
for _ _ O
more _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
soft, _ _ O
warm _ _ O
and _ _ O
yeasty _ _ O
rolls _ _ B-FOOD
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
Cheddar _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
Marmite. _ _ B-FOOD
They _ _ O
never _ _ O
came. _ _ O
It _ _ O
took _ _ O
two _ _ O
tries _ _ O
and _ _ O
about _ _ O
20 _ _ O
minutes _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
a _ _ O
second _ _ O
glass _ _ O
of _ _ O
wine. _ _ B-FOOD
We _ _ O
were _ _ O
left _ _ O
alone _ _ O
with _ _ O
menus _ _ O
for _ _ O
three-quarters _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
hour _ _ O
before _ _ O
we _ _ O
waved _ _ O
like _ _ O
drowning _ _ O
sailors _ _ O
and _ _ O
begged _ _ O
him _ _ O
to _ _ O
take _ _ O
our _ _ O
order. _ _ O
"There _ _ O
are _ _ O
some _ _ O
additions _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
tonight," _ _ O
he _ _ O
began. _ _ O
Additions? _ _ O
When _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
can't _ _ O
send _ _ O
out _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
one _ _ O
course _ _ O
an _ _ O
hour, _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
needs _ _ O
subtractions. _ _ O
And _ _ O
Blenheim _ _ B-EST
has _ _ O
no _ _ O
business _ _ O
offering _ _ O
nine-course _ _ O
tastings _ _ O
unless _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
ready _ _ O
to _ _ O
provide _ _ O
pajamas _ _ O
and _ _ O
sleeping _ _ O
bags. _ _ O
Maybe _ _ O
its _ _ O
pieces _ _ O
would _ _ O
fit _ _ O
together _ _ O
better _ _ O
if _ _ O
there _ _ O
weren't _ _ O
so _ _ O
many _ _ O
of _ _ O
them. _ _ O
I _ _ O
hope _ _ O
so, _ _ O
because _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
like _ _ O
to _ _ O
see _ _ O
it _ _ O
transform _ _ O
itself _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
puzzle _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O

We _ _ O

when _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
my _ _ O
guests _ _ O
suddenly _ _ O
tilted _ _ O
his _ _ O

He _ _ O
looked _ _ O

the _ _ O

of _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O

through _ _ O

He's _ _ O
"the _ _ O

the _ _ O

Yet _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
comes _ _ O
to _ _ O
current _ _ O

those _ _ O
in _ _ O

Mr. _ _ O

shows _ _ O
a _ _ O

verging _ _ O
at _ _ O

on _ _ O

may _ _ O
be _ _ O
his _ _ O
most _ _ O
thorough _ _ O
repudiation _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
downtown _ _ O
scene. _ _ O
It _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
just _ _ O

did _ _ O

try _ _ O
to _ _ O

as _ _ O

and _ _ O

of _ _ O

that _ _ O

was _ _ O
likely _ _ O
to _ _ O
break. _ _ O
In _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
McNally's _ _ O
restaurants, _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
are _ _ O
rarely _ _ O
treated _ _ O
like _ _ O
stars. _ _ O
At _ _ O

two _ _ O
men, _ _ O
Shane _ _ O

Daniel _ _ O

share _ _ O
the _ _ O
work _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
credit. _ _ O
As _ _ O
a _ _ O
result, _ _ O
perhaps, _ _ O
their _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
is _ _ O
almost _ _ O
egoless; _ _ O
it's _ _ O
not _ _ O
about _ _ O
what _ _ O
they _ _ O
want. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
about _ _ O
what _ _ O
you _ _ O
want, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
if _ _ O
that _ _ O
happens _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O

at _ _ O

that _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
accused _ _ O
of _ _ O
trying _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
an _ _ O
impression. _ _ O
The _ _ O

the _ _ O

intensity _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O

a _ _ O

of _ _ O

that _ _ O
even _ _ O
the _ _ O

of _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses _ _ O
may _ _ O
register _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
half _ _ O
step _ _ O
down: _ _ O
a _ _ O
pot _ _ O
of _ _ O
fat, _ _ O
clean _ _ O
mussels _ _ O
with _ _ O
bits _ _ O
of _ _ O
preserved _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
clinging _ _ O
to _ _ O
them; _ _ O
a _ _ O
roast _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
done _ _ O
right; _ _ O
a _ _ O
salade _ _ O
niçoise _ _ O
that _ _ O
pays _ _ O
attention _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
detail, _ _ O
including, _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
wonderful _ _ O
departure _ _ O
from _ _ O
tradition, _ _ O
the _ _ O
pile _ _ O
of _ _ O
smashed _ _ O
potato _ _ O
salad _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
bottom _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
bowl. _ _ O
Here _ _ O
and _ _ O
there, _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
tends _ _ O
to _ _ O
overembellish. _ _ O
The _ _ O
decent _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
salmon _ _ O
comes _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
lentil _ _ O
salad _ _ O
that _ _ O
tries _ _ O
to _ _ O
do _ _ O
too _ _ O
many _ _ O
things _ _ O
at _ _ O
once, _ _ O
and _ _ O
limp _ _ O
white _ _ O
stewed _ _ O
onions _ _ O
and _ _ O
fennel _ _ O
did _ _ O
not _ _ O
give _ _ O
skate _ _ O
Grenobloise _ _ O
(billed _ _ O
as _ _ O
meunière) _ _ O
anything _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
really _ _ O
needed. _ _ O
It _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
nice, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
to _ _ O
taste _ _ O
the _ _ O
meat _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
aggressive _ _ O
seasoning _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
steak _ _ O
tartare _ _ O
appetizer, _ _ O
given _ _ O
the _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
are _ _ O
clearly _ _ O
buying _ _ O
good _ _ O
beef. _ _ O
At _ _ O
least _ _ O
it _ _ O
made _ _ O
a _ _ O
strong _ _ O
impression, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
I _ _ O
can _ _ O
say _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
$18 _ _ O
heirloom _ _ O
tomato _ _ O
salad. _ _ O
Heirlooms _ _ O
from _ _ O
where, _ _ O
exactly? _ _ O
Food _ _ O
Emporium? _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
unless _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
coming _ _ O
to _ _ O
Cherche _ _ O
Midi _ _ O
to _ _ O
commune _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
essence _ _ O
of _ _ O
summer, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
good _ _ O
enough _ _ O
salad. _ _ O
The _ _ O
desserts _ _ O
are _ _ O
much _ _ O
better _ _ O
than _ _ O
that. _ _ O
The _ _ O
floating _ _ O
islands, _ _ O
the _ _ O
mocha _ _ O
pot _ _ O
de _ _ O
crème, _ _ O
the _ _ O
small _ _ O
pink _ _ O
raspberry _ _ O
soufflé _ _ O
hovering _ _ O
above _ _ O
a _ _ O
bed _ _ O
of _ _ O
warm _ _ O
berries _ _ O
-- _ _ O
the _ _ O
lineup _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
argument _ _ O
after _ _ O
another _ _ O
for _ _ O
bringing _ _ O
back _ _ O
old-fashioned _ _ O
pleasures. _ _ O
After _ _ O
a _ _ O
recent _ _ O
tour _ _ O
of _ _ O
all _ _ O
his _ _ O
restaurants, _ _ O
I _ _ O
think _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
McNally's _ _ O
great _ _ O
talent _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
knowing _ _ O
which _ _ O
things _ _ O
are _ _ O
worth _ _ O
worrying _ _ O
about _ _ O
and _ _ O
which _ _ O
can _ _ O
get _ _ O
by _ _ O
with _ _ O
being _ _ O
just _ _ O
good _ _ O
enough. _ _ O
At _ _ O
Morandi _ _ O
, _ _ O
the _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses _ _ O
were _ _ O
almost _ _ O
impressive _ _ O
in _ _ O
their _ _ O
mediocrity, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
was _ _ O
just _ _ O
swell, _ _ O
which _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
place _ _ O
needs _ _ O
to _ _ O
keep _ _ O
its _ _ O
chairs _ _ O
full. _ _ O
The _ _ O
short-rib _ _ O
patty _ _ O
melt _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
only _ _ O
good _ _ O
dish _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
table _ _ O
full _ _ O
of _ _ O
disappointments _ _ O
at _ _ O
Schiller's _ _ O
Liquor _ _ O
Bar _ _ O
, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
enjoyed _ _ O
myself _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
I _ _ O
have _ _ O
at _ _ O
far _ _ O
better _ _ O
restaurants. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
limit, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
and _ _ O
Balthazar _ _ O
is _ _ O
approaching _ _ O
it. _ _ O
The _ _ O
cooking, _ _ O
under _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
McBride, _ _ O
has _ _ O
become _ _ O
utterly _ _ O
mundane, _ _ O
a _ _ O
pretty _ _ O
but _ _ O
flavorless _ _ O
imitation _ _ O
of _ _ O
French _ _ O
food _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
kind _ _ O
found _ _ O
at _ _ O
any _ _ O
generic _ _ O
fake _ _ O
bistro. _ _ O
Cherche _ _ O
Midi's _ _ O
salade _ _ O
niçoise _ _ O
is _ _ O
delicious _ _ O
from _ _ O
start _ _ O
to _ _ O
finish; _ _ O
Balthazar's _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
that _ _ O
can't _ _ O
remember _ _ O
what _ _ O
they're _ _ O
supposed _ _ O
to _ _ O
taste _ _ O
like. _ _ O
How _ _ O
can _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
chef _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
restaurateur _ _ O
be _ _ O
responsible _ _ O
for _ _ O
both? _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
McNally _ _ O
does _ _ O
worry _ _ O
about _ _ O
service, _ _ O
which _ _ O
at _ _ O
Cherche _ _ O
Midi _ _ O
manages _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
everywhere _ _ O
without _ _ O
crossing _ _ O
the _ _ O
line _ _ O
to _ _ O
helicopter _ _ O
waitering. _ _ O
And, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
he _ _ O
worries _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
interiors. _ _ O
Cherche _ _ O
Midi's _ _ O
is _ _ O
lovely. _ _ O
Outside _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
dystopian _ _ O
intersection. _ _ O
You'd _ _ O
never _ _ O
know _ _ O
it _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room, _ _ O
which _ _ O
feels _ _ O
intimate, _ _ O
almost _ _ O
private, _ _ O
although _ _ O
of _ _ O
course _ _ O
every _ _ O
face _ _ O
is _ _ O
on _ _ O
display, _ _ O
bathed _ _ O
in _ _ O
light _ _ O
the _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
apricot _ _ O
jam. _ _ O
For _ _ O
three _ _ O
decades, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
McNally _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
rooting _ _ O
around _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
Lego _ _ O
kit: _ _ O
distressed _ _ O
mirrors, _ _ O
chipped _ _ O
subway _ _ O
tiles, _ _ O
bottles _ _ O
backlighted _ _ O
to _ _ O
look _ _ O
like _ _ O
stained _ _ O
glass. _ _ O
In _ _ O
his _ _ O
hands, _ _ O
these _ _ O
well-worn _ _ O
tricks _ _ O
give _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
the _ _ O
battered _ _ O
nobility _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
vintage _ _ O
Saab. _ _ O
When _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
else _ _ O
tries, _ _ O
they _ _ O
end _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
1986 _ _ O
Ford _ _ O
Escort. _ _ O
Sets _ _ O
and _ _ O
lighting _ _ O
will _ _ O
never _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole _ _ O
show. _ _ O

"They _ _ O

we're _ _ O
looking _ _ O
at _ _ O
two _ _ O
hours. _ _ O
They'll _ _ O
call _ _ O

This _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
grim _ _ O
report _ _ O
from _ _ O
inside _ _ O
the _ _ O
latest _ _ O
East _ _ B-LOC
Village _ _ I-LOC
restaurant _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
turned _ _ O
its _ _ O
no-reservations _ _ O
policy _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
viral _ _ O
marketing _ _ O
campaign. _ _ O
A _ _ O
small, _ _ O
hungry _ _ O
mob _ _ O
was _ _ O
gathering _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
sidewalk. _ _ O
Hoping _ _ O
to _ _ O
find _ _ O
a _ _ O
pleasant _ _ O
place _ _ O
to _ _ O
drink _ _ O
and _ _ O
snack _ _ O
until _ _ O
the _ _ O
phone _ _ O
rang, _ _ O
I _ _ O
herded _ _ O
my _ _ O
group _ _ O
to _ _ O
Huertas, _ _ B-EST
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
Basque-leaning _ _ B-CUISINE
tapas _ _ B-TYPE
place _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
blocks _ _ O
away. _ _ O
The _ _ O
room _ _ O
smelled _ _ O
like _ _ O
garlic _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
smoke. _ _ O
A _ _ O
cured _ _ B-FOOD
pig's _ _ I-FOOD
leg _ _ I-FOOD
sat _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
bar, _ _ O
its _ _ O
ankle _ _ O
held _ _ O
tightly _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
clamp. _ _ O
A _ _ O
sharp _ _ O
knife _ _ O
had _ _ O
exposed _ _ O
its _ _ O
interior _ _ O
architecture _ _ O
of _ _ O
meat _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
fat _ _ O
and _ _ O
sinew. _ _ O
Later, _ _ O
we _ _ O
ordered _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
slices _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
Iberico _ _ B-FOOD
ham, _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
melted _ _ O
on _ _ O
our _ _ O
tongues, _ _ O
warm _ _ O
and _ _ O
salty, _ _ O
we _ _ O
all _ _ O
traded _ _ O
looks. _ _ O
We _ _ O
did _ _ O
it _ _ O
again _ _ O
when _ _ O
we _ _ O
ate _ _ O
crumbly _ _ O
shards _ _ O
of _ _ O
aged _ _ B-FOOD
manchego _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
tasted _ _ O
of _ _ O
brown _ _ B-FOOD
butter _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
caramel. _ _ B-FOOD
The _ _ O
looks _ _ O
meant: _ _ O
This _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
knows _ _ O
where _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
the _ _ O
good _ _ O
stuff. _ _ O
That _ _ O
applied _ _ O
to _ _ O
many _ _ O
things _ _ O
we _ _ O
ate _ _ O
that _ _ O
night. _ _ O
Jonah _ _ O
Miller, _ _ O
Huertas's _ _ B-EST
chef, _ _ O
has _ _ O
written _ _ O
a _ _ O
concise _ _ O
menu _ _ O
of _ _ O
Basque-inspired _ _ B-CUISINE
tapas, _ _ B-FOOD
not _ _ O
all _ _ O
of _ _ O
which _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
called _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
fair _ _ O
amount _ _ O
of _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
canned. _ _ O
I _ _ O
am _ _ O
not _ _ O
revealing _ _ O
any _ _ O
secrets _ _ O
here. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
food _ _ O
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
can _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
comes _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
table, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
dense _ _ O
mackerel _ _ B-DISH
in _ _ I-DISH
olive _ _ I-DISH
oil, _ _ I-DISH
which _ _ O
we _ _ O
ate, _ _ O
happily, _ _ O
on _ _ O
sliced _ _ O
baguettes _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
pimentón _ _ B-FOOD
aioli. _ _ I-FOOD
"All _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
Basque _ _ B-CUISINE
seafood _ _ B-FOOD
goes _ _ O
straight _ _ O
into _ _ O
cans," _ _ O
our _ _ O
server _ _ O
told _ _ O
us, _ _ O
and _ _ O
she _ _ O
was _ _ O
so _ _ O
convincing _ _ O
that _ _ O
we _ _ O
asked _ _ O
if _ _ O
she _ _ O
knew _ _ O
a _ _ O
store _ _ O
that _ _ O
sold _ _ O
these _ _ O
marvelous _ _ O
cans. _ _ O
She _ _ O
did. _ _ O
She _ _ O
also _ _ O
knew _ _ O
where _ _ O
we _ _ O
could _ _ O
buy _ _ O
the _ _ O
manchego, _ _ B-FOOD
which _ _ O
she _ _ O
was _ _ O
as _ _ O
excited _ _ O
about _ _ O
as _ _ O
we _ _ O
were. _ _ O
From _ _ O
the _ _ O
front _ _ O
door _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
table, _ _ O
our _ _ O
service _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
proactively _ _ O
friendly _ _ O
and _ _ O
enthusiastic. _ _ O
In _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York, _ _ I-LOC
servers _ _ O
who _ _ O
learn _ _ O
that _ _ O
night's _ _ O

are _ _ O
rare _ _ O
enough; _ _ O
here _ _ O
was _ _ O
one _ _ O
who _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
to _ _ O
know _ _ O
everything _ _ O
about _ _ O

She _ _ O
told _ _ O
us _ _ O
about _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
San _ _ B-LOC
Sebastián, _ _ I-LOC
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
had _ _ O
come _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
to _ _ O
point _ _ O
out _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
delicious _ _ O
parts _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
turbot, _ _ O
showing _ _ O
her _ _ O
how _ _ O
to _ _ O
scoop _ _ O
out _ _ O
his _ _ O
favorite _ _ O
part, _ _ O
the _ _ O
cheeks. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
she _ _ O
took _ _ O
a _ _ O
deep _ _ O
breath _ _ O
and _ _ O
said: _ _ O
"Spain, _ _ B-LOC
you _ _ O
guys." _ _ O
It _ _ O
wasn't _ _ O
all _ _ O
cans _ _ O
and _ _ O
hams _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Miller's _ _ O
kitchen, _ _ O
not _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
would _ _ O
have _ _ O
minded. _ _ O
We _ _ O
asked _ _ O
for _ _ O
something _ _ O
called _ _ O
Huertas _ _ B-DISH
rotos, _ _ I-DISH
which _ _ O
turned _ _ O
out _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
Basque _ _ B-CUISINE
dish _ _ O
huevos _ _ B-DISH
rotos _ _ I-DISH
interpreted _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
pasta _ _ B-FOOD
dish. _ _ O
Skinny _ _ O
threads _ _ O
of _ _ O
potato _ _ B-FOOD
were _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
al _ _ O
dente _ _ O
and _ _ O
tossed _ _ O
with _ _ O
chorizo _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
its _ _ O
oil, _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
soft-cooked _ _ B-FOOD
egg _ _ I-FOOD
on _ _ O
top. _ _ O
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
gone _ _ O
in _ _ O
30 _ _ O
seconds. _ _ O
We _ _ O
drank _ _ O
vermouth, _ _ B-FOOD
made _ _ O
on _ _ O
site, _ _ O
while _ _ O
every _ _ O
few _ _ O
minutes _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
came _ _ O
around _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
tray _ _ O
of _ _ O
small _ _ O
bites _ _ O
straight _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen. _ _ O
There _ _ O
was _ _ O
egg _ _ B-FOOD
salad _ _ I-FOOD
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
slice _ _ O
of _ _ O
baguette, _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
red _ _ B-FOOD
shrimp _ _ I-FOOD
on _ _ O
top; _ _ O
a _ _ O
golden _ _ O
croqueta _ _ B-FOOD
of _ _ I-FOOD
rice _ _ I-FOOD
with _ _ I-FOOD
creamy _ _ I-FOOD
mushrooms _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
center; _ _ O
and _ _ O
sweet _ _ B-FOOD
roasted _ _ I-FOOD
piquillo _ _ I-FOOD
peppers _ _ I-FOOD
stuffed _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
cheesy, _ _ B-FOOD
porky _ _ I-FOOD
froth _ _ I-FOOD
of _ _ I-FOOD
fresh _ _ I-FOOD
sausage _ _ I-FOOD
whipped _ _ O
into _ _ O
goat _ _ B-FOOD
cheese. _ _ I-FOOD
These _ _ O
came _ _ O
in _ _ O
single _ _ O
servings _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
could _ _ O
take _ _ O
or _ _ O
decline, _ _ O
depending _ _ O
on _ _ O
how _ _ O
good _ _ O
they _ _ O
looked _ _ O
and _ _ O
how _ _ O
hungry _ _ O
you _ _ O
were. _ _ O
Each _ _ O
plate _ _ O
you _ _ O
took _ _ O
was _ _ O
marked _ _ O
down _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
card, _ _ O
dim-sum _ _ O
style, _ _ O
by _ _ O
servers. _ _ O
Huertas _ _ B-EST
calls _ _ O
these _ _ O
items _ _ O
pintxos, _ _ B-FOOD
a _ _ O
Basque _ _ O
term _ _ O
for _ _ O
snacks _ _ O
smaller _ _ O
than _ _ O
tapas _ _ O
and _ _ O
pinned _ _ O
together _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
toothpick. _ _ O
In _ _ O
Spain, _ _ B-LOC
pintxos _ _ B-FOOD
do _ _ O
not _ _ O
circulate _ _ O
like _ _ O
dim _ _ O
sum. _ _ O
(Mr. _ _ O
Miller _ _ O
got _ _ O
the _ _ O
idea _ _ O
from _ _ O
State _ _ B-EST
Bird _ _ I-EST
Provisions _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
San _ _ B-LOC
Francisco.) _ _ I-LOC
Yet _ _ O
we _ _ O
felt _ _ O
much _ _ O
closer _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
Spanish _ _ B-CUISINE
tapas-bar _ _ B-TYPE
spirit _ _ O
than _ _ O
if _ _ O
we _ _ O
had _ _ O
ordered _ _ O
10 _ _ O
or _ _ O
15 _ _ O
"small _ _ O
plates _ _ O
meant _ _ O
for _ _ O
sharing" _ _ O
at _ _ O
once, _ _ O
passed _ _ O
them _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
table _ _ O
and _ _ O
called _ _ O
it _ _ O
dinner. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
rarely _ _ O
a _ _ O
satisfying _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it's _ _ O
how _ _ O
many _ _ O
Spanish _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurants _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
deal _ _ O
with _ _ O
tapas. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Huertas _ _ B-EST
modified _ _ O
dim-sum _ _ O
approach _ _ O
was _ _ O
perfect _ _ O
for _ _ O
people _ _ O
like _ _ O
us, _ _ O
who _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
start _ _ O
with _ _ O
drinks _ _ O
and _ _ O
see _ _ O
how _ _ O
the _ _ O
night _ _ O
goes _ _ O
without _ _ O
being _ _ O
forced _ _ O
to _ _ O
turn _ _ O
tapas _ _ O
into _ _ O
dinner. _ _ O
The _ _ O
way _ _ O
this _ _ O
night _ _ O
went _ _ O
was _ _ O
that _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
called, _ _ O
we _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
leave. _ _ O
I _ _ O
went _ _ O
back _ _ O
to _ _ O
Huertas _ _ B-EST
a _ _ O
week _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
later. _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
made _ _ O
reservations _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
small, _ _ O
square _ _ O
back _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room, _ _ O
where _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Miller _ _ O
serves _ _ O
a _ _ O
set _ _ O
menu _ _ O
for _ _ O
$55. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
front _ _ O
room, _ _ O
the _ _ O
plates _ _ O
are _ _ O
unconnected _ _ O
episodes, _ _ O
and _ _ O
you _ _ O
supply _ _ O
the _ _ O
narrative _ _ O
yourself. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
back, _ _ O
you _ _ O
settle _ _ O
in _ _ O
while _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Miller _ _ O
tells _ _ O
a _ _ O
story _ _ O
in _ _ O
five _ _ O
courses. _ _ O
He _ _ O
started _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
nod _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
front _ _ O
room, _ _ O
a _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
little _ _ O
bites. _ _ O
There _ _ O
were _ _ O
gildas, _ _ B-DISH
found _ _ O
in _ _ O
every _ _ O
tapas _ _ O
bar _ _ O
in _ _ O
San _ _ B-LOC
Sebastián, _ _ I-LOC
sharp, _ _ O
clean _ _ O
and _ _ O
salty _ _ O
skewers _ _ O
of _ _ O
white _ _ B-FOOD
anchovy _ _ I-FOOD
threaded _ _ O
with _ _ O
spicy _ _ B-FOOD
green _ _ I-FOOD
pepper _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
an _ _ O
olive. _ _ B-FOOD
There _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
blistered _ _ O
mound _ _ O
of _ _ O
Padrón _ _ B-DISH
peppers _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ I-DISH
garlic _ _ I-DISH
shrimp _ _ I-DISH
on _ _ O
toothpicks, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweetest _ _ O
or _ _ O
firmest _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
ever _ _ O
eaten. _ _ O
This _ _ O
was _ _ O
an _ _ O
anomaly; _ _ O
in _ _ O
general, _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
at _ _ O
Huertas _ _ B-EST
stands _ _ O
out _ _ O
for _ _ O
its _ _ O
pure, _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
flavors. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
a _ _ O
separated _ _ B-DISH
egg. _ _ I-DISH
The _ _ O
white, _ _ B-FOOD
fried, _ _ O
lay _ _ O
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
jumble _ _ O
of _ _ O
corn _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
tomatoes _ _ B-FOOD
cooked _ _ O
quickly _ _ O
with _ _ O
crisp-chewy _ _ O
pimentón-cured _ _ B-FOOD
bacon. _ _ I-FOOD
The _ _ O
yolk, _ _ B-FOOD
raw, _ _ O
sat _ _ O
on _ _ O
top _ _ O
and _ _ O
served _ _ O
as _ _ O
sauce. _ _ B-FOOD
Next _ _ O
was _ _ O
skate, _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
and _ _ O
still _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
juicy _ _ O
inside, _ _ O
with _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
turnips _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
pale-green, _ _ O
herbaceous _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
of _ _ O
puréed _ _ O
turnip _ _ O
greens _ _ O
and _ _ O
fennel. _ _ O
The _ _ O
seasonal _ _ O
Greenmarket _ _ O
aesthetic _ _ O
was _ _ O
familiar _ _ O
to _ _ O
me. _ _ O
Would _ _ O
any _ _ O
Basques _ _ O
recognize _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish? _ _ O
They _ _ O
would _ _ O
know _ _ O
the _ _ O
next _ _ O
course, _ _ O
wonderful _ _ O
garlic-and-pimentón-scented _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
hot _ _ O
dogs _ _ O
called _ _ O
chistorra, _ _ O
even _ _ O
though _ _ O
they _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
used _ _ O
to _ _ O
seeing _ _ O
chistorras _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
pork _ _ O
or _ _ O
beef. _ _ O
Alongside _ _ O
these _ _ O
house-made _ _ O
sausages, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Miller _ _ O
had _ _ O
a _ _ O
wonderful _ _ O
succotash _ _ O
of _ _ O
late-summer _ _ O
beans. _ _ O
Dessert _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
dream, _ _ O
a _ _ O
round _ _ O
and _ _ O
closely _ _ O
packed _ _ O
little _ _ O
goat-cheese _ _ O
cheesecake _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
topping _ _ O
of _ _ O
candied _ _ O
almonds _ _ O
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
bottom _ _ O
crust. _ _ O
More _ _ O
tangy _ _ O
than _ _ O
sugary, _ _ O
the _ _ O
cake _ _ O
took _ _ O
beautifully _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
ripe _ _ O
nectarines. _ _ O
This _ _ O
night _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
later _ _ O
one _ _ O
made _ _ O
it _ _ O
clear _ _ O
that _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
in _ _ O
Huertas's _ _ O
back _ _ O
room _ _ O
ranks _ _ O
among _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
deals _ _ O
in _ _ O
town, _ _ O
up _ _ O
there _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
how-do-they-do-it _ _ O
bargains _ _ O
at _ _ O
Contra _ _ O
and _ _ O
Delaware _ _ O
& _ _ O
Hudson. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Miller _ _ O
shapes _ _ O
his _ _ O
menus _ _ O
so _ _ O
skillfully _ _ O
that _ _ O
it's _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
imagine _ _ O
wanting _ _ O
more. _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
once _ _ O
the _ _ O
familiar _ _ O
conventions _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
modern _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
menu _ _ O
kicked _ _ O
in, _ _ O
I _ _ O
did _ _ O
steal _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
looks _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
front _ _ O
room, _ _ O
where _ _ O
a _ _ O
tray _ _ O
of _ _ O
hot _ _ O
croquetas _ _ O
always _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
going _ _ O
around. _ _ O
Maybe _ _ O
I _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
more _ _ O
spontaneity. _ _ O
Or _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
I _ _ O
just _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
a _ _ O
croqueta. _ _ O

at _ _ O

the _ _ O

Claudette's _ _ B-EST
charms _ _ O
are _ _ O
many _ _ O
and _ _ O
begin _ _ O
with _ _ O
those _ _ O

which _ _ O
replace _ _ O
the _ _ O

that _ _ O
used _ _ O
to _ _ O

Losing _ _ O

the _ _ O

is _ _ O
that _ _ O

in _ _ O
the _ _ O

Claudette _ _ B-EST

French _ _ B-CUISINE

(Rattan _ _ O

The _ _ O

aesthetic _ _ O
is _ _ O
supplied _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
whitewashed _ _ O
tables, _ _ O

pillows _ _ O
and _ _ O
shelves _ _ O
lined _ _ O
with _ _ O
books _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
arranged _ _ O
by _ _ O

and _ _ O
separated _ _ O
by _ _ O
anonymous _ _ O
knickknacks. _ _ O
Contributing _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
cafe _ _ O
look _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
compact _ _ O
bar _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
winning _ _ O
cast _ _ O
of _ _ O
aperitif _ _ O
cocktails, _ _ O
which _ _ O
all _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
named _ _ O
after _ _ O
Roger _ _ O
Vadim's _ _ O
wives. _ _ O
Small, _ _ O
gentle _ _ O
and _ _ O
very _ _ O
appealing, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Brigitte _ _ O
and _ _ O
her _ _ O
cohorts _ _ O
cheerfully _ _ O
buck _ _ O
the _ _ O
trend _ _ O
toward _ _ O
potent, _ _ O
convoluted _ _ O
cocktails _ _ O
that _ _ O
don't _ _ O
know _ _ O
how _ _ O
to _ _ O
behave _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
table. _ _ O
Claudette's _ _ B-EST
food _ _ O
follows _ _ O
the _ _ O
example _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
aperitifs; _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
light, _ _ O
approachable _ _ O
and _ _ O
unlikely _ _ O
to _ _ O
impair _ _ O
your _ _ O
ability _ _ O
to _ _ O
stand _ _ O
up _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O

of _ _ O
the _ _ O
meal. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
mood _ _ O
for _ _ O
an _ _ O
intelligent _ _ O
salad, _ _ B-FOOD
Claudette _ _ B-EST
has _ _ O
plenty: _ _ O
green _ _ B-FOOD
beans _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
vinegared _ _ B-FOOD
hearts _ _ I-FOOD
of _ _ I-FOOD
palm _ _ I-FOOD
with _ _ O
heaps _ _ O
of _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
mint; _ _ B-FOOD
a _ _ O
nest _ _ O
of _ _ O
freshly _ _ O
shredded _ _ B-FOOD
zucchini, _ _ I-FOOD
still _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
under _ _ O
its _ _ O
anchovy _ _ B-FOOD
vinaigrette; _ _ I-FOOD
a _ _ O
crunch-fest _ _ O
of _ _ O
raw _ _ O
radishes _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
snap _ _ B-FOOD
peas _ _ I-FOOD
tugged _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
unexpected, _ _ O
intriguing _ _ O
direction _ _ O
by _ _ O
cumin. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
less _ _ O
expected _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
cinnamon-laced _ _ O
raz _ _ O
al _ _ O
hanout _ _ O
spice _ _ O
blend _ _ O
dusted _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
bistro-style _ _ O
fries. _ _ O
More _ _ O
brushes _ _ O
with _ _ O
North _ _ O
Africa _ _ O
lay _ _ O
ahead. _ _ O
Claudette _ _ O
makes _ _ O
an _ _ O
unleavened, _ _ O
layered _ _ O
flatbread, _ _ O
similar _ _ O
to _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
kesra, _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
good _ _ O
when _ _ O
hot _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
griddle, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
thick _ _ O
smear _ _ O
of _ _ O
pistou. _ _ O
(I _ _ O
couldn't _ _ O
see _ _ O
the _ _ O
point _ _ O
of _ _ O
another _ _ O
spread, _ _ O
the _ _ O
bland _ _ O
and _ _ O
expensive _ _ O
hummus _ _ O
with _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
truffles.) _ _ O
Gradually, _ _ O
it _ _ O
becomes _ _ O
clear _ _ O
that _ _ O
Claudette's _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Wade _ _ O
Moises, _ _ O
and _ _ O
chef _ _ O
de _ _ O
cuisine, _ _ O
Koren _ _ O
Grieveson, _ _ O
have _ _ O
made _ _ O
a _ _ O
smart _ _ O
decision _ _ O
about _ _ O
Provence. _ _ O
Rather _ _ O
than _ _ O
treating _ _ O
it _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
were _ _ O
frozen _ _ O
in _ _ O
time _ _ O
and _ _ O

"A _ _ O

in _ _ O

repeated _ _ O
forever _ _ O
-- _ _ O
they _ _ O
cast _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
glances _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
North _ _ O
African _ _ O
immigrants _ _ O
who _ _ O
live _ _ O
and _ _ O
cook _ _ O
there. _ _ O
Claudette's _ _ O
owners, _ _ O
Carlos _ _ O
Suarez _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mark _ _ O
Barak, _ _ O
were _ _ O
traveling _ _ O
in _ _ O
Provence _ _ O
when, _ _ O
like _ _ O
many _ _ O
English-speaking _ _ O
tourists, _ _ O
they _ _ O
fell _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
sunny _ _ O
spell _ _ O
of _ _ O
Lourmarin. _ _ O
They _ _ O
had _ _ O
a _ _ O
charmed _ _ O
meal _ _ O
in _ _ O
that _ _ O
town _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
founded _ _ O
by _ _ O
Claudette _ _ O
Sammut, _ _ O
a _ _ O
Frenchwoman _ _ O
who _ _ O
lived _ _ O
in _ _ O
Tunisia _ _ O
until _ _ O
the _ _ O
1950s. _ _ O
Before _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
over, _ _ O
they _ _ O
had _ _ O
asked _ _ O
her _ _ O
family _ _ O
if _ _ O
they _ _ O
could _ _ O
take _ _ O
her _ _ O
name _ _ O
back _ _ O
to _ _ O
Manhattan. _ _ O
They _ _ O
brought _ _ O
her _ _ O
bouillabaisse, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
an _ _ O
eccentric _ _ O
white _ _ O
version _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
puff-pastry _ _ O
hat _ _ O
and _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
juice _ _ O
but _ _ O
no _ _ O
tomatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
an _ _ O
undetectable _ _ O
quantity _ _ O
of _ _ O
saffron. _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
not _ _ O
as _ _ O
smitten _ _ O
by _ _ O
its _ _ O
tenaciously _ _ O
sour _ _ O
broth _ _ O
as _ _ O
they _ _ O
were. _ _ O
As _ _ O
a _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
monkfish, _ _ O
baby _ _ O
octopus _ _ O
and _ _ O
shellfish, _ _ O
it _ _ O
might _ _ O
get _ _ O
by, _ _ O
but _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
soup, _ _ O
it _ _ O
lost _ _ O
its _ _ O
appeal _ _ O
after _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
spoonfuls, _ _ O
and _ _ O
even _ _ O
sooner _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
oversalted. _ _ O
A _ _ O
somewhat _ _ O
more _ _ O
successful _ _ O
souvenir _ _ O
from _ _ O
Lourmarin _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
pieds _ _ O
paquets. _ _ O
Traditionally _ _ O
an _ _ O
all-day _ _ O
stew _ _ O
of _ _ O
sheep's _ _ O
trotters _ _ O
and _ _ O
tripe, _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
de-trottered _ _ O
for _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers. _ _ O
Or, _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
server _ _ O
with _ _ O
an _ _ O
oratorical _ _ O
flair _ _ O
put _ _ O
it, _ _ O
"we _ _ O
absented _ _ O
the _ _ O
feet _ _ O
for _ _ O
cleanliness _ _ O
of _ _ O
flavor." _ _ O
What _ _ O
we _ _ O
get _ _ O
instead _ _ O
are _ _ O
tripe-wrapped _ _ O
bundles _ _ O
of _ _ O
pork _ _ O
shoulder _ _ O
braised _ _ O
in _ _ O
white _ _ O
wine _ _ O
and _ _ O
tomatoes. _ _ O
Tender _ _ O
but _ _ O
polite, _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
upstaged _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
bread, _ _ O
fantastic _ _ O
when _ _ O
dunked _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
expanse _ _ O
of _ _ O
rust-colored _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
As _ _ O
the _ _ O
absented _ _ O
feet _ _ O
suggest, _ _ O
Claudette's _ _ O
exploration _ _ O
of _ _ O
Provence _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
undercut _ _ O
by _ _ O
its _ _ O
impulse _ _ O
to _ _ O
play _ _ O
it _ _ O
safe, _ _ O
to _ _ O
water _ _ O
down _ _ O
the _ _ O
pastis. _ _ O
Braised _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
thighs _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
bed _ _ O
of _ _ O
nutty _ _ O
toasted _ _ O
bulgur _ _ O
arrive _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
tagine, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
aren't _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
in _ _ O
one. _ _ O
When _ _ O
servers _ _ O
lift _ _ O
the _ _ O
glazed _ _ O
lid, _ _ O
the _ _ O
mint _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
aromatics _ _ O
don't _ _ O
rush _ _ O
into _ _ O
your _ _ O
lungs _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
they _ _ O
would _ _ O
in _ _ O
Tangier. _ _ O
The _ _ O
tiny _ _ O
dab _ _ O
of _ _ O
harissa _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
go _ _ O
far, _ _ O
either. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
is _ _ O
moist _ _ O
and _ _ O
well _ _ O
browned, _ _ O
the _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
gets _ _ O
sunny _ _ O
Mediterranean _ _ O
sweetness _ _ O
from _ _ O
oranges, _ _ O
and _ _ O
for _ _ O
complexity _ _ O
and _ _ O
originality, _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
leaves _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
shade. _ _ O
After _ _ O
making _ _ O
its _ _ O
opening _ _ O
moves _ _ O
so _ _ O
gracefully, _ _ O
Claudette _ _ O
grows _ _ O
oddly _ _ O
clumsy _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
end. _ _ O
The _ _ O
most _ _ O
reliable _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
pistachio _ _ O
cake _ _ O
sandwiching _ _ O
a _ _ O
layer _ _ O
of _ _ O
citrus _ _ O
cream, _ _ O
smartly _ _ O
accompanied _ _ O
by _ _ O
candied _ _ O
orange _ _ O
peel. _ _ O
But _ _ O
a _ _ O
chocolate _ _ O
pot _ _ O
de _ _ O
crème _ _ O
with _ _ O
harissa _ _ O
was _ _ O
grainy, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
supposed _ _ O
bread _ _ O
pudding _ _ O
of _ _ O
chocolate-almond _ _ O
croissants _ _ O
looked _ _ O
and _ _ O
tasted _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
stack _ _ O
of _ _ O
stale _ _ O
pastries. _ _ O
Most _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
time, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
does _ _ O
what _ _ O
it _ _ O
sets _ _ O
out _ _ O
to _ _ O
do, _ _ O
even _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
holding _ _ O
back. _ _ O
If _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Moises _ _ O
and _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Grieveson _ _ O
choose _ _ O
to _ _ O
dive _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
deeper _ _ O
into _ _ O
their _ _ O
vision _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
African-tinged _ _ O
Provence, _ _ O
they _ _ O
could _ _ O
make _ _ O
the _ _ O
Gallic _ _ O
revival _ _ O
more _ _ O
interesting _ _ O
by _ _ O
cleaning _ _ O
the _ _ O
dusty _ _ O
windows _ _ O
of _ _ O
nostalgia _ _ O
through _ _ O
which _ _ O
New _ _ O

like _ _ O
to _ _ O
view _ _ O
French _ _ O

(Known _ _ O

At _ _ O
Sammy's, _ _ B-EST
the _ _ O
meat _ _ B-FOOD
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
cooked. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
something _ _ O

in _ _ O

if _ _ O
you _ _ O
want _ _ O
it _ _ O
medium _ _ O
or _ _ O
black _ _ O
and _ _ O
blue, _ _ O
then _ _ O
write _ _ O
your _ _ O
request _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
sheet _ _ O
of _ _ O
paper, _ _ O
tear _ _ O
it _ _ O
into _ _ O
small _ _ O
pieces _ _ O
and _ _ O
throw _ _ O
them _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
air _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
piano _ _ O
player _ _ O
sings _ _ O
"Happy _ _ O

Two _ _ O
times _ _ O
I _ _ O
asked _ _ O
for _ _ O
garlic-smeared _ _ B-FOOD
skirt _ _ I-FOOD
steak, _ _ I-FOOD
called _ _ O
Romanian _ _ B-DISH
tenderloin _ _ I-DISH
at _ _ O
Sammy's, _ _ B-EST
cooked _ _ O
medium _ _ O
rare. _ _ O
One _ _ O
steak _ _ O
arrived _ _ O
medium _ _ O
well, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
time _ _ O
a _ _ O
single _ _ O
steak _ _ O
ranged _ _ O
from _ _ O
well _ _ O
done _ _ O
to _ _ O
bloody, _ _ O
and _ _ O
every _ _ O
degree _ _ O
in _ _ O
between. _ _ O
I _ _ O
wasn't _ _ O
asked _ _ O
how _ _ O
I _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
a _ _ O
broiled _ _ B-DISH
veal _ _ I-DISH
chop. _ _ I-DISH
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
seared _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
outside _ _ O
and _ _ O
raw _ _ O
inside, _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
other _ _ O

tuna. _ _ B-FOOD
When _ _ O
nobody _ _ O
asked _ _ O
how _ _ O
I _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
sweetbreads _ _ B-FOOD
broiled, _ _ O
I _ _ O
feared _ _ O
the _ _ O
worst. _ _ O
Another _ _ O
surprise: _ _ O
Scored _ _ O
and _ _ O
blackened _ _ O
on _ _ O
top, _ _ O
they _ _ O
were _ _ O
close _ _ O
to _ _ O
perfect. _ _ O
The _ _ O
servers _ _ O
follow _ _ O
a _ _ O
template _ _ O
unique _ _ O
to _ _ O
this _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
dressed _ _ O
in _ _ O
Sammy's _ _ B-EST
T-shirts _ _ O
and _ _ O
jeans _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
dishrag _ _ O
swinging _ _ O
from _ _ O
one _ _ O
pocket. _ _ O
Speed _ _ O
trumps _ _ O
ceremony. _ _ O
Standing _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
metal _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
chopped _ _ B-FOOD
liver, _ _ I-FOOD
they _ _ O
pour _ _ O
a _ _ O
cascade _ _ O
of _ _ O
schmaltz _ _ B-FOOD
from _ _ O
on _ _ O
high, _ _ O
go _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
liver _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
forks _ _ O
to _ _ O
mix _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
shredded _ _ O
radishes, _ _ B-FOOD
fried _ _ B-FOOD
onions _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
lumps _ _ O
of _ _ O

chicken _ _ I-FOOD

and _ _ O
do _ _ O
not _ _ O
necessarily _ _ O
notice _ _ O
the _ _ O

bits _ _ O
that _ _ O
escape _ _ O
the _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
and _ _ O
land _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O

The _ _ O
ritual _ _ O
ends, _ _ O
not _ _ O
with _ _ O
"bon _ _ O
appétit" _ _ O
or _ _ O
"enjoy _ _ O
your _ _ O
meal" _ _ O
but _ _ O
with, _ _ O
"O.K., _ _ O

The _ _ O

of _ _ O
waiting _ _ O
tables _ _ O
at _ _ O
Lower _ _ B-LOC

Jewish _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurants, _ _ O
by _ _ O
turns _ _ O
cranky, _ _ O
funny _ _ O
and _ _ O
crankily _ _ O
funny _ _ O
(discerning _ _ O
one _ _ O
from _ _ O
another _ _ O
could _ _ O
take _ _ O
decades _ _ O
of _ _ O
practice) _ _ O
probably _ _ O
died _ _ O
with _ _ O
Ratner's, _ _ B-EST
but _ _ O
flashes _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
still _ _ O
surface _ _ O
at _ _ O
Sammy's. _ _ B-EST
One _ _ O
night, _ _ O
when _ _ O
we _ _ O
kept _ _ O
asking _ _ O
our _ _ O
server _ _ O
if _ _ O
we'd _ _ O
ordered _ _ O
enough, _ _ O
he _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
his _ _ O
eyes, _ _ O
checked _ _ O
his _ _ O
watch _ _ O
and _ _ O
said, _ _ O
"Tell _ _ O
you _ _ O
what: _ _ O
If _ _ O
you're _ _ O
still _ _ O
hungry, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Chinese _ _ B-CUISINE
food _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
here _ _ O
at _ _ O
9:30." _ _ O
Hungry _ _ O
we _ _ O
weren't. _ _ O
As _ _ O
always _ _ O
at _ _ O
Sammy's, _ _ B-EST
I _ _ O
walked _ _ O
out _ _ O
feeling _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
eaten _ _ O
a _ _ O
football _ _ O
stuffed _ _ O
with _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-FOOD
fat _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
beef. _ _ B-FOOD
The _ _ O
kitchen, _ _ O
so _ _ O
unpredictable _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
comes _ _ O
to _ _ O
meat _ _ O
temperatures, _ _ O
is _ _ O
absolutely _ _ O
consistent _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
ability _ _ O
to _ _ O
produce _ _ O
starch _ _ O
that _ _ O
detonates _ _ O
inside _ _ O
the _ _ O
stomach. _ _ O
The _ _ O
fried _ _ B-DISH
kreplach _ _ I-DISH
are _ _ O
grenades _ _ O
of _ _ O
dough _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
tiny _ _ O
core _ _ O
of _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
meat _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
tastes _ _ O
like _ _ O
dough, _ _ B-FOOD
too. _ _ O
The _ _ O
latkes _ _ B-DISH
are _ _ O
flavorless _ _ O
and _ _ O
textureless, _ _ O
but _ _ O
not _ _ O
weightless. _ _ O
Better _ _ O
than _ _ O
either, _ _ O
the _ _ O
kishke _ _ B-DISH
could _ _ O
stand _ _ O
some _ _ O
gravy _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
some _ _ O
salt. _ _ B-FOOD
In _ _ O
fact, _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
exception _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
grandmotherly _ _ O
sweet-and-sour _ _ B-DISH
stuffed _ _ I-DISH
cabbage, _ _ I-DISH
almost _ _ O
everything _ _ O
at _ _ O
Sammy's _ _ B-EST
needed _ _ O
salt. _ _ B-FOOD
Once _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
added _ _ O
freely, _ _ O
the _ _ O
chopped _ _ B-DISH
liver _ _ I-DISH
was _ _ O
beyond _ _ O
reproach, _ _ O
the _ _ O
skirt _ _ B-DISH
steaks _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
lamb _ _ B-DISH
chops _ _ I-DISH
were _ _ O
excellent, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
fried _ _ B-DISH
silver-dollar _ _ I-DISH
potatoes _ _ I-DISH
were _ _ O
worth _ _ O
talking _ _ O
about. _ _ O
I _ _ O
can't _ _ O
figure _ _ O
out _ _ O
why _ _ O
Sammy's _ _ B-EST

cutting _ _ O
back _ _ O
on _ _ O

after _ _ O
all _ _ O

for _ _ O

of _ _ O

The _ _ O
last _ _ O
review _ _ O
of _ _ O
Sammy's _ _ B-DISH
in _ _ O
The _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
Times, _ _ O
written _ _ O
by _ _ O
Mimi _ _ O
Sheraton _ _ O
in _ _ O
1982, _ _ O
praised _ _ O
the _ _ O
Romanian _ _ B-DISH
salad _ _ I-DISH
of _ _ I-DISH
whipped _ _ I-DISH
eggplant _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
green _ _ I-DISH
peppers; _ _ I-DISH
the _ _ O
broiled _ _ B-DISH
brains; _ _ I-DISH
the _ _ O
mush _ _ B-DISH
steak; _ _ I-DISH
the _ _ O
pitcha, _ _ B-DISH
a _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
gelatin _ _ B-FOOD
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
calves' _ _ B-FOOD
feet _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
garlic; _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
baked _ _ B-DISH
unborn _ _ I-DISH
eggs. _ _ I-DISH
The _ _ O
recent _ _ O
menus, _ _ O
stapled _ _ O
inside _ _ O
manila _ _ O
folders _ _ O
as _ _ O
they _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
since _ _ O
the _ _ O
Koch _ _ O
administration, _ _ O
haven't _ _ O
offered _ _ O
any _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O
specialties. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
how _ _ O
a _ _ O
culture _ _ O
disappears. _ _ O
But _ _ O
if _ _ O
Romania _ _ B-LOC
has _ _ O
faded, _ _ O
Sammy's _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
loudly, _ _ O
raucously, _ _ O
endlessly, _ _ O
embracingly _ _ O
Jewish, _ _ B-CUISINE
a _ _ O
permanent _ _ O
underground _ _ O
bar _ _ O
mitzvah _ _ O
where _ _ O
Gentiles _ _ O
can _ _ O
act _ _ O
like _ _ O
Jews _ _ O
and _ _ O
Jews _ _ O
can _ _ O
act _ _ O
like _ _ O
themselves. _ _ O
One _ _ O
night, _ _ O
I _ _ O
went _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
woman _ _ O
who _ _ O
had _ _ O
spent _ _ O
the _ _ O
summer _ _ O
in _ _ O
Europe, _ _ B-LOC
as _ _ O
synagogues _ _ O
and _ _ O
Jewish-owned _ _ O
shops _ _ O
burned _ _ O
in _ _ O
one _ _ O
city _ _ O
after _ _ O
another. _ _ O
In _ _ O
Sammy's _ _ B-EST
basement, _ _ O
when _ _ O
strangers _ _ O
joined _ _ O
their _ _ O
hands _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
air _ _ O
and _ _ O
danced _ _ O
between _ _ O
the _ _ O
tables, _ _ O
eyeing _ _ O
our _ _ O
food _ _ O
as _ _ O
they _ _ O
passed, _ _ O
I _ _ O
could _ _ O
see _ _ O
her _ _ O
grow _ _ O
less _ _ O
tense _ _ O
every _ _ O
minute. _ _ O
"It _ _ O
feels _ _ O
so _ _ O
good _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
back _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
place _ _ O
where _ _ O
I _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
out," _ _ O
she _ _ O
finally _ _ O
said. _ _ O
And _ _ O
if _ _ O
this _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
your _ _ O
heritage _ _ O
-- _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
aren't _ _ O
quite _ _ O
sure _ _ O
what _ _ O
is _ _ O
happening _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
man _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
keyboard _ _ O
belts _ _ O
out _ _ O
"Sing _ _ O
us _ _ O
a _ _ O
song, _ _ O
you're _ _ O
the _ _ O
schmatte _ _ O
man" _ _ O
-- _ _ O
the _ _ O
entertainers _ _ O
at _ _ O
Sammy's _ _ B-EST
will _ _ O
still _ _ O
get _ _ O
to _ _ O
you. _ _ O
Dancing _ _ O
and _ _ O
singing _ _ O
along _ _ O
to _ _ O
some _ _ O
dumb _ _ O
old _ _ O
tune _ _ O
being _ _ O
played _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
musician _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
corner: _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
how _ _ O
people _ _ O
had _ _ O
fun _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Old _ _ B-LOC
World, _ _ I-LOC
by _ _ O
which _ _ O
I _ _ O
don't _ _ O
mean _ _ O
just _ _ O
the _ _ O
parts _ _ O
of _ _ O
Europe _ _ B-LOC
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
Lower _ _ B-LOC
East _ _ I-LOC
Side's _ _ I-LOC
Jews _ _ O
came _ _ O
from, _ _ O
but _ _ O
also _ _ O
the _ _ O
world _ _ O
before _ _ O
amplifiers _ _ O
and _ _ O
apps _ _ O
and _ _ O
first-person-shooter _ _ O
video _ _ O
games _ _ O
and _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
forms _ _ O
of _ _ O
entertainment _ _ O
that _ _ O
drive _ _ O
us _ _ O
into _ _ O
ourselves. _ _ O
Sammy's _ _ B-EST
forces _ _ O
you _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
yourself; _ _ O
I _ _ O
don't _ _ O
think _ _ O
there's _ _ O
another _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
where _ _ O
people _ _ O
talk _ _ O
to _ _ O
strangers _ _ O
as _ _ O
readily _ _ O
as _ _ O
they _ _ O
do _ _ O
here. _ _ O
"Would _ _ O
you _ _ O
like _ _ O
me _ _ O
to _ _ O
take _ _ O
your _ _ O
picture?" _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
next _ _ O
table _ _ O
asked _ _ O
one _ _ O
night. _ _ O
"Do _ _ O
you _ _ O
want _ _ O
our _ _ O
seltzer _ _ O
charger _ _ O
for _ _ O
your _ _ O
egg _ _ B-DISH
creams?" _ _ I-DISH
another _ _ O
asked _ _ O
us. _ _ O
As _ _ O
a _ _ O
table _ _ O
of _ _ O
about _ _ O
two _ _ O
dozen _ _ O
people _ _ O
filed _ _ O
out, _ _ O
a _ _ O
woman _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
back _ _ O
called _ _ O
to _ _ O
them, _ _ O
"Thank _ _ O
you _ _ O
for _ _ O
dancing _ _ O
with _ _ O
us!" _ _ O
Is _ _ O
this _ _ O
a _ _ O
three-star _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
as _ _ O
Mimi _ _ O
Sheraton _ _ O
thought _ _ O
in _ _ O
1982? _ _ O
By _ _ O
today's _ _ O
standards, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course _ _ O
not. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
closer _ _ O
to _ _ O
one. _ _ O
But _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
need _ _ O
stars _ _ O
to _ _ O
tell _ _ O
you _ _ O
what _ _ O
to _ _ O
think _ _ O
of _ _ O
Sammy's, _ _ B-EST
I'm _ _ O
not _ _ O
sure _ _ O
I _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
share _ _ O
my _ _ O
seltzer _ _ O
charger _ _ O
with _ _ O
you. _ _ O
I'll _ _ O
give _ _ O
it _ _ O
to _ _ O
those _ _ O
nice _ _ O
North _ _ O
Korean _ _ O
Jews _ _ O
instead. _ _ O

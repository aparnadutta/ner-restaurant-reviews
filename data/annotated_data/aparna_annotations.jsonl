{"id": 22, "data": " Nothing about the appearance of the Cornish game hen at Blue Smoke screams, \"I am the best thing you will eat today!\" It looks a bit like a deflated football that somebody punctured with a pair of sticks and dragged through the mud. In fact, in Blue Smoke's attempt to bring together the barbecued game hen of Cozy Corner , in Memphis, with the fried hot chicken of places like Prince's, in Nashville, the bird has been through a good deal more than that. The process goes like this, approximately : spatchcocked, brined, rubbed with spices, smoked, chilled, dunked in a frothy batter, tossed in seasoned flour, deep fried, dipped in spicy oil and sprinkled with four kinds of ground pepper. \"Just a little pop-pop dust right on top\" is how Jean-Paul Bourgeois, Blue Smoke's chef, describes the last step. \"That introduction of fresh chile onto that fried chicken, it just brings the zing.\" Then came one final touch, he said: \"a little swirlybird of Tabasco hot honey.\" Handily, this can all be shortened to smoked, fried hen when you order ($24 at the Battery Park City location and $26 on East 27th Street). But you'll know there's more to it when your jaw smashes through the dark crust with a sonic boom; when the particular forms of heat contributed by habanero, black pepper, Sichuan peppercorn, Aleppo pepper, cayenne and Tabasco sauce all start to pile up and reverberate like My Bloody Valentine guitar chords ; when the meat gives up juices that swirl with wood smoke.

{"id": 23, "data": " Lately I have fallen under the spell of an East Village restaurant called Foxface . The cooking there is hard to pin down, geographically. Stopping in a few weeks ago, I ate Low Countryish wild red shrimp on grits, with sweet corn off the cob and a potent saffron-lobster sauce. More recently, I had skinless pork sausage inspired by sai ua, the spicy and tangy specialty identified with the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai. The soft tripe I enjoyed the other weekend had been simmered with 'nduja, the fiery and malleable Calabrian sausage, and then covered with a few thin shingles of shaved pecorino. If I had started hanging around at Foxface sooner, especially during the cold months after its opening, in February, I might have run into a wider variety of cuisines and main ingredients. I did manage to get some of the elk osso buco while that was still on the menu. I never got to try the wild hare, though, stewed in red wine with a bit of chocolate and thickened with its own blood, a formula that students of very old-guard French cooking will recognize as lièvre à la royale. Nor did I make it in time for the venison, left to bubble for hours in white wine with mushrooms and dark juniper berries. The Foxface dish I may never forgive myself for missing, though, is the kebabs served with preserved lemons and tahini, because the kebabs were made from ground lamb and camel. Although these foods may lack any unifying cultural background, they did have one thing in common: They were all served on rolls. Apart from an occasional salad or soup, everything cooked at Foxface arrives in sandwich form. And with the exception of a muffuletta that briefly manifested a few months back, every sandwich at Foxface is filled with hot, cooked meat or seafood or vegetables. In Mexico, certain taco stands specialize in tacos de guisado, tortillas filled with one kind of stew or another. Most of Foxface's offerings are, in effect, sandwiches de guisado. Which reminds me of another impressive Foxface sandwich, a magenta and green tangle of cilantro stems and pickled onions pressed into an engagingly tart pile of pork, marinated in sour orange juice and roasted very slowly under a banana leaf in emulation of cochinita pibil from the Yucatán. There is no guarantee that any of these items will be available when you go to Foxface. The menu is printed daily and taped up next to the window on St. Marks Place where most of the business is transacted. Sometimes a new sandwich appears after the printed menu has already been posted, so it will be written out by hand on a card that has in its upper left corner the restaurant's logo, a drawing of an elegant fox in cat's-eye glasses with a cigarette holder in one gloved hand. The sandwiches have names like It's What's 'Nside (for the tripe with 'nduja) or 120 BPM (bison heart with tahini and \"many spices\"). The Smoking Fox is sold every day. It is filled with smoked pork rib the color of a dry rosé, separated from the bones and covered with coleslaw, pickles and a few splashes of habanero-orange vinegar. Your mind, of course, goes either to Memphis or to the McRib , and neither is exactly wrong, but the meat is of a superior grade and is smoked with the attention to timing and nuance that characterizes Foxface's cooking. It's a great sandwich. To place an order, you lean in to the window and speak with Sivan Lahat, who owns and runs Foxface with Ori Kushnir, her partner in life and in sandwiches. They immigrated to New York from Israel almost 20 years ago and have lived here ever since, apart from a brief flirtation with the Midwest and a longer experimental period in Tokyo. While they were in Japan, they operated a pop-up restaurant, which is the closest either of them came to running a food business before opening Foxface. Like the fox in the logo, Ms. Lahat has coppery hair and wears cat's-eye glasses. She prepares the orders in the room behind the window, which measures 48 square feet. Inside the building, under the stairs, Foxface has a second room. Mr. Kushnir thinks it could be as large as 14 square feet. A variety of equipment is stowed in the two rooms, including three induction burners, a roaster, a smoker and a dishwasher. After business hours, some of it comes out as Mr. Kushnir supervises the more time-consuming roasts and stews. He describes the food that he and Ms. Lahat cook as \"dishes we like to eat, reimagined as sandwiches.\" I like to eat a lot of the same dishes, as it happens, but they have been hard to come by lately, especially those shapeless brown stews that are so out of style. Following some of the world's most influential chefs and shamed, perhaps, by the unflattering lenses of a million amateur photographers, restaurants have shifted away from plain and plain-looking cooking. The subtlety and the thrill of plain cooking comes from searing, simmering, reducing, skimming and so on. All the people who own Instant Pots know this, but the segment of the restaurant scene with artistic leanings has forgotten it, focusing instead on plating, arranging six or seven things in some photogenic design and hoping they will cohere. Slapping a roll on it is one way to get a shapeless brown stew ready for its close-up, although it has to be said that on the mean streets of Instagram, an elk osso buco sandwich is no match for a rainbow unicorn ice cream sundae. Because space is at a premium, there is no room to sit and eat your Smoking Fox at Foxface itself. You can, however, take it to a table a few steps away inside an adjoining business called the William Barnacle Tavern . This is a reassuringly gloomy bar that is said to have originated as a speakeasy. Model ships and other nautical paraphernalia are strewn about, references to the rumrunning operation a former owner of the building presided over during Prohibition. (The stairs that Foxface's dishwasher is housed below lead to an exhibition space called the Museum of the American Gangster .) The bar's current owner has resisted some modern conveniences. Most of the lighting at night comes from small candles, and all of the music is provided by old films -- of Irish folk recitals, Cab Calloway concerts -- that run in looping, watery projections on the back wall. All Foxface sandwiches are presented in a trim little white box that can be unfolded into a place mat. You can purchase an Italian fruit soda for $3 from Foxface, or buy alcohol from the tavern. The beer is not expensive, but the specialty of the house is absinthe. Most patrons drink theirs diluted with ice water poured from a four-spigot absinthe fountain at the end of the bar. The bartender will make absinthe cocktails, too, including the one Ernest Hemingway supposedly invented that is just absinthe and Champagne in a big glass . He called it Death in the Afternoon, and it is what I intend to drink if I ever get my hands on that camel sandwich.

{"id": 24, "data": " I'm starting to think the American cult of chef worship may really be on the way out. At the very least, it has paused to catch its breath. Since the seven-story food court in Hudson Yards was unveiled last month, the public reaction has been somewhere between shrug and ugh. Attitudes may improve as visitors eat their way to the top floor. So far, though, the response hasn't come close to matching the greeting bestowed on the restaurants at Time Warner Center in 2004, even though the project represents the same basic idea executed by the same developer with at least one of the same chefs, Thomas Keller . Even more striking has been the low-key reception to Rocco DiSpirito's return. Late last year Mr. DiSpirito took over the kitchen at Standard Grill in the meatpacking district. At one point, when he was the chef at both Union Pacific and Rocco's on 22nd while starring in a television show, he was arguably the most famous chef in the country. Then both places closed, and the show was canceled. Mr. DiSpirito has not been in charge of a restaurant since George W. Bush was in the White House. For that matter, it has been some years since Standard Grill itself has done anything noteworthy. In 2009, when it was new and Dan Silverman was the chef, I reviewed it, gave it one star and then lost track of it. In other words, the selection of Mr. DiSpirito did not just come out of left field. It came from the weeds across the street from the parking lot behind left field. For surprise value alone, it should have been one of the year's most buzzed-about news items. But the trumpets have been muted, and the back handsprings seem to lack a certain bounce. This, at least, is the view from outside the restaurant. Once you're sitting at one of the tables -- newly topped with leather pads in a major retrofitting that has made the dining room look like an expensive cabaret, blue velvet and all -- you will hear quite a lot of talk about Mr. DiSpirito, or as they call him here, Chef Rocco. Chef Rocco, you learn, conceived each dish on the menu so that it can be eaten by one person or shared with others. No, I didn't believe it at first, either, but apparently it's true: Rocco DiSpirito invented food. There is also something that servers call Chef Rocco's Game Changing Toast, although sometimes they shorten it to Rocco's Game Changing or simply Game Changing, as in \"Here's a little more Game Changing for you.\" The item in question is a toasted, cracker-thin slice of bread made of nuts, oats, seeds and psyllium-seed husks held together without benefit of wheat flour. Like nearly everything on the menu, it is free of gluten. Being mostly made of browned nuts, it is also delicious. Whether it is truly Rocco's is up for debate. It seems to strongly resemble the Life-Changing Loaf of Bread recipe that Sarah Britton published on her blog, \"My New Roots,\" in 2013, and that appeared on another blog two years later, with minor changes, as Game Changing Nut & Seed Bread . It's one of the items that reflect Mr. DiSpirito's recent obsession with nutrient-dense dietary supplements , although the way it keeps coming up in the servers' patter makes you wonder if Mr. DiSpirito spent too much time as a QVC pitchman. Anyway, somebody-or-other's toast sits under the smoked gravlax, red with beet juice and very silky on its bed of coconut crème fraîche, that Mr. DiSpirito sends out as an amuse. A plate of the toast will also appear if you order the platter of acorn-fed, hand-sliced Ibérico ham or the chilled Maine sea urchins served on the spiky half-shell. Either one will convince you that Mr. DiSpirito knows how to get his hands on raw materials that can stun with almost no assistance. The best things at Standard Grill, and there are quite a lot of them, depend on very good ingredients touched as little as possible. Back in the Union Pacific days, Mr. DiSpirito's interest in East Asian cuisines came out in the form of complex preparations, arcane ingredients and out-of-nowhere juxtapositions. Now he seems to have moved on to the luxury minimalism of an omakase sushi chef, a style that was foreshadowed by the only Union Pacific dish he's brought back, bay scallops and sea urchin with a few throat-searing drops of mustard oil. Standard Grill's ice-cold cubes of bluefin chu-toro stirred with golden osetra caviar, meanwhile, could have come straight out of Masa , while the yellowfin tartare, barely dressed with crushed macadamias and freshly grated wasabi, is like one of the better items at Tetsu . Each night there are half a dozen or so skewers cooked over Japanese charcoal and wheeled to the table on a mini-grill the size of a toaster oven. Speared on a stick might be fantastic small scallops out of Peconic Bay; a feathery mop of maitake mushrooms; buttery chicken livers with barely a hint of bitterness; or firefly squid, a little bigger than a fava bean and grilled whole so they can be swallowed guts and all. Again, the ingredients are exceptional. The skewers look simple enough, but they are all, you learn, brushed with \"a little sauce Chef Rocco came up with to complement the charcoal.\" The sauce for seafood involves coconut nectar and lemongrass, and what it actually does is put you, vaguely and pleasantly, in mind of Thailand. While I am one of those increasingly stooped and wizened diners who remembers, in detail, Mr. DiSpirito's cooking at Union Pacific, far more people recall him as the meatball-pushing antihero of \"The Restaurant,\" an NBC series about Rocco's on 22nd, an actual (and doomed, it turned out) Italian-American restaurant. The show, which debuted in 2003, was a pioneer in the genre of cooking-focused reality television, although when everybody started suing everybody else, it became clear it was a pioneer in the way the members of the Donner Party were pioneers. The handful of Italian dishes at Standard Grill may be meant for \"Restaurant\" fans. Neither of the two pastas showed Mr. DiSpirito at his best, but a chewy risotto with red shrimp and what seemed like half a dozen forms of black truffles may make you understand why Ruth Reichl started her 1998 Times review of Union Pacific with a woman moaning at the next table. Standard Grill's Norwegian salmon on an ivory puddle of vegan cashew sauce won't inspire the same reaction, but the steaks might; they are dry-aged until ripe, and earn their deep-brown crust over extremely hot Japanese charcoal. Given what Mr. DiSpirito is capable of doing with a piece of halibut and some goose fat, I can't quite believe that I'm recommending the rib-eye over the seafood, but I am. It may be that Mr. DiSpirito knows exactly what he is doing. Simplicity is the whole point of a grill, which is first cousin to the steakhouse. He has also designed a menu so straightforward that if, after a respectable period of time, he is no longer in the kitchen, the food quality can stay roughly the same as long as the hotel doesn't argue about ingredient costs. The Standard has not left the restaurant's fate entirely in his hands, either; besides redecorating, it hired a maître d'hôtel, Michael Cecchi-Azzolina, away from Le Coucou ; he is hard at work building an audience every night, handing out old-school business cards to old-school producers, chefs and publishers, sitting down to chat with Brooke Shields and Ms. Reichl. Standard Grill is so much better than it used to be, and so much better than almost any restaurant serving a comparable menu of grilled meats and chilled seafood, that it's foolish to wish for the return of the same Mr. DiSpirito who gave us Union Pacific. It's a little bit as if Barbra Streisand had returned to Broadway, and then sang all her songs in a whisper sitting on the edge of the stage.

{"id": 25, "data": " Looking around Haenyeo's dining room one night in early March, I thought maybe Jenny Kwak's time has finally come. Her third restaurant, Haenyeo was about three months old and already filled with people who looked as if they'd been going there for years. It sits on a prime corner lot, on a stretch of Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that is rich in local minichains serving banh mi, burritos, lobster rolls and so on, to take out or eat in. Intimidating restaurants don't tend to prosper here. Very few people inside Haenyeo look the least bit intimidated as they lift grilled oysters by the shell to pour the dregs of hot seaweed butter over toast; or carve wedges of zucchini-scallion pancakes fried to a dark and satisfyingly rich brown; or stir mushrooms, squid, bean sprouts, steamed spinach and cabbage kimchi with a just-cracked egg into a bibimbap whose bottom layer of rice is golden and crunchy where it meets the hot stone bowl. The customers at Haenyeo seem to have an easy familiarity with Korean food. Some of them, at least, can probably thank Ms. Kwak for that. In 1992, when she began serving the cuisine in the East Village at her first restaurant, Dok Suni's, the words tteokbokki and seolleongtang and jajangmyeon did not roll off the tongues of most non-Koreans. But that's who she wanted to lure in with American music, date-night décor and Western-style service. Once she had them, she would tempt, teach, turn them on to the flavors she'd grown up with. Her mother, Myung Ja Kwak, shared cooking duties. Ms. Kwak's was not the take-it-or-leave-it approach of 32nd Street, and she kept at it. She wrote \"Dok Suni: Recipes From My Mother's Korean Kitchen,\" which was one of the few Korean cookbooks in English when it came out, in 1998. At her second restaurant, Do Hwa, she and her mother led customers deeper into unfamiliar ground. Each of the restaurants stayed open for about two decades, which is a very long time in New York. If you want a metaphor for how effectively Ms. Kwak paved the way for restaurants like Atoboy , Soogil, Danji and others whose chefs weave Korean cuisine into new patterns, consider that one of them, Oiji, moved into its address on First Avenue right after Dok Suni's moved out. What Ms. Kwak is doing in Park Slope isn't all that different from what she has done all her career, except that by now South Korean comfort food has become comfort food for New York in general. Haenyeo does pay more attention to seafood than Dok Suni or Do Hwa did, though. Ms. Kwak hasn't gone pescatarian on us. She still serves impressive pork and beef bulgogis with ssamjang and lettuce, and the pan-fried dumplings are filled with high-fat ground beef seasoned with kimchi, garlic and soy. But her menu's orientation has shifted slightly toward the ocean. This is good news, because the seafood at Haenyeo has a sparkle and sweetness you don't always find in the smoke-filled rooms of 32nd Street. A bibimbap variant may be the menu's sleeper dish, partly because it starts out looking like a lunch bowl from Sweetgreen. It is a version of hwe dup bap. At first you just see raw tuna, shredded romaine and perilla leaves, grated carrots and cucumber, and strips of seaweed. Hidden underneath is warm rice. But there is a pink mound of spicy cod roe in the bowl, too, with cured salmon eggs and a few lobes of sea urchin. Both of them will break apart as you stir, bringing their distinct saltwater intonations to the rice and vegetables. What the menu calls \"white fish fillets\" -- pan-fried cod with rings of scallion showing through their thin gold sheet of egg batter, otherwise known as saeng seon jeon -- is so modestly named it might get overlooked; it shouldn't. The menu plays Don't Mind Me again with \"mackerel, grilled or braised.\" Just get the mackerel, because the kitchen knows how to cook it, whether over a flame or in a dark, smoky pan of garlic and gochujang. In truth, the kitchen seems to know how to cook every kind of seafood, although perhaps it could come with a better partner for the fried scallops than the sweet, yellowish tartar sauce with corn in it. The walls are hung with photographs of Korean women in wet suits. These are the haenyeo of Jeju island , who dive up to 30 feet deep for conch, abalone and seaweed while holding their breath for several minutes at a time. The money they made diving is probably the reason parts of Jeju have a matriarchal family structure. Naming the restaurant after them, Ms. Kwak continues a theme started with Dok Suni's, which means \"strong women's.\" One dish that seems out of place is a revival of Dok Suni's fried chicken. Was the batter always so pasty and airless? That's not how I remember it, but it's possible my standards have changed as Korean fried chicken has infiltrated nearly every part of town over the past decade. In any case, there is better chicken to seek out here, not just the home-style dokdoritang stewed in chile sauce but also the wings. Haenyeo double-fries wings that have been dipped in potato starch, then coats them with a fine version of a yangnyeom chile sauce, tangier and a little less sweet than some. When Ms. Kwak detours from the Korean straight and narrow, consider traipsing along behind her. You may wind up having beignets for dessert, buried under a fresh coat of powdered sugar in the best Café du Monde style. (This and the grilled oysters may betray the hand of her business partner, Terrence Segura, who is from New Orleans. He is also her husband.) Or you may follow her all the way to the joyous rice cake fundido, which starts out as tteokbokki in chile sauce and becomes totally atypical through the addition of chorizo, sliced jalapeños and a melted, browned topcoat of Oaxacan cheese that comes up in long, stretchy strings when you pull on it. It is, in all likelihood, the best Tex-Mex dish in New York. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 26, "data": " In 2012 and 2013, when people were lining up at Smorgasburg and then on the second floor of the Houston Street Whole Foods Market for biodegradable bowls of Yuji Haraguchi's mazemen -- noodles that might be dressed with crisped twigs of bacon and a jiggling onsen egg, say, or yuzu-cured salmon and some Camembert soft enough to transform into a sauce -- I was sure the crowds would multiply and fan out, demanding more of this strange brothless ramen. And they did, in a sense. Soon Mr. Haraguchi had established his own free-standing establishment, Yuji Ramen in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where he serves that bacon-and-egg mazemen along with his possibly visionary \"tunakotsu\" ramen. In 2014, when Ivan Orkin came to New York , he brought along his own mazemen recipes. Over the next few years mazemen turned up in other restaurants, too, but all of them remained better known for soup ramen, and sold more of it. It began to look as if mazemen would never be more than a sideshow act, the one-armed ax-catcher of the ramen circus. Then at the start of the year, the chef Shigetoshi Nakamura, who operates an intimate ramen shop on the Lower East Side, opened an annex next door that is dedicated to mazemen. All the seating at this new place, Niche , is at a dozen or so stools arranged around one long, narrow table. When the dining room is fully occupied, the only way to get from one end to the other is to walk sideways while holding your breath and picking up all the coats that you are going to knock off their wall pegs as you go. Not that there is much reason to roam around. Orders are taken from and delivered to the table, and there is no public restroom on the premises. As is the case next door at Nakamura, seats by the window offer a close-up view of the stone walls that support the last few yards of the Williamsburg Bridge before it empties onto Delancey Street. Before he came to New York, Mr. Nakamura was already well known in Tokyo, where he proved to have a theatrical streak. Before filling a bowl with noodles, he would yank them from the boiling water with his left hand and then hold them high in the air for a few seconds, letting them drain while standing completely motionless. Suddenly he would drop his arm and the basket would plunge toward the water again, before stopping just in time and getting one quick, emphatic shake. When Mr. Nakamura was immortalized as one of four \"ramen gods\" in a set of Hello Kitty notepads and phone straps, Kitty was posed with her left paw raised high in emulation of the Nakamura Shake. If Mr. Nakamura has been practicing his choreography on the spaghetti-like, crinkly noodles at Niche, I haven't seen it yet. The Nakamura Shake seems designed to extract cooking water as quickly as possible before the noodles cool, and temperature is not especially critical in mazemen. The idea of noodle soup without the soup has been on the loose in Japan for decades. Broth is the most expensive and labor-intensive part of a bowl of ramen; in the 1950s, a Tokyo noodle shop, in the pitiless logic of the restaurant business, began omitting the broth when ladling out noodles at staff meals, or so the story goes. This \"abura soba\" -- oil noodle, because it was moistened with lard along with the seasoning sauce called tare -- wasn't half bad, so it went on the menu at a discounted price. As an even cheaper version of an already cheap and filling meal, abura soba was quickly embraced, especially by students. As food ideas tend to do in Japan, it evolved rapidly. Today, abura soba tends to refer to dry soups that have more or less the same toppings you'd find in a bowl of normal ramen, while mazemen generally has toppings that are rarely seen in soup and often would not respond well to being submerged in hot liquid. There is Italian-style mazemen, with anchovies, salami, olives and tomatoes. Some mazemen shops specialize in fried beef cutlets. At a Tokyo restaurant called Beefst , the centerpiece of each bowl is sliced roast beef, served rare. Mr. Nakamura has an answer to that: steak mazemen. The steak is rib-eye, in cubes that have been browned with a kitchen torch. When you stir them with the noodles and a smooth, creamy spoonful of something the menu simply calls \"pork sauce,\" their juices and flecks of char flavor the whole bowl. Plain spinach and fermented bamboo, meanwhile, keep the total effect from being queasy-making. Novel, straightforward, refined, unruly and impure of heart, steak mazemen has the makings of a classic New York dish. So does the duck, a common special. A sliced breast of moulard duck cooked to a deep violet-pink, it is served with a bright, focused sauce built on soy and enough warm duck juices to lubricate the whole-wheat noodles. It is not an austere dish by any means, but it is balanced and restrained. The same cannot be said for another special that is always offered on the same nights: a bowl of liquefied foie gras topped with pistachios and truffle oil. It is not clear what will happen to anyone who tries to eat this with a spoon, but the prognosis does not seem good. Instead, everybody orders it with the duck mazemen and dips the noodles into the foie gras, after which conscious thought tends to stop for a minute or two. When cerebral activity resumes, you might wonder why the sauce doesn't come with its own noodles. No other mazemen is such a joy ride, but the vaguely Italian one with tomatoes, mushrooms, kombu and an angry red soak of chile oil is not the kind of thing you want to turn your back on. Even the tribute to Russ & Daughters , where the noodles are coated with spicy cod roe and the topping is sliced smoked salmon, can sneak up on you. Niche is one of the few ramen-yas in town where the appetizers are worth noticing. Sea urchin perched on tiny corners of toast is a strange and awkward affair, but the sardines on toast, dressed with chile flakes, are very good, as are the raw scallops with yuzu juice and the avocado salad showered with tempura flakes. Should fries be an appetizer? Maybe not, particularly Niche's \"umami kombu fries,\" which have been sprinkled with powdered shio kombu until they are almost subliminally green. Apart from the color, they look like the fries at McDonald's. The difference is that the shio kombu makes them almost diabolically hard to stop eating. And if you don't eat them before the mazemen arrives, then when will you? Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 27, "data": " If you ate at Spice Market before it closed two years ago, you may experience low-key but persistent flashbacks at Wayan , which set up shop in February on the east end of Spring Street in NoLIta. Again the flavors come from Asia and the methods, generally, from France. Again the far-off tropics are evoked through the play of indirect, dappled light, as if filtered through jungle foliage or a carved wooden screen. Again the presiding culinary sensibility belongs to a Vongerichten. Jean-Georges Vongerichten put together Spice Market in 2004, a confection of teak, silk, vodka, peanut sauce and high heels that brought the Asian Party Temple restaurant genre to its apotheosis. All the earlier examples suddenly seemed fumbling and unsophisticated, and with the possible exception of the Spice Market spinoffs in Qatar and Mexico, the ones that would follow seemed increasingly mindless and out of touch. Interior design that rummages through the musty old trunks of Orientalism doesn't look as alluring as it did 15 years ago, and cooking that filters Asian flavors through a Western sensibility isn't automatically met with gales of excitement. Wayan, where Mr. Vongerichten's son, Cédric, is the chef, avoids both traps, I think. The restaurant is a tribute to Indonesia, the home of his wife and business partner, Ochi Vongerichten, and the site of two restaurants that he opened recently. (He is also the chef of Perry St. in Manhattan, which his father owns.) The scale is more personal and the cultural references are more specific at Wayan than at Spice Market and its kind. The menu is far from encyclopedic, but it is clear that Indonesia's cuisine has been given more than the quick glance that informs a lot of Asian fusion. Ms. Vongerichten works in the dining room, stopping by tables to offer explanations of the menu and how the cooking differs from that at some other Indonesian restaurants in New York, which she cheerfully calls \"more authentic.\" More than any other factor, she helps keep Wayan from turning into a junior version of one of her father-in-law's restaurants -- Young Vongerichtenstein. Servers will tell you to start with a stick or two of satay. You can, although the skewers are cooked on a flattop instead of a grill, and inconsistency is an issue. The pork skewers that are so appealingly juicy and savory with sweet soy one week can be scorched and bitter the next time you see them, and just ordinary the following week. (The pickled watermelon radishes on the side, though, are always terrific; they're brined with lime leaf.) The peanut sauce on chicken satay may hum with red curry and chiles, or may present as a sweet, inert blob. A more promising opening move, and one that will help place Cédric and Ochi Vongerichten's mental map of Indonesia in perspective, would be the Jimbaran-style clams. This is not a dish that is likely to have been stirred by generations of sainted grandmothers since the dawn of time. It is, in fact, a specialty of the seafood vendors who sprang up on a stretch of Balinese beach where resorts first began to appear sometime around the birth of Taylor Swift. Littlenecks, flavored with soy sauce and garlic paste, are grilled under flakes of coconut, which form the golden crust that would be provided by bread crumbs if these were clams oreganata. A slice of pickled red chile sits on each one, waiting. If you were on vacation, you would order tray after tray of these. Here on Spring Street, other things will keep you distracted. In the hearts-of-palm salad, sweet and sour are carefully pitted against each other by means of a mango vinaigrette, a lime-and-fish-sauce dressing and a neon coat of passion-fruit pulp. The crab cake is, despite its sweet chile sauce, about as Indonesian as Betty White, but it is fresh and fluffy and not worth arguing about. Wayan's rendition of the street snack bakwan jagung is a golden agglomeration of corn kernels and shallots fried into a flat, crunchy disc. There had better be nasi goreng at any restaurant that is even playing at being Indonesian. There is, the rice fried just until it crackles a bit between your teeth. It has a gentle but genuine spice undercurrent that would be welcome in more of the cooking. Of course there is a gado gado, and this being 2019, of course the main ingredient is avocado; the hard-cooked eggs belong to quail. This time the peanut dressing isn't cloying or clumpy. As the plates get larger, few dishes really come forward as the kind of knockout that everybody will talk about later. The closest contender must be the lobster and basil with wavy noodles in a sauce containing, among other things, sweet soy and melted butter -- a combination that the senior Mr. Vongerichten has used so successfully that it may be his son's inheritance. Should the calamansi vinaigrette poured over the steamed black sea bass be more sour and spicy? Probably. But if there are few stars on the table, the contrast of flavors, colors, textures and techniques makes the meal into a memorable ensemble piece. The drumsticks in yellow chicken are crunchy, and the thighs are tender; both are mellow with a yellow curry seasoned by lemongrass and ginger. The tomato-chile sambal pressed into the surface of cod \"bilindango\" is potent enough to carry over to the spears of asparagus and fiddlehead ferns sprawled alongside. All of this looks very come-hither in the dining room, where the Rockwell Group has abandoned stadium-size props, building atmospheric effects instead out of contrasting textures and light values and the movement of shadows. This is the visual language of expensive tropical resorts, and Wayan seems to give people the feeling they're on vacation. It is not necessarily a loud restaurant, but New Yorkers are a loud people, and around 10 the noise can start to press down. It is a good time to call for dessert. The purple-yam ice cream with banana cake and caramelized bananas is good if sundaes are your thing. The pandan custard under passion-fruit pulp gets a lot of mileage from just a few flavors. But the one that sounds too boring to bother with (\"assorted exotic fruit?\") is worth a second look. Lychee, mango, pineapple and dragon fruit may not be particularly exotic, but a dip or a dunk into a dark, spicy syrup of tamarind and palm sugar will wake them right up.

{"id": 28, "data": " How clam pizza, with all its charms, remained trapped in New Haven for most of a century is a mystery that may never be unraveled. At least it has escaped now. For the past decade or so, Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana , the 93-year-old establishment said to have invented the regional delicacy, has been exporting it to its other branches in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. There is also a small cult of the clam pie among New York pizzaioli. It has become a fixture at Lombardi's and some Staten Island pizzerias, as well as inspiring lovingly considered tributes at Pasquale Jones , Motorino and the Clam . I have eaten most of them, and happily, but on a recent trip to Connecticut I was led to what I now realize is the clam pie against which all others should be measured. It is baked at Zuppardi's Apizza in the city of West Haven. Unlike the coal ovens used to fire New Haven's more famous \"abeetz,\" to use the Connecticut-Neapolitan dialect, the ovens at Zuppardi's are fired by gas. As a result, Zuppardi's pies are not nearly as blackened as the ones from Pepe's, but the crust still bulges with air pockets and emerges with a pleasingly dry, thin and crackery crunch. [ Learn how to make pizza at home with this guide from NYT Cooking. ] Zuppardi's tops its clam pizza (market price, typically $32.45 for a medium pie) with fresh garlic, olive oil, dried oregano, cracked red pepper and littlenecks. Smaller clams may be opaque when they reach the table. Larger specimens will be just warmed through. All will taste as if they had just been shucked, as in fact they were. Opening clams to order means that the clam pizza takes longer than Zuppardi's other specialties, like the plain pie (tomato sauce, grated cheese, no mozzarella), itself worth a detour from Interstate 95, which rumbles by about a cherrystone's throw away.

{"id": 29, "data": " It is true that the bacalaitos at the Freakin Rican in Astoria, Queens, are not quite as big around as the ones you will see browning in veritable caldrons of oil over wood fires at kiosks scattered along the beach road in Piñones, outside San Juan. These flattened cod fritters are the size of pie plates in Puerto Rico, while in Queens they are roughly the diameter of a coffee can. Dimensions aside, they give off all the right signals. They are the color of a corn muffin, with green specks of chopped cilantro under the surface that let you know they are not made from Goya's mix. They don't leave your fingertips entirely free of grease, but they come close. They have an exterior crunch that surrenders quickly to the firm, chewy interior of mashed salt cod; the texture is less fried dough than fish taffy. You could start to build a business around bacalaitos like these. That, in fact, has been Derick López's plan for some time now. Mr. López, who was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the South Bronx, is the Freakin Rican's chef and, with his husband, Victor Vargas, its owner. About four years ago, armed with picnic coolers and a couple of folding tables, the two men began selling a short menu of Puerto Rican staples at the street fairs that seem to infiltrate a different New York thoroughfare each weekend. As they promoted the Freakin Rican catering operation, the Freakin Rican product line, the Freakin Rican Facebook page and the Freakin Rican YouTube channel, they saved their earnings so they could found the Freakin Rican restaurant. After a false start in another part of Queens, it opened a short distance from the Museum of the Moving Image one year ago this month. The dining room has 19 seats. The banana-plant wallpaper on the left wall is reflected in the mirrors on the right. In between are some metal chickens and bright-green figurines of coquís, the little frogs that chirp from every Puerto Rican tree. Diners sip on tropical-fruit shakes or bottles of Kola Champagne, Coco Rico and Malta India, the Harry, Ron and Hermione of Puerto Rican soft drinks. Héctor Lavoe may be playing over the speakers, or Víctor Manuelle, not so loudly that they can't be drowned out by the sounds of a small number of employees singing \"Happy Birthday\" while wielding a tambourine and a pair of maracas. If you have spent any time at all on the trail of chicharrones, mofongo, sancocho and other wonders of the Puerto Rican kitchen, you know that Astoria is not a primary hunting ground for any of them. You also know, though, that blinking-light cuchifritos parlors and family-run cocina criolla luncheonettes have been disappearing from the Bronx, East Harlem and the Lower East Side over the past few decades, along with many of their customers. The Puerto Rican population in New York peaked around 1990, when residents of the old barrios began to flow to the suburbs in large numbers, according to Laird W. Bergad , the director of the Center for Latin American, Caribbean and Latino Studies at City University of New York Graduate Center. Beacons of Puerto Rican cuisine still survive; Casa Adela, for instance, is still busily dispensing chickens from its venerable lemon-yellow rotisserie on Avenue C, despite the death last year of its founder, Adela Fargas. But there are not so many of these places left that we can take an unlimited supply of tostones and mojo de ajo for granted, either. The Freakin Rican developed its act on the street-fair circuit, but it applied the same tactics that succeed at Smorgasburg and similar urban foraging grounds, where the ideal dish can be held in one hand, gets immediate attention, costs under $10 and can serve as a plank in a branding platform. This may explain why appetizers are the strong suit on the Freakin Rican menu. The sorullitos, Puerto Rico's answer to hush puppies, are an exception; they are dense and dry, as if the cornmeal hadn't absorbed enough water. Mr. López's alcapurrias, though, are very good, even if the picadillo that runs down the middle of a tube of mashed fried plantains like the graphite in a pencil could be seasoned a little more forcefully. And his pasteles are exceptional. Pasteles are structured like tamales. Where the masa would be, Mr. López makes a sweet, enjoyably gummy mash of green plantains, taro root and kabocha squash. The filling is a soft, rich vein of stewed pork shoulder with ham, bacon, red peppers and green olives. Rolled up in a banana leaf, these pasteles probably deserve their own float in the Puerto Rican Day Parade. Mr. López fries chicken in two styles. One, the chicharrones de pollo, is traditional. The other, the Freakin Crispy Wings, is not. Each has its rewards. The chicharrones, hacked into three-bite hunks, taste of cider vinegar and garlic powder and have a smooth, achiote-tinted buttermilk crust that breaks open with a pleasing crackle. The Freakin Crispy Wings are spicier, and the shell is thicker and more deeply crevassed. These wings may owe more to Atlanta than to Mayagüez, although you can get them with a guava barbecue sauce that's reasonably tropical. Leave behind these appetizers, the core of the street-fair business, and the menu can start to appear unsteady. At dinner, the main courses tend to be fairly plain fried or grilled meat. Grilled pork chops splashed with mojo can be dry and dull, and the grilled chicken breasts are not much more interesting. Baked pork ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce are tender enough, but they aren't very persuasive. On several nights, I found myself gazing longingly at the lunch specials on the back of the menu, wondering why I couldn't have a brick of pastelón for dinner. (I came back for it one Thursday afternoon, and was glad I did.) Until more long-cooked dishes like it appear at dinnertime, consider a bowl of sancocho. Listed as \"vegetable root soup\" for $7, it doesn't sound like much of a meal. But it is a grab bag of a stew with at least two kinds of meat, great hunks of taro and yuca, a couple of inches of corn on the cob and a magical squash broth that has the consistency of heavy cream and the color of very ripe mango. In the unlikely event that you finish it and the bowl of rice that comes with it and then cry out for more, the Freakin Rican has just the thing for you: mofongo. A dome of mashed plantains possessed by garlic, the mofongo is cooked to order to keep the crunchy bits crunchy and the whole thing from getting boggy. You can have it with chicharrones or sliced roast pork, which leaves behind a happy impression of garlic, oregano and salt. If you have come for a birthday, a candle stuck in the meringue icing of a tres leches cake is probably in your future. If not, flan and espresso will do, and a bag of pasteles for tomorrow.

{"id": 30, "data": " More than a year ago, I was on the verge of reviewing Del Posto when the news intervened. The restaurant had changed significantly since the last time it had been evaluated by a Times critic: Sam Sifton promoted it from three stars to four in 2010, when Mark Ladner was the executive chef and Brooks Headley was running the pastry kitchen. First, Mr. Headley had quit this stately, expensive Italian restaurant in Chelsea so he could sell fast, cheap vegetarian burgers . Next, Del Posto had spent about $1 million on crystal candle vases, white leather chairs and other luxurious fittings that made it even more stately and expensive. Finally, Mr. Ladner had left to sell fast, cheap pasta. A fresh review was clearly in order. Before I could write it, though, a number of women who had worked for Mario Batali, one of the owners, started talking about the sexual harassment and abuse that they say he had doled out. Suddenly there seemed to be more important questions than whether the braised-rabbit agnolotti were cooked al dente. Negotiations took more than a year, but Mr. Batali no longer profits from Del Posto, having sold his stake in March to a group led by his former partner, Joe Bastianich . Employees have said that Mr. Bastianich himself helped, at a minimum, to build the sexist and disrespectful environment in which Mr. Batali operated. Mr. Bastianich has apologized, saying that he had heard Mr. Batali speak inappropriately to employees, and that he should have done more to stop the sexual harassment. Some diners will stay away, feeling that Mr. Bastianich has not sufficiently atoned. I understand this, but I am also interested in the way employees may be treated at the restaurant now and in the future. Here, there is reason to hope. Among other human-resources reforms, employees can now report complaints about owners or corporate officers to an independent investigative firm with the power to refer cases to outside counsel. As part of the restructuring, Melissa Rodriguez, who has been the executive chef of Del Posto since 2017, was made a partner in the restaurant, along with Jeff Katz, now the managing partner. A new pastry chef, Georgia Wodder, was appointed last spring. Del Posto is, with the possible exception of Aquavit , the grandest and most expensive restaurant in New York where women are in charge of everything you eat, starting with the miniature saffron waffle rolled like a cannoli and stuffed at one tiny end with taleggio and at the other with fennel pesto, and ending with the prosecco marshmallow tucked into the wooden drawer of a custom-made cheese grater. The cooking is more subdued now. The kitchen is not seen as a beacon of innovation the way it used to be, perhaps because Ms. Rodriguez is less interested than Mr. Ladner was in feats of technical derring-do like 100-layer lasagnas . She gets her effects by following old Italian templates and putting them together so elegantly that they seem to light up from inside. There's an honesty to her approach -- she doesn't try to shoot out all the lights by supercharging dishes with fat -- but it's not the kind of peasant simplicity people usually mean when they talk about honesty in Italian food. It's a sophisticated honesty. You know chicken cacciatore, of course. Ms. Rodriguez's version is made from guinea hen breast, roasted until the skin crackles like parchment. What would be the body of the stew is now a sauce; the tomato, celery and onion in it come through distinctly. Occupying a little sidecar is a pressed puck of braised leg meat under a single, Roman-style gnocco, a small featherbed of semolina held together by eggs, milk and cheese. One side has been broiled so hard it is nearly burned, which seems like a mistake at first, but turns out to supply the bit of campfire that this hunter's stew needs. It has to be far more complicated to prepare than the cacciatore at your neighborhood Italian restaurant, but it seems simpler, pared to essentials, and wonderful in every bite. I've never seen anyone wring as much flavor out of salsify as Ms. Rodriguez does. Sliced transparently thin and fried, it makes crunchy brown chips about half the size of an M&M. These decorate the top of a grilled-salsify pudding that has the refreshing bittersweetness of one of those plant-based Italian aperitifs. If it were not garnished with streaky leaves of radicchio, it could pass for a dessert. The menu structure has not changed, although the prices have. Everything can be had à la carte. Lunch is still a relative bargain, though the price has shimmied up to $59 for three courses. For a blowout $194 dinner, the Captain's Menu yields eight courses or so. Most people, however, go with the $164, five-course Menu del Posto. The primary argument in favor of this strategy is, to me, an overwhelming one: Two of those five courses are pasta. Del Posto's pastas are worth doubling up on. They can come in many forms. Delicate conical tortellini have hidden pockets of nettles and spring peas; they are half-submerged in a light spring-vegetable brodo in which Parmigiano-Reggiano rinds once bobbed like bay leaves. This is the spring minestrone. A single, plate-spanning raviolo, called a fazzoletto, is topped with poached mussels and filled with spinach and fresh herbs -- not a lawnmower-mulch of greenery but a layer of emulsion as thin and velvety as the dough that envelops it. The sauce of mussel juices, white wine, butter and saffron makes this the only convincing mussel pasta I've ever had. The range of flavors Ms. Wodder commands in her pastry kitchen seems unnecessarily limited to me, although I may be unfairly comparing her desserts with Mr. Headley's, which roamed all over the place. Individually, her desserts are soothing, often showcasing the comforts of dairy. More emphasis, some extra acidity or bitterness, might have brought an assemblage of quince paste, brown-butter gelato and griddled brioche into relief. But I appreciated the way winter squash in the batter modified the sweetness of an olive oil-orange cake, and I enjoyed the moody sulkiness that amaro lent to a citrus salad served with the cake. Del Posto has in recent years picked up a reputation as a restaurant for one-percenters. It rarely gives that impression once you are inside, where servers solemnly accommodate just about anyone. There is a vegan menu at Del Posto. A vegetarian meal can be put together easily, and almost everything can be made without gluten, including the pasta. Yes, the stockpile of Champagnes includes some lock-and-key stuff, and should you require a Barolo costing between $2,000 and $4,000, one will quickly be added to your bill. But among the 3,100 or so Italian labels superintended by Evan Clagnaz, the wine director, are more marked from $60 to $75 than I can count. Piemonte is a place to hunt, and Friuli, and the Valle d'Aosta, for starters. Though the restaurant is not exclusively for rich people, it is explicitly for occasions. Once, when a reservationist called to confirm and asked whether I was celebrating anything special, I said no, and was gently laughed at: \"Just a normal Tuesday night at Del Posto?\" There is little danger that anyone will mistake a night at Del Posto for normal. If nothing else, the napkins and towels are a tip-off. First, there is a small hot linen napkin scented with tomato-vine oil, to wipe the dust of the outside world from your hands. Then a large white linen napkin, followed just before dessert by a small yellow one. It is given to you, and the white one is taken away, by a server using a large fork and spoon as tongs. When you go to the restrooms, you may encounter an attendant who has just restocked the hand towels from a large basket she carries on one arm, like Heidi out gathering wildflowers for Grandfather. There are little ceremonies like this from start to finish; I don't know of any other restaurant that performs quite so many tasks whose only real purpose is to draw attention to themselves. And these things are rarely done with a smile; employees seem to have been directed to keep a respectful, formal distance as they carry out your requests and perform other services you'd never think of requesting. They rarely seem comfortable. Their solemnity is underlined by the sepulchral lighting at night, so gloomy it makes the crypt of Grant's tomb look like a tiki bar. A good deal of the service is the attentive, helpful kind that you really want, but the rest of it seems designed only to give customers the sensation of temporary power over other people. Some people may love this, but it reflects a serious lack of imagination when you think about the ways the service at Blue Hill at Stone Barns or Noma , for instance, is integrated into the experience. Is it stretching a point to ask if enshrining subservience, as Del Posto does, reflects the same twisted sense of priorities that allowed Mr. Batali to get away with abusing his own power for so long? (And is it a coincidence that far more men than women seem to work in the dining room, particularly in the upper ranks?) Now that Ms. Rodriguez owns a piece of the restaurant, perhaps she can lead a reconsideration of priorities in the front of the house, and find a tone that more closely matches her philosophy in the back. She shouldn't have to clean up the messes men made.

{"id": 31, "data": " Hanon, a new udon shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was produced by the union of a Tokyo video-production company and a Japanese manufacturer of unusually thin condoms. The condoms became the subject of a series of advertisements on which the production company worked; in one of them, called \"Acts of Love,\" dancers in London re-enact, with surprising grace and dignity, the mating rituals of blue-footed boobies, fiddler crabs and other animals. Well, kids, when two companies like each other very much, sometimes they decide to create a new company together. That is what happened with the production firm and the prophylactics people when, for reasons that are perhaps best not to question, they hit upon the idea of expanding their product line from condoms into noodles. The restaurant lies across Union Avenue from Kellogg's Diner. Its door is marked during business hours by the fluttering white noren curtains. It is the second Hanon location. The first is about 6,700 miles away, in the city of Kamakura, which lies south of Tokyo and is known for soba, not udon. This gave Hanon the advantage of not competing against any of Japan's established udon styles, leaving its chef, Takahiro Yanagisawa, free to come up with his own. Mr. Yanagisawa, who had spent 25 years making sushi before turning to noodles, focused his innovative urges on the dough. He began by adding wheat germ and bran to the white flour that in udon is typically used alone. The resulting noodle is called zenryufun or whole wheat. The bran and germ are Mr. Yanagisawa's attempts to make a more healthful udon, but they also add flavor, a mottled color and a slightly rough texture that holds on to the dashi-based broth. This dough is also made into a green noodle, called sasauchi, by mixing in powdered barley shoots and leaves of kuma-zasa, a bamboo variety that pandas dote on . To the human palate, or at least this human's palate, sasa tastes something like green tea. Both the speckled zenryufun and the green sasauchi are flat noodles, resembling fettuccine that has been working out. Avoiding extremes, they are moderately chewy and reasonably springy. Either flavor, or both, can be ordered cold and spread on a bamboo mat for dunking into a sauce, either a peanut-buttery sesame sauce or the traditional dashi-based dipping sauce. For larger or more curious appetites, these dipping noodles, called seiro udon, can be dangled into a hot duck soup in which a few hunks of well-boiled duck meat swim. The cold noodles can also be accessorized with whipped mountain yam or tempura or both. If you had stumbled into Hanon under the impression that it was another generic Williamsburg noodle mill, the tempura would set you straight. The crust is engineered for udon, thick and substantial enough that it will not dissolve and float away in the soup, yet somehow not oily or clunky. The tempura is served with sea salt, which will not only season the fried blowfish tails, shrimp, mushroom and vegetables, but will also do very good things to any noodles it happens to meet. With the hot soups, there is no choice of noodles. All are made with zenryufun. The plain broth, a dashi augmented by white soy sauce, is not so salty or concentrated that I didn't want to drink it all. It also performs well made into a thick-but-not-sludgy curry soup with thin pink slices of washugyu beef; a shaggy, mossy, salty-sour mass of ume and kombu; and a soup of shaved beef and onions that tastes like a deeper, stronger version of French dip jus and is blitzed by a little grated yuzu peel at the end. A few near-relatives of udon make it to the menu as well. The beef-and-onion combination can also be had over rice. Creamy, slightly spicy cod roe is tossed with zenryufun for an excellent mentaiko pasta that, for once, relies on the roe rather than Kewpie mayonnaise to make an impression. The eventual plan is to sell both colors of noodle to grocery stores and other restaurants -- to become, in essence, the Sun Noodle of the udonisphere. This would be a gain for New York, but for the moment Hanon's udon is found only at Hanon, where the noodles are made fresh each day. Any plan for world domination is not hinted at on the restaurant's Facebook page , which seems to be its home base online, though nobody has bothered to post a menu there yet. Nor does the dining room suggest a budding global chain. Atmospheric and presumably expensive prints by the photographers Takashi Homma and Nobuyoshi Araki hang over the tables, and a signed Cy Twombly lithograph has been placed by the door to the backyard. The music -- torch songs, jazz piano -- seems to be coming from a radio tuned to another decade. A lot of this cocktail music will make more sense once the liquor license comes through. Hanon is getting set to offer sake, shochu and wines chosen by Jorge Riera, who built the list at Frenchette and has turned countless New Yorkers on to the fizzy, fuzzy and furry delights of natural wines. The idea of Hanon is not to slurp and slide out, but to stay for a meal: a chilled French red with the fried chicken and Japanese omelet, maybe, and something a bit brawnier with curry soup. Dessert could be a tofu blancmange, smooth and white and somewhat sweet, but there is more satisfaction in the grainy, earthy bricks of red bean paste. The meal might end with tea, to which the restaurant takes the same unhurried approach it applies to everything else. The iced oolong is slowly cold-brewed; a bamboo whisk and ceramic chawan are kept on the dining counter for painstakingly whipping up bowls of matcha; an appliance imported from Taiwan will transform freshly steeped hojicha and ice into a tan froth, a process that takes about five minutes. This foam tea is dairy-free, unlike Taiwan's infamous cheese tea. It is served in a wine glass, and the experience of drinking it is similar to tackling a pint of Guinness before the head has settled down.

{"id": 32, "data": " One of the ways people pretend to be sophisticated about restaurants these days is by claiming that the New York City dining scene has lost its edge. The sheer number of restaurants in the city -- about 27,000, according to the health inspectors -- makes the argument absurd. How many of them are slipping? All of them? Just the first 20,000 or so? In reality, people who gripe about the state of New York restaurants are usually talking about a sliver of a slice of a fraction, probably around 50 places whose names are in steady circulation, with the newest weighing most heavily in the results. The number of really good ones is higher than anyone can count. Places that other cities would brag about get lost in the crowd here. The chef Günther Seeger, for instance, was a national star when he cooked in Atlanta. The tasting-menu restaurant he opened in the West Village three years ago should have been a major destination, especially after he dropped the prices. Mr. Seeger can make ingredients bend to his will almost without touching them. His cooking outshone that of some of the city's more famous chefs, who whip their ingredients harder with far less payoff. Yet he struggled to put Günther Seeger NY on the map. I reviewed it, but some other critics didn't, and by the time it closed, last month, Chris Crowley of Grub Street wrote , \"it wasn't a restaurant you heard a lot of food geeks talk about.\" Mr. Seeger complained to one acquaintance that he couldn't even get on a list of New York's 100 best restaurants. Of course, good restaurants fail everywhere, but it's hard to imagine Mr. Seeger vanishing into the crowd in San Francisco, Chicago or Los Angeles. Considered and rejected, maybe. But overlooked? Not likely. I'm not sure that any words of mine could have persuaded the city to cuddle up to Mr. Seeger, who isn't particularly cuddly. But I wish I'd found ways to remind New Yorkers that his breathtakingly pure cooking was there to be enjoyed while that was still true. Which brings us, by a circuitous and not particularly well-paved route, to Anthony Mangieri of Una Pizza Napoletana . Using naturally leavened dough and a short shopping list of ingredients, Mr. Mangieri makes what is unmistakably the finest sit-down pizza in the five boroughs. (I doubt he has any rivals in the stand-up joints, either, but slice pizza is a different game.) Two years ago, I posited that Razza, a pizzeria in Jersey City, made \"the best pizza in New York.\" I don't regret writing that, but I would like to point out that Mr. Mangieri was not cooking in the city at the time and that Razza's chef, Dan Richer, has said that he began taking pizza seriously only after he met Mr. Mangieri. Una Pizza Napoletana saw a rush of curious pie-eaters after it opened on Orchard Street a little more than a year ago. But the last few times I've gone, there were too many unclaimed chairs and bar stools. When Anthony Mangieri is making pizza, the right number of empty seats is zero, as any New Yorker who waited in line at the old Una Pizza Napoletana, in the East Village from 2004 to 2009, could tell you. Press interest in the new place has died down, too. So when I heard a rumor that Mr. Mangieri was thinking of leaving the city and taking his pizza with him, I was unnerved, to put it mildly. Asked about it, he told me he was considering it but hadn't made up his mind. Mr. Mangieri has left New York before, and I didn't like it then, either. This time, I wasn't going to let him get away without a fight. It is true that my review of Una Pizza Napoletana last year was decidedly mixed. It is also true, though, that almost every criticism I made has been addressed. It has gone from one of the most confounding pizzerias in the city to one of the most enjoyable. The problem with Una Pizza a year ago was that it was trying to be two things at once. It was, of course, a Neapolitan pizzeria, serving classic, unadorned pies baked for about two minutes inside a wood-burning oven shaped like an igloo. But it was also a cutting-edge Lower East Side experiment. At the instigation of Mr. Mangieri's partners, the chefs Fabian von Hauske Valtierra and Jeremiah Stone, the kitchen brought forth appetizers that had rarely if ever been asked to live under one roof with a pizza. There was a jellylike mass of raw lobster inside a ring of chickpeas, and a rust-colored puddle of 'nduja under raw turnips and nasturtium leaves. The wine list was virtually a treatise on natural wines, a long document full of the names of eccentric producers and obscure European villages. In another restaurant, all this would have been the departure point for some adventurous evenings. But in a pizzeria it led to some peculiar pairings, made the check a bit higher than you wanted and resulted in long waits before you were finally allowed to eat the delicious pizza you'd come for. Over the past year, Mr. von Hauske and Mr. Stone have stepped aside, letting Mr. Mangieri call the shots. The wines on offer now number about 15. They are still a likably eccentric lot, but picking one doesn't feel like studying for a master sommelier exam. The appetizers are simpler and less expensive: a plate of marinated white anchovies, a dish of warm Italian olives or a bowl of Little Gem lettuce with sunflower seeds in a Caesarish dressing. I do miss the tiramisù from the opening menu, but the new cannoli filled with ricotta -- a blend of domestic cow's milk and Italian sheep's milk -- are nearly as good. It's common for a new restaurant to trim its sails, but this one has trimmed its prices, too. In the beginning the five regular pizzas were all $25; now they range from $19 to $25, and the two extra-complicated Friday and Saturday pizzas are priced at $26. I liked Mr. Mangieri's pies in the East Village, I liked them more when he came back to town, and it's possible, just possible, that they've improved over the past year. He is, like Mr. Seeger, a minimalist. He lets you notice each ingredient: the little ping of sourness in the Campanian buffalo mozzarella, for instance. Or the unruly, windswept-hillside aroma of dried Sicilian oregano. The precise crunch of each unrefined Trapani sea-salt crystal waiting to dissolve. The crust is so tender it barely fights fork, knife or teeth. Some diners will wish it put up more crackly resistance. You inhale it at least as much as you eat it. When you have finished, some of the most popular pizzas in town will seem tough, leathery, overworked. Even if this is not the style you crave, you'll know that it's the work of a baker who has spent years listening to the dough. There is a place for people who are as obsessed with pizza as Mr. Mangieri, and the place is New York City.

{"id": 33, "data": " You will find Kawi , the latest Momofuku restaurant, on the fifth floor of 20 Hudson Yards, assuming you stay determined and swallow back the urge to run for the exits that may grip you as you negotiate escalators that don't connect to one another, elevators that are hidden out of sight like somebody's crazy grandfather and shiny retail windows that seem to be trying to provoke a class war. By the time people reach Kawi they tend to look rattled; New Yorkers who will easily weave their way around broken sidewalks, potholes, garbage piles and al fresco rat conventions come undone when faced with the interior of a shopping mall. Kawi, now two months old, can be disorienting in its own way, but at least you can have a seat and a drink while you get your bearings. Space there is used, or not used, the way it is in Las Vegas. There's a very long bar behind a line of black, geometric bar stools receding toward the vanishing point; low lounge tables; taller, square wood tables; round wood tables; black-leather booths; red-leather booths; red-leather banquettes; and a row of chairs facing a kitchen counter. Between all this furniture are aisles wide enough for a Zamboni. All those seats have backs, too. Kawi is loaded with the comforts and accommodations that critics, including me, were begging Mr. Chang to pay more attention to as recently as the opening of Nishi three years ago. Has anybody complained before that a David Chang restaurant was too quiet? They're saying it about Kawi. If there is anybody left who still thinks of Mr. Chang as a downtown punk, Kawi will clear up that misconception. The early Momofuku restaurants were skateboards; Kawi is a minivan with sliding doors, armrests, cupholders and Don Henley on the stereo. The ride may not be as fast, but it's a lot smoother. Kawi is also the first Momofuku restaurant in New York to address Korean cuisine head on and at length. Majordomo , which opened in Los Angeles last year, is at least half Korean, but the menu is loaded up with other stuff, a lot of which is big and showy and seemingly designed to dazzle the high rollers. It can be hard to remember you're eating galbi-jjim after a server buries it beneath a tableside avalanche of shaved raclette. Eunjo Park, Kawi's executive chef, avoids this type of distraction. This is lucky, because she makes food that you want to concentrate on. Before joining the Momofuku stable, she worked in the formal and highly fastidious kitchens of Daniel , Le Bec-Fin and Per Se . She later returned to South Korea, where she had lived until she was 12, for advanced studies at the Seoul restaurant Gaon and at the kitchen of the Chunjinam hermitage, presided over by Jeong Kwan , certainly the most celebrated cooking Zen nun in her country. A strong interest in tradition marks Ms. Park's food at Kawi. Her dishes are set apart from versions you may have had before by the exactitude of the technique and the quality of the ingredients. One section of her menu is turned over to kimbap, those wide, nori-wrapped sushi rolls often spotted at salad bars, languishing under plastic wrap. Most kimbap is designed to be portable, filling and inexpensive. Ms. Park's kimbap, on the other hand, is built for pleasure. She has a pickled vegetable kimbap on the lunch menu that is truly exciting; you are meant to dip it in a dark liquid that tastes a bit like soy sauce but is made with beets. The dinner menu brings kimbap filled with chives, pickled daikon, citrus jelly and a buttery pink vein of foie gras terrine. Has this really never been done before, you wonder as you eat it, and if not, why not? Among the other gussied-up raw fish that you expect in Momofukuland, like a refreshing if somewhat staid madai tartare, are some dime-size clams in chile sauce and an elegant, inspired interpretation of gejang. Blue crab legs and claw are cracked and given a three-day soak in soy sauce, among other things, which gives them an impressive amount of flavor. Then, in case you haven't noticed that you're dealing with a real chef, Ms. Park stirs the crab's roe with creamy rice and spoons this Korean risotto into the open belly of the shell. At moments like this, or in the hwedupbap filled with raw fish as strikingly good as any you'll find in a $200 omakase, or in the doenjang jjigae, a potful of braised fermented bean paste with pork belly that appears on the menu as \"yesterday's stinky soybean stew\" and manages to be homespun and polished at the same time, it's possible to see Kawi as Ms. Park's response to Atomix . It's as if she had looked at Junghyun Park's dazzlingly complex compositions at his year-old modern Korean restaurant and decided that she could cook in a style that was every bit as modern and painstaking, but that instead of turning traditional dishes into tasting-menu food she would keep the old forms and innovate inside them. With her tidy, refined, French-influenced neo-traditionalism, Ms. Park could become something like the Alain Ducasse of Korean cooking. It's not obvious, though, that Kawi needs an Alain Ducasse. Certain appetizers seem to belong on another planet, more beautiful and gentle than ours, such as the soft tofu with soy syrup that, sitting under a shattering thin crust of caramelized sugar, is like a savory crème brûlée by way of Seoul. And there are others, such as the sticks of fried cod that a server pointlessly snips in half with scissors and then spritzes with atomized yuzu juice, that are right at home at Hudson Yards. The presentation seemed forced. That could also describe the boiled chicken dish, one of the menu's showiest items and, at $64, one of its most expensive. The whole bird is steamed, then the breast is sliced and served plain while the dark meat is fried and coated with spices. Neither is spectacular on its own, and the combination is bizarre. More successful versions of elaborate, oversize, multicomponent dishes are proven moneymakers elsewhere in the Momofuku republic. But arm-waving platters like that seem out of place at Kawi, which is the least Momofukian of the Momofukus. The most uncharacteristic thing of all is that the dining room has never been operating at anything close to capacity, at least when I've been there. Maybe tables are being kept off the reservation books to give the cooks time to learn where the spice cabinet is. Or maybe the fans who are so devoted to Mr. Chang's downtown spots are still trying to figure out the escalators.

{"id": 34, "data": " Good restaurants don't rain down from nowhere, but Crown Shy came close. No doubt it went through the same birth pangs as all the others. As far as I can tell, though, it simply materialized one morning this March at 70 Pine Street, and was open for business that afternoon by the time the financial district's elevators began disgorging traders, bankers and analysts in search of 5-o'clock refreshment. One reason it seems to have crept up on the city is that it's a large, well-capitalized, big-time restaurant of the kind that only established groups seem able to get off the ground these days. Yet Crown Shy doesn't come from Danny Meyer, Andrew Carmellini or any of the other usual suspects. Its two main players were recruited after talks among April Bloomfield, Ken Friedman and the building's developer fell apart in 2016, before accusations of sexual harassment engulfed Mr. Friedman. Crown Shy's chef, James Kent, used to run the kitchen at the NoMad , and his partner, Jeff Katz, is the managing partner at Del Posto . Neither exactly fell off the turnip truck last week. As a team, though, they're unproven, and as they went through construction and hiring, the drumbeat of publicity was more muted than it might have been if marquee names had led the project. Then there is Crown Shy's location, a sprawling, soaring, street-level space that, as far as anyone recalls, has never held a restaurant before. Many New Yorkers have seen the 1932 building's distinctive, hulking, pyramidal silhouette on the skyline, but until recently, when the offices on its 67 stories were repurposed as expensive apartments and hotel rooms, not many had encountered the frenzied exuberance of the lobby, which makes use of polished marble in at least five contrasting colors. It looks like something Bernini would have designed if he'd lived to see the Jazz Age. Depending on which entrance you use -- the revolving doors are crowned with aluminum reliefs of Art Deco flowers being pollinated by elongated stylized butterflies -- you may want to allow an extra five or 10 minutes to take it all in before you eat. Above all, it's the extent to which Crown Shy already has its act together that makes you ask: Where did this place come from? The whole operation radiates confidence from start to finish. The finish brings real desserts from a real pastry chef, Renata Ameni. She comes to Crown Shy fresh from Manresa, in Los Gatos, Calif ., and before that, she put in half a decade at Eleven Madison Park . Her desserts at Crown Shy look uncomplicated, and you don't realize how intelligently they've been put together until you start to eat one. There's a milky-white yogurt cheesecake under tender spring strawberries, with smooth strawberry sorbet in the center and a pistachio crumble sprinkled over that. Her chocolate tart gives her a chance to show off about half a dozen different effects she can work with chocolate, starting with a crunchy, crumbly, almost salty chocolate crust, moving on to a soft, soufflé-like filling and ending with curls of dark chocolate. Ms. Ameni's side of the kitchen is also responsible for the savory churros filled with Gruyère sauce -- the menu calls them fritters, they taste like gougères and the texture is something else entirely. Also her work: the miniature loaf of pull-apart bread that appears after you order. With dried olives on top and olive tapenade between every skinny slice, it is one of the most memorable parts of the meal. Even the obligatory scoops of ice cream that restaurants seem required to offer aren't allowed to leave her pastry station until they've been turned into a composed dessert, and not some kind of slapdash sundae , either. Satsuma ice cream gets to wear a toasted turban of marshmallowy meringue and some cracked honeycomb candy on the side. The effect is witty and delicious, progressing from purely sweet to bittersweet to tart and bittersweet. Mr. Kent's savory dishes pursue the same strategy. This is to say, they regularly over-deliver, starting with the iced Wellfleet oysters dressed with cucumber jelly, diced cucumbers, grains of jalapeño and microleaves of purple shiso. An almost absurdly creamy purée of white bean hummus under a fiery red slick of melted 'nduja is probably meant to be shared, but as soon as I'd tasted it I came up with other ideas, as my dinner guests will testify. Two tartares show Mr. Kent's talent for carrying bright new ideas with him into well-traveled territory. In the first, he laces hand-chopped raw beef with toasted walnuts and earthy rye croutons; in the other, chopped raw snapper is sprinkled with individual juice-filled vesicles of grapefruit, lime, lemon and orange that pop between your teeth, a kind of instant, interactive ceviche. Maybe one or two ideas should have been left by the side of the road. The chicken liver ragù tossed with housemade cavatelli doesn't need to be so sweet with sherry; a rough pesto is a fine use for fresh chickpeas, but isn't there a better partner for it than shaved jicama? All is forgiven when Mr. Kent turns a mainstay like grilled chicken into a main course as exciting as the one at Crown Shy, which keeps the sunshine brightness of its citrus marinade, and is served with a purée-slash-hot sauce of fermented hot and sweet peppers. The vivid orange of that hot sauce almost matches the marble in the lobby. But Crown Shy's two big dining rooms and extended bar are a little more restrained, dominated by cream tones, blond wood tables, and chairs with saddle-brown leather seats and backs. The only echoes of grandeur are the enormous windows and the ceiling high up overhead. The wine list is one to get lost in. Finance wizards with bonuses to expunge can certainly do that, but it's great to see lots of bottles under $100 on almost every page. Anyone who knows what some of these wines cost wholesale will be able to locate any number of good deals, but even the unschooled will notice the value regions. They jump off the page: Portugal, Greece and New Zealand, for instance, along with vast stretches of Germany and pockets of Spain, France and Italy. With so many strengths, Crown Shy must have at least one thing wrong with it. And yes, it does. Obviously that name is ridiculous. Knowing that it refers to a tendency of very tall trees not to let their upper stories grow into their neighbors' branches doesn't help, either. But we should probably get used to it, because we're going to be hearing more about this restaurant. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 35, "data": " When a batch of banh beo comes to the table at Van Da , any confusion about how to eat them does not last long. Banh beo, a species of small rice cake, are a favorite afternoon snack in the central Vietnamese city of Hue. Each one is steamed in a ceramic dish just big enough to hold a few spare coins. Faced with a platter of banh beo, you realize fairly quickly that you have essentially two choices: You can use a spoon, or hold the dish to your mouth and tip it up while throwing your head back, as if doing a Jell-O shot. If you go the Jell-O shot route, it may help to bring a pair of chopsticks or a fingertip into play at the last minute to encourage the banh beo to leave the nest. You have now transferred to your mouth a warm divot of steamed rice and tapioca flours that has a consistency like panna cotta's and a negligible flavor on its own. All the action is in the toppings. At Van Da, these include a spoonful of chopped scallions and the green oil in which they were sizzled, red rings of fresh Thai chile, some fish sauce, rehydrated dried shrimp and a flap of fried tofu skin, standing in for the pork rinds a banh beo vendor in Hue would use. The divot of rice cake is still warm, which helps the aromas drive their way into your head. It's over in a minute. If you're lucky, there will be another banh beo on the table so you can start over. Van Da joined the East Village's growing hub of interesting Vietnamese restaurants three months ago. Like Hanoi House , Madame Vo and Madame Vo BBQ , it is semitraditional and semimodern. Those two strains are embodied at Van Da by, respectively, Yen Ngo and Hannah Wong. Ms. Ngo, who owns the place, was raised in Dalat, Vietnam, and while she has worked in restaurants and catering in New York City for years, she has never had a chance before to show off the food of her childhood, like the banh beo steamed by her mother, who had grown up in Hue. Ms. Wong is the chef. Though she has cooked at Gramercy Tavern and Battersby , her background in the food of Vietnam before Van Da was more or less confined to the roughly two weeks she spent traveling there while living in Hong Kong on a Fulbright grant a decade ago. Nevertheless, she has put together a trenchant, concise and pleasure-focused menu of Vietnamese dishes. Some she learned directly from her boss, and on those recipes she was apparently discouraged from drawing outside the lines. Others are more freely interpreted. It's a credit to Ms. Wong's sensitivity that if you don't already know the original templates, it can be hard to tell where they end and her imagination begins. Banh beo and the other snacks from Hue that Ms. Ngo taught Ms. Wong get their own berth on the menu. As you'd imagine, they tend to be very good. Banh it ram are chewy, fried balls of mochi, filled with a coconut-soaked mash of mung beans and shallots. Banh khot are little rice-flour pancakes molded into edible cups about the size of a Ritz cracker. In Vietnam, the cups would be filled with shrimp. Ms. Wong instead spoons sautéed mushrooms into hers, along with a crisscrossing of fresh herbs and a spill of coconut cream. Ms. Wong makes an effort to bring out regional differences in Vietnamese cuisine by devoting sections of the menu to Saigon and Hanoi, hundreds of miles apart, as well as Hue, somewhere in the middle. She doesn't have quite enough dishes from any one place to paint a full picture, but the project is intriguing. Like other New York chefs, she has been caught in the tractor beam of cha ca la Vong , the turmeric-and dill-scented fish dish that is a specialty of a 100-year-old Hanoi restaurant of the same name. Her version, though, supplies less dill, less sauce and less satisfaction than some others. Her two improvisations on the theme of Hanoi's best-known contribution to gastronomy, pho, are more effective. One gives you the soup without the noodles; floating in a rich and cloudy broth are ghostly white, billowing won tons that contain chopped beef fillet freely seasoned with black pepper. The other dish is, humbly enough, a plate of soupless pho noodles stir-fried with springy mushrooms, bitter greens and chopped scallions. Its simplicity makes the impact of the dish hard to explain until you learn that it has been showered with Maggi Seasoning , a soylike sauce that is the invisible secret of many Vietnamese dishes. Nodding toward Saigon, Ms. Wong makes a rendition of shaking beef by stir-frying tender and chewy marinated hanger steak with potatoes and then throwing a fistful of watercress at it. If you think that sounds like a French bistro plate, then you are starting to understand how her mind works. Ms. Wong cooks skillfully, with an appreciation for nuance, and she doesn't abuse her freedom by innovating pointlessly. It's possible, though, that she could stand to be less shy with chiles and herbs. The table salad of greenery to be wrapped around grilled shrimp offers no herbs other than mint and basil, and you'll run out of lettuce before the fourth shrimp has been dressed. The green papaya salad is a little too innocuous, and while her version of the street snack of grilled corn in fish sauce is a real success, fresh chiles would have more impact than the chile threads Ms. Wong balances on top. (Incidentally, the kitchen at Van Da makes a fine hot sauce that is like a milder and less acidic Sriracha, but servers never seem to remember to mention it until the end of the meal.) There are just three desserts. By the time you order, one or two may have been 86ed. With luck, though, the che will have survived. In Vietnam, che is thought of as a drink even though it can take the form of a pudding, as it does here, where warm pearls and threads of tapioca are cooked in coconut milk with cubes of soft taro. It is just sweet enough to qualify as a dessert. A black dust darkens the surface: black-sesame brittle, ground to powder. Even a single dessert qualifies as an impressive feat inside Van Da's tight quarters. Through the miracle of careful design, the space almost never feels cramped, but this is still an intimate restaurant. In the basement is a small seating area laid out as efficiently as the cockpit of a fighter jet; above it, at the top of a staircase, is an even smaller seating area sharing a room with a window-facing dining counter, the kitchen and a bar. The cocktails that roll off that bar, like the gin-and-celery duet called the White Tiger, are much more sharply drawn than the drinks at restaurants with twice the space and four times the budget.

{"id": 36, "data": " Talking about how good the chef Thomas Keller's new restaurant is would be easier if it weren't also painfully out of step with the city's mood. TAK Room is so determined to be \"timeless,\" as Mr. Keller has often called it, that it seems clueless. TAK Room opened in March, one of 11 restaurants inside the 720,000-square-foot mall at 20 Hudson Yards. Parts of Hudson Yards are still under construction, but enough has been finished for most New Yorkers to figure out that this fistful of glass needles stabbed into the West Side wasn't built for them. Just as the helipad the city offered to build for Amazon crystallized anger about the cruddy state of our subways, the glittering new home on 10th Avenue for global luxury brands, investment funds, law firms, business travelers and hunters of seven- or eight-figure apartments spurred a lot of New Yorkers to ask, What's in it for us? Mr. Keller's answer is a restaurant that looks and acts like a millionaire's hangout in an old New Yorker cartoon. It charges like one, too, with adjustments for inflation. An eggplant Parmesan is the least expensive main course, at $30, followed by the New Zealand salmon for $42. After that, please turn off all electronic devices and place your tray tables in the upright, locked position, because we are going up to $66 and $75 before reaching a cruising altitude of $85. Look down there -- don't the people look just like ants? TAK Room's timing is off in other ways, too. Hudson Yards has stirred up New Yorkers' latent resentment of chain stores from beyond the Hudson, and what does Mr. Keller offer them but a clone of his restaurant in Florida, the Surf Club ? The name has been changed, but the menus are nearly identical; they glorify the strait-laced, spice-free food that rich white Americans used to feed on when nobody was shaming them into being adventurous. It is the food of \"21,\" of three-martini lunches, steakhouses and country clubs: prime rib and Dover sole, iceberg lettuce and oysters Rockefeller. Of course, being a Thomas Keller production, TAK Room serves the most refined, meticulous country club food you've ever seen. Most of it is very good, and a few things are so inexplicably delicious that you have the sensation of slipping the knots of gravity and floating an inch or so above your seat. The entrance is on the fifth floor, just past Neiman Marcus. But the action is on the sixth floor, up a Deco-cubist staircase so grand that you may feel a little underdressed unless you have Carole Lombard on one arm. (There is no dress code.) At the top, you find yourself in a lounge where a pianist and upright bassist glide through satiny jazz standards. Bartenders whip up streamlined, uncomplicated drinks that are either genuine classics, like the Pendennis Club, or modern drinks built along classic proportions, like the Tritter rickey, a tall, fizzy gin number that shimmies with absinthe. Around sunset, when pink light trickles through the western windows, it has to be the most pleasant room within a mile for fighting vainly the old ennui . They let people eat in this room, too, and it is tempting. But there is more to see, room after room, all laid out by the London interior-design firm David Collins Studio. There are leather banquettes deep enough to lose a small child in. Facing them are mohair-velvet chairs that swivel so you can quietly surveil the room without craning your neck. Each table gets a white linen cloth and a flickering oil lamp behind a white porcelain shade. The other colors are black walnut, midnight blue and law-firm green. At some point a captain in a crisply tailored suit will deposit the wine list. It mostly avoids the latest fashions, like a croquet party on Nantucket. Later there will be a preamble to the menu. Under the day-to-day care of Jarrod Huth, TAK Room's chef de cuisine, it has a continental theme and an à la carte format. Highlights will be pointed out, and the prime rib will certainly be mentioned, as will the restored 1930s silver trolley on which it is ferried from table to table. Here comes a French onion dip surrounded by newly fried potato chips that are dark without a hint of charring. This is TAK Room in one extremely crunchy, lusciously creamy bite: an hors d'oeuvre from the age of Naugahyde and polyester, transformed into something so good and pure it's beyond reproach. The Parker House rolls are gravity-defying orbs served with soft cultured butter that, in the evening's best magic trick, rises from a custom-made dish in six identical ridged curls , like shrimp performing a Busby Berkeley routine. Bespoke flourishes like that are a TAK Room hallmark; see also the oyster crackers, like down pillows shrunk to the size of Chiclets, served with the silk-smooth New England clam chowder that is one of the most likable appetizers and, at $16, the best value. Another hallmark, though, is unevenness. Avocado Louie with a small bouquet of other vegetables is thrillingly right, thanks to a Thousand Island dressing that crackles with energy; the Caesar salad, made while you watch, has almost no personality. Grated Parmesan and anchovies vanish into it without a trace, along with dull croutons that could take some pointers from the oyster crackers. Something called \"warm soft boiled egg\" is a quietly joyous celebration of luxurious flavors and textures, the yolk running like lava over a buckwheat blin and a heap of warm osetra caviar in crème fraîche. (Yes, warm. It's wonderful.) And the chilled prawn cocktail is going to be my platonic ideal of the dish from now on. But the crab cake had very little crab flavor, on two different nights, although it contained almost nothing else. Lobster thermidor (now there's a name I've not heard in a long, long time) is so tender, its sauce so fluffy and rich, that eating it becomes an intimate act. Dover sole meunière, though, has neither the crisped skin nor the juicy flesh that can make this fish so alluring. Yes, life cannot be one giant plate of dancing butter-shrimp. Still, the gap between great and non-great items -- nothing comes close to bad -- is a bit too wide and comes into view a bit too often. Regulars will learn to work the menu the way golfers learn their way around the eighth hole at Pebble Beach. Some will love the prime rib, which could not be any more moist without breaking several laws of chemistry. Others will wish that it had more concentrated beef flavor and that the flaps and handles had not been trimmed off, perhaps in pursuit of some Kellerian quest for bovine symmetry. A large number will settle on the roast chicken for two. The meat is juicy but not gushy, the flavor full but not salty, the jus dark but not over-reduced. After the chicken, the pastry chef, Alex McClenaghan, can offer a highly refined coconut cake or an urbane lemon meringue tart, but you'd almost have to be insane not to get the chocolate cake. Certainly a close relative of devil's food cake, his version weaves dark-chocolate cremeux between its many, many layers, all of them wrapped in a dark-chocolate frosting. And there will be regulars, because the rewards of TAK Room, if you can find them and pay for them, are as intense as the chocolate in that cake. The core audience may turn out to be travelers on loan from the Surf Club and Mr. Keller's California strongholds, or they may just be people who like the feeling of crashing the country club. Anti-plutocrat fevers come and go, but the trappings of American aristocracy are always in style somewhere.

{"id": 37, "data": " \"Does the sheep's head soup have a lot of stuff in it?\" I asked my server. Realizing that this was somewhat ambiguous, especially applied to a dish as laden with stuff as the brew of lambs' snouts, ears, tongues, cheeks and eyeballs known in Turkey as kelle paca, I tried again. \"Is it very filling, I mean?\" My concern was a familiar one, to me at least. I was in Queens, at a new Turkish restaurant in Astoria called Lokanta , and the menu was so appealing that I wanted to try it all. Already I was set on a few bourekas, some labneh, the fava dip and some form of braised lamb over eggplant. I'd spotted another three or four dishes that I was probably going to tack on at the end of my order, as if by afterthought. I suspected that I could add a small bowl of kelle paca and still eat everything else. But a big bowl, one so thick with bits formerly affixed to a sheep's skull that a spoon would stand up in it, might tip the scale. The server pondered this for a while until a wiry man got up from his marble-topped table in the corner and conferred with her. Wearing baggy jeans, a white T-shirt and a baseball cap that kept his zinc-colored ponytail in place, he looked like a contractor, maybe a painter who'd come by to touch up the moldings and had been invited to stay for a Turkish coffee. Then he spoke to us about the sheep's head soup. \"I am a genius,\" he began. \"And even I don't know how to answer this question. I think that the question must be wrong.\" As those who chase the scent of lamb and charred eggplant around the city have probably guessed, this was no contractor. This was Orhan Yegen, the Turkish-born chef and restaurateur who has opened close to 20 Turkish restaurants over the past two decades or so while keeping up a running monologue that made him a favorite of food writers . In 2004, Mr. Yegen opened Sip Sak in Turtle Bay, then proceeded to surprise those who had charted his career by embarking on a long, stable period . All was quiet, relatively speaking, until April, when Lokanta arrived in Astoria to supplement the Greek and Cypriot menus along its stretch of Broadway, and Mr. Yegen arrived to tell customers that their questions were wrong. The kelle paca colloquy ended when I agreed to order it. After hours on the stove, the meat on the head had fallen away into about eight different textures, from frilly to ropy to collagenously chewy to tender and lean. All of this suspended in a slippery, almost sticky broth the color of cappuccino. And no, it was not too filling. Soups, braises, stews and other recipes requiring plenty of time and even more olive oil are the basis of Mr. Yegen's reputation. They set his menus apart from those at other Turkish restaurants around town, which tend to revolve around the grill. Lokanta makes very fine kofte, but for a full medley of minced and skewered meats, you are better off under the swaying chandeliers of Taci's Beyti on Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn. Lokanta will grill or roast a whole fish, but it will not be all that different from what might be served in Brooklyn at Liman , where your bass will be filleted within view of the fishing boats and swans of Sheepshead Bay. Diners in Lokanta's custody have signed on for a more nuanced view of the Turkish kitchen. Take, for instance, the shadings that lamb takes on. In hunkar begendi, chunks of it are stewed in tomatoes and peppers and ladled over an eggplant mash beaten to a memorable richness with cheese and milk. Ali nazik is, in schematic form, the same thing, built on the same foundation of milky eggplant, but in Lokanta's version the lamb is ground and simmered with onions and red and green peppers; somehow it achieves a rich, unctuous consistency that is amplified by the eggplant and the scoop of strained yogurt dropped on top. Lokanta's \"roasted lamb and rice\" is in the pilaf family, which means that the rice is not just a side dish but the heart of the recipe, baked until alluringly sweet with currants, allspice and cinnamon, then sprinkled with fresh dill at the last minute. The lamb's job is to be obligingly tender, and it succeeds, one reason the dish is requested by so many tables. To fend off boredom, I imagine, Mr. Yegen fills his manti with both lamb and beef. Each little dumpling is rolled by fingertip and is roughly the size of one. The meat has been seasoned just forcefully enough that it will announce itself, politely but clearly, as it breaks through the dough. It would be possible to sit down in front of a bowl of these, spooning them up with their warm yogurt and chile oil and dried mint, and call for another bowl a minute later. Of course, the meal should begin with strips of nigella-dotted Turkish bread and a spread or two -- maybe memorably creamy purée of dried favas; or the roughly mashed eggplant, smoky without a trace of bitterness; and one of the strained-yogurt dips, either the tangy cacik, laced with minced cucumbers, or the labneh, as firm as a new mattress. Either will prove useful as the meal goes on. So will a simple salad, especially the one with white beans and purple onions. The tightly rolled, golden bourekas are like skinny Turkish spring rolls filled with dill and melting feta. Cold poached leeks, a frequent special, are more appealing than the cold poached artichokes that have a permanent spot on the menu. If Mr. Yegen tells you that the grilled octopus is the best in the city, keep in mind that he rarely seems to leave his own restaurant. It's quite good, though, with a fugitive sweetness that may be supplied by the tomatoes and purple onions. Desserts run toward milky white puddings, nice if you are looking for a mild sedative. The baklava, imported from Turkey, is a treat for those of us who like pistachios and think sugar syrup makes a better baklava sweetener than honey. The unlikely champion, though, is the butternut squash that has been languorously baked in its own juices with nothing but sugar. The technique is one of those small tricks that helps Mr. Yegen's cooking stand out, like the perfume of lemon peel in the Turkish lemonade. Lokanta has no liquor license yet. Some customers smuggle wine through the door and keep the bottles on their tables, which are topped with radiant white marble from Turkey and surrounded by classic bentwood cafe chairs. But it is hard not to want the lemonade, which is cold and just tart enough and not very filling at all. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 38, "data": " The high cost of doing business in New York takes a toll on many restaurants in the long run, but it can also lead to compromises whose shortcomings become part of the fun -- for diners, at least. If Darryl and Melissa Burnette had been able to afford to rent a space bigger than 275 square feet for their restaurant, Belle Harlem , Mr. Burnette might do the cooking behind a wall instead of behind a counter. Ms. Burnette, his wife and business partner, might spend all night going in and out a swinging kitchen door instead of paying attention to the customers sitting at the 12 seats in the restaurant's single room. At this point, after three years in business, Belle Harlem might be run by employees, and the Burnettes might come in a few times a week to keep an eye on things. Instead they have a paid staff of one. His name is Alex Geudelekian. He was eating dinner there one night, noticed that the weeds were growing up around Mr. Burnette's ankles, asked if he needed help, and has been the sous-chef ever since. The smell of foie gras gravy with duck breast being seared on one of the three induction burners might not rush up to meet you when you step through the door, on the opposite side of Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard from Striver's Row. You might not hear the hiss of chicken being fried inside buttermilk batter before it is arranged between standing partitions of pizzelle and tied together by an amber river of truffled maple syrup warmed with jalapeños and bananas. If you didn't hear the low roar of a Searzall torch as it warms a plate and then melts and browns a patch of Cheddar, you might not know that you're about to be served Mr. Burnette's cheese-steak crostini. (These are small toasts stacked with seared filet and melted cheese, and in between are onions that have been caramelized until they're sweet enough to be a dessert topping. The Cheddar would cause every Philadelphian who lives within 10 blocks of East Passyunk Avenue to pick up the nearest blunt object, but it makes a certain amount of sense when you taste it.) Some of Belle Harlem's space limitations are, in fact, a little constricting. When the place is full, some customers have to ride sidesaddle, their knees angled away from the counter, because if they faced it head-on they'd cut off the narrow path to the restroom in the back. But 275 square feet are what the Burnettes have to work with, and they have made this shallow sliver into something rare not just in Harlem but in all Manhattan. One of the peculiarities of dining in the city, circa 2019, is that the more high-functioning a restaurant is, the less likely you are to encounter a proprietor. There are exceptions, of course, but often the most successful restaurateurs are very busy people, so they leave their dining rooms in the hands of professional managers. Proprietors aren't always as smooth as professionals, but they are as attuned to what goes on in their dining rooms as new parents are to the noises coming from a bassinet. I never quite felt as if I were attending a dinner party in the Burnettes' apartment, which is the feeling they say they're going for, but I always knew I was in a place that somebody cared about. Their original plan was to feed everyone the same meal -- a tasting menu. \"We found out pretty quickly Harlem wasn't ready,\" Mr. Burnette said in an interview. How quickly? \"We tried one night.\" Belle Harlem rolled out an à la carte menu the next day. It stuck. The first half is given to smaller plates, although one of the hallmarks of the restaurant is that the Burnettes don't serve anything truly small. They want you to eat. Two people could get away with ordering one main course and two appetizers, though I'd urge anyone going to Belle Harlem not to overlook dessert. These introductory dishes are where Mr. Burnette takes casual American vernacular food like chicken and waffles out for a stroll. His fried chicken has a convoluted, frilly crust, with plenty of golden surface area for the jalapeño-banana syrup to get lost in. The pizzelles are a new idea of his, replacing the regular waffles he used to make, and they work best when he cooks them to a dark crisp. This is also where you'll find the cheese-steak crostini, as well as spring rolls stuffed with macaroni and cheese -- kid food in a fried shell, yes, but a bacon marmalade with fresh dill makes it unexpectedly complex, a chef's dish. The bottom of the menu is more substantial: The pan-seared, smoked pork tenderloin, for instance, is bigger than what usually crosses a 12-seat tasting counter. This month, Mr. Burnette is laying the barrels of pork over a cherry compote with basil leaves, with a few snap peas for added sweetness. He brings a keen sense of what to do with ingredients as they come into season to the vegetables he grows on the roof of the Burnettes' apartment building, a block away. The tiny yields of an urban garden wouldn't satisfy a larger restaurant, but they can shuffle right onto the menu at Belle Harlem, and shuffle off again when they're all gone. This month, there are thin bands of zucchini under the beef tenderloin, and young, soft favas around the lobster salad. There are more favas over pan-seared dorade and garden chives, with the almost transparently thin noodles tossed with butter and cream and tucked under the fish fillet. Mr. Burnette, who is black and who grew up in rural southwestern Virginia, has said he worked up the nerve to move north for culinary school after seeing the chef Marcus Samuelsson on television . (\"I thought, hell, if he could do it, I could do it, too.\") Sometimes today, in his restaurant less than a mile away from Mr. Samuelsson's Red Rooster Harlem , he reaches back to his childhood for ideas. A dessert in a glass called the Triflin' Ho-Ho is an acknowledged homage to Hostess cakes, although there is an English trifle in the mix, too, as well as a trace of Spice Market , where Mr. Burnette once worked. The chocolate in the broken shards of cake pulses, intriguingly, with Urfa pepper; its heat rubs up against the passion-fruit cream, brandied cherries and whipped cream that fill the glass. A year ago, Belle Harlem eliminated tips and raised prices. If you take that into account, check totals can still seem high, especially if you happen to be served pale, limp housemade potato chips or a $42 duck breast with a bitter arugula sauce and a poached pear that tastes like alcohol. The margins must be tight. At times you almost hear them squeak, as when Ms. Burnette anxiously reminds you that you were a few minutes late and suggests you order quickly so she can turn the seat in time for the next reservation. A professional manager might have brought a more soothing manner to the exchange. But a manager might not be as genuinely happy to see a party of three walk in without a reservation just when three seats had opened up, and might not smile as widely when told that the sparkling rosé is fantastic with the lobster salad, and would she mind pouring another glass? No, she doesn't mind at all. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 39, "data": " The chef John Fraser's new restaurant has a blandly corporate name, 701West , that tells you less about the place than simply walking into the dining room. One of several operations he is running in the new Times Square Edition hotel, it is clad in paneling on the walls and ceilings. Velvet curtains and banquettes are the slightly alarming color of a blue macaw's tail feathers. Wooden blinds are usually snapped shut against the strobes of 47th Street and Seventh Avenue. To get to your table, you must first pass between two identical Champagne trolleys. An iced reservoir in the center of each is loaded with about half a dozen bottles that range in price from a Blanquette de Limoux for $26 a glass to a 2006 brut from Dom Pérignon for $66 a glass. Before you sit down, you've already learned that wine is front and center, literally and figuratively; that it is more likely to come from classic, mannerly European estates than, say, Macedonian villages still using amphoras that Odysseus drank from; that the ideal customer is not likely to get up and walk out upon being offered a $66 aperitif; and that the restaurant expects to attract so many of these customers that a single Champagne trolley is not enough. Which is to say that Marriott International and the hotelier Ian Schrager installed 701West on the 11th floor of the Edition for people who still think a leisurely, three-course dinner with a few interesting bottles and some of the customary niceties is worth spending money on. It belongs to a species of restaurant that is no longer in great supply in Manhattan, let alone on the intersection where the green neon of the Olive Garden faces off across Seventh Avenue against the giant candy bars of Hershey's Chocolate World. It also marks Mr. Fraser's first arabesques on the stage of formal dining since Dovetail closed last year. These are early days for 701West, but so far I've found the cooking more original and appealing than Dovetail's in its final phase. As you know if you've tried the fried-cauliflower buns at Nix, or the ramen-style boiled eggs at the Loyal whose yolks are red with a film of jellied chile oil, Mr. Fraser has a playful, imaginative streak. He needs it at 701West, where there is no real theme beyond wine and style. But there is enough creativity across the menu, on which he collaborates with the chef de cuisine, Rob Lawson, and the pastry chef, Sébastien Rouxel, to make dinner the engaging, somewhat eccentric experience it is clearly meant to be. Before the first courses appear, for example, there may be a \"cauliflower mille-feuille,\" the raw vegetable shaved into white sheets that are softened by chilled mezcal cream and then topped with sturgeon caviar. It's enticingly off-kilter, and another frequent amuse manages to outdo it: a spoonful or so of white-asparagus foam above a warm custard of sunflower-seed butter, dense and nutty and sweet with a few drops of honey. This is luxury dining in its way, which is not the predictable way. The menu proposes three courses for $98, but a server informed me that \"we also have à la carte, if that's more your rhythm for the evening.\" Frequently the surprises come in the form of an unexpected tweak dealt to a vegetable. Slowly cooked in beet juice, a whole beet takes on the glistening ruby intensity of raw bluefin tuna. There is an appetizer of actual bluefin as well, and it has the precise, Japanese-informed minimalism of a dish you'd get at Jean-Georges, with tiny spring peas and young turnip greens and an electrifying white cloud of grated horseradish. In a dish of fava agnolotti, the X factor is the bright, almost effervescent sparkle of vinegar-marinated tomatoes and their juices stirred into a Parmesan-rind broth. There is one mystifying appetizer in which the dueling tidal flavors of sea urchin and squid-ink risotto are allowed to cancel each other out. For the most part, though, the plates don't overreach, for all the inventiveness on display. Asparagus dipped in aioli is a good idea, of course, but what if the asparagus has been steamed inside a wrapper of thinly shaved cedar until it is nearly as smoky as country bacon? And what if the aioli is enhanced by truffles? It may sound overworked, but it is such a thrill that one of my guests asked for another plate before we could move on to the main courses, throwing the rhythm for the evening right out the window. The night will pause again if one of the main courses is the sweet potato, as everyone tries to figure out where it got its creaminess and savory depth. Even once you know it's been sealed up and baked inside a little coffin of sourdough that is streaked with green threads of wakame seaweed, you still can't quite believe that all this flavor has been achieved with an ordinary sweet potato. Some of the large pieces of fish and meat are showstoppers on their own, like the lobster that rests for four days in aged-beef fat before being broiled and set over some jammy ratatouille. When they are not, something else on the plate usually is. The long slab of roasted duck breast dredged in powdered herbes de Provence would keep my attention even without its sidekick, a curiously likable risotto made from pine nuts. In the case of lamb, the firecracker is a cocotte of fresh, creamy cranberry beans. Mr. Rouxel, recently of Upland and the Clocktower, brings a lighter-than-air quality to the desserts. Hovering over a crunchy buckwheat pastry crust is a wavy sea of pastry cream infused with parsnips. It's earthy and ethereal at the same time. He even knows what to do with white chocolate, aerating it into a mousse to frost an English-pea sponge cake, and giving it a piercing sour-cherry sorbet as a foil. All seven captains working at 701West are sommeliers, listed by name on the menu; they are assisted by back servers who are sommeliers in training. This is one of those innovations in service that seems obvious now that somebody's actually doing it. The meal can become an evening-long conversation about wine; the sommeliers even invite you to play the wine-insiders' game of guessing the identity of a mystery pour in a black glass. It is slightly incredible that a restaurant that tries so hard to give wine equal status with the cooking does not have more bottles for under $80. That said, the ones it does have tend to be very good and fairly priced. Besides 701West, Mr. Fraser is in charge of the deep-dish focaccia, carrot Bolognese and \"billboard burger\" at the Terrace and Outdoor Gardens, which is open all day on the ninth floor. He also oversees the dinner-theater menus at the Paradise Club on the seventh floor, which is currently staging \"The Devouring,\" a neo-Burlesque extravaganza (juggling, sword swallowing, aerial acrobatics) purportedly inspired by William Blake. This was no doubt the destination of the stilt walker I nearly ran into in the lobby one night. Dressed in scarlet from head to heel, she got along faster on her stilts than I do on my own legs. She was the first thing I've seen in years that gave me hope for the future of Times Square. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 40, "data": " Sooner or later, those of us who follow the career of Jean-Georges Vongerichten reach a point where our memories can't keep up. The tuna tartares start to run together; we can't recall whether it's served in lettuce cups with threads of shiso at Perry St. or at JoJo . At some point it's hard to recall what makes the chicken breast inside a resoundingly crunchy Parmesan crust at Nougatine different from the Parmesan-crusted chicken at the Mark. With his partner, Phil Suarez, Mr. Vongerichten has founded scores of new restaurants around the world. Nearly 40 of them are still up and running, 15 in New York. Devising menus for each new place, he repeats himself occasionally, but more often he rearranges old patterns. Lime juice is traded for yuzu, cherry vinegar comes in for balsamic. Almost always, the result is a dish that is similar enough to his past work to be recognizably Vongerichtenesque but different enough to seem fresh. Maybe he can keep track of it in his head, but for the rest of us it would be really useful to have a family tree of every dish he ever invented, with its parentage and offspring. Something like 23andMe , it could tell you which strands of kitchen DNA are shared by which Vongerichten restaurants -- 23andV. This service would come in handy in times like the present, when critics and superfans are trying to metabolize the two restaurants Mr. Vongerichten opened in New York City during a single week in May. One is the Paris Café , a casual, all-day proposition inside Eero Saarinen's T.W.A. terminal at Kennedy International Airport, now gloriously resurrected as the TWA Hotel. The second is a polished seafood house that sits out in the East River on the end of Pier 17, next to the wreck of the old Fulton Fish Market; it's called the Fulton . Because I've been to both so recently, I can report confidently that the Fulton slices deep-red strawberries over strawberry ice cream and a sorbet made from strawberries and red wine to make its strawberry sundae, while the one at the Paris Café substitutes dried strawberries. That version isn't bad, but there is an undeniable difference between fresh summer berries and dehydrated ones, and that difference suggests the quality gap between the two restaurants. The best reasons to go to the Paris Café are Saarinen's glass walls, gliding curves and suspended catwalk, although the dining areas are swell, too, smartly evoking Raymond Loewy's original design for the space, which looked like a coffee shop on the moon. The place has some likable pizzas and salads, and it vaults clear over the other restaurants at the airport. But the recipes seem designed not to push the kitchen too hard, the menu is even more Vongerichtenesque than usual, and any dishes involving fruits or vegetables will make you wonder whether the produce truck drove to La Guardia instead. The Fulton, though, is a grown-up production. Under the day-to-day command of Noah Poses, the executive chef, it is easily the best seafood restaurant to open in Manhattan since the Pool , and easier to afford. Yes, a handful of items on the menu have that glassy-eyed stare, but almost everything else comes through. To get to the Fulton, you have to walk almost all the way to the end of the pier, where some tall planters cordon off the Fulton's outdoor tables. All the tables, indoors and out, have a view of the Brooklyn Bridge, but the best backdrops are inside and upstairs, where you can see that you're surrounded by water. Mentioning the view as a selling point will make some New Yorkers cringe. But Pier 17's developer, clearly hoping to erase the stigma, has recruited David Chang, Andrew Carmellini and Mr. Vongerichten. Day trippers and tourists will love the Fulton, in any case, and they will be right. True, the outdoor patio feels like the beachside bar of some island resort, with soft-core club music playing and servers carrying too-small trays slinking around in long skirts. Once you get inside, though, the tension in the open kitchen lets you know this is, in fact, New York. Running a seafood house gives Mr. Vongerichten an opening to lead with one of his strong suits, raw fish. The sea trout tartare is stirred with raw oysters and horseradish, which creates the uncanny momentary illusion that you're eating beef. White ponzu, made from white soy sauce, is the centerpiece of a platter of iced sashimi. Local fluke, taking a bath in habanero vinaigrette, is topped with mint and Sichuan buttons; even if you know what's coming -- Sichuan buttons are the flower buds of the toothache plant, which when chewed, produce a numbing and cooling sensation -- the dish is a surprise. The Fulton's Manhattan clam chowder is spicy, thick with potatoes and a healthy portion of clams. It's the rare version that tastes as good as it sounds, although purists will deduct one point for the absence of oyster crackers. There's a very intriguing sesame-poppy crust on the soft-shell crabs; you have just enough time to register the seeds before a potent green salsa of coriander and jalapeño kicks in. Few chefs are as skilled at using acidity, heat and salt to bring definition to a dish. So it's a surprise to realize how generic the Fulton's fish stew is, or to wonder what the ingredient is that throws the red snapper ceviche in watermelon juice out of whack. A separate menu card lets you know that most of the seafood in the main courses can be ordered \"simply cooked.\" I was never curious enough to try it, being too distracted by the salmon in a cumin-coriander seed crust so fragrant it turns heads; the sea bass and carrots in a life-affirming pool of lemon-turmeric sauce; and the detailed-oriented fish and crisps, a brick of flounder kept at scalding temperature by a leakproof and supernaturally crunchy buckwheat batter. Served with mashed fresh peas, it could almost pass for English if it didn't come with saffron aioli. Most distracting of all is the whole black bass baked inside a fish-shaped pastry lavishly decorated with golden scales, fins, gills and other parts the bass itself won't be needing anymore. It takes a good 10 minutes to unveil it, fillet it and then plate it together with slices of crust, some tomato concassé and a sauce choron, and I doubt many movies playing in theaters now can rival it for entertainment. Wonderful as it is to see one of the showpieces of pre-nouvelle cuisine given so much attention, you could ask whether whole fish en croute really makes sense after, say, kale salad. Mr. Vongerichten's technical approach may let him generate a menu full of smart, reliably pleasurable food, but it doesn't guarantee that it will all hang together. The pastry menu does, though, by sneakily staying true to classic American desserts. What's sold as Meyer lemon pudding turns out to be more like a lemon meringue tart with a quick, pulsing acidity; the apricot pie is more like a crisp, with oatmeal streusel on top; and the highlight of the strawberry sundae isn't the fresh fruit but the strawberry ice cream, its flavor straight out of the summertime ice cream shacks in a thousand vacation towns.

{"id": 41, "data": " Some restaurants push their tasting menus. Rezdôra doesn't. A few steps down from the sidewalk, on the same block of East 20th Street as Gramercy Tavern and the brownstone where Teddy Roosevelt was born, Rezdôra lists a \"regional pasta tasting\" for $90 on its menu. The region in question is Emilia-Romagna, whose refinements in the art of rolling and saucing noodles are admired even by Italians from other parts of the country. Chances are that most of the five pastas in the tasting are exactly the ones you picture when you think about Emilia-Romagna, starting with tortellini in brodo. This would seem to make it an easy sell, and yet servers at Rezdôra never tried to sell me on the tasting. Until I asked about it one night, I had never seen the separate menu card that describes each course. With some hesitation, I ordered it. Every one of the pastas was excellent, and one or two would be worth walking a long distance for. After the fifth course was gone, it slowly dawned on me that Stefano Secchi, Rezdôra's chef and one of its owners, had just laid down a straight flush. The tortellini were penny-size hoops rolled around minced and blended pork in a parcel just big enough to suggest the idea of meat. \"This is a special broth made from older chickens,\" a server said as he poured a steaming liquid from a kettle over the tortellini. It was the color of turkey gravy. The broth spent about half a day on the burner; drew some of its power from melted Parmigiano-Reggiano; and was more intense than canned chicken broth in roughly the same way that a dry-aged rib-eye is more intense than a McDonald's all-beef patty. This was followed by a smooth, almost fluffy tomato-basil sauce over maccheroni al pettine, delicate tubes with ridges they get from being rolled by hand along a comb made for the job. Three straw-colored blobs that looked like melted Brie turned out to be a glossy and wonderful fonduta made from Parmigiano-Reggiano. From there it was on to tortelloni, each about three bites big, filled with plush fresh ricotta and shiny with melted brown butter in which a few sage leaves had been bubbled. If we are talking about Emilia-Romagna we have to talk about ragù, and that was the next course, tossed with slim ribbons of tagliolini. Some people will find the ragù saltier than they like. Almost everyone will find it more tender and smooth than the last 20 or 30 ragús they ate. The tour winds down with round, meat-filled anolini, a branch of the ravioli family that resides in Parma. They are served in something called crema di Parmigiano; you will not be far off if you imagine an Alfredo sauce cooked for one of the more sybaritic Roman emperors. This is not Rome, though, and the sauce gets the tart counterpoint it needs from an inky, 25-year-old balsamic vinegar poured straight from the bottle. Mr. Secchi blew into town in May on a small gust of publicity whipped up over his time at Osteria Francescana , the Modena workshop where Massimo Bottura reconfigures the touchstone flavors of the region in dishes with names like \"memories of a mortadella sandwich.\" Mr. Bottura's approach to menu writing seems to have rubbed off on Mr. Secchi more than his experimental urges did. At Rezdôra, you are unlikely to catch the kitchen using any overtly modernist techniques, but you may well encounter \"cherry season in Vignola,\" a pleasant if somewhat too soupy plate of stracciatella with toasted almonds, almond milk and cherries both sweet and sour; or \"cow grazing in Emilia-Romagna,\" a sirloin basted with butter whose richness is modulated by a sauce of sweet red peppers; or \"Grandma walking through forest in Emilia,\" a transfixing plate of mushroom purée, slivered snap-pea pods and little hats of spinach pasta filled with braised leeks. If we are tracing influences, though, Mr. Secchi's cooking at Rezdôra seems to have been molded at least as deeply by his time working at the pasta station of another restaurant in Modena, Hosteria Giusti . Laura Galli Morandi, Giusti's chef, steadfastly defends the style of the local nonna tradition that Mr. Secchi channels in his pasta tasting and other parts of his menu. Like a meal in Giusti's four-table dining room, one at Rezdôra can and probably should start with prosciutto and other manifestations of salted pork draped over warm pillows of fried dough called gnocchi fritti. Before leaving Italy, Mr. Secchi also cooked at Antica Moka in Modena and All'Enoteca in the Piedmont; after coming back home to Dallas, where he grew up, he ran the kitchens of two restaurants his parents own there. Still, I suspect the Bottura connection is responsible for the speed with which the bar stools fill up when the restaurant opens at 5:30 each night, for the difficulty of reserving one of the other 48 seats, and for the way would-be customers collect in eddies outside the door to strategize. Not much about the interior is likely to lure crowds; with its brick walls, timbered ceiling and bare wood tables, it looks like any number of Manhattan restaurants that emulate the trattorias, enotecas and osterias of Italy. And of course, people who eat at Rezdôra have a way of becoming repeat customers. They come back even though it is still a young restaurant and occasionally makes a young restaurant's mistakes. One night, the stewed cannellini beans placed alongside black sea bass and black garlic zabaglione were still crunchy; the rock shrimp served with strozzapreti could have been a little less tough and tasted a little shrimpier. And some of the original pastas aren't quite as stunning as the classics, but then every grandmother in Emilia-Romagna could have told you that. Mr. Secchi is still one of the most appealing new talents in years to enter the city's Italian restaurant scene, the kind of cook who can unite ordinary people who just like to eat pasta and the fanatics who collect menus from Osteria Francescana. (The date-stamped copy of the regional tasting menu that's given out at the end of the night, signed by Mr. Secchi and his kitchen crew, must be for this crowd.) He also has the good luck to come along when some of the figures who dominated New York's Italian landscape for the past two decades or so have either disappeared or gone into hibernation. There is one more workplace that I hope has left a mark on Mr. Secchi: his parents' restaurants in Texas, both of which are called Ferrari's Italian Villa & Chop House . The first has been in business since 1983, a life span that any restaurateur would envy. The odds are against Rezdôra's being around 36 years from now, but Mr. Secchi and his business partner have made one move that tends to be associated with longevity in New York restaurants. They bought the building. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 42, "data": " In the fall of 1980, Patrick Clark, the first chef at Keith McNally's first restaurant, the Odeon , helped introduce nouvelle cuisine to New York when it was all the rage in Europe. Nearly every place Mr. McNally has built since then has been a firm rejection of all that is fashionable in food, and each one has been, at least in its first few months, the most fashionable restaurant in town. The one he opened in early June in the meatpacking district, Pastis , was assembled partly from the salvaged bones of a nearby restaurant he closed five years ago, Pastis. (He salvaged the name, too.) The onion soup, the meaty snails sloshing around in the divots of a black iron snail pan with what must be half a pint of garlic butter, and a few other old war horses from the original menu have been summoned for one more joust on the battlefield. In short, the new Pastis takes almost everything straight from the old Pastis , which in turn took almost everything from the stodgiest, least trend-conscious sort of French cafes and brasseries. Needless to say, reservations are harder to come by than at any other New York restaurant that's opened this year. The paradox of this is that Pastis is really meant for those nights when you decide to cancel your reservations at the little nine-seat tasting counter where the menu is inspired by Kieslowski's \"Decalogue.\" It is for those times when you get an urge to eat a Gruyère omelet after 10 p.m., cooked medium-rare, flecked with herbs, skillfully rolled and staunchly backed up by a cold white from the Savoie. Urges like that do not typically announce themselves three weeks in advance, and they don't tend to survive exposure to rooms filled with people who have read about Pastis on the blogs but haven't yet figured out what it is for. For much of his life, Mr. McNally has been chipping, cracking, distressing and weathering interiors that are the architectural equivalent of rumpled sweaters two sizes too large. Perhaps the largest and certainly the most rumpled of all is Pastis. It doesn't have the corner entrance it had at its former address, or the long communal table that sliced through the front room like a surfboard. And the shelves of cigarette packs are definitely gone. ( You could still smoke in restaurants in 1999, when Pastis opened.) But the magazine racks are back, along with the overhead fans turning steadily below a stamped tin ceiling. Once again the walls are covered with chipped subway tiles, white, framed by black grout. The chairs still don't match. The ambient light is the color of a Scotch and soda and makes everybody look the way they do after you've drunk one. On an antique mirror, or one that looks like an antique, someone has scrawled a menu of desserts, almost none of which Pastis actually serves. You can, however, get an energetically whisked dark-chocolate mousse under shaved curls of chocolate, or a baba au rhum so drenched in booze that it might spontaneously combust if it weren't being restrained by a white dune of whipped Chantilly cream. The most significant change from the first Pastis to the second happened offstage. Mr. McNally, who had a stroke two years ago, has brought on the restaurateur Stephen Starr as a partner who, essentially, manages everything except the design. Familiar faces from La Mercerie and other Starr enterprises work alongside loyal retainers from the McNally empire. The McNally troops are exquisitely poised, self-assured, able to spot a misplaced butter knife from across the street. The Starr cadre is more casual, and occasionally a server will ask your opinion of \"the flavors so far,\" a question that has surely never been uttered at Minetta Tavern . Mr. Starr has oversight of the wine list, which is less conservative than a typical McNally lineup, and of the food, which has not been a strong suit of the McNally organization since the chefs Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr went out on their own. Pastis's chef, Michael Abt, was until recently in charge of the kitchen at the Washington restaurant Le Diplomate , which Mr. Starr owns. Better qualifications would be hard to conjure, given that Le Diplomate is essentially an imitation McNally restaurant. Taking his cues from the old days, Mr. Abt is putting out simple, unadorned, hunger-obliterating French cuisine drawn from the era before supermarkets and fast food. The salad of pickled herring and carrots with boiled potatoes might come straight from Brasserie Lipp . The country pâté is laden with chicken livers and riddled with soft white pork fat in gobs the size of gumdrops, although it could stand more salt, and I'd be happy to trade the slab of butter that comes with it for a pot of mustard. The pâté is made in house, as is the gorgeously smooth boudin blanc. With the boudin, you want puréed potatoes that are almost liquid. That is what you get. You might argue that, when it offers chilled king crab legs to be dipped in aioli, this unextravagant cafe breaks character. Does the same apply to garnishing sardines served in the can with an ingot of prized, costly butter made by Jean-Yves Bordier? Maybe. I thought, in any case, that the sardines and the olive oil they are packed in tended to talk over the butter. The half roast chicken is not in the same class as the birds that Antoine Westermann cooked when he was still at Le Coq Rico , but it is probably as good a roast chicken as any normal restaurant can produce. The duck in olives, though, is misconceived; the sauce is thin, acrid and one-dimensional instead of head-spinningly rich, the way it is at Allard in Paris . The seafood -- the trout amandine with its sautéed skin taut beneath its armor of toasted almonds; steamed mussels in a lemon broth that's satiny with melted butter; an entire steamed branzino with enough crisp summer vegetables to make a salad -- is very appealing, though that won't stop the people who are going to get steak frites without even a glance at the menu. Those people may get fries that are crunchy and golden, or they might end up with a limp, oily batch, or they may get both in the same night, as I did. At the length of 20 years, memories are untrustworthy, but I'm reasonably sure the food at Pastis is better than it used to be. The wine is certainly more interesting. What's gone, and won't be back now that the surrounding addresses have been taken over by shops like Loro Piana, Sephora, Hermès and RH, is the pure downtown electricity Pastis once generated. Sharing real estate with meat cutters in blood-smeared aprons and prostitutes in dresses as tight as the skins on a boudin blanc, Pastis did a drop-dead perfect imitation of the coolest restaurant in France. The French part was fake, but the cool was real. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 43, "data": " New York used to be a one-mole town, and that was mole poblano. A chocolate-colored, bittersweet agglomeration of two dozen or so ingredients, it comes, like most of the city's Mexican immigrants, from the state of Puebla. Typically simmered with chicken, mole poblano was a staple of takeout joints and lunch counters and restaurants before anyone took Mexican food in New York seriously. All the other moles -- Oaxaca's mole verde, say, which gets its green color from pumpkin seeds, tomatillos and fresh herbs -- were about as rare as a mandarin duck in Central Park. In recent years, as these once-exotic species have become regular features of the menus at Cosme , Empellón , Claro and other restaurants, mole poblano has become something like the pigeon of Mexican sauces, too common and familiar to be worth noticing. If you share this low view of mole poblano, you owe it to yourself to have the one at Casa Enrique . The chef, Cosme Aguilar, calls it mole de Piaxtla, after the Pueblan town where his father grew up, and as a reminder that there is not just one mole poblano but many. Some have apple in addition to raisins. Some are thickened with animal crackers. Mr. Aguilar remembers that in his childhood home, plantains were allowed to hang until they were black before they could be pounded into mole. Maybe this explains the particular sweetness of Casa Enrique's version, which is not the candy-bar sweetness of some. It's deep and complicated. The character of this mole de Piaxtla unfurls as you eat, whether the sauce has been soaked into enchiladas filled with chicken or simply pooled on a plate over and under a quartered chicken and yellow rice cooked with peas. Mr. Aguilar has been frying, blending and stirring mole de Piaxtla since Casa Enrique opened in 2012, just off Vernon Boulevard, in Long Island City, Queens. In fact, he has barely changed his menu since our Hungry City critic, Ligaya Mishan, reviewed it the next year. Mr. Aguilar says he is emulating the restaurants he likes best in Mexico, ones whose kitchens make the same dishes year in and year out. Whether despite this or because of it, the restaurant seems to have improved in subtle ways. Acoustic panels tacked to the ceiling make conversation easier. Servers, always welcoming, have become experts at anticipating the meal's ebb and flow. They'll step in just when you're ready for a fresh drink, maybe a margarita with some tamarind this time to offset the raw-sugar syrup. They'll gauge the precise moment when you're ready to have dinner plates cleared to make room for dessert. Or they'll break away from your table just long enough to join in a full-throated singing of \"Happy Birthday\" around a slice of tres leches cake with a candle stuck in it on the other side of the room. This may happen three or four times a night, probably not because Casa Enrique looks particularly festive -- from floor to ceiling, it's done almost entirely in white -- but, I'd guess, because regulars know it regularly outperforms any number of other restaurants that might seem to be more special on the surface but aren't, really. Also, the tres leches cake, if not as soggy with condensed milk as it could be, is still pretty good, though I think the flan is almost mandatory, and it, too, is a perfectly credible birthday-candle holder. Although the guacamole is freshly mashed and pleasingly minimalist, I tend to skip it as long as the people I'm with don't mind. Instead I'll head straight for the two-bite sopecitos topped with refried beans and loose chorizo, or the albondigas in cumin-laced chipotle sauce, each of the three meatballs stuffed with hard-cooked eggs. The best Mexican seafood dishes often come from restaurants that specialize in them. Mr. Aguilar, though, seems equally at home with fish and meat. The market fish offered as a main course -- lately a black sea bass -- has always been seared to a crisp on the skin side. Still, in all these years I've never been convinced that the corn under it compares to the best street-corner esquites, or that it and the fish really add up to a whole dish. The seafood appetizers, on the other hand, are some of my favorite things at Casa Enrique: the delicately fried oysters sitting in a mayonnaise that gets its tangerine color from ground chiles; the ceviche, freshly tossed with lime and herbs; the crab tostadas, loaded with a thin slice or two of Serrano chile, chopped tomato, leaves of cilantro, smooth avocado salsa and a spoonful of crab meat, pure and clean; and the shrimp cocktail, which gets its roundness and slight richness, I think, from orange soda, just the way you'd hope. Mr. Aguilar is not one of those chefs who set up masa factories in their basements. Casa Enrique's corn tortillas do not have the pretty floral aromas of Cosme's, or the sweet, focused corn flavor you taste in Claro's. But they are better than you'd find almost anywhere else in New York. They give a boost to the tacos, made with braised tongue or brisket; crumbled chorizo; or fried, battered fish, and they are especially delicious soaked in salsa verde and wrapped around roasted poblanos in cream to make enchiladas Doña Blanca. And while Cosme's more modern approach has soaked up more media attention, I've encountered more bloops and wobbles eating there than I have exploring the far more traditional menu at Casa Enrique. It isn't necessarily the more interesting restaurant, but it's the one where I'm more confident that if I went there tonight, everything would taste exactly the way it was supposed to. The pozole will be dark and intense, though not especially spicy, with tender strands of pork in the broth and all the usual mix-ins waiting on the side. The pork ribs will be slowly braised, in the style of Chiapas, in a thick cooked salsa built on a foundation of guajillo chiles. These ribs are not to be confused with the baby back ribs, cooked in an even thicker, creamier pipian rojo, that sometimes turn up as a daily special. Best of all, perhaps, will be the chamorro de borrego, or lamb shank stewed with chickpeas; it will be very tender and very flavorful in its rough sauce of pulla chiles with crushed guaje seeds. The name of that sauce is huaxmole, or sometimes guaxmole, or even mole de guaje. Yes, it's a mole, and one that rarely flies as far north as New York City.

{"id": 44, "data": " The nice man who brought samples of the banoffee macaron to me and other customers one recent morning began, a few moments later, to gently buff the doors and windows of a new, rose-gold prototype car with a soft cloth. I could see this because the car and I were sharing a room on West 14th Street. The car was in the back and I was in the middle, sitting at one of the cafe tables near the stairs to the second floor, where there is a bar shaped like a wheel and a restaurant with a menu devised by Gregory Marchand, the chef of the Frenchie restaurants in Paris and London. The employees in all of these rooms work for the Union Square Hospitality Group , which I suppose means that Danny Meyer, the group's founder and one of the world's best-known restaurateurs, is now also in the business of polishing automobiles. The whole operation is called Intersect by Lexus , which gives you a good idea who made the car and was paying to keep it shiny and free of dust. Intersect by Lexus is one of those modern places where brands, instead of asking you to buy one of their products then and there, instead try to make you feel the kinds of emotions about the brand that may lead to a sale later on. This is a job formerly performed by advertisements. In fact, Lexus used to publish a print magazine and mail it to its customers, back when that seemed like a good way to persuade people to have emotions about a car. Now we live in the age of the \"branded experience.\" A toilet-paper manufacturer will send you a wheeled toilet on demand . A mattress company will encourage you to sleep inside a roaming \"napmobile.\" Makers of a crunchy orange snack open restaurants, lasting just a few days , where chefs put the crunchy orange snack into meatballs, tacos, cheesecakes and everything else. You cannot get Anne Burrell to sprinkle a Lexus over the top of your mac and cheese, however, and not just because the cheapest one costs $33,000 more than a bag of crunchy orange snacks. Intersect by Lexus takes a different approach, closer to that of A/D/O , a \"creative hub\" in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, owned by the car brand Mini. A/D/O offers temporary exhibitions, talks, performances, work spaces for designers and a sun-filled, roomy Scandinavian cafe whose kitchen was, for a time, overseen by the chef Fredrik Berselius and the restaurateur Claus Meyer . (Mr. Berselius is no longer involved.) When I ate at the cafe, shortly after A/D/O opened, the food barely dented my consciousness, although I remember thinking that if I worked nearby I probably would drop in for lunch or a cortado. In the same way, if I find myself in the meatpacking district by day, I might join the Wi-Fi philosophers who occupy the spindle-backed chairs downstairs at Intersect, just so I could get a maple-bacon scone, a recipe imported from Frenchie to Go on the Rue du Nil in Paris. On the other hand, I'd go well out of my way to eat upstairs at Intersect again. It's not a restaurant in three dimensions -- the service, while skilled, is a bit anonymous, and the interior is a hodgepodge of expensive, subtle design and bric-a-brac that might have been ordered from a catalog. But the food is some of the most engaging I've come across in the past few months, and it will go away after the end of March, when Mr. Marchand's menu will be replaced by one devised by another chef from somewhere else in the world, chosen by representatives from Union Square Hospitality Group and Lexus. (A formal review, with stars, would be obsolete almost as soon as it was published.) I've never made it to Frenchie or its branch in London. Many New York chefs have, however, and working my way through Mr. Marchand's dishes at Intersect helped me understand what other restaurants around town have been trying to imitate: the charred leaves, the cooked grains, the gently swirling patterns that suggest the chef has been plating food on a turntable. Grilled baby leek greens angled out around a pile of barley topped with what looked like a deviled egg. It was, in fact, a smoked and lemon-spiked yolk plopped in the center of some \"whites\" made of Parmesan sabayon. Spice and crunch came from puffed barley dusted with piment d'Espelette. It was just tricky enough, this dish. And I loved the way a caraway brioche, pickled mustard seeds and cucumbers completed the deli allusions begun by a foie gras terrine with layers of soft, smoky pastrami. There was a very welcome spin on skate grenobloise in which the fish was replaced by creamy white halibut under a golden bread-crumb crust; sea beans extended the briny flavor of capers in the brown butter sauce. And if this all sounds a bit cerebral, the big, pillowy, pan-seared gnocchi with fried sweetbreads and veal-glazed mushrooms proved that Mr. Marchand knows the appeal of animal instincts. What to make of those few dishes that did not come together -- the pebbles of cauliflower under a layer of seeds and nuts that looked as if it had spilled from a bird feeder, or the lukewarm chocolate mousse at the bottom of a deep bowl? Was the problem Mr. Marchand's recipes? The way the Union Square Hospitality kitchen crew, led by Nickolas Martinez, had carried them out? The local terroir? Mr. Martinez and Dylan Shipsey, the general manager, say they want customers to feel as if they are walking into Frenchie in Paris. Intersect does not have the premodern limestone wall and ceiling timbers of the Rue du Nil, but Mr. Marchand tried to sprinkle some Right Bank pixie dust on West 14th Street by choosing the plates and bowls, consulting on flower arrangements and sharing his Spotify playlists. Maybe those things help. But the dining room, by the design firm Wonderwall , mostly looks like money to me, apart from the shelves half-filled with coffee-table books, black crow figurines and other eerily generic knickknacks. At least somebody had the good sense to keep the car downstairs, by the restrooms, before it was rolled out last weekend to make room for another temporary exhibition. In what may not be a good sign for Lexus, nobody paid much attention to it when I was there, but somebody was always marveling about the toilets, the Japanese kind that seem to know exactly what you are going to do before you do. The chef-in-residence conceit is not unique to Intersect. On Mulberry Street, Chefs Club also turns its permanent kitchen crew over to somebody else's menu; a new restaurant in Houston, the Decatur Bar & Popup Factory , gives its entire space to prospective restaurateurs for three months at a time so they can test-drive their ideas before going out on their own. The chefs of Contra , in Manhattan, and other restaurants sometimes turn over the menu to friends of theirs for a night or two. The most ambitious experiment in this vein may be In Situ , the restaurant inside the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art that on any given day faithfully reproduces a dozen or so dishes that are strongly identified with other restaurants around the world. To understand the appeal for chefs of these pop-ups and residencies, think about the Instagram posts, the email-address caches, the preview news items, even the occasional reviews they generate. For a few months' or even a few nights' work, a restaurant can refresh its aura of newness and relevance. In an era that feeds on novelty, chefs who just keep plugging along can seem older than they really are. The events make the host restaurant look cooler, too. (It's been a while since Union Square Hospitality Group hired a chef who got menu analysts chattering the way Mr. Marchand does.) And of course, people who go to these dinners can boast about them on social media. It's a big, beautiful marketing ecosystem in which everybody from predators to bottom feeders gets to believe they're at the top of the food chain.", "label": [[41, 57, "DISH"], [283, 299, "LOC"], [560, 565, "LOC"], [570, 576, "LOC"], [2230, 2242, "CUISINE"], [2243, 2247, "TYPE"], [2410, 2414, "TYPE"], [2628, 2648, "LOC"], [2777, 2794, "DISH"], [2819, 2833, "EST"], [2841, 2851, "LOC"], [2855, 2860, "LOC"], [1740, 1749, "FOOD"], [1751, 1756, "FOOD"], [1758, 1769, "FOOD"], [1860, 1874, "FOOD"], [2072, 2092, "LOC"], [2926, 2935, "EST"], [3572, 3580, "DISH"], [3598, 3604, "LOC"], [3611, 3619, "LOC"], [3693, 3702, "EST"], [3792, 3806, "FOOD"], [853, 871, "DISH"], [2744, 2753, "EST"], [3812, 3825, "FOOD"], [3916, 3940, "FOOD"], [3969, 3975, "FOOD"], [4007, 4018, "FOOD"], [4039, 4067, "FOOD"], [4115, 4131, "FOOD"], [4160, 4173, "FOOD"], [4186, 4204, "FOOD"], [4266, 4281, "FOOD"], [4283, 4304, "FOOD"], [4309, 4318, "FOOD"], [4333, 4337, "TYPE"], [4359, 4376, "DISH"], [4404, 4412, "FOOD"], [4447, 4464, "DISH"], [4478, 4482, "FOOD"], [4506, 4519, "FOOD"], [4535, 4552, "FOOD"], [4554, 4563, "FOOD"], [4593, 4599, "FOOD"], [4607, 4625, "FOOD"], [4684, 4751, "DISH"], [4893, 4904, "FOOD"], [4922, 4927, "FOOD"], [4932, 4936, "FOOD"], [5006, 5022, "DISH"], [5324, 5332, "EST"], [5336, 5341, "LOC"], [5343, 5352, "EST"], [5423, 5433, "LOC"], [5475, 5485, "LOC"], [5500, 5516, "LOC"], [6307, 6322, "LOC"], [6324, 6334, "EST"], [6423, 6430, "LOC"], [6436, 6463, "EST"], [6624, 6630, "EST"], [6636, 6645, "LOC"], [6789, 6796, "EST"], [6825, 6859, "LOC"]]}
{"id": 45, "data": " Dated was the word one friend used after going to Benno , and if you've eaten there, too, you'll know why. It's as if the past 15 years in food never happened. The menu seems to be stuck in some time between 1994, when Thomas Keller bought the French Laundry, and 2004, when he opened Per Se with a young Jonathan Benno leading the kitchen. The restaurant will probably be a tough sell to those diners who expect all restaurants to fall on a continuum between Noma and the Salt Bae place . But I prefer it to any number of newer, self-consciously modern restaurants, some of which are so determined to be of the moment that they might as well have a time stamp. Benno is not trying to be contemporary. It's trying to be delicious. And it is, from start to finish, almost without exception. Benno is the third of three dining operations that Mr. Benno opened last year in the Evelyn Hotel , on East 27th Street. It is the one where the prices, and presumably the stakes, are highest. We know it is a statement restaurant because Mr. Benno has put his name on it, for the first time in his career. Whatever the statement is, it is not forward-looking. Most of the statement is in French (barigoule, mousseline, tête de veau, béarnaise), a significant part is in Italian (carnaroli risotto, garganelli verde, pecorino ginepro) and not one word is in Danish or Mandarin. The statement has a lot to say on the topics of stocks and purées and accurate chopping and patient skimming; it is entirely silent on the subjects of fermented vegetables, or foraging, or immigration, or food deserts, or hashtags. The statement is delivered in a windowless hotel dining room to people sitting comfortably on black-leather chairs or velvet banquettes the color of a pinot noir from the Loire Valley. It takes the form of a fixed number of courses, three or four or five, your choice. One will be dessert and one a main course. None of them is a small plate meant for sharing. None is a large-format plate either, unless you count the veal sirloin chop that arrives on a silver platter in slices that are as pink and delicately shaded as the cheek on any blushing young aristocrat Fragonard ever painted. The presentations are not overly dramatic. They can be disarmingly modest, like the cold slice of fish terrine that appeared before the appetizers one night looking pale and somewhat lost. I barely noticed it. Then I tasted fennel and other bouillabaisse flavors and -- excuse me, what was your name again? -- I started to pay attention. It is not news that the liquid yolk of an egg tastes good trickled over baby leeks, fingerlings, black-truffle froth and pioppini mushrooms the size of shirt buttons. But just how good it is makes an interesting item. Lamb saddle, with grill marks that could come from a steakhouse, is served with fairytale eggplant and Thumbelina carrots. Each vegetable in this miniature garden is planted in a purée or a reduced essence of itself. Each is very good, and the carrots are fantastic. Alongside them sits lamb breast that has been pressed into a rich little brick coated in bread crumbs. One corner of this brick sits in a dark-green spread that tastes like gremolata. Not one combination of flavors on this plate is original, and it doesn't matter at all. The Italian food that Mr. Benno made at his last restaurant, Lincoln Ristorante , could be impressive, but I sometimes had the sense that he was cooking from the outside in, trying to unlock the flavors of Italy through process and method. The results didn't always match the evident effort. I still got a bit of that feeling from his food at Leonelli Taberna , in the back of the Evelyn lobby. It's supposed to be the hotel's casual Italian restaurant, and it would be if you didn't sometimes catch the food trying to relax. Only a lasagna with green noodles below a dark field of browned béchamel seemed completely comfortable with itself. (On the streetside end of the hotel is a pastry shop and bakery selling two-foot-long flatbreads called focaccia that have more in common with Roman pizza al taglio.) The cooking at Benno, overseen by Justin Skribner, the chef de cuisine, doesn't appear to be plagued by a similar anxiety. The French ideas, like a drum of pig's trotter under a fried quail egg with flageolets and other beans, or the darkly seared duck breast with melting foie gras and a savory triangle of duck leg, dates and pistachios in brik pastry, have an easy inevitability. Pasta is unlikely to become the thing Benno is known for. Still, when the kitchen stretches to Italy, nice things happen. Lobster fra diavolo, with the bent shells called lumache, is a tribute to an American pop hit made over, in the Thomas Keller tradition, with maximum clarity and precision. Spaghetti made with grano arso, or burned-wheat flour, tasted pleasantly toasted rather than incinerated as it soaked up the liquor of tiny hard-shell clams and a soft mass of very fresh sea urchin roe. Technique never overplayed its hand in these dishes. The only time it came up short was when a drum of steelhead salmon poached in olive oil arrived slightly mushy and underdone. A week later, the fish was cooked more successfully. The scope of the Evelyn's dining operation is big enough to support a full-time baker (Lisa Kalemkiarian, responsible for Benno's needle-tipped mini-baguettes, among other items) and pastry chef (Lindsey Bittner, whose desserts include a rosemary flan with candied cranberries that I ordered every time I went, so I could watch other people try it for the first time). You couldn't call the wine list dated, with its unwashed, uncombed natural types among other groomed, sedate numbers, and some fine values between $50 and $75 tiptoeing among the super-Tuscans and 2005 Bordeaux. All this should persuade some skeptics to give Benno a try. The restaurant's greatest challenge is that the food seems to come from an era that's too old to seem fresh but too recent to feel nostalgic about. When pop music is that age, we cringe. When buildings are that age, we knock them down before they can be landmarked. But sometimes one chef cooking what he believes is better than 10 chefs cooking what somebody else believes.

{"id": 46, "data": " The fancy mall in the Time Warner Center known as the Shops at Columbus Circle has a lot to answer for. Its opening, in 2003, may have marked Manhattan's capitulation to a retail landscape ruled by chains rather than independent, homegrown businesses. For diners, the mall is best known for its eating-and-drinking zone named, with matchless pretentiousness, the Restaurant Collection. This brought us Per Se and Masa , which overnight made the city's other high-end restaurants seem as affordable as Veselka . It was the start of a new class of restaurants where dinner would be priced like a luxury good, with entry-level meals that today cost $300 or more. Much more, in Masa's case. The purpose of this exclusivity was to signal to people with money to spend that they would be comfortable spending it in the Shops at Columbus Circle. For the same reason, businesses that were too far down-market were not welcome as tenants. This is why there's a Whole Foods Market but not a Family Dollar. So those of us who follow David Chang's mind along its switchbacks and cul-de-sacs have to wonder if he was being subversive when he decided to install Bang Bar , which is essentially a shawarma stand, on the mall's third floor. Mr. Chang is a close observer of the ways society assigns high status to the food of some cultures and devalues the cooking of others. One of his greatest hits is a riff about New Yorkers who complain about $17 bowls of ramen while paying $30 for spaghetti. If he has a routine about vertical rotisseries I've never heard it, but surely he is alive to the associations they conjure, from Greek diners to taco trucks to the Halal Guys carts parked near Columbus Circle. If anybody grasps the cultural implications of bringing $6 street-meat sandwiches indoors where they can perfume the air breathed by consumers of Pink shirts and Floga furs, it is Mr. Chang. Bang Bar might make more sense as a provocation than a business concern. It begins serving at 8:30 a.m. and closes when the food is gone, usually by 1 or 2 p.m. In the weeks after its opening, on Halloween, the lines were worthy of the Department of Motor Vehicles. Employees tried to appease the horde by handing out off-the-menu snacks, like rice porridge with fermented shiitakes, and asking whimsical survey questions. (\"Do you keep peanut butter in the fridge?\") After Mr. Chang opened a Momofuku Noodle Bar in the space next door, Bang Bar's crowds grew somewhat more manageable, and when I showed up for breakfast at the end of December, there was no line at all. Maybe Deutsche Bank employees will keep Bang Bar's early shift afloat, but right now its success seems to hinge on the lunch rush. There are two rotisseries. After 11 a.m., one spit is buried deep inside a missile of dark chicken marinated with a yakitori-style glaze. The other is at the center of a red, dripping, gochujang-rubbed tower of pork. Ideally, whichever meat you choose will have built up a dark outer bark that can be lopped off with a few knife strokes and stacked on to a disc of griddled flatbread. The bread, thicker than a tortilla and less oily than a roti, will be rolled tight, like a cigarette, then bent in half, with both open ends at the top. This is called, in Bang Bar parlance, a U. The chicken or pork can also be piled over a bowl of rice, but the bread is really very good. A close relative of the flatbread Mr. Chang's crew originated at Majordomo in Los Angeles, it is perceptibly tangy and salted, without being salty. A couple of condiments -- including habanero salsa and the brick-red Ssam Sauce used, in various iterations, to italicize Noodle Bar's pork buns and a hundred other creations in Mr. Chang's Momofuku restaurant group -- are kept out on a counter alongside the moist towelettes. But they're hard to apply once a U has been rolled. What I did want was a spoonful or two of raw white onions, some chopped cucumber, maybe parsley or cilantro -- the kind of simple salad that is almost always lobbed into a shawarma or a doner kebab. Both the chicken and pork are slightly sweet, and could use a lift. The lunch menu also has two dips -- a darkly fascinating, spicy eggplant spread, or whipped chickpeas whose sharp, pecorino-like flavor betrays the presence of Hozon, the fermented chickpea paste invented in a Momofuku laboratory. They are alluring enough, but the real reason to order them is the bread, puffier and softer than the one that wraps the U. A smaller version of this, maybe five inches across, is folded in half like a taco to make a \"mini,\" which replaces the U at breakfast. It is no great shock that this bread works nicely with smoked salmon and scallion cream cheese blended with just enough soy sauce to make it arguably Asian. It is more flavorful than a bagel and better at holding everything together. But it is somewhat surprising how delicious a freshly griddled mini is with caper-scallion cream cheese, salted cucumber, tomato and fresh dill inside. The whole thing tastes alive in a way that a bagel with a schmear of veggie cream cheese never will. I've saved the breakfast mini with mortadella for last, although it's been the subject of the most rapt online attention. Building logs of mortadella layered with lardo and roasting them on spits is exactly the sort of thing the Momofuku group was put on this earth to do. I am glad this revolving meat torpedo exists. I respect Bang Bar's cooks -- this collaborative effort has no chef, Mr. Chang said in a phone interview -- for realizing that the proper garnish for caramelized mortadella shavings is a slice of yellow American cheese and hot mustard. I appreciate the respect the sandwich pays to both fried baloney and Taylor Ham. And if I were in the habit of turning up at Columbus Circle with a hangover in the mornings, I would probably become a regular consumer of mortadella minis with Ssam Sauce. With a clear head and stomach, though, the saltiness can be a little too bracing. At either meal, Bang Bar offers a cinnamon roll modeled on the kkwabaegi, the twisted Korean doughnut stick. It is baked rather than fried, making it a rare example of a Momofuku dish that contains less fat than its inspiration. It is a fine pastry to have with Bang Bar's Vietnamese coffee, even after you learn that the cream cheese icing contains fermented chickpeas. By the way, bang, or bbang or ppang, depending on how you like your Korean words transliterated, means bread. So this shawarma joint inside a mall is officially a bread bar, which makes sense given how pleasant the bread is. Still, I can't help wondering how the people in charge of the Restaurant Collection felt about welcoming a place called Bang Bar.

{"id": 47, "data": " Americans who weren't born into Korean cuisine have discovered it in many ways and many locales over the past decade or two. Bulgogi folded into tortillas has been handed out through the window of a roving truck . Smoked kimchi has been draped over pulled pork between halves of a cheese-glazed doughnut to make an outdoor food-stall sandwich called the Chonut . Hwe, raw fish eaten with condiments that typically spread across an entire table, has been streamlined to one or two bites in a tasting menu administered by servers in sci-fi tunics. The pork belly dish bo ssam has been reimagined as a whole roasted pork shoulder that a gang of hungry people could use in a bonding ritual involving heads of lettuce, a platter of oysters and a pair of tongs. More often than not, the audience for these items is young. Youth, in fact, has been a key part of the story of how kimchi and other dishes spread from immigrants' kitchens to the Instagram feeds of diners without a single Korean ancestor. You might get a Chonut at Smorgasburg with your roommate, take down a bo ssam at Momofuku Ssam Bar with your friends from college and sit at Atomix's U-shaped counter to celebrate your first anniversary. Hwaban , which opened in Chelsea in August, is something different. It's the modern Korean restaurant where you'd take your mother. The dining room is spare, sleek and uncontroversial. The brick walls have a recent coat of white paint, and there is plenty of light by which to read the menus. The banquettes and benches have gentle curves and soothing neutral colors. The only vaguely menacing items in sight are the canteloupe-size eyeballs hanging on the walls, but they turn out to be high-tech speakers, and the cocktail jazz they play never rises above a murmur. Just inside the front door is a lattice of shelves holding simple, geometric bowls and teaware. These give Hwaban the look of a cloistered Parisian salon de thé, which it resembles in other ways as well. Exceptional green tea from South Korea is brewed along with tisanes -- made from mulberry leaves, mistletoe stems or dried wild pears -- that Korean mothers brew in winter for sneezing and sniffling children. And while some restaurants are saving money by doing without pastry chefs, Hwaban needs two of them to keep up with its obsession with Western-style sweets. One, Ahram Song, is a buttercream specialist who tints and shapes frosting into botanically detailed flower arrangements decorating chocolate or honey-pecan cakes. Another, Lauren Kim, makes the fleecy cheesecake that is carved into slivers the length of a dinner plate; pretty, well-tailored French numbers like a passion-fruit Pavlova or a drum of white cake filled with fresh strawberries and frosted with whipped cream; and the cookies and toffees that are sold by the box, for takeout. The illusion that you've wandered into a tearoom somewhere on the Right Bank is extended by the drinks list, which has only two Korean sojus and a handful of Japanese sakes but several pages of wines from France. The rest of the menu is unmistakably Korean, and very often it is based on Korean family cooking. \"This is my mother's recipe,\" Mihyun Han, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Key Kim, will say on one of her frequent circuits around the tables. She said it one night about the shaggy white meatball of chicken, tofu and mushrooms -- the menu calls it a dumpling -- sitting in a warm and transfixing soy-milk broth. Another time, she was talking about what she calls \"snowy bibimbap,\" a gentle, agreeable wintertime variation on the classic rice dish made with strands of mung bean jelly and shaved burdock, bellflower root, and other vegetables in shades of ivory, cream and bone. The chef, Woong Jang, does very fine work in white. One of Hwaban's most luxurious dishes is a length of king crab leg with spinach and a poached egg, all surrounded in a rich pine-nut sauce the color of hotel sheets. Like the Manhattan restaurants Atomix and Jungsik , Hwaban de-emphasizes the sweeter and spicier side of the Korean palate so other flavors can come through. Coins of poached pollock roe are sliced over a block of soft tofu in a clear, subtle dried-seafood broth. Soy-braised abalone is served in an anchovy broth that is, if not exactly subtle, at least soft-spoken. One of two pork belly dishes on the menu involves ssamjang, the potent soy-chile paste now sold in supermarkets throughout the land, but the other does not. In that one, you eat a slice of simmered pork belly together with a pickled mushroom and a square of cabbage kimchi. There is, of course, a sharp little kick to the spicy fish stew known as maeun-tang, and a fair amount of chile paste in the daktori-tang , a spin on the classic braised chicken and vegetable dish, both of which Mr. Jang makes very well. But there is also the surprise of tasting ginger and carrots along with the chiles in a bright orange sauce for seared salmon. Ms. Han and Mr. Kim also own Kosaka , a chiaroscuro lair for omakase sushi on West 13th Street. I was a little put off by how active the servers were there; just as I was focusing on the piece of fish in front of me, somebody would dart in at one elbow or the other to ask how I was enjoying it all. The service style is similar at Hwaban, but it plays better there. A meal at Hwaban is also about three times less expensive, at $55 for an appetizer and two main courses. The mains are served at the same time, which Ms. Han says is her attempt to reproduce the abundance of Korean family tables like her mother's. Her mother also gets credit for the two-sided fritters of minced shrimp pressed against zucchini coins on the short à la carte menu. They're served with a crisp pair of fried shrimp and little cubes of jelly that melt into dipping sauce on contact with the warm fritters. The same soy jelly accompanies a kimchi-jeon that's topped with browned mozzarella -- in other words, a kimchi pizza. It would fit right in at Smorgasburg.

{"id": 48, "data": " Something seems to be going wrong at Bluebird London , the busily programmed 10,500-square-foot restaurant that the mall in the Time Warner Center imported from England in September. Maybe the people in charge have been taking management cues from Prime Minister Theresa May's government, which has approached its Brexit plan like a class of first graders trying to build a working jet airplane out of Lego pieces and a flying-squirrel sock puppet. Or maybe the mess back home has just sapped the restaurant's spirit. Whatever the cause, what was meant to be a cheerful gift from London has turned into the Bluebird of Unhappiness. Sir Terence Conran opened the original Bluebird in 1997 inside an Art Deco garage built on King's Road in Chelsea for the Bluebird Motor Company. It was one of his \"gastrodomes,\" those soaring complexes like Quaglino's and Bibendum that embedded restaurants within a busy hive of shops, cafes and bars. The gastrodomes' designs were talked about more often and more enthusiastically than their menus, which aimed for unthreatening familiarity. The current owners, D & D London , have managed to keep the London Bluebird in circulation by changing upholstery and chefs, but it is not at all clear why they or the Time Warner Center believed that a Bluebird clone would play in Manhattan in 2018. True, the retail shop has been dropped. But up front, next to the desk where the hosts have mastered the art of checking reservations without making eye contact, is a cafe-slash-wine bar. A glass case there serves as a temporary prison for aging pastries and tragic snacks. Beyond is a lounge followed by a bar, the centerpiece of which is an enormous plexiglass sculpture of a ponytailed woman's head that doubles as a shelf for weird liqueurs. Just before the ramp that descends to the main dining room is a console with two turntables which, a note on the website says menacingly, are operated on weekends by \"live DJs.\" At other times, the restaurant stages such events as a workshop in the art of making \"a seriously chic wreath.\" The poster-size menus drawn up by Nicolas Houlbert, the chef, cram so much copy onto a single page, and are organized so randomly, that they are best approached as if you were doing a word search, by unfocusing the eyes and waiting until the letters organize themselves into recognizable patterns. Look, here's butternut squash soup. This must be fluke -- no, fluke crudo. Long Island. Burrata. Long Island burrata? When you have finished the puzzle, please savor the warm feeling of accomplishment for a moment, because it goes away once the food arrives. The \"crispy shrimp\" have the limp, expired quality of tempura that's been doing laps all night at a conveyor-belt sushi place. Yellowfin tuna poke has been tossed onto a big, damp heap of unseasoned quinoa, which must be there to soak up any seasoning that accidentally attaches itself to the fish. At lunch there is a lobster Cobb salad with lettuce and round, red objects that are probably supposed to be tomatoes. Because you are in an English restaurant, you will be curious about the English food. Because you are in Bluebird London, you will regret this. A prawn and monkfish curry is presented on a thali with mango chutney, basmati rice and paratha, which run the gamut from unnecessarily sweet to ridiculously sweet. The fish half of fish and chips is golden and crisp on the ends but pale and soggy in the middle. At least the minted peas that come with it are crunchy. This is more than can be said for the potato chips that come with an order of beef tartare. They are pale, cobweb-colored, not fresh, and undercooked so they sag and fall apart beneath any amount of beef. The tartare, by the way, is seasoned with ketchup, which is not as wrong as you might think. If something comes with a pastry crust, exercise caution. On top of an allegedly Cornish chicken pie, sealing in dry chicken and mushrooms coated in grease that is trying its best to be mistaken for sauce, is a dome of puff pastry; it doesn't taste like butter or salt, but it is cooked. The thicker crust around a farmhouse pork terrine, served with a chill that brought out its Spammy qualities, is on its way to being cooked. The very, very thick football of crust encasing beef Wellington is cooked only on the surface; deep inside, where it meets the tenderloin, is a mass of wet, gluey dough. This costs $95 and will serve two people, both of whom had better like the taste of raw flour. All is not doom and gloom in the pastry department, though. The pull-apart cheese straws are thick, puffy and warm, bronzed on top with baked Montgomery's Cheddar. Most of the sweets are likable, particularly the cube of sticky toffee pudding and the wedge of Bakewell tart with a layer of orange marmalade between the frangipane and the pastry shell. The only real hazard on the dessert menu is the barely congealed Pimm's jelly at which somebody has hurled fistfuls of chopped cucumbers and strawberries. It's like a stray plate of salad that you might pick up at a party before you realized that somebody had dumped the warm dregs of a drink into it. The servers seemed eager to oblige, but gave the impression of struggling in the face of unseen enemies. One night, asked \"Still or sparkling?,\" I chose the sparkling water. My server began to walk away, then turned on his heel and said, \"I'm sorry, we're all out of sparkling.\" \"That's fine,\" I said. \"I'll just have the BrewDog I.P.A. instead.\" \"I apologize,\" he said. \"We don't have any draft beer.\" After the main course was cleared, I asked him for the Chocolate Bluebird. \"That is our signature dessert,\" he said. I nodded. I had read that this was a chocolate mousse inside a blue-chocolate shell in the shape of a vintage racecar once made by the Bluebird Motor Company. \"Unfortunately, we do not have it tonight,\" he said. His courtesy went a long way. Ultimately, though, I preferred the blunt approach that one of the bartenders took with one of my guests. Looking over the long list of old and new cocktails, she asked the bartender which he would recommend. \"If you want to drink something that tastes good,\" he said, \"I wouldn't order anything off our menu.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 49, "data": " There is a good case to be made for not reviewing the newly relocated Four Seasons Restaurant at all but just leaving it on the slush pile, and that case can be found in court records involving Julian Niccolini. Mr. Niccolini has operated the restaurant with Alex von Bidder since the mid-1990s, first at its original home in the Seagram Building and now, after a two-year hiatus, in a smaller berth on the other side of Park Avenue. Over that time, he has frequently been celebrated for his charm. Less frequently, he has been a defendant in civil and criminal actions arising from things he was accused of having done to women inside the restaurant. In 1991, one of his waitresses sued Mr. Niccolini and the Four Seasons , citing sexual harassment. She claimed that for more than three years he had repeatedly rubbed up against her, told her in vulgar terms about his sexual urges and called her \"slut,\" \"lesbian\" and other things. Mr. Niccolini denied the charges. In 2014, a former assistant manager filed suit against Mr. Niccolini , Mr. von Bidder and the Four Seasons, alleging discrimination. The ex-manager said that after she returned from a maternity leave, the restaurant made it difficult for her to pump breast milk during work hours and, about three months later, fired her and replaced her with a man. In a response filed with the court, the defendants denied the allegations. Both suits were settled under terms that have not been divulged. In 2015, Mr. Niccolini was arrested on a felony charge of sexual abuse. According to a prosecutor, he had attacked a woman at the Four Seasons bar \"with such force that he ripped her bra open and caused significant scratch marks on her back and bruising on her hip.\" After pleading guilty the following year to a reduced charge of misdemeanor assault, Mr. Niccolini was given a \"conditional discharge,\" avoiding jail. I know people who will never eat at the Four Seasons because they don't want to give Mr. Niccolini their money. I understand this. I also know people in the food media who think the Four Seasons should not get any coverage as long as Mr. Niccolini owns a piece of it. I understand this, too, but it's not my view. [Julian Niccolini has since been forced to resign from the restaurant.] Their stance rests, I think, on the idea that writing about powerful men who have been accused of abusing women amounts to condoning the abuse and helping the abusers stay in power. While it's true that media attention is often like oxygen to restaurants, critics have the power to tell a story other than the one the restaurant is pushing. Even when we're not writing a pan, a fair assessment often requires weaving shining threads with ugly ones. The ugliest threads at the Four Seasons happen to be ugly enough to make many people stay away. But there is beauty in the fabric, too. The Four Seasons has been a significant force in dining: a pioneer in championing American ingredients and wine; an innovator in bringing contemporary design into the restaurant world; a cultivator of an eclectic scene that treated political power, financial success and creative talent as coequal branches of a high society that was peculiar to New York. Most of this happened some time ago. In its last years in the Seagram Building, the Four Seasons had become a shabby but lovely museum of midcentury architecture and design, with martinis that I didn't mind overpaying for and food that I did. I was curious about its new incarnation, which opened in August, and curiosity is as good a reason as any for a critic to swing into action. If I were writing the next chapter in a long history, I'd mention how gracefully Diego Garcia has grown into his new job as the restaurant's chef. I enjoyed Mr. Garcia's fish cookery at his last restaurant, a small, bare-bones place in Hell's Kitchen called Gloria , but he seemed limited by the kitchen's size. He works on a grander scale now, with more expensive ingredients and more delicate treatments that still betray his creative streak. He roasts duck because the Four Seasons is famous for it, and makes fresh pasta and risotto because the captains in their black jackets need some place to shave all those white truffles. For all intents and purposes, though, he has turned the Four Seasons into a seafood restaurant, and a very good one. It's not hard to believe he was once a sous-chef at Le Bernardin when you taste, say, the raw scallop slivers in citrus juices, elegantly equipped with tart apple and caviar, or the intensely smooth chowder of tiny, just-cooked clams in a New England-style cream broth that's pale yellow with butterfat. He knows when to show restraint and when to go all in, taking sea-urchin ravioli that are already head-spinningly rich and draping lobes of sea urchin over them. Some of the cooking is boring in the right way. I don't want surprises in Dover sole à la meunière, and I didn't get any. It was flawless. The duck will surprise only people who don't know that duck meat cooked to well-done bastes in its own fat until it is almost a warm confit. Other dishes were boring in the usual sense. The mustard sauce poured around the golden crab cake tasted like cream that was shown a picture of a mustard jar. The chapter would also depict the return of Bill Yosses. Anybody who ate his desserts before he disappeared into the White House won't be surprised by how good they are here. They do have a slight Rip Van Winkle quality, suggesting that Mr. Yosses allowed several new waves in pastry to pass him by, but that's no criticism. He makes a better baba au rhum than almost anyone in town, his chocolate tart with a salted stripe of caramel is both powerful and precise, and his hazelnut financier balanced over roasted pears is more delicious than almost any almond financier you can find. He has even improved the restaurant's signature, the Kate Pierson beehive of cotton candy that sails out to the tables of valued guests. (Apparently I've joined that club.) This being the Four Seasons, the history would have to mention the new restaurant's interior. It reminded me of the old Philip Johnson dining rooms without making me sad to be here instead of there, a trick I had thought was impossible. The bronze bead curtains have transformed into strings of gilded glass baubles; the flatware and glasses pay homage to the vintage designs used at the original restaurant; and the bar is once again a four-sided island in the middle of a lounge. For the first time you can eat a real meal there, while you watch the Grand Central-bound commuters outside and the cotton candy-bound regulars inside, generally a mature group in tightly knotted ties or heels that echo down the corridor to the dining room like the ticking of a grandfather clock. All of this and a generous budget (the prices are as exclusionary as ever) could make for a few hours of celebratory sightseeing of a kind that is quickly disappearing from the city. The Four Seasons offers an escape from the outside world. Escaping from what's inside, however, takes a mental effort that is beyond me and will probably be beyond many others as well, whether Mr. Niccolini is in sight or not. During my three meals, I never saw him. Restaurants, even grand ones like the Four Seasons, are intimate places; eating is an act that requires trust and a sense of safety. We want to get up from the table feeling restored on all fronts except the financial one. Mr. Niccolini's actions have done serious damage to his power to provide that feeling, even as he and Mr. von Bidder have made the restaurant better than it has been in years.

{"id": 50, "data": " Alex Raij and Eder Montero met while working in the kitchen of a sprawling, impersonal, gloomy modern-Spanish restaurant that lasted about two years. They went on to get married and, as joint chefs and owners, opened a string of compact, intimate, slinky modern-Spanish restaurants that are still in business. Their one misfire was a small, intimate non-Spanish coffee shop in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. After dusting themselves off, they replaced the cafe tables with taller and longer ones, traded the pastry cases for a bar, installed a stripe of backlighted glass blocks that cast a subaqueous glow on the room, and in September reopened as Saint Julivert Fisherie . And what is a fisherie, you ask, having quickly consulted your French, Spanish and English dictionaries and found no such word? Saint Julivert is my first, but if it is anything to go by, then a fisherie is a seafood establishment that aspires to be more than a raw bar but does not want to be mistaken for a full-bore restaurant. Wines come mostly from coastal regions (and are organized by the nearest body of salt water). Small plates abound. And if you guessed that they are something like the tapas that Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero explore at El Quinto Pino , Txikito and La Vara , but without the running Spanish theme, you are not far off. Not that the menu is entirely un-Spanish. The octopus carpaccio from Txikito makes a special guest appearance at Saint Julivert Fisherie, the way the Fresh Prince once turned up on an episode of \"Blossom.\" Under marjoram leaves and pinprick grains of Espelette pepper, the carpaccio is as good as you remember; the warm plate halfway melts the fattier bits of octopus into delicious goo. There is another cameo: El Quinto Pino's very fine combination of pink-fleshed anchovies with cold vanilla butter. The butter soothes the anchovies the way the vermouth in a martini helps the gin settle down. (On a related topic, the short cocktail list includes a deceptively soft-spoken number called the Kanpai Martini. It's a variation on the Vesper, which itself is the amended martini that Ian Fleming had James Bond order in \"Casino Royale.\") At times Saint Julivert reminds me of Cal Pep , in Barcelona, Spain, whose plain, cramped counter looks like the last place in the world where you are going to have an epiphany of the taste buds, right up until the moment the txipirones and thumbtack-size clams knock you off your barstool. Like Cal Pep, and unlike nearly every other New York restaurant, Saint Julivert serves gooseneck barnacles when they're available, boiling them with bay leaves and salt and mounding them on a cloth napkin before they cool so that when you twist the wrinkled sheath of skin away from the sweet, edible meat inside there is a good chance somebody in the vicinity will get hit with a squirt of hot barnacle juice. Mostly, though, any Spanish-ness in Saint Julivert has more to do with its spirit than its recipes, which come from all over: the deep-fried Puerto Rican cylinders of cornmeal known as sorrullitos; a kanpachi collar whose juicy meat is shockingly white under a black rub of jerk spices; tender slices of warm beef tenderloin on a fist-size roll, known in Portugal as a prego sandwich. There is also the crispy tuna bake, a peculiarly satisfying hybrid that crosses a tuna noodle casserole by way of India with fideuà, the Spanish dish that treats pasta like the rice in paella. The noodles, short ridged tubes, are toasted and cooked with oil-cured tuna in a tomato sauce that is seasoned with turmeric and curry leaves. It is one of the most fearless, not to mention filling, dishes on a menu that could use a little more of both qualities. Although Saint Julivert works with exceptional seafood, and treats it with the care that fans of Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero have come to expect, the menu plays it safe more often than it should. Like all of the couple's restaurants, Saint Julivert toggles between innovation and tradition. But the other places explore Spanish cuisine, so when they toss off a straight-ahead classic like patatas bravas, there's a reason. When Saint Julivert serves fluke ceviche or a crab and avocado salad dressed with yuzu juice and trout roe, it can seem to be grasping at ideas that other restaurants are already doing -- even when Saint Julivert does them better. The sautéed skate splashed with Manzanilla could not be fresher or more skillfully browned, but do the garlic chips and sliced dried chiles on top make this version of a well-known standard one I'll remember a month from now? Maybe not, although at the time I was very happy to have it, not least because it was one of the few things on the menu the size of a standard main course. Even if you're an old hand at navigating the shallow waters of small plates, it can be unnervingly easy to spend more than $100 on food and drinks at Saint Julivert and still wonder whether you've actually had dinner. Seafood this good is expensive, but the menu doesn't stray very far above $20; the result is that portions can seem somewhat airy. When there's an inexpensive opportunity to pad out a dish, Saint Julivert doesn't always take it. I understand why I can't have more than three excellent wild shrimp in a $21 bowl of red pozole, but couldn't there be more than a spoonful of hominy kernels? Saltines fried in canola oil are served with the ceviche and with a cold and highly appealing bowl of pickled shrimp under pink pickled onions; grilled bread slices accompany the mackerel whipped into a hummus-like orange spread with piri-piri oil. Still, each time I went, somebody at my table asked for more bread. None of Saint Julivert's issues are insoluble. The lighting could be warmed up so the room looks less like an aquarium. A few more dishes you won't see anywhere else, like the tuna bake, would make it harder to resist. Another two or three large plates would make it a place you think of when you're hungry. The excellent $19 prego sandwich is more snack than dinner, until you pay another $7 to have fried oysters tucked into the roll beside the beef, making it into a kind of crunchy carpetbagger. On the other hand, that's worth doing even if you're not hungry. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 59, "data": " Almost everybody is calling Misi , the latest endeavor from the chef Missy Robbins, a pasta restaurant. That's not quite right. Yes, Ms. Robbins has given half of her menu over to long noodles and short ones; strands of linguine with chopped garlic and a double dose of fish in the form of chopped anchovies and drizzled colatura; circles filled with ricotta whipped until it is as soft as cream; pinched rings of tortelli stuffed with mascarpone and spinach; the deeply ridged Sardinian shells known as malloreddus; and other Italian marvels of starch formation. True, anybody who has been to Ms. Robbins's other restaurant, Lilia , also located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, knows that the pasta there reliably steals the show from everything else on the table. When those people show up at Misi, odds are good that they will not have chosen that day to start a keto diet. Moreover, Misi has a greater variety of pasta than Lilia, so many that the architecture makes space for them. Misi is across the street from the old Domino refinery on the East River, where the cranes used to unload sugar from barges in the open air so that on days when the wind was right you could taste it on your tongue a mile away. Next to the dining room, facing the factory's remains, is a separate, glassed-in workshop where the temperature and humidity are kept at consistent dough-friendly levels. There, the long noodles, etc., are rolled out and cut long before 5:30 each night, when Misi's front door is unlocked and the crowd waiting in line for walk-in seats begins to snake eagerly forward. And to be sure, if you watch Ms. Robbins and her kitchen crew at the end of one of two long dining counters, you'll see the same quick motion over and over: an almost surreptitiously quick trip of hand to mouth, a sharp bite and an appraising chew to decide if that batch of pasta is ready to be pulled from the water. Some chefs show their mastery over pasta by pressing it thinner than a screen protector for an iPhone. Ms. Robbins likes hers to have body and heft, and the chew test is the most reliable way to tell when thick pasta like that is ready. You are very unlikely to get a piece that is undercooked at its core, or one that doesn't fight back enough to let you know it is still alive. You get this just-in-between texture in the stubs of mezze rigatoni with a simple, glossy, ripe tomato sauce that's been stewed with whole garlic cloves -- 30 to a batch, according to the menu. You get it again in the corzetti, discs about the diameter of a Red Bull can that are pressed with a wooden stamp to give them a target pattern. In October, Misi served these ridged coins with another tomato sauce, this one barely cooked, just some Sungold tomatoes warmed until they broke open and their yellow pulp spilled out. Fresh basil, thyme and chervil were scattered over the top, as good an illustration as any of how Ms. Robbins makes her food stand out without deviating from an Italian reliance on simple, unmanipulated ingredients. But to call Misi a pasta restaurant would be to overlook its highly impressive work with vegetables. They are the subject of the menu's other half, sneakily headlined \"antipasti.\" This is where you will find a globe eggplant roasted until it is as soft and easy to spread as cream cheese; the cut surfaces are dressed with Calabrian chiles, and the taste of lemon juice seems to have found its way to the center of the eggplant. There are fleshy and firm chanterelles, too, lightly pickled and preserved in olive oil until they're brought to the table crisscrossed with rosemary needles. Grilled runner beans with garlic and chiles have been around lately, too, in a big heap that I would have enjoyed more if a few stringy, leathery beans had not gotten past the inspectors in the kitchen. Like the pastas, Misi's vegetables tend to bring together only a few ingredients, often applied in ways you don't quite expect. I don't know where else you will taste pistachios and anchovies combined with skinny, leaf-bud-green leeks marinated in vinegar, or a kind of panzanella made with grilled bread, capers, fresh oregano and chunks of zucchini that are still tender after a quick poaching in olive oil. And though the gently roasted tomatoes won't come back to the menu until next summer, you can try imagining how their dusting of fennel seeds and cracked coriander seeds responds to a last-minute squirt of spicy honey. There are enough of these vegetables, and enough meatless pastas, that a vegetarian could eat extremely well at Misi just by watching out for things like bottarga and staying away entirely from the creamy pork sugo tossed with strangozzi. (Meat eaters, on the other hand, may find the sugo helps restore chafed nerves.) Although Misi doesn't let its kitchen range as widely as Lilia's, it is a more successful restaurant in several ways. The menu has been distilled down to essentials, and the whole enterprise seems more carefully thought through. The restaurant is on the ground floor of a new apartment building by SHoP Architects , who chose to leave a hole in the middle that you could fly a helicopter through. The developer, Two Trees , recruited Ms. Robbins and her business partner, Sean Feeney, and gave them a chance to build the virgin space to their needs. The acoustics are better than at Lilia, and traffic between tables flows more smoothly. The interior is unusually good, with narrow horizontal wall tiles in white and nooks for stacked plates that make them part of the décor. As at Lilia, the wine list practically begs you to take something new for a whirl: a catarratto from Sicily, a Corsican niellucciu, or a croatina-ughetta blend from Lombardy softened with some uva rara. Of course, you could stick to a $45 Lambrusco, or get a $250 Champagne from David Léclapart, after which you can try flying through the hole in the building yourself. If we are striving for total accuracy, though, we need to call Misi a pasta-vegetables-and-gelato restaurant. Its gelato is made in house; there are about six kinds at any given moment. The flavors open up right away, in part because Misi serves them just below the melting point and in part because the ingredients are used prodigally. There are a lot of almonds in the almond, and the espresso could keep you up an extra hour. But even the unflavored fior di latte, made with milk, cream and sugar, comes at you in a rush. There are no desserts other than gelato. The only decision to make at the end of the night is which one you're going to have.", "label": [[29, 33, "EST"], [87, 103, "TYPE"], [186, 193, "FOOD"], [221, 229, "FOOD"], [243, 249, "FOOD"], [271, 275, "FOOD"], [299, 308, "FOOD"], [322, 330, "FOOD"], [352, 359, "FOOD"], [415, 423, "FOOD"], [437, 447, "FOOD"], [452, 459, "FOOD"], [391, 396, "FOOD"], [479, 488, "CUISINE"], [505, 516, "FOOD"], [528, 535, "CUISINE"], [627, 632, "EST"], [651, 673, "LOC"], [690, 695, "FOOD"], [791, 795, "EST"], [862, 871, "DIET"], [883, 887, "EST"], [913, 918, "FOOD"], [924, 929, "EST"], [983, 987, "EST"], [1045, 1055, "LOC"], [1089, 1094, "FOOD"], [1397, 1404, "FOOD"], [1469, 1475, "EST"], [1855, 1860, "FOOD"], [1934, 1939, "FOOD"], [2110, 2115, "FOOD"], [2332, 2346, "FOOD"], [2375, 2387, "FOOD"], [2418, 2431, "FOOD"], [2497, 2505, "FOOD"], [2630, 2634, "EST"], [2674, 2686, "FOOD"], [2722, 2738, "FOOD"], [2809, 2814, "FOOD"], [2816, 2821, "FOOD"], [2826, 2833, "FOOD"], [2964, 2971, "CUISINE"], [3031, 3035, "EST"], [3038, 3054, "TYPE"], [3108, 3118, "FOOD"], [3229, 3243, "FOOD"], [3294, 3306, "FOOD"], [3342, 3358, "FOOD"], [3377, 3388, "FOOD"], [3438, 3446, "FOOD"], [3474, 3486, "FOOD"], [3526, 3535, "FOOD"], [3589, 3597, "FOOD"], [3633, 3639, "FOOD"], [3644, 3650, "FOOD"], [3753, 3758, "FOOD"], [3819, 3825, "FOOD"], [3827, 3833, "EST"], [3834, 3844, "FOOD"], [3977, 3987, "FOOD"], [3992, 4001, "FOOD"], [4039, 4044, "FOOD"], [4058, 4065, "FOOD"], [4080, 4090, "FOOD"], [4109, 4114, "FOOD"], [4116, 4122, "FOOD"], [4124, 4137, "FOOD"], [4152, 4160, "FOOD"], [4209, 4218, "FOOD"], [4250, 4258, "FOOD"], [3607, 3627, "FOOD"], [4349, 4361, "FOOD"], [4374, 4389, "FOOD"], [4426, 4437, "FOOD"], [4465, 4475, "FOOD"], [4488, 4496, "DIET"], [4497, 4503, "FOOD"], [4512, 4522, "DIET"], [4551, 4555, "EST"], [4593, 4601, "FOOD"], [4637, 4676, "EST"], [4679, 4690, "DIET"], [4724, 4728, "FOOD"], [4768, 4772, "EST"], [4816, 4823, "EST"], [5342, 5347, "EST"], [5541, 5546, "EST"], [5620, 5630, "DISH"], [5636, 5642, "LOC"], [5646, 5665, "DISH"], [5672, 5694, "DISH"], [5700, 5708, "LOC"], [5728, 5736, "FOOD"], [5774, 5783, "DISH"], [5799, 5808, "FOOD"], [5968, 5972, "EST"], [5975, 6013, "TYPE"], [6019, 6025, "FOOD"], [6139, 6143, "EST"], [6261, 6268, "EST"], [6276, 6282, "EST"], [6292, 6300, "EST"], [6358, 6371, "DISH"], [6383, 6387, "FOOD"], [6389, 6394, "FOOD"], [6399, 6404, "FOOD"], [6463, 6469, "FOOD"]]}
{"id": 60, "data": " Something has been missing from New York's current Indian restaurant scene, but I wasn't sure what it was until I ate the kaleji masala at Adda Indian Canteen in Long Island City, Queens. Modernization is the theme unifying many of the Indian restaurants that have taken root around the city over the past few years. At the rarefied end of the spectrum, we have Indian Accent bringing the cuisine into line with the intricate techniques and plating that can land restaurants on the itineraries of list-clutching gastrotourists. At the populist end, we've seen Indian cooking gastro-pubbed by Babu Ji and other new places that try to make non-desis feel at home with house-party vibes, beer in a self-service fridge, and dishes like naan pizzas and samosa burgers. New York hasn't seen nearly as many recently opened restaurants devoted to the pure, original stuff that is getting modernized. The snacks pitched together in a blur by hawkers at folding tables and rolling carts by the side of the road; the gravy-soaked stews and sauceless dry curries patiently made from 25 or so vegetables and seasonings, all of them chopped, ground, fried and simmered at home by those keepers of the culinary flame known collectively as the aunties -- we've seen interpretations of this food, squeezed from eyedroppers and prepared for their photo shoots with edible flowers. But new places cooking the genuine article have been scarce. There is a problem of missing context here; twists on tradition don't really resonate when tradition is hard to find in its untwisted form. And for anyone who truly loves Indian cooking, there is a more pressing problem of missing flavor. Five dots of tandoori-spice oil just won't land on the taste buds with the impact of a full plate of charred and steaming tandoori chicken, no matter how evenly spaced those dots are. I hadn't given much thought to either problem, to tell the truth, until I made it to the out-of-the-way patch of Long Island City where Adda Indian Canteen operates. This is not the part of that neighborhood where high-rise apartments grow overnight and Amazon will soon tiptoe in with 25,000 employees. Adda is east of all that, under a National Guard recruiting office, surrounded by a thicket of railroad tracks and highway overpasses. Unless you are looking for it, you are not likely to end up in the small dining room, in which Indian tabloids have been upcycled as wallpaper. Once I'd found it, one of the first things I ate was the kaleji masala, chicken livers in a dark gravy seasoned with fresh ginger and garam masala. Right away I realized that this was the kind of Indian food the city has been hungry for, or at least the kind that I'd been hungry for: made with care but no pretense; seasoned for people who love the interplay of spices; presented without apology in all its brown, lumpy glory; and complex in ways that demand full attention. Adda (ah DAH) Indian Canteen was opened in September by Roni Mazumdar, who owns it, and Chintan Pandya, who is the chef. The two men already run Rahi , in Greenwich Village, perhaps the best of the casual, modernizing Indian restaurants, where Mr. Pandya serves original notions like tandoori skate and sends almost everything out of the kitchen decorated with edible flowers. They've taken another angle at Adda, mining family recipes and the lessons Mr. Pandya absorbed from civilian cooks around India. The menu travels beyond the standard north Indian dishes most New Yorkers already know, but even those dishes, when they appear, are prepared so emphatically that they don't resemble anything else in town. Adda is a lusty, full-throated defense of traditional cooking. Saag paneer, the grayest of old gray mares in many Indian restaurants, is coltishly energetic at Adda. The cheese is made in the kitchen, and it's gorgeously soft, while the saag is a tart and peppery mix of wilted arugula, sorrel, spinach and mustard greens. Mr. Pandya does very well by the class of sidewalk treats called chaat. Each delivers the messy riot you'd hope for, busy with crunchy hieroglyphs of fried noodles and splattered with yogurt and tamarind sauce. One chaat is anchored by a big kale fritter, another by several smaller chips of battered, spiced lentil cakes, and a third by fried smashed potatoes and chickpeas. But discerning chaat lovers should probably go directly to the dahi batata puri, soft potato packed into hollow globes of fried dough that you can pick up and eat with your fingers, like chocolates. Anything that passes through Adda's tandoor is worth investigating. Seekh kebabs, made with lamb that's coarsely ground by hand, come out of the tandoor juicier and pinker than the usual; Mumbai-style tandoori macchi, a skewered pompano rubbed with ground mustard seeds and cilantro, is lightly charred and smoky after roasting, but still moist; bhatti da murgh, a double-marinated chicken thigh and drumstick, is so thickly crusted with coriander and cumin that it crunches when you bite it. My server expressed an enthusiasm about the poussin -- plunged into the tandoor in one piece after marinating in vinegar, yogurt, fresh red chiles and kala namak, the sulfurous black salt of India -- that you typically find in new converts to a cult. After tasting it, I was ready to join. He was enthusiastic about almost everything, as it turned out; the service at Adda is nothing if not eager to talk up the food. (Getting your water glass refilled is another story.) Placing a dish of yogurt and pomegranate seeds next to the goat biryani that is steamed under a lid of dough, he said, \"This is going to be your best friend when the spice in the biryani starts to hit you.\" It was, in fact, one of the fiercest biryanis I've ever met, and the yogurt tamed it so that I could taste the tender goat meat and crisp, bittersweet fried onions. Few things on the menu are quite as chile-drenched as the biryani, but Mr. Pandya definitely favors India's more intense flavors. Adda is not big on soft-spoken cream sauces; the coconut milk in the Malvani prawn curry from the South Konkan coast, for instance, has a pronounced kick. (It's very good if you get it on a night when the prawns are firm and not spongy.) And while Adda does serve some vegetables, it would not make my list of the 20 best local Indian restaurants for vegetarians. It would, however, be the place I'd send you if you want to know how good Delhi butter chicken can be. Or if you don't yet believe that rara gosht, chunks of lamb stewed on the bone with spiced minced lamb, is not redundant but luxurious. And Adda is the first restaurant I'd tell you about if you woke up one morning hungry for bheja fry, goat brains cooked with onions, ginger and a considerable number of fresh green chiles. \"Like soft scrambled eggs,\" our server said, accurately. I might point out that a typical Indian bheja fry is drier, with a higher ratio of brains to sauce. But I would not necessarily mean that as a complaint.

{"id": 61, "data": " Earlier this year Henry, a new restaurant in the lobby of the Life Hotel on West 31st Street, quietly died. You wouldn't know it to look around the place on any recent night at 8, when a seamless playlist of hip-hop and R&B unspools as servers carry stacked beef ribs to what seems like every third table. What changed? In August, the chef Joseph Johnson , better known as JJ, was made a partner and assumed control of the kitchen. What he has done is less a makeover than a takeover; his imprint radiates out from his Afrocentric menu to animate the whole enterprise. The playlist, which can run from noon until 8 the next morning without repeating a track, is his. Mr. Johnson's initials now hang in the front window, flooding the nearby tables with pink neon. The initials have migrated to the restaurant's website as well, where its name is now given as Henry at Life Hotel by JJ . These are not subtle gestures, but subtlety has rarely saved a restaurant on the brink of failure. Mr. Johnson has been busy hiring new employees for the front and back of the house, and the racial mix he has already achieved is as impressive as it is rare. Diversifying a restaurant's service staff is one of the surest ways to diversify the audience, and on many nights brown faces and white faces, topknots and braids, headscarves and headbands, sit side by side, giving Henry more the appearance of a restaurant in Harlem than of one just off Herald Square. It was in Harlem, as chef de cuisine at a slinky neighborhood hangout called the Cecil and the history-drenched jazz supper club Minton's , that Mr. Johnson made his name. Fleshing out a notion suggested by Alexander Smalls, the consulting chef in both places, Mr. Johnson explored the African diaspora, the imprint that Africans have put on cooking around the world. He does something similar at Henry, although his view has grown to embrace flavors from, say, India and Southeast Asia that turn up in Africa and in diasporic countries like Jamaica and Barbados. He calls the menu at Henry \"Pan-African.\" [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] This is a big story -- too big to be told in full by one restaurant, or two for that matter. But it's an important story, and it certainly beats Henry's original idea of tying the restaurant to the history of Life magazine, which was once published in the same building, and to Henry Luce , who bought it in 1936, then radically remade it and moved it to other quarters. This concept was so wispy that Henry's first chef, Michael Vignola, resorted to an all-things-to-all-people menu of foie gras sliders and meatball pizza. Just how vast Mr. Johnson's scope has become will be clear by the end of the appetizer course. (Here I am assuming that you have chosen a traditional two- or three-course meal rather than eating all 15 items on the menu, in full and in order; this route costs $390 and is called \"It Was All a Dream,\" after a Notorious B.I.G. lyric.) There are littleneck clams, battered with rice flour and crunchy with shaved fennel and Asian pear. All of this is dotted with a tangerine-colored fluff of piri-piri sauce that is less ferociously spicy than the scalding piri-piris of Angola, Mozambique or South Africa. You are welcome to get a half-dozen, but at my table a full dozen went quickly. Benne seeds, the heirloom variety of sesame brought to North America on slave ships, add a flavor that is something like toasted almonds mixed with coffee beans to tuna tartare. The tuna is topped with a chip of curried peanut brittle and spooned over shiso leaves; you pinch the leaf and pop it in your mouth, where good things start to happen. And as you're adjusting to this cross-pollination of Africa and Japan, Indo-Caribbean cuisine appears on the horizon: a plate of folded roti with dips. The spinach chutney is a little joyless, but the inky purée of eggplant sweetened with dates is a terrific idea. Why Mr. Johnson puts a fried egg on the roti is unclear. When your meal at Henry is over, you may wish you had been sent home with a world map showing the history of forced African migration and spice-trade routes. While it's going on, though, you generally flow with the inner logic the way you can get into a hip-hop track without being able to name every last sample. Generally, but not always. I believe I understood some of the reasoning behind chopped collard greens and cashews tossed with a coconut dressing, but I still find raw collards somewhat rough going after the first few mouthfuls. Is the seared salmon with rice noodles, edamame and bok choy a reference to the Vietnamese community in Senegal? To me it tasted, not unpleasantly, like something one of the better Asian fusion restaurants in Manhattan would have served 20 years ago. Henry's shrimp and pork dumplings, on the other hand, are nondescript little blobs; they sit in an aromatic \"Harlem curry,\" informed by Bengali cooking, that deserves a better dance partner. You could say the same about the intensely herb-scented seafood broth in a seafood boil that Mr. Johnson calls the Afropot; the clams and king crab legs were very good, but the prawns were unappealingly soft and the mussels not quite fleshy enough. The cooking, though, has been getting tighter over the past month, picking up from a first and somewhat droopy meal on a night when Mr. Johnson was not in the kitchen. Tamarind jerk chicken had no spice to speak of. A parcel of rice supposedly inspired by Dominican concón had as much crunch as if it had been left out on the counter overnight, and the eggplant curry ladled over it tasted more like a halfheartedly seasoned tomato sauce. The second time I tried it, the rice had a golden crackle and the curry was worth paying attention to. Apart from the seared scallops in a remarkably good hominy broth with cilantro pistou, those bone-in ribs are the most rewarding main course. The rewards are not so much the short ribs themselves, though they are flavorful and tender; the thrill of the dish is in the battery of little sides like stir-fried millet, spiced black beans and a hoisin sauce I wanted to take home to keep on hand for Chinese-food emergencies. I also thought about pocketing a Foie Crispy Treat, and I would have gotten away with it because everybody else at the table thought they were too weird. Weird they are, but interesting, too. Maybe you'd be happier with the sweet potato pie in a crisp butter crust, very old school apart from the purple yam in the filling. True, at some point in your meal a hotel guest may decide to march through the dining room with a full set of luggage.

{"id": 62, "data": " For most of its time on earth, the New York slice has not been seen as a product that needed tinkering. Yes, pizza in the city has been accessorized with toppings from crayfish (not bad) to Buffalo chicken (hmm) to Caesar salad (no, no, no, no, no). But the foldable, portable triangles of cheese, sauce and dough themselves were generally held to be a natural resource that was perfect as is, much like the soft, unfiltered city tap water claimed to be the source of their excellence. Some pizzerias try to make a better slice. Very few try to make a different slice. Mama's Too makes a different slice. It combines some of the most appealing elements of a Neapolitan pie with the most satisfying aspects of the archetypal product sold on paper plates from sidewalk windows. It is as if Frank Tuttolomondo, the owner and pie architect of this informal but very serious pizzeria on the Upper West Side, has learned how to genetically modify pizza. The bulge of crust at the edge of what Mama's Too calls the \"house slice\" is brown, more rough than smooth and baked to a ferocious crackle. You could tear it off and enjoy it on its own, or maybe with butter or olive oil, just as you can with the best Neapolitans. Yet the flat layer of crust on the bottom is firm, without the soupy center of the Neapolitan style. True to New York form, you can hold it in the air by the curved rim and it will stay flat and parallel to the floor. As they do at Totonno's and some other brick-oven pizzerias, Mr. Tuttolomondo lays the cheese down before the sauce. Rather than drippy, milky discs of fresh mozzarella, though, he covers the raw dough (after priming it with olive oil) in shreds of a slice-friendly variety that is known in the trade as low-moisture mozzarella and that the rest of us call pizza cheese. Over this, he ladles a few blots of tomato pulp. This helps the crust to bake through without getting soggy, keeps the cheese from sliding off the crust, and most of all lets you taste the tomatoes, which are very good. You could, I suppose, think of the house slice as a white pizza with tomato-sauce topping. After the pie comes out of the oven, Mr. Tuttolomondo sprinkles it with grated two-year-old Parmigiano-Reggiano. Basil leaves are the last to go on. At this point, you can pay, walk out the door and amble toward Broadway and 106th Street cradling your slice in a paper plate and taking bites as you go. In other words, you can have the traditional sidewalk pizza experience, but you will be tasting flavors you normally find only in high-minded sit-down pizzerias like Sorbillo , Ops or Una Pizza Napoletana . Those bloodhounds who follow the city's melted-mozzarella trail will recognize that Mama's Too is part of a great reawakening of slice culture. Unlike brick-oven pizza, which came from Europe and relied on preindustrial technology, the New York slice is a lowly American hybrid. It is baked in gas ovens, and the sheer number of places selling it suggests that it requires no special skill. When it is praised, we don't talk about its artisanal roots; we call it the humble slice, the street-corner slice, the slice of the common man and woman. The ordinary slice and its heftier cousin, the Sicilian-style square, were probably first rehabilitated with superior ingredients and a sophisticated understanding of baking by Best Pizza in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 2010. Today, serious pizza hobbyists talk about their favorite slices by reeling off the dough's rising time and hydration levels. North Brooklyn is still the center of the neoclassical slice movement, with L'Industrie and Williamsburg Pizza and, most recently, Paulie Gee's Slice Shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, but the forward-thinking slice is found in Manhattan, too, at Scarr's on the Lower East Side and Corner Slice in the Gotham West Market. The goal of the neoclassicists is, essentially, to return to the golden age of New York takeout pizza, which survives at places like Di Fara in Midwood, Brooklyn, one of the holy sites of the neoclassical church. Paulie Gee's Slice Shop, Scarr's and other neoclassicist joints cultivate a self-consciously vintage atmosphere, styling their logos and signs and interiors so they look like a place where Johnny Boy and Charlie in \"Mean Streets\" might have gone for a pepperoni slice and a Coke. Mr. Tuttolomondo does not fetishize the past. Perhaps this is because he lived it. For almost 60 years his family has owned a series of old-school slice joints in the neighborhood. The current incarnation is literally on a street corner, at the intersection of 106th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. It is called Mama's Pizza . He didn't open Mama's Too a block away to outdo his parents; he's bringing their product into a new era. If the neoclassicists are like the folk revivalists who collected old acoustic 78s, he is Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. When Mama's Too opened in December, it also served housemade pasta. It's still on the menu board that hangs on one wall, but Mr. Tuttolomondo has stopped serving it to concentrate on pizza. Besides the house slice, he also makes squares that he sees as a marriage of rectangular Sicilian pizza with Roman pizza al taglio. The crust is much taller than the Roman style, and taller than some Sicilians, too, but it is airy and chewy. On the bottom it has the bronze color, the cratered surface and the pan-fried crunch of the bread on a grilled cheese sandwich. The edges, where the dough meets the pan, have a gold fringe of browned cheese, known among students of pizza styles as a \"frico crust.\" This fringe is, of course, crunchy and delicious. The most impressive square is, I think, the pepperoni. Unlike most of the others, it incorporates tomato sauce. The mozzarella is baked until it begins to brown. The pepperoni slices are small and concave, like contact lenses made of meat. Crunchy around the rims, these little cups are half-filled with spicy red oil. It may sound as if I approached this slice with cool, analytical detachment. The truth is I ripped into it like a pack of hyenas. The other squares tend to be white pies with toppings. Again, tomato sauce is one of the toppings. In one case it's a thick and creamy layer of vodka sauce, one of the ideas that separates Mama's Too from the neoclassicists. Mr. Tuttolomondo also makes a cacio e pepe Sicilian pie, essentially a four-cheese pizza in which one of the cheeses is pecorino; the whole slice hums with black pepper. The square topped with Gorgonzola dolce and pears works in a way that combination often doesn't, although half a slice was enough for me. The shop is small, and if you sit at one of the handful of red counter stools you will share the small tiled floor up front with neighbors waiting for takeout and delivery guys. There are no vintage soda refrigerators or letterboard signs, but there is a small photograph of Robert De Niro eating pizza and a much bigger one of John Travolta in \"Saturday Night Fever,\" biting into his double-decker slice. The picture is in black and white except for the pizza. Tinted orange and red, it glows like a beacon.", "label": [[36, 44, "LOC"], [110, 115, "FOOD"], [169, 177, "FOOD"], [191, 206, "FOOD"], [216, 228, "FOOD"], [291, 297, "FOOD"], [299, 304, "FOOD"], [309, 314, "FOOD"], [431, 440, "FOOD"], [492, 501, "TYPE"], [570, 580, "EST"], [659, 673, "DISH"], [823, 826, "FOOD"], [871, 879, "TYPE"], [887, 902, "LOC"], [942, 947, "FOOD"], [962, 967, "FOOD"], [988, 998, "EST"], [1010, 1021, "DISH"], [1151, 1157, "FOOD"], [1161, 1170, "FOOD"], [1202, 1213, "DISH"], [1237, 1242, "FOOD"], [1324, 1332, "LOC"], [1298, 1308, "CUISINE"], [1447, 1456, "EST"], [1483, 1492, "TYPE"], [1520, 1526, "FOOD"], [1543, 1548, "FOOD"], [1585, 1601, "FOOD"], [1625, 1634, "FOOD"], [1658, 1667, "FOOD"], [1737, 1760, "FOOD"], [1790, 1802, "FOOD"], [1840, 1851, "FOOD"], [1868, 1873, "FOOD"], [1923, 1929, "FOOD"], [1951, 1956, "FOOD"], [1993, 2001, "FOOD"], [2076, 2113, "DISH"], [2125, 2128, "FOOD"], [2194, 2226, "FOOD"], [2228, 2240, "FOOD"], [2327, 2352, "LOC"], [2472, 2477, "FOOD"], [2569, 2578, "TYPE"], [2584, 2592, "EST"], [2595, 2598, "EST"], [2602, 2622, "EST"], [2665, 2682, "FOOD"], [2709, 2719, "EST"], [2776, 2792, "FOOD"], [2810, 2816, "LOC"], [2861, 2869, "LOC"], [2887, 2895, "CUISINE"], [3217, 3231, "CUISINE"], [3347, 3357, "EST"], [3361, 3383, "LOC"], [3409, 3414, "FOOD"], [3477, 3484, "FOOD"], [3519, 3533, "LOC"], [3595, 3606, "EST"], [3611, 3629, "EST"], [3650, 3673, "EST"], [3677, 3697, "LOC"], [3742, 3751, "LOC"], [3761, 3768, "EST"], [3776, 3791, "LOC"], [3796, 3807, "EST"], [3816, 3834, "LOC"], [3915, 3923, "LOC"], [3980, 3996, "LOC"], [3969, 3976, "EST"], [4049, 4071, "EST"], [4074, 4081, "EST"], [3932, 3937, "FOOD"], [4301, 4316, "DISH"], [4323, 4327, "DISH"], [4476, 4488, "TYPE"], [4590, 4623, "LOC"], [4638, 4650, "EST"], [4668, 4678, "EST"], [4897, 4907, "EST"], [5075, 5080, "FOOD"], [5094, 5105, "DISH"], [5171, 5185, "FOOD"], [5191, 5196, "CUISINE"], [5197, 5212, "FOOD"], [5218, 5223, "FOOD"], [5416, 5421, "FOOD"], [5427, 5450, "FOOD"], [5473, 5478, "FOOD"], [5683, 5692, "FOOD"], [5737, 5749, "FOOD"], [5755, 5765, "FOOD"], [5805, 5814, "FOOD"], [6117, 6141, "FOOD"], [6150, 6162, "FOOD"], [6232, 6243, "FOOD"], [6277, 6287, "EST"], [6343, 6368, "DISH"], [6384, 6401, "FOOD"], [6433, 6441, "FOOD"], [6422, 6429, "FOOD"], [6469, 6481, "FOOD"], [6506, 6522, "FOOD"], [6527, 6532, "FOOD"], [6918, 6923, "FOOD"], [7076, 7081, "FOOD"]]}
{"id": 63, "data": " A card is set down in front of you before each new course arrives at Atomix , the tasting-menu restaurant in Murray Hill run by Junghyun Park and his wife, Jeungeun. Each is printed with a boldface transliteration of a Korean word under an abstract design of geometric shapes and lines. They look like flashcards from a school run by progressive graphic designers. \"Your first course is guk, which means soup,\" a server will say. \"This card is for hwe, Korean for raw.\" \"Jorim is next. Jorim means it's been braised.\" This sounds as if it would get old, but it doesn't. Very early on, you learn that on the other side of these vocabulary exercises lie dishes of wonderful intricacy, sophistication and beauty. One after another, each of the 10 courses in the $175 meal opens up new ideas about Korean cuisine and culture. In the Atomix pedagogical method, instruction is followed closely by reward. (While we are working on vocabulary: The restaurant's name is pronounced, somewhat counterintuitively, a-toe-mix.) [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] Many of the rewards are the kind you eat, of course. Guk-which-means-soup is a shimmering broth that Mr. Park, the chef, makes from fermented tomatoes and kelp; chilled and poured over scallop slices layered between slivers of green tomato that have been marinated in Korean fig vinegar, the broth has an electrifying sweet-sour balance. The dish may not scream \"Korean cuisine,\" but the next one does. This is hwe -- Korean for raw, you'll recall, and also the term for Korean-style sashimi. The fish is striped jack, brushed with plum vinegar sauce. Slices of it are folded around a mild fermented chile, a few drops of sesame oil and bits of kimchi made from cabbage and ramps. Sitting over each slice of jack is a crisp square of gim, which the Japanese call nori. Pinch some fish inside the gim and eat it, and the flavors that unspool are some of those that are brought to the table with Korean sashimi, but they're put together with a harmony that's hard to achieve when you swab them yourself under the influence of a few glasses of soju. Inspired by a poem from the Choson era, Mr. Park summoned an entirely different set of flavors for the hwe on Atomix's opening menu, which ran from late May to early September. Then, the fish was sea bream, firm and chewy, marinated overnight with ginger in a magnificently good tangerine vinegar from the island of Jeju. Eaten with sea urchin, plain spinach, sparkling shards of jelly made from pale young soy sauce, and Chinese-mustard leaves fermented in some wonderful way, it was so deeply harmonic I wouldn't have minded if Mr. Park had served it over and over for the rest of the meal. Centuries before it became the fashion among American chefs, fermentation was a pillar of Korean cuisine. Atomix exploits it in all kinds of ways. Fermentation bends a mix of juices from Korean pears, green apples and pineapple toward a cidery direction that makes it a thrilling marinade, braising liquid and sauce for exquisitely rich Wagyu strip loin. It's the foundation for an array of vinegars you won't find on the average table in Koreatown: cherry blossom, persimmon, mugwort, birch. And, of course, fermentation is behind the restaurant's arsenal of pickled vegetables, the most interesting of which may be the tart brussels sprouts that Mr. Park serves in banchan format alongside roast duck with a mole sauce that could pass muster in Mexico if Mr. Park did not up the funk level with gochujang. Some of these ingredients were fermented or otherwise preserved in South Korea. Many more were put up for storage at Atoboy , the Parks' other restaurant, over the past year or more as the Parks prepared to open Atomix. Atoboy's food is woven around traditional banchan dishes, and while Mr. Park gives himself room to play, the cooking there stays true to the fairly simple origins of banchan. His tasting menus at Atomix make a quantum leap in complexity. It's like seeing the guy who strums the 12-string guitar on the L platform pick up a conductor's baton and lead an orchestra through a Mahler symphony. On the back of Atomix's flashcards he lists the components of each dish, and each of their ingredients -- around 20 on average, very few of them ordinary and none of them out of place. Nothing at Atomix tastes confused or overburdened. The dishes are even more elaborate than those at Jungsik , the rarefied Korean-inspired restaurant downtown where Mr. Park was the chef de cuisine before he and his wife struck out on their own. And while Jungsik seems determined to stuff Korean flavors into an outdated French formality, Atomix is warm, contemporary and Korean at just about every turn. The Parks, who were raised in South Korea, hired a Seoul architecture firm, Studio Writers, to remake two floors of a secretive-looking townhouse on East 30th Street. Upstairs is a small bar where you can slither into a pale-leather booth to idle over smartly conceived snacks like soy-marinated scallop jerky; beef tartare, mixed with red and black pepper, and under a snowfall of pecorino; or fried wings stuffed with fried rice and dusted with ground Sichuan peppercorns. Stairs descend to a bright, skylit lounge of upholstered benches where the tasting menu kicks off with a couple of hors d'oeuvres and drinks. The idea must be for you to leave the shuffle of Manhattan behind in stages, but I always spent my few minutes in this way station eyeing the comfortable, dark, wood-clad den a few steps away where the rest of the meal is served at a 14-seat counter. The natural materials and simple lines in the tasting room seem to bow toward Korea's long Zen tradition, and a kind of purposeful calm reigns there. Servers and cooks all wear flowing, boat-neck shirts in a shimmering pewter color that gives them a slight science-fiction look; they are the work of a Korean-born New York designer, Sungho Ahn. Ms. Park, who goes by Ellia, glides behind the counter, smiling and holding out a cloth case to offer a pair of the Korean-made chopsticks she collects. They're beautiful objects, and so are the handmade plates and bowls that begin to file out of the kitchen, each made by a potter or glass worker or wood carver in South Korea. These artisans are identified on the menu cards, whose abstract designs are the work of a South Korean artist. Tasting menus can be arid and sterile when a chef doesn't have much to say. The format comes to life when a restaurant is overflowing with ideas, like Atomix. The way the Parks put Korean culture in the foreground recalls the early days of the Four Seasons, which moved beyond European models of formal dining by hiring an American architect and American industrial designers to go along with the American ingredients and even American wines. The Four Seasons had a Swiss chef, though. Atomix is more thorough: It has the Parks. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 64, "data": " The rise of Sichuan food in New York has made the past decade or two a glorious era for prowlers of Chinese restaurants. Chongqing chicken and mung-bean jelly proliferated as skilled chefs flocked to the city. But while the miles of dan dan noodles and mountains of Sichuan peppercorns have been exhilarating, they have tended to overshadow the cuisine of another great chile-haunted region, Hunan. Part of the problem is nomenclature. The word Hunan on a restaurant's front window tends to say as much about the actual cooking inside as pandas and bamboo on the sign. At first glance it can be hard to distinguish Hunan Garden, say, from Hunan House until you see the menus and learn that the former name signifies egg rolls while the latter promises the red-braised pork that Mao used to dote on. Fake Hunans outnumber real ones, which is one reason to celebrate the appearance of Hunan Slurp . Operating in the East Village since May, Hunan Slurp lives up to both halves of its name. When people in Hunan get hungry for a bowl of noodles, what they have in mind are mifen: long, white strands made from pounded rice, so smooth they may slither right out of the chopsticks of inexperienced slurpers. Chances for New Yorkers to practice their antiskid chopstick techniques have been limited, generally speaking, to the rice noodles of other parts of Asia. When you could find Hunanese noodles around town, they tended to be tucked away on larger menus with so many other Hunanese opportunities that they were rarely given a chance to slither. Hunan Slurp offers some of those opportunities, too. The chef and proprietor, Chao Wang, comes from Hunan's second-largest city, Hengyang, and fills the menu with both traditional Hunanese dishes and his own innovations. But noodles are the heart of the restaurant. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] They peek out from underneath slices of beef, tofu and barbecued pork, all fanned out like a hand of poker, in a soup-less wonder called Hometown Lu Fen. The sauce is in the bottom of the bowl, and should absolutely be augmented with some of the chopped pickled red chiles in oil served in a small dish on the side. In the string bean mifen, the noodles weave around a fried egg and a scattering of ground Berkshire pork, stir-fried to a crackle with little rounds of sliced, pickled green beans. There is no slick of chile oil on top, and the pale broth looks harmless enough, but once the soup is stirred together it will take the crease out of a pair of newly pressed trousers. A little red sheaf of dried chile threads bobbing in the wild pepper and beef soup gives you an idea what you are in for, if the name hasn't already given away the game. But with Hunan Slurp's noodles, as with Hunanese food generally, heat is part of the message; it's never the medium. Stock is to the cook what pitch is to the opera singer, goes a Chinese proverb. Hunan Slurp's soup stocks are rounded and cloudy from long-boiled bones and meat, and they tend to get better the longer they linger with their toppings. (So do the noodles.) A master class in the art of broth subtlety is provided by the two-part soup that goes by the under-promising name fish fillet mifen. Part One is an oversize ceramic bowl of milky white pork-and-fish stock strewn with flower petals, pea shoots, purple basil and other fresh herbs. It arrives on a wooden tray next to Part Two, the noodles, which get their own bowl. The broth's flavor was elusive at first, more a texture than a taste. Within minutes the steamed fish in the broth, together with the herbs, had transformed it into something splendid. Like many of the new Chinese restaurants that have sprouted in the East Village, Hunan Slurp pays attention to appearances. Under a backlighted logo that spells out SLURP in elongated, noodly letters, a sheet of glass on First Avenue frames the long, tunneled dining room, designed by New Practice Studio . The interior is sheathed in wooden slats that run up one wall, arch their way across the ceiling and fall down the opposite wall. Depending on your frame of mind, eating at Hunan Slurp can feel like sitting under a rack of drying noodles or finding yourself inside the belly of a particularly tidy whale. A glassed-in kitchen lies in the back, its shelves stacked with colorfully glazed modern Chinese plates and bowls that you won't find in the restaurant-supply shops on the Bowery. Once you leave the noodle section of the menu behind, it is possible to find cooking that doesn't necessarily live up to the standard set by the crockery. I'm told that the bands of cumin-seasoned beef speared with toothpicks can be crisp and well-browned, but the ones I got were gray and floppy. And the sweet-and-sour spareribs, an appetizer, were far more sweet than sour, and tough, too. On the best available evidence, Mr. Wang's palate skews a bit sweet. This is unusual in a Hunanese kitchen, but only those spareribs were off-puttingly sugary. A multicolored salad of chilled cherry tomatoes was bright and refreshing despite a fruity marination in plum juice. (A similar dish sometimes turns up at Hao Noodle and Tea by Madam Zhu's Kitchen , where it is sweeter, and still very enjoyable.) And the hint of sugar in stir-fried chicken did not soften the toothy bite of young ginger, or hide the ginger's natural sweetness, either. You may not notice the bias toward sweetness anyway, given the kitchen's open embrace of chiles. An electrical current of heat crackles through the dim-sum-style chicken feet, cooked until they are falling-off-the-toe tender. Bright green chiles animate a stir-fry of julienne potatoes, cooked so fast they're still stiff. They also bring not just spice but crunch to a classic Hunanese sauté of pork and garlic topped with an egg fried to a ruffled, golden crisp. The chiles knocked around in a very hot wok with sweet, juicy cabbage are small, red, sun-dried and noticeably fruity under their mouth-zapping heat. The spice level is more subdued in the excellent stir-fry of pork and smoked tofu, and it's almost undetectable in a very likable preparation of skinny eggplant sections topped with discs of bell pepper; the skins are left on the eggplants, which gives the appetizer something of the appearance of tuna maki wrapped with purple seaweed. Meals tend to move quickly. For this you may be thankful on busy nights when those wood slats go from attractive design elements to unnervingly effective sounding boards. As in other Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood, the crowd tends to be young, bright, quick and eager to get on with the rest of the evening. As the dinner rush ends, the howl subsides. Maybe ice cream is on the agenda, or a classic dessert soup of mung beans and barley in syrup. Or maybe a pot of tea, loose-leaf, brewed at the table while you think about chiles and rice and pork and wonder how many more Hunanese chefs can be persuaded to settle down in New York.", "label": [[13, 20, "CUISINE"], [29, 37, "DISH"], [101, 108, "CUISINE"], [122, 139, "FOOD"], [144, 159, "FOOD"], [234, 249, "FOOD"], [267, 286, "FOOD"], [393, 398, "LOC"], [446, 451, "LOC"], [616, 628, "EST"], [640, 651, "EST"], [717, 726, "DISH"], [757, 773, "DISH"], [805, 811, "LOC"], [884, 895, "EST"], [915, 927, "LOC"], [939, 950, "EST"], [1003, 1008, "LOC"], [1034, 1041, "FOOD"], [1070, 1075, "FOOD"], [1115, 1119, "FOOD"], [1352, 1356, "LOC"], [1321, 1333, "FOOD"], [1545, 1556, "EST"], [1645, 1652, "LOC"], [1674, 1682, "LOC"], [1725, 1733, "CUISINE"], [1378, 1386, "CUISINE"], [1387, 1394, "FOOD"], [1859, 1872, "LOC"], [1925, 1929, "FOOD"], [1770, 1777, "FOOD"], [1931, 1935, "FOOD"], [1940, 1954, "FOOD"], [2022, 2037, "EST"], [2139, 2164, "FOOD"], [2208, 2225, "DISH"], [2231, 2238, "FOOD"], [2254, 2263, "FOOD"], [2284, 2305, "FOOD"], [2361, 2380, "FOOD"], [2403, 2412, "FOOD"], [2434, 2439, "FOOD"], [2476, 2480, "FOOD"], [2588, 2599, "FOOD"], [2623, 2634, "FOOD"], [2639, 2648, "FOOD"], [2745, 2757, "EST"], [2759, 2766, "FOOD"], [2776, 2784, "CUISINE"], [2853, 2858, "CUISINE"], [2933, 2946, "EST"], [2947, 2958, "FOOD"], [2999, 3004, "FOOD"], [3009, 3013, "FOOD"], [3098, 3105, "FOOD"], [3137, 3142, "FOOD"], [3180, 3184, "FOOD"], [3223, 3240, "DISH"], [3294, 3313, "FOOD"], [3341, 3351, "FOOD"], [3326, 3339, "FOOD"], [3353, 3365, "FOOD"], [3376, 3387, "FOOD"], [3425, 3433, "EST"], [3439, 3446, "FOOD"], [3478, 3485, "FOOD"], [3563, 3575, "FOOD"], [3583, 3588, "FOOD"], [3608, 3613, "FOOD"], [3680, 3687, "CUISINE"], [3726, 3738, "LOC"], [3740, 3751, "EST"], [3844, 3850, "FOOD"], [3880, 3892, "LOC"], [4139, 4150, "EST"], [4443, 4449, "LOC"], [4470, 4476, "FOOD"], [4633, 4652, "FOOD"], [4757, 4781, "DISH"], [4934, 4942, "CUISINE"], [4967, 4976, "DISH"], [5019, 5024, "FOOD"], [5036, 5051, "FOOD"], [5109, 5119, "FOOD"], [5159, 5200, "EST"], [5267, 5272, "FOOD"], [5276, 5294, "DISH"], [5335, 5341, "FOOD"], [5355, 5363, "FOOD"], [5480, 5486, "FOOD"], [5553, 5565, "DISH"], [5624, 5636, "FOOD"], [5659, 5676, "FOOD"], [5769, 5777, "CUISINE"], [5860, 5866, "FOOD"], [5918, 5925, "FOOD"], [6055, 6087, "DISH"], [5778, 5821, "DISH"], [6158, 6166, "FOOD"], [6197, 6208, "FOOD"], [6236, 6245, "FOOD"], [6304, 6313, "FOOD"], [6327, 6341, "FOOD"], [6526, 6533, "CUISINE"], [6710, 6719, "FOOD"], [6767, 6797, "DISH"], [6817, 6820, "FOOD"], [6876, 6882, "FOOD"], [6887, 6891, "FOOD"], [6896, 6900, "FOOD"], [6926, 6934, "CUISINE"], [6976, 6984, "LOC"]]}
{"id": 65, "data": " During the five years Village Cafe has been open, I must have driven the length of Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn a dozen times without noticing it. At best I might have spotted the tiny parking lot in Midwood, with tattered red, blue and silver streamers flapping over its 10 or so spaces, giving it the appearance of the world's smallest used-car dealership. In the back is a wide, single-story structure that looks like the trailer office where you would sit down to discuss loan options with Marty from financing. But that building is an Azerbaijani restaurant that stands out among the dining outposts of former Soviet republics that stretch north from Brighton Beach, and each time I've gone inside I was given not a credit check, but a test of my appetite's limits. This is not just because almost every platter of food that leaves the kitchen at Village Cafe seems intended to feed an actual village. I run into trouble because there are so many things I want to order and so few things I am willing to leave on the table as the meal winds down. There will never be a time when I go to Village Cafe and decide not to have at least one qutab, if not all three. The menu gives the name of this delicate Azerbaijani flatbread, the diameter of a pita but thinner, as kutaby. Either way, it is very good when stuffed with minced, quietly spiced chicken or lamb. It is exceptional when filled with greens: spinach, scallions, and dill and cilantro, two fresh herbs that turn up again and again in Azerbaijani cooking. I will always want the crimped dumplings, the size and shape of chicken drumettes, that the English menu calls ravioli and the servers call pelmeni. Filled with chicken or lamb, these dumplings can be boiled, but the urge to ask for them fried is overwhelming, and the fried ones are better dunked in the tomato-pepper sauce that I would call salsa if I were not in an Azerbaijani restaurant. There will be liver on my table, too. Maybe it will be Turkish style, little fried cubes under a tart purple dusting of ground sumac. Or the liver may be added to bits of lamb hearts, kidney and testicles, and cooked with onions and potato cubes in a fantastically oily hash called djiz biz. Whether I will eat guru hingal will depend on how far in advance I've planned my meal, because it generally has to be ordered a day ahead. It is a noodle dish: very thin, wide sheets of pasta under a sauce of onions and ground lamb fried in its own fat until it is magnificently crunchy. If you poured chile oil over guru hingal, it would taste Sichuanese; stew the lamb with tomatoes and you could mistake the sauce for Bolognese. But it's from Azerbaijan, and it's good with yogurt. And I will have soup, even if nobody else does, because Village Cafe's kitchen understands how to make it. The kufta-bozbash is a strong, well-skimmed lamb broth with chickpeas and a single, tender lamb-rice meatball, as big as an apple. The broth for dushbara soup is similar, but the ballast is provided by miniature lamb dumplings about the size of M&Ms. Cilantro and dried mint are added to both soups at the last minute, and the mint is especially helpful. Village Cafe's hot borscht, strong and decidedly unvegetarian, outperforms some I've had in Brighton Beach. Instead of sour cream, it comes with a spoonful of yogurt. The cuisine of Azerbaijan often echoes those of its neighbors Georgia, Armenia and Iran, but other dishes, like borscht, were hauled down from Eastern Europe in the strong arms of Mother Russia. We can also thank Russia for the insane music videos that play on Village Cafe's two televisions, typically with the volume off while American pop of the '80s plays on the sound system. You sit at what appear to be varnished picnic tables with chairs instead of benches. The rest of the décor looks like a Brighton Beach yard sale: a mushroom cookie jar, an embroidered peasant smock, a camouflage cap, a samovar or two, a collection of beaded handbags, several ceramic cows, three statues of fat chefs with toques and mustaches, and two giant forks mounted on the wall. For atmosphere, Village Cafe is roundly beaten by my second-favorite Azerbaijani restaurant in Brooklyn, Old Baku in Kensington. Walk past the awning that says \"private club,\" past the curtained booths in the front dining room, past the open kitchen where chefs scoop burning coals to keep the fire under the kebabs going strong, and you enter a courtyard from another country. Almost everybody at Old Baku is smoking under the arbor of grape vines that weave around strings of white lights. If you go in the fall, you might be brought a plate of purple grapes, newly picked a few feet away. But Village Cafe gains its edge on Old Baku in the kitchen. The stewed fruit ladled over saffron rice in its plov, for instance, is a richer and more varied compilation of dried plums, apricots, chestnuts and deeply browned lamb. The salads are brighter, too, if you can get over some of the names. The menu was evidently written by someone with a weakness for poetry, so the salads are called things like \"Journey to Baku,\" \"Winter Fun\" and \"Unexpected Guests.\" The Journey to Baku is worth taking; it's a sharply seasoned, smoky eggplant mash with peppers and tomatoes. The kidney beans in a traditional lobio salad are creamy, salty and well-oiled under their topping of chopped walnuts and cilantro. Main course names incline toward the allusive as well, with one chicken cutlet called \"Miracle of Village\" and another -- buried under a white pillow of cheese and cream sauce -- that goes by \"Mother In Laws Chicken.\" But really, the best place to go once all the amenities have been polished off is the kebabs. The quail may be a bit wizened. The grilled testicles with a hint of lemon in their lightly browned surfaces will always be a niche proposition. But the lamb ribs, the marinated lamb chops known as chalahac and the flatbread-wrapped Azerbaijani version of kofte called lulya kebabs (made from chicken or lamb) are extremely good. The vegetable skewer choices begin and end with blistered tomatoes and softly collapsing eggplant. Both are worthwhile. So is the side dish called \"homemade potatoes,\" if there is any room left on the table. Sliced and fried with onions, they narrowly beat out the pretty good fries. A cup or two of strong dark tea will speed your recovery from this onslaught. Dessert may not. Still, there is something to be said for trying a Napoleon made like baklava and a baklava made like a Napoleon. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 66, "data": " Shrinking modesty is not the normal attitude for restaurants with a view. The Rainbow Room had Art Deco razzmatazz and its revolving dance floor; Windows on the World, before terrorists destroyed it, served cocktails in a room named the Greatest Bar on Earth. Manhatta , which recently opened on the 60th floor of an International Style tower downtown, doesn't follow their lead. It is the least show-offy skyscraper restaurant you've ever seen. The whole operation is very orderly and well behaved, apart from its refusal to spell its own name correctly. (The reference is to the Lenni Lenape name Manahatta, or Mannahatta, meaning \"island of many hills,\" but without the second \"a\" the name just looks incomplete. It's like a child named Henr.) A dedicated door around the corner from the building's main entrance brings you into a foyer that, with its sleek chairs and coffee tables, looks like the lobby of one of those 1960s white-brick apartment buildings in the East 40s and 50s. When you get out of the elevator -- it goes to just one floor, the top -- a short walk leads to another sparsely furnished sitting area, this one looking out the windows toward the harbor and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. When the lounge hasn't been rented out for parties and sealed off, it's busier than the foyer downstairs, but it still appears to have been designed for people who are waiting for their dates to get back from the restroom. In the other direction are Manhatta's bar, a longish counter whose seats face uptown, and its dining room, which looks both north and east toward Brooklyn. The color scheme, navy-blue leather and dark wood, might strike the Knickerbocker Club 's board as a little too conservative. An open kitchen has been dropped down into the middle of all this, but the overall design strategy is to sit back and let the windows do the work. Danny Meyer, whose Union Square Hospitality Group runs Manhatta through a management contract with the building's owner, told The New York Times last year that Manhatta would not be as flamboyant as a typical top-floor restaurant. \"Those kinds of places often do not live up to expectations; they try too hard to live up to the view,\" he said. \"I expect to conceive of it like a ground-floor restaurant, as a place people might want to visit regularly.\" You can't blame Mr. Meyer for not wanting to open a mediocre splashy restaurant, but Manhatta flirts dangerously with being a mediocre unsplashy restaurant. The chef, Jason Pfeifer, doesn't quite let that happen. His French menu, grounded in seasonal flavors, is fairly priced at $78, including tip, for a three-course prix fixe. A good amount of it is very likable, but there are more spongy patches than there probably should be. At their best, Manhatta's better appetizers and main courses are fleshed out with fruits and vegetables so ripe and pristine they seem to come from a Greenmarket stall that only Mr. Pfeifer can see. A melon and cucumber salad with fluffy curds of feta was an exploration of melonic potential; each section of fruit was a bit different, some infused with citrus, others dripping with unfiltered garden-patch sweetness, all of them tangy with white balsamic vinegar. An admirably cooked brick of halibut was paired with bittersweet fennel bulbs and a mustard sauce with a gentle but effective bite. Raw nectarine crescents, braised lettuces and tender thin wheels of immature corn on the cob augmenting a main course of chicken were their charming selves, and all the better for their slinky dressing of chicken jus. Sweet black figs stood in for apples in a memorable little tarte Tatin garnished with raw pale-green figs. (Jennifer Bretania and Vanesa Beltran share the pastry duties.) Gently marinated hen-of-the-woods mushrooms made an exquisitely woodsy counterpoint to ruffles of shaved La Marotte sheep cheese. But generous applications of produce don't always save the food from seeming a bit safe, conservative and slightly dated. Mr. Pfeifer, who spent eight years in the kitchen at Maialino , Mr. Meyer's Roman-inspired restaurant, is now cooking French food in the post-nouvelle mode that Daniel Boulud has been artfully fomenting for years. Mr. Boulud has earned the right to keep working in that groove as long as he likes, but it's strange to find a young chef at a new, high-profile destination doing it when others around the city are pushing ahead with contemporary interpretations of French cuisine. And when Manhatta turns to the classics, its use of French idioms seems skin-deep compared with Laetitia Rouabah's light touch and sophisticated technique at Benoit , or Marie-Aude Rose's painstaking elevations of cafe cooking at La Mercerie , or Daniel Rose's intelligent, neoclassical excavations of silver-cloche cuisine at Le Coucou . Where Le Coucou brought back quenelles as helium-light pike dumplings in dizzyingly rich lobster-brandy sauce, Manhatta turns them into quivering balls of pudding distantly scented with seafood. Of all the ways a modern chef might grapple with cassoulet, the sublimely burly Languedocian assault on the digestive system, upending it over a crisp and golden chicken paillard has to be one of the strangest. Manhatta isn't the first restaurant to update veal blanquette with meat that's roasted rather than stewed, but the sauce is so blandly milky that it's hardly there. And while modern desserts can stray into savory territory more than they did in Escoffier's day, a vanilla soufflé with butterscotch sauce probably shouldn't taste salty. Some of this was dispiriting, but I never got up from the table in a bad mood. There are grace notes throughout the restaurant, like the dark, shiny little canelés that show up with dessert. This being a Union Square Hospitality production, the servers seem to be trained mind readers. A pair of the mismatched binoculars scattered around the restaurant materialized just when I was trying to locate the clock tower in the Consolidated Edison Building; before I'd had a chance to point out a fruit fly in my wine (did it ride up with me in the elevator?) a sommelier spirited the glass away and brought a fresh one. Mr. Meyer was probably right to take a dialed-down approach to the top-floor restaurant genre. It dates from a more innocent age, when people could look at the financial district's unblinking grids of lighted windows as the bland face of high-stakes cheating that we've come to recognize from \"Margin Call\" and \"Billions.\" At the time of the financial crisis, Manhatta's building was the headquarters of JPMorgan Chase -- a relatively minor player in the three-card-monte game of mortgage-backed securities, but a player nonetheless.

{"id": 67, "data": " \"People always say summer is not a good time for sushi,\" Derek Wilcox said. \"I have no idea what they're talking about.\" Early evening, the end of August, and the granite TriBeCa sidewalks outside Shoji at 69 Leonard Street were deserted. The restaurant was empty, too. I sat alone on one side of the counter, and on the other stood Mr. Wilcox, alone, as he usually is even when customers occupy all 12 chairs. Although assistants work in the wings, the restaurant is essentially a one-man show. In the broad view, having the place to myself was unjust. In the year since Mr. Wilcox took over the restaurant -- at first his work there was termed a residency or pop-up, but in June the owner, Idan Elkon, announced that he'd put a ring on it and made the arrangement permanent -- he has firmly placed it in the top tier of the city's Japanese restaurants. On the basis of sushi alone, Shoji has few plausible rivals, and for sushi embedded within a longer, kaiseki-derived menu, it has no parallel. There should be no empty seats, no matter how many New Yorkers are off lolling at the beach. Taking a selfish view, though, I wasn't particularly unhappy to be the only customer. Mr. Wilcox, who grew up in Virginia, cooked at a kaiseki restaurant in Kyoto called Kikunoi for seven years and then spent three more at a traditionalist sushi parlor in the Ginza district of Tokyo. You might think of this as the equivalent of earning a master's degree followed by a Ph.D. in Japanese cuisine, and one side benefit of a meal across the counter from Mr. Wilcox is the chance to hear what he learned studying abroad. Show some curiosity and you could get a short education in the mineral-rich clay used by potters in the town of Shigaraki, or the various aliases and false names under which a particularly delicious, pink-fleshed fish known as akamutsu in Japan travels under when it is away from home. On this August night, I was about to get a two-hour schooling on the pleasures of summer sushi. Mr. Wilcox's opening move was a squiggle of what looked like short, thick noodles and turned out to be lengths of chilled eggplant; Mr. Wilcox had given them a cool bath in the light sauce in which icy coils of somen noodles are dipped in summer. Laid over the top were two tongues of bafun sea urchin, a species with the color of a nearly ripe persimmon. With one dish, he had shooed away the heat outside, shown off the uncanny harmony of urchin and eggplant, and introduced a minor theme of the night, the summer urchin harvest in Japan. This overture out of the way, Mr. Wilcox lifted what appeared to be a machete. This was a hamo knife, a heavy swath of sharp steel that can reduce the daggertooth pike conger's dozens of tiny bones to edible smithereens; before the first one was forged in the 19th century, he explained, the eel had to be fully cooked and separated from its skeleton. This hamo would be quickly scorched on one side and served with a lick of wasabi and puréed salt-cured plums thinned with dashi. Sashimi came next in the form of shioko, or kanpachi caught when it is young and its flavor is leaner and softer than it will get later in the year. This was followed by a local fish that in the spring Mr. Wilcox had told me he didn't like, striped bass. He had been working with it, though, salting it overnight and then grilling it until the skin crackled. Now I don't want striped bass cooked any other way. After this was Mr. Wilcox's nod to the kaiseki tradition known as takiawase, a plate of simmered vegetables and, in this case, seafood: a small potato, some Japanese eggplant, a crisp pink ginger shoot and the most flavorful piece of octopus I have ever put in my mouth. After my first meal at Shoji I learned to hope that chawan mushi, a bowl of steaming-hot tofu custard, was on the menu. In spring Mr. Wilcox made it with spot prawns, but tonight, in homage to clambake season, he was serving lobster chawan mushi. To this point, the menu had faithfully followed kaiseki's ritualized sequence of courses and its stopwatch-precise attention to seasonality. It was about to veer in a different direction, but it was enough to suggest that Mr. Wilcox could open a kaiseki restaurant that would set a new standard in the city. I'm not sure the city would support it, but it would be spectacular while it lasted. The different direction, of course, was sushi. Accounting for just about half the Shoji menu, the sushi portion is briefer and offers less variety than the full monty at, say, Sushi Amane or Ginza Sushi Onodera . But I'm not sure any competitor outflanks Shoji on the quality of the seafood it does serve, or in the timeliness with which it serves up exactly the specimens most worth tracking down at any given moment. In spring, when bioluminescent firefly squid are spawning in Japanese bays, Mr. Wilcox gets them. In August, when cuttlefish are thumbnail size, unbelievably smooth and as meltingly soft as the thinnest sheet of nova at Russ & Daughters , he will lay three of those over a single finger of rice. He tracks bluefin that has been caught from healthy stocks, like the o-toro from Ireland that he served last spring and that was so seductive it could have been captioned \"the guy she told you not to worry about.\" While in Japan, Mr. Wilcox learned to make fresh ikura from sacs of salmon roe, a slow process that requires massaging the eggs apart by hand in many changes of water. Normally the roe is then heavily cured with sugar and salt, but the roe he was serving last month was very lightly seasoned before being spooned into a shot glass and served as is -- sticky, fatty, sweet and fresh. After the last piece of fish, the kaiseki format kicks in again with a soup, which may be as simple as a classic bowl of miso or may break with tradition, like the extraordinary corn soup I ate in August. There will be something cold and refreshing, maybe a granita made from ginger or matcha, and finally a more substantial dessert. Sometimes this is a sort of tart with seasonal fruit -- candied kumquats, maybe, or white peaches and blueberries -- arranged in a mochi wafer called monaka. For all this the charge is $252, service included. A shorter menu is available at $190, or a longer one at $295, again with service included. That service is somewhat minimal; lately it has meant a single employee assiduously refilling water glasses and taking orders from a drinks list whose cheapest item is a $12 bottle of beer. Could my server have been more adept at deciphering the wines, sakes, shochus and Haitian rums Mr. Elkon and Mr. Wilcox have put together? Perhaps, but I wouldn't necessarily want the scene cluttered by a sommelier in full pocket-square-and-cuff-links regalia. More employees hovering at the counter might take away from the bond Mr. Wilcox builds with the people he feeds. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 68, "data": " Sometimes when I am waiting, and waiting, for a barista to steam milk for my cortado, I like to pass the time by imagining what life would be like if Howard Schultz had boarded the wrong plane in 1981 and flown to Penang instead of Milan. Starbucks, the company he joined after that trip and would eventually lead , might teach its employees the fine arts of Malaysian kopi, brewed by pouring hot water over grounds in the bottom of a sock, rather than show them how to operate an espresso machine. Instead of white-chocolate mocha lattes, we would drink bek-kopi, white coffee, brewed from beans that are lightly roasted in palm oil margarine. Venti would just be Italian for a number, while kopi-C kosong, or strong black coffee with unsweetened condensed milk, would have entered the American lexicon, along with kopi tarik, the same drink made with sweetened condensed milk. There would be no competitions where baristas drew swans and elephants in milk froth, and in their place we would have exhibitions of coffee and tea pulling , the art of cooling the beverage while coaxing the milk in it to form a foamy head by pouring it from one pot to another in long, swooping, steamy cataracts. In other words, the places where we get our caffeine fix might look a lot like Kopitiam , on East Broadway in Chinatown. Kyo Pang founded Kopitiam three years ago as a homage to the coffee and tea parlors of Malaysia, where she grew up. A typical Malaysian kopitiam is a ramshackle hangout where people drop in to read the morning paper, grab breakfast, catch up on neighborhood gossip and do all the other things that classically accompany a cup of tea or coffee. Something of that spirit pervades Kopitiam, too. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] The original Kopitiam, reviewed by Ligaya Mishan in a 2015 Hungry City column, was situated around the corner on Canal Street and had just four seats at a single counter. In June, Ms. Pang and her new business partner, Moonlynn Tsai, relocated to a larger, if still fairly intimate, space a few steps above the sidewalk. You order at the counter and receive a number on a metal stand, a kind of promissory note for the food and beverages. If you show up on a weekday in the morning or afternoon, when seats are not hard to come by and the room has a languid, unhurried air, you could get just a cup of bek-kopi and linger over it with a newspaper. You will probably want more than that, though. From 9 a.m., when the doors open, until 10 p.m., when they close, you can get nasi lemak, Malaysia's national dish and a particular favorite at breakfast. I don't know another kitchen in the city where the fragrances of coconut and pandan leaf infuse the rice as elegantly, or where the tiny dried fish, which Kopitiam fries with peanuts, form a caramelized crust that erases the distinction between sweet and savory. Or your breakfast could be a bowl of two eggs boiled just long enough to turn the whites opaque while leaving the yolks free to billow into mushroom-soy broth underneath. Or it might be fish ball soup, grape-size globes of ground fish in a cloudy white broth; if the grains of white pepper on the surface aren't intense enough for you, you can stir in a little fish sauce spiced with bird's eye chiles. Rice vermicelli can be added, too, but the soup is easier to appreciate in pure liquid form. For mornings when nothing but a cannonball dive into sugar will do, Kopitiam is ready with a sculptural pile of thick-cut French toast battered with Milo malt-chocolate powder, a Malaysian passion, with streams of sweetened condensed milk playing the part that in this country is normally taken by maple syrup. Eat the whole stack and you will know the answer to the musical question posed by the Cramps: How far can too far go? At 10:30 a.m. Ms. Pang, the chef, adds a gang of new dishes to the breakfast crew, and all of them stick around until closing time. There are fresh little oysters embedded in a thin browned omelet, rice noodles in a chilled sesame-oil broth with a growl of chile heat and spicy skate steamed in banana leaves, the classic acoustic version of the dish that Max Ng plays with amplifiers and wah-wah pedals at Momofuku Ssam Bar . Any of these could make a small meal. But one of the most inviting aspects of Kopitiam is Ms. Pang's fidelity to the Malaysian love of snacks. Pandan leaves wrapped around a kind of chicken sausage; ground five-spice pork rolled inside bean-curd skins and fried; fried strips of mackerel sausage with a curry-leaf sauce -- any of them makes a fine appetizer, but each could just as easily be the entire goal of a between-meals stop at Kopitiam. For that matter, so could the small sweets like pulut: triangular, pandan-wrapped bundles of sticky rice tinted with blue morning glory flowers and spread with toasted coconut sugar or house-made coconut jam. Ms. Pang is devoted to cakes as well. You get the sense that if it were physically possible, she'd bake every cake she knows every day, but she settles for one or two in an unpredictable rotation. You may find the caramel-brown honeycomb cake, with its intriguing structure of hollow vertical columns at the bottom, or you may find her coconut cake, or there may be some fresh surprise. Snacks and sweets tend to get edged out of the spotlight in New York restaurants, where there's always pressure to order something big. This is, after all, a city that turned the casual tapas bar into the peculiar genre known as the tapas restaurant. There is no such pressure inside Kopitiam, at least on weekdays. Weekend brunch is another story, as it often is. The menu is the same, but the crowds thicken. A sign-in sheet is kept outside the door, next to the pink pay phone (25 cents; it works), and hopeful customers sit on ceramic garden stools at the top of the stoop listening for their names. When you're finally called, you may feel silly getting nothing more than tannic milky tea and a bundle of blue sticky rice. And when demand peaks, chaos can creep in, suggesting that Kopitiam is still figuring out the mechanics of its larger space. Servers may pop by anxiously to ask, \"Did you get all your food?\" and the answer may be no. Drink orders may stack up. Once the white coffee was off the menu; another time, no coffee at all was being poured; and for a short time one day, both coffee and tea were unavailable, an awkward state of affairs for a coffee and tea parlor. Even with a backlog of tickets, though, the food trickling out of the kitchen is almost unfailingly terrific. Maybe the stir-fried duck tongues I ate last time could have slid from their cartilaginous framework more easily. Then again, maybe I wasn't in the right mood for duck tongues.

{"id": 69, "data": " Considering the history, the influence, the depth and the sophistication of Iranian food, it has always seemed unfair that New York City has so few places to eat it. Unfair to the cuisine and unfair to would-be eaters. If you want a symbol for the state of the cuisine in New York City, Taste of Persia NYC will fit the bill. Until recently I might have called it the city's most promising Iranian kitchen, if the word kitchen weren't such a stretch. Taste of Persia is a takeout operation squeezed into the front window of a Chelsea pizzeria, except during the two months when fire damage forced it to take up temporary residence in a holiday market. It does show off some of the pleasures of the Iranian table, but not the table itself. So a new Brooklyn restaurant called Sofreh , which joined the Iranian ranks in June, would have caused a stir even if the cooking weren't quite as good as it is. The dining room is spare and modern, with exposed rafters, molded plywood chairs and shades of soft white. You have to look carefully to see the breaks with garden-variety minimalism, like the echoes of medieval arches behind the bar and the Persian calligraphy carved into the plaster in the back, where a small deck hangs above a garden. Minimalism surrenders entirely in the bathroom, papered in a pulpy collage of posters from pre-revolutionary Iranian cinema. All summer, Iranian expats and hopeful fans of Iranian cuisine have been filing in, armed with questions: Does the saffron rice stand high in voluminous heaps of discrete grains? Are nigella seeds embedded in the dimpled, golden crusts of the oval loaves of barbari? Do the cold shards of sorbet frozen around threads of noodles in Sofreh's faloodeh contain just enough rose water to soften the bite of lime syrup? Check, check and check. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] The main dining room is on the street level of a Prospect Heights brownstone just off Flatbush Avenue, and the food is largely in a domestic mode. Nasim Alikhani , who owns the restaurant with her husband, Theodore Petroulas, is responsible for the menu. Ms. Alikhani has never worked in a restaurant before. Rather than following the plating fashions of more trend-conscious chefs, she models the cooking after the things she might make when company comes over. Platoons of kebabs dominate the menus of other Iranian restaurants around town, but home kitchens are rarely built with vast indoor grills; Sofreh's cooking, entrusted to two chefs named Ali Saboor and Soroosh Golbabae, revolves around the oven and stovetop. A loaf of barbari, its crust baked to a Roman-pizza crackle in a revolving oven, is served with many of the appetizers, and it is always gone so soon that I end up ordering one or two more. This flatbread is of course ideal for tearing and swishing into the thick yogurt dips, one mixed with golden raisins and shredded cucumber, another with minced shallots and chives. It is indispensable with the eggplant mash enriched with walnuts, strained yogurt and sweet fried onions. A loaf of barbari is also spread with herbs and feta that is more creamy than briny. Earlier in the summer Sofreh offered an appetizer of dry, underseasoned beef meatballs with sour cherries. One of the only things on the menu that was hard to warm up to, it has been replaced lately by beef kofte, made light and tender by rice and stewed split peas. The kofte sit in a gentle saffron-tomato sauce that is another natural partner for Sofreh's bread. Ms. Alikhani, 59, grew up in the sprawling desert city Isfahan, and moved to the United States in her early 20s. For years she cooked Iranian dishes from memory, and it would be decades before she traveled back to Iran to learn more about its food in preparation for opening Sofreh. Her version of ash, the herb and whole-wheat noodle stew, stands out on the menu because it stays so close to tradition. Other dishes show the acclimatizing effect of New York. It's an article of faith for chefs in the city that any dish can be improved by putting a poached egg on it. I'm not so sure that Sofreh's smoked eggplant halves with their sweet, garlic-drenched tomato sauce need one, though. Is the watermelon feta salad familiar from restaurants that have nothing to do with Iran? Maybe just a bit, but Sofreh's version stands out for its intriguing sauce of nigella seeds crushed into mint oil. And while the Shiraz salad isn't chopped to fine bits in the traditional way that makes it something like Iran's answer to pico de gallo, its sour purple flecks of sumac distinguish it from the herd of tomato-cucumber assemblages. The menu is fairly concise, and occasionally I wished that it plunged into tradition with less restraint. For a dish called \"catch of the day,\" Ms. Alikhani has adapted ghalieh mahi, a tamarind-soured stew of fish and fresh herbs from southern Iran. In her version, a pan-seared hunk of whitefish -- halibut and cod have taken turns in the role -- is set over a long-cooked sauce. Dark with caramelized onions and fried cilantro and fresh fenugreek leaves, the sauce is hypnotically complex. Still, a sauce sitting under fish is not the same as one that has been cooked with fish so the flavors can get acquainted. A simple flattened and griddled half chicken, though, is a wonderful foil for a topping of tart barberries and a captivating sauce of dried Persian plums and saffron. And there's lovely simplicity to the braised lamb shank with roasted garlic and sizzled onions; the turmeric- and cinnamon-scented sauce might have been put on this earth to be spooned over fluffy rice. There is no shame in ending the meal with a goblet of thick yogurt parfait with jam and pistachios. But there are harder-to-find sweets, too, like the rose-water custard, grainy with rice flour, transformed into a sort of tart by a crust of chopped nuts. Saffron and rose-water ice cream is luxuriously rich despite a few stray ice crystals. And the faloodeh, one of the world's oldest frozen desserts, will put to rest all doubts about the wisdom of embedding sorbet in a nest of vermicelli, if there were any doubts to begin with.

{"id": 70, "data": " There was a time when there was only one Nobu, on Hudson Street in TriBeCa. When it opened in 1994, it was the first restaurant outside Los Angeles to offer Nobuyuki Matsuhisa 's startling new liaison of sushi and other Japanese food with Peruvian flavors. The herds of imitators were still to come. If you wanted to try raw yellowtail in ponzu under a green jalapeño wheel, or fried rock shrimp shimmering with spiced mayonnaise, or broiled black cod in miso so sweet it might have been maple syrup -- and for a few years it seemed as if that was all anybody wanted -- you either went to Matsuhisa in Beverly Hills, Calif., or you went to Hudson Street. Now you can eat Nobu ceviche in Dubai, Budapest and Cape Town. If you want Nobu sashimi salad for dinner followed by a night in a Nobu hotel, you can do that in Marbella, Manila, Miami or Palo Alto. When the United States Space Force establishes its first lunar base, the generals and majors will no doubt find a Nobu there, with tuna tataki on the menu and a line three-deep at the bar. This is because after the success of Nobu in TriBeCa, Mr. Matsuhisa and his partners made a strategic decision. The food would stay roughly the same -- more on this in a minute -- but the surroundings would grow bigger, boozier, louder, more theatrical. If Nobu did not exactly invent the Asian Party Temple restaurant genre, it certainly drew the blueprints. At these new Nobus, Mr. Matsuhisa's food was still a major event, but not necessarily the main event. And the question was not just whether you felt like eating at Nobu but whether you felt like being at Nobu. The Malibu location in particular has a reputation for intense good-time vibes that can drive away customers who merely want to eat. All this was encapsulated for me in two brief scenes from my recent meals at Nobu Downtown and Nobu Fifty Seven . The first episode took place while I was sitting at the sushi bar of Nobu Downtown. This location, inside the old AT&T tower on Lower Broadway, is theoretically the successor to the first Nobu; it opened last year a few weeks after the original closed. The sushi bar was the heart of the TriBeCa restaurant. The chefs behind it prepared or touched at least half the food, and seats there were so coveted that during the 1990s, when even celebrities complained about how hard it was to get in, a mostly sushi restaurant called Next Door Nobu was opened simply to contain the overflow. (It closed last year, too, and won't be replaced.) At Nobu Downtown, the upstairs sushi counter is on the far side of the cocktail bar that the design firm Rockwell Group slipped in among the enormous fluted limestone columns that fill the building's ground floor like a petrified forest. I had just eaten a piece of Japanese scallop sushi with a dangerous streak of wasabi when an animated group of four new arrivals appeared next to me. The sushi chefs eyed them warily, because they appeared to intend to cluster around a single stool, the way people do at a bar. Soon it became apparent that they thought they were at the bar. But the people they mistook for bartenders were all busy slicing raw fish, so eventually the group moved on to look for somebody to make them a drink. Moments like this didn't tend to happen at the original Nobu, but they do bring Nobu Downtown in line with Nobu Fifty Seven. In business on 57th Street since 2005, Nobu Fifty Seven is another two-story proposition. Between 5 and 7 p.m. its ground-floor lounge acts on young Midtown professionals like the fishing nets evoked by Rockwell Group's design. At the time the second scene took place, the bartenders looked as if they were struggling not to get caught. My cocktail, a Negroni-esque thing with sake in it that was ferried to my upstairs table from the downstairs bar, was neither shaken nor stirred; it was, in fact, almost hot. While I was waiting for the cocktail to be cooled by its single ice cube, a server was struggling to open a bottle of Champagne for a table of at least 10 men next to me. When the cork came out, he managed to spray the room in a manner usually seen in the Super Bowl champions' locker room. Everybody nearby got a little wet, including me and my guests, but nobody seemed to notice. Servers at both addresses have the brisk, well-drilled, impersonal and slightly numbed quality that comes of waiting on hundreds of people a day. At Nobu Fifty-Seven, one told me, \"Our menu is kaiseki style, so it's like tapas. Everything is meant for sharing.\" I must have looked confused because he added, \"Some dishes are going to be bigger than others.\" Nobu Fifty-Seven was given three stars in its last New York Times review , by Frank Bruni in 2005. That's what Ruth Reichl gave the original in 1995. After three recent visits to each location, I decided that, apart from minor menu variations, any qualitative difference in the food between the two branches is too subtle for me to make out. The chefs uptown are Taku Sato and Matt Hoyle. Downtown was led by Ricky Estrellado and Ryo Hasegawa until June, when Mr. Estrellado died suddenly. His successor has not been named. Both kitchens are models of superior ingredient shopping and consistent performance. When those classic Nobu dishes appear, they will be exactly like the last time you had them. In the case of the mayo-bathed fried shrimp, that may not be an entirely good thing. And I still think the flavor of the caviar that crowns tuna, or salmon, or yellowtail tartare gets elbowed out of the way by the wasabi-soy sauce. But the tiradito, slices of yellowtail squirted with lemon and yuzu juice, then dotted with puréed rocoto pepper, is always wonderfully bracing. The candylike black cod is as hard to deny as ever, even if the extra sweetening Mr. Matsuhisa gives this traditional Japanese dish strikes me as somewhat shameless. The sashimi salad and the lobster shiitake salads are both better than any salad from a global chain has the right to be. I don't know who orders the dishes marked Nobu Now, but I tried a few. Umami Chilean sea bass: not worth it, even for the slightly exotic return of a fish that hasn't been seen much since the '90s. Kumamoto shooters: a thrilling series of flavors that will recall the way you felt the first time you ate at Nobu. Michele Goldsmith's desserts, served both uptown and downtown, are modern and playful and don't try too hard to follow the theme, whatever that is. Over the years, the Hudson Street Nobu became something unusual, a restaurant that could serve tourists and families from around the corner with equal aplomb. But a meal at Nobu is still among the best, although not the cheapest, ways to introduce children to raw fish. And sitting at the sushi bar can still provide the intimacy that the rest of the place lacks. The chefs behind the counter may not draw the kinmedai cultists who flock to Sushi Zo or Sushi Ginza Onodera , but they know what they're doing, and they light up when they get a customer who can tell.

{"id": 92, "data": " Real estate developers used to wait for restaurants to illuminate the sidewalks before they'd start investing in a neighborhood. They don't wait anymore. If there's no Florent or Schiller's Liquor Bar around, they simply have one built, synchronizing the opening with the move-in date of the first new apartments. This is the tactic being used by Hudson Yards , the glass-and-steel mountain range rising above a one-time dining wasteland where soon not just restaurants but an entire \"restaurant collection\" will flourish, including new projects from David Chang, José Andrés and others, all \"curated\" by Thomas Keller . And it is the approach taken by Henry Hall, a tower of rental apartments just north of Hudson Yards on West 38th Street. To give the place the atmosphere and the hangout opportunities of a boutique hotel, Henry Hall has turned its first two floors over to a wine shop, a cocktail lounge, a private dining room and a restaurant. I am telling you all this because that restaurant, Legacy Records, is unusually good and very popular and if somebody invites you there, you should know why you are having dinner down the street from the Javits Convention Center and a stable where Central Park carriage horses go to be hosed down at night. And you will also know why Legacy Records seems eager to suggest that it has local roots -- so eager that it has essentially ginned up a history for itself that brings together sloppy research with a superficial tribute to black culture. It's not a combination that will appeal to everybody. Like the bar and the wine store, Legacy Records is run by Delicious Hospitality, the company behind Pasquale Jones and Charlie Bird . The menu, as it is in those two restaurants, is essentially Italian, but less rustic and more expensive. This is the first time the group has routinely charged more than $30, and as much as $46, for main courses. (The prices, like the ones at Pasquale Jones but not Charlie Bird, include service.) I don't know for sure whether Ryan Hardy, the chef and one of the three partners, has upgraded to better purveyors, but I do know I was taken aback, often, by the quality of the raw ingredients at Legacy Records. There was the raw sea scallop, so intensely fresh that its slices clung together stickily; Mr. Hardy had dressed it with dots of yogurt, tiny oval basil leaves, toasted almonds and tart little pink cells of finger lime. There was chilled Dungeness crab, a few pristine white chunks under sea urchin foam, to be spooned from a shot glass. And tiles of yellowfin tuna belly, not as fatty as bluefin but very rich all the same, under bits of salted lemon peel and a splash of colatura, the Italian fish sauce. Again with the main courses, I stopped and wondered: Where did Mr. Hardy find lamb (with snap peas and smoked cream) that tasted as if it had never eaten anything but fresh herbs? How did he find a rib-eye that's so tender and deeply flavorful without being flabby? Mr. Hardy has been quick to make the most of what the market says is the first month of spring and the calendar says is the last. Creamy new-crop potatoes deserve a little appreciation before they're sent off to root cellars, and Mr. Hardy built a fine appetizer around them with leggy broccoli sprouts and melting chunks of fresh mozzarella spiked with anchovy. Charred snap peas made a tangy salad together with ramps in a peppery buttermilk dressing. But sweet English peas were swallowed up by a too-sharp risotto; seasoned with prosciutto, the rice took on more of the ham's saltiness than its sweetness. Legacy Records doesn't say anything particularly original, but it has a finesse that's new for this restaurant group. There's an exceptional plate of grilled pigeon, neatly carved and served with swooshes of nettle purée. It is at least as impressive as the dish that's becoming a breakout star for the restaurant: a duck breast, its skin rubbed with pepper, chiles, honey and fennel and then roasted until it has a deep, crusty bark that a Texas pitmaster would be proud of. Ordering wine is an event in itself. Robert Bohr and Grant Reynolds, who are Mr. Hardy's partners and the resident wine soothsayers, have seen to it that cultists can rub elbows with the Agraparts, Raveneaus and Gajas, while the rest of us will still find a few bottles under $100 from some of the most expensive arable land on earth. Oddly enough, the wine list makes less of an impression than the ones at Charlie Bird and Pasquale Jones, simply because you'd expect an ambitious cellar in a restaurant this expensive. Then again you might also expect a smart, artful dessert menu; if so, you're out of luck. There is ice cream with strawberries, a dark chocolate meringue and a selection of gelati, served in a cone; all perfectly pleasant, but there's more wit and creativity in the excellent cocktail roster administered by Jeff Bell. I'm sure there are people who are reluctant to go to Legacy Records because of how relentlessly noisy this team's downtown restaurants are. But they seem to have sent the acoustics to obedience school, because all the sound waves do what they're told: Conversations stay at their own tables, while the music stays in the background. Ken Fulk, who designed all the public spaces in the building, covered some wall panels with grasscloth, put glove-soft leather on the tabletops, and found other ways to dampen the noise. Legacy Records certainly doesn't look like any other restaurant; Mr. Fulk went to extremes, using some motifs from the 1980s -- emphatic grids, metallic finishes, whites and country-club greens -- that not everybody is ready to see resurrected. Hanging in the bar is a 2006 photograph by the artist Mickalene Thomas of a black woman with an Afro and a giraffe-print shirt posed in front of albums by Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross. It has a counterpart on the second floor, a mural behind the bar based on the Ernie Barnes painting seen on Marvin Gaye's album \"I Want You.\" Along with the constant hip-hop and vintage soul soundtrack and the restaurant's name -- taken, we are told, from a recording studio that once stood on this site -- Legacy Records tries to present itself as a homage to another era in music. If Legacy Recording Studios had been used by Mr. Gaye, Mr. Wonder and Ms. Ross, that homage might make sense. But it didn't. Lasting just from 2001 to 2009, the studio was built for and mostly used by orchestras, Broadway cast recordings and commercials. Legacy Records has taken this shred of history and turned it into a fantasy of black American music. Exhibited in a museum or gallery, Ms. Thomas's photo might be taken as a comment on the different postures and personas available to black women. Hanging it next to the counter where pastries and coffee are sold by day strips out some of its meaning; it looks like an attempt to buy a personality for a restaurant that doesn't have one of its own. If anyone gets to decide who can use black culture for what purposes, it surely isn't me. But Legacy Records uses it in a gratuitous and offhanded way that made me uncomfortable. Stevie Wonder will always be cool, but a restaurant dreamed up by real estate developers doesn't automatically become cool by putting him on the wall.

{"id": 93, "data": " At some fateful moment in the 13th century when Kublai Khan was preparing to lead the Mongol hordes into battle, hunger struck. With no time to make a roast or stew, the legend goes, the Great Khan's chef carved very thin slices of raw mutton and plunged them into hot broth for a few seconds. Besides serving as an inspiration to those of us who believe there is always time to eat, the chef's impromptu recipe is said to have given China its ancient and delicious hot pot tradition. Hot pots did not jump to Japan until shortly after World War II, when kelp joined the broth and the name was changed, onomatopoetically, to shabu shabu. But like hot pots in China, shabu shabu is a do-it-yourself bash where everybody around the table gets to dunk and swish the ingredients they like best. Chefs are not required. Then on Delancey Street last fall, a new shabu shabu restaurant appeared where a chef standing behind a counter does all the cooking for no more than eight people at a time. Her name is Mako Okano. Out of a style of dining that has always been a big, informal free-for-all, she has built a quiet, refined, intimate spot called Shabushabu Macoron . Usually backed up by two other women, but occasionally working solo, Ms. Okano moves deliberately. She will gesture to the place mat, where the night's eight or 10 courses are written out in Japanese, right to left, and then to another slip of paper with the same courses printed in English, again right to left. The price is $128. There are no choices to be made. Ms. Okano has modeled her restaurant on omakase sushi bars, where the chef calls the tune. When I first arrived, I admit that I couldn't see the point of having a chef do the cooking when I was perfectly able to do my own dunking and swishing. Ms. Okano quickly poured two or three mouthfuls of yeasty, warm unfiltered sake into a little saucer. This arrived with a snack -- cured salmon and salmon roe seasoned with fermented rice -- that artfully underscored the sake's flavor. Then she turned and quietly addressed a sauté pan over the stove. When she turned around again she had cooked an omelet and flicked it into a roll in the Japanese style. Served in a bowl of hot, clear dashi, the egg was as tender and delicate as its garnish, a tiny piece of mitsuba stem tied into a knot. Next she poached two pieces of abalone for a few seconds each in abalone broth. One she dabbed with a small, intense blip of the Japanese spice paste yuzu kosho. Over the other she spooned a sauce made from the abalone's liver. I ate them both, and was flooded first with pleasure then with embarrassment that I'd thought simmered food wasn't worth a chef's time. By the time I'd eaten a small tongue of sea urchin combined with silky rags of yuba still dripping with soy milk, I was on board for anything Ms. Okano wanted to cook. For some time the bubbles in an iron pot of dashi set over a countertop burner had been getting bigger and faster. Thin strips of Wagyu beef, streaked with so much fat they looked like stained glass, were stretched out on black slate with pinkish bands of pork belly. Raw vegetables -- cabbage, lettuce, enoki and shiitake mushrooms, half a brussels sprout and a cherry tomato on a wooden spear -- waited on a nearby plate. Before I knew it she had cooked the first piece of beef -- was it the A5 from Miyazaki or the A4 from Kagoshima? The flesh had twisted itself around, and now dusk-gray outer curls hid inner curves of faded pink. The flavors moved in rapid waves: first a few clinging, savory drops of dashi, then some already-melted beef fat, followed by the flavor of the lean meat itself, sweet and refined. Finally came a second helping of fat, freshly melted now. When Ms. Okano fished out a piece of beef, she would suggest seasoning it with one or more of an almost comically large assortment of condiments and purées that she makes herself. She seemed to favor her ponzu, and so do I; it's more radiant with yuzu than any I've had before. I also liked the sweet soy once I learned to doctor it with a few drops of what Ms. Okano calls \"gravy sauce,\" a dark liquid that makes meat taste meatier. Many dismal meals would be saved if I carried an eyedropper of gravy sauce around with me. Swabbing the pork belly in the sticky, thick sesame paste with toasted sesame seeds produces an effect similar to, but more subtle than, the combination of peanut butter and bacon. It's even better with a smear of salted plum, or a few drops of the yuzu-olive oil sauce that seems to have jetted in from Italy. The vegetables were spotless and fresh. A meal without them would be off kilter, perhaps to a degree that would cause grumbling from the digestive system, but on their own they are not a reason to go to Shabushabu Macoron. The chicken meatballs are, though. So are the green tea soba noodles that Ms. Okano somehow manages to cook in between everything else without seeming to leave the few square feet behind the counter. Soba is not standard with shabu shabu, but it is something she has experience making from her time in the kitchen at Cocoron , a soba-ya across Delancey Street. When she began talking about her dream of opening what she hoped would be the world's first omakase shabu shabu restaurant, Cocoron's owners listened. When she came back from a dunk-and-swish tour of Japan, they signed on as her partners. At times, it seems as if Ms. Okano can't believe it all worked out. After she'd cooked me three nearly identical meals, I wondered if she'd still be as giddy a year from now. Will she be able to change the menu with the seasons to keep things interesting? Can she stash surprise ingredients below the counter for repeat customers, the way sushi chefs do? None of these questions occurred to me the first two times I ate at her restaurant. I just sat there in something like a state of wonder while she cooked for me. This is, bizarrely, a rare experience at tasting counters, where chefs are often intent on intricacies of plating. The physical setting of Shabushabu Macoron strongly suggests a shoestring budget -- the paper towel roll in the restroom hangs from what may be an actual shoestring -- but sitting there while Ms. Okano stands a few inches away and makes your dinner is one of the most luxurious experiences this city currently offers.

{"id": 94, "data": " Ever since Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone began rehabilitating chicken Parm and Neapolitan cookies around 2010, I've been waiting for other restaurants to carry the torch of Italian-American food boldly into the future. This is a major branch of American cuisine, too important for its fate to be left to the Olive Garden. For the most part, though, the torch has gone uncarried. I have been told that Palizzi Social Club, in Philadelphia, may qualify, but because Palizzi is a veritable club -- members and guests only, no new applications accepted -- I don't expect to eat there before the nation's tricentennial. Then in October, a place opened in the West Village that seemed to hit all the right tropes. It's called Don Angie . Two chefs share the kitchen -- Angela Rito and her husband, Scott Tacinelli -- and they make versions of chicken scarpariello , antipasto salad and braciole. The dining room brings back the high-glitz Italian restaurant décor of the 1970s and '80s, the period when Formica and oil paintings of the Bay of Naples went out and mirrors with gold pinstripes came in. The floor is a black-and-white checkerboard. The bar is made of polished marble the color of beef carpaccio. There is a house Chianti, and it comes in a straw-covered bottle. There is hope for a red-sauce renaissance, after all. Unfortunately, more or less from the day it opened, having dinner at Don Angie has been only marginally less difficult than eating at a private club. That has something to do with Ms. Rito's and Mr. Tacinelli's knack for cooking things that Instagram can't resist. The two spent three years running the kitchen at Quality Italian in Midtown, where they engineered, among other pieces of shutterbait, a chicken Parm that looked like a pizza. There was some wonderful stuff at Quality Italian and some less wonderful stuff, and almost all of it either arrived on trolleys or was prepared at tableside or set on fire while you watched. The restaurant group behind Quality Italian, Quality Branded , is also backing Don Angie. So as I resigned myself to eating at Don Angie close to 5:30 p.m., when I managed to get an unreserved table, I also braced for a dose of abracadabra. It arrived right on schedule with my first drink, which a server strained into a glass through a coffee filter cone lined with espresso ice. It was called Americano, Americano, and combined at least three meanings of the word: a highball, an Italian aperitif wine and a diluted shot of espresso. The Americano highball, so simple that just about any bartender can make it, doesn't need much improvement. But I have to admit that the coffee did give it some ballast. I'm also happy to report that this was one of the last bits of stagecraft I saw at Don Angie. Ms. Rito and Mr. Tacinelli have a few tricks up their sleeves, but they save them for the kitchen. The result is food that is creative in a more interesting and more consistently successful way than it was at Quality Italian. And it arrives at the table without the aid of trolleys. When you get a Caesar salad, the server doesn't whip together the dressing on the spot. It's been done in the kitchen, where the chefs replaced romaine with tender chrysanthemum leaves that taste like some newly discovered herb. (The feathery leaves firmly grip the dressing and the fluffy rasped cheese, too.) I can't remember seeing chrysanthemum in an Italian restaurant before, and it shows the chefs' skill for cross-pollinating with other cuisines, especially Asian ones. While the Torrisi-Carbone axis is generally faithful to Italian-American standards, using more expensive ingredients and more modern techniques but leaving the basic ideas intact, the Rito-Tacinelli approach is more radical. They trample on tradition when they feel like it. Prosciutto and honeydew melon are tossed with candied hazelnuts and mint leaves in a lime, tamarind and fish-sauce dressing. This very good salad, which obviously glances toward Southeast Asia, is a smart way to handle an antipasto standby that is usually pointless except when melons are in season. Their garlic bread turns out to be a very thin disc with garlic chives and melted cheese inside and sesame seeds on top. Lightweight, salty and irresistible, it's modeled on Ligurian focaccia di recco, but it may also bring to mind Turkish gozleme, Azeri kutab or even a Chinese scallion pancake. There's China again, in the pepperoni fried rice served under barbecued squid. Ignore the squid unless you like it leathery, and just focus on the rice, stirring it with labneh when the heat starts to rise. The dish everybody has seen on Instagram is the pasta called caramelle. In Italian it means caramel, as in candy, but the shape will remind most Americans of an elongated Tootsie Roll, with twists at either end of a drum that's filled with buffalo ricotta. Cameras come out because the dough is striped, with black sesame-flour bands alternating with ordinary egg pasta. The sesame barely registers; the fun of the dish is the sauce, a peppered, pickled cantaloupe that tastes like it's still percolating. But the dish that could be Don Angie's lasting contribution to the pasta sciences is the garganelli with meatball ragù. The central problem of red-sauce restaurants is this: Pasta and meatballs are always served together, but they remain stubbornly separate. Ms. Rito and Mr. Tacinelli have found a way out of this conundrum by crushing meatballs into a tomato-guanciale ragù. It's not quite as simple as I've made it sound, but you don't know that when you're eating it; you just think you're magically eating meatballs and pasta at the same time. They've also tried to salvage chicken scarpariello, a dish that is almost always overcooked. Their solution is to make a kind of pie with chicken meat pressed down into a kind of crust made of sausage. The flavors are accurate, and for once it's not dry, but it's not as engaging as other main courses, like the veal cutlet with speck and pickled mustard seeds, or the grilled fillet of orata next to herbed fregola, with buttermilk as the sauce. Reworking tiramisù almost never improves it, but as a change of pace I did like how the one at Don Angie shifted the emphasis from espresso to bittersweet cocoa. There's a delicious, if more conventional, plate of tender, light zeppole with tangy whipped robiola under an Andy Warhol mop of spun sugar that people go wild for. I was charmed by a smaller, quieter dessert: a mochi cake stuffed with fior di latte ice cream, with sea salt and a fragrant scribble of olive oil. It's like eating a mozzarella ball that wanted to become a dessert when it grew up, and did. Follow NYT Food on Facebook , Instagram , Twitter and Pinterest .

{"id": 95, "data": " Anthony Bourdain entered the literary stage with an inside tip, delivered in the gruff whisper of a racetrack tout: Don't order fish on Mondays. It was the part that everybody remembered from his first published work, a long essay about the unglamorous and sometimes unsavory work of cooks and dishwashers that ran in The New Yorker in 1999 and that made it almost impossible for waiters to sell seafood between Sunday and Tuesday for at least a decade. And the advice gave Mr. Bourdain, a journeyman cook and chef nobody had heard of, a new career. Before he was found dead on Friday , in what the authorities were treating as a suicide, he was the witty, connected guide who, in memoirs, cookbooks and television shows, would tell you things that others wouldn't. In the glossy, cheerful, relentlessly promotional realms of food and travel writing, that left him a fair number of truths he could claim as his own, and he took full advantage of the situation. A close reader of Orwell , he modeled that first essay and the book that grew out of it, \"Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly,\" on Orwell's \"Down and Out in Paris and London.\" While other restaurant writers had helped build the cult of the creative, artistic chef, Mr. Bourdain made folk heroes out of the dishwasher and the line cook -- a job description previously known only to restaurant employees. He described their lives and their day-to-day work in concrete, indelible detail. When kitchens were being wrapped in a shimmering gauze of glamour, Mr. Bourdain got busy unwrapping them, revealing the injuries and addictions, low wages and high tempers that took a toll on workers. Among other things, he was one of the first writers to tell the dining public that many high-profile New York restaurants would cease to function without the work and talents of Mexican employees. It was almost a casual aside, yet it suddenly opened new subjects to the purview of food writing: immigration policy, labor conditions, racism. He identified with the grunts, portraying himself as a slinger of cheap steaks and French fries. The grunts, in turn, identified with him, not because of his contributions as a chef -- who can name an Anthony Bourdain dish? -- but because he told the world what the work was really like. And once he left kitchens behind for a career in travel television, he didn't lead his camera crews on a tour of the world's most luxurious resorts. He went to Detroit and the Bronx, Libya and Beirut. \"Good food, good eating, is all about blood and organs, cruelty and decay,\" he wrote in the opening sentence of that New Yorker piece, and it set the tone for all the work that followed. [Read more of our coverage on Anthony Bourdain's death: Anthony Bourdain, Chef, Travel Host and Author, is Dead at 61 ‘ Tony Was a Symphony': Fans and Friends Remember Anthony Bourdain ] Mr. Bourdain was a blood-and-organs kind of guy, and he became identified with his unflinching, at times ostentatious, descriptions of life, death, sex and digestion. Footage of fly-speckled goats' heads in open-air markets was to his travel shows what harbor sunsets were for other programs. Although he wasn't immune to hyperbole, he had an old-school chain-smoking newspaper editor's hatred of self-serving hypocrisy, particularly in other television hosts. He delighted in mocking celebrity chefs like Guy Fieri (whose Times Square restaurant he called \"the Terrordome\") and Paula Deen (\"the worst, most dangerous person to America\"). At times Mr. Bourdain's capacity as truth-teller could bleed into other, less salutary roles: the attention-seeking bully, the purveyor of well-polished shtick, the lecture-circuit fixture who, on cue, would curse like a line cook who has just chopped off the tip of his finger. \"I do a lot of speaking engagements and sometimes I feel like I'm being paid to curse in front of people who haven't heard it in a while,\" he said in a 2008 interview . In the past few months, as accusations of sexual harassment and predatory behavior have shaken the restaurant industry , Mr. Bourdain's swaggering accounts of kitchen life have come in for re-evaluation. He certainly took pleasure in telling outsiders what it was like. Was there some pride in there, too, in belonging to a band of misfits and rule-breakers? Had he helped to popularize a workplace culture in which misogyny and abuse were overlooked, tolerated and sometimes even celebrated? \"To the extent which my work in ‘Kitchen Confidential' celebrated or prolonged a culture that allowed the kind of grotesque behaviors we're hearing about all too frequently is something I think about daily, with real remorse,\" he wrote on Medium in December. Having regularly heaped disgust and outrage on Harvey Weinstein (who was accused of rape by Asia Argento, Mr. Bourdain's partner), he was also confronted with serious and deeply unsettling allegations about Mario Batali , a friend. \"In these current circumstances, one must pick a side,\" Mr. Bourdain wrote. \"I stand unhesitatingly and unwaveringly with the women.\" But if the feminist perspective was relatively new to his repertory, speaking out about sexual abuse was not. Long ago, in \"Kitchen Confidential,\" he had written about a union shop steward who had inserted his fingers into Mr. Bourdain's rectum every day, in front of the other kitchen workers. Experiences like this may be common for male cooks, but they are not commonly discussed in public. Mr. Bourdain was too unsettled, his moral compass too twitchy, to have written an account of kitchen life that was purely celebratory or purely accusatory. \"Life is complicated. It's filled with nuance. It's unsatisfying,\" he once said. \"If I believe in anything, it is doubt.\" ", "label": [[129, 133, "FOOD"], [397, 404, "FOOD"], [1773, 1781, "LOC"], [2085, 2091, "FOOD"], [2096, 2108, "FOOD"], [2461, 2468, "LOC"], [2477, 2482, "LOC"], [2484, 2489, "LOC"], [2494, 2500, "LOC"], [3399, 3411, "LOC"], [3504, 3511, "LOC"]]}
{"id": 96, "data": " Can anybody who has to think about the price of groceries still keep up with the sushi scene in New York? Just in the past year we've gotten at least five omakase-only sanctuaries -- Sushi Noz, Sushi Amane, Noda, Shoji at 69 Leonard Street and Ichimura at Uchu -- where the price of a meal, before drinks and tax, is somewhere between $250 and $300. If you were already inclined to think that the Japanese seafood game, like so many other things in Manhattan, is rigged in favor of the robber barons, these restaurants won't change your mind. But the next time you despair of ever tasting another slice of yellowtail, I'd suggest dropping into an izakaya called Wokuni for lunch or dinner. A short detour from Grand Central Terminal, it has been in business since October. So far it has not drawn much attention to itself. Given the mixed messages it sends out, this is understandable. It has soaring ceilings, a backlit bar with shelves so high the topmost bottles can be reached only by a gymnast, an undulating wall of overlapping tiles that suggests Frank Gehry in his fish-scale period, and a constant dance beat in the background that won't stop no matter how hard you cry. In other words, it looks like the Asian fusion restaurant in the lobby of a W hotel built around 1999. The menu sings another tune, though. It is full of traditional izakaya dishes like tofu agedashi and chicken karaage, rounded out by sashimi and grilled skewers. There is one twist, though: Wokuni is much, much more interested in seafood than the average izakaya. As a rule, the fish at Wokuni is exceptionally good and almost bizarrely fresh, shipped daily from the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo or from a fish farm in Nagasaki owned by the restaurant's parent company, Tokyo Ichiban Foods . (Its admirable motto: \"We are changing the dietary culture in Japan with persistence.\") Raw or cooked, the seafood at Wokuni sets it apart from other izakayas in New York, best seen as embassies of Japanese drinking culture in which the food plays the role of the ambassador's chauffeur. Sushi is rare at standard izakayas, but it is made and sold at Wokuni, at very moderate prices. While many omakase chefs age their fish to make it supple and relaxed, the sushi at Wokuni is almost insolently fresh. And if you merely get a few $5 pieces of king yellowtail sushi, or $6 pieces of sea bream sushi, and maybe a slice or two of golden-eye snapper sushi at $9 each, you won't regret it. The fish will be shiny. It will probably be chewy. The pinks and reds and ivories and whites in its flesh will be as distinct as if they'd been painted on with a nail-polish brush. But sushi is not the highest use of Wokuni's seafood. What the place lacks are the seasonal fish that can make a sushi excursion really memorable: gizzard shad, striped jack, firefly squid. When it comes to sashimi, though, this is not much of a liability, and the firmness of Wokuni's fish becomes a point in its favor. Before ordering sashimi -- or, in fact, anything else -- check the daily specials posted by the chef, Kuniaki Yoshizawa. They will almost always include several cuts of bluefin from farm-raised fish. If you come very early for lunch and manage to get the Wokuni don, a special that centers on a sashimi rice bowl and shrimp tempura, it will strike you as an incredible bargain at $24. The kitchen makes only five Wokuni-dons a day, though, so chances are you will have to content yourself with the kaisen-don, and chances are that even though it doesn't include tempura, the $18 you pay will still seem like one of the best raw-fish deals in town. Things get even more intriguing when Wokuni's seafood comes into contact with heat. Again, the specials should be your starting point. There may well be a grilled yellowtail collar. If you are in the habit of ordering this at your favorite izakaya, it is a good bet that you will be surprised by how much cleaner and sweeter it tastes here. Bluefin collars and jaws are not served often enough for anybody to get into the habit of ordering them. The grilled collar at Wokuni one recent night was one of the greatest pieces of cooked fish I've had in a long time, every bit of it worth chasing into the hollows of bone, skin and cartilage where it hid. It is not always available, but the grilled bluefin tail is, carved into a steak with the backbone sliced open so you can get at the teaspoonful of hot, clear jelly inside the spine. Mr. Yoshizawa has had the surprising idea of treating the angles and corners of the sea bream's body like chicken wings. Tucked into triangles, fried until crunchy and served with lemon, they are meant to be gnawned on between sips of sake. On the other hand, ei hire, a frequent special of cured, dried skate fin cut into squares, makes a chewy and likable sidekick to beer. Fish and chips, of course, will go with either -- the fish species changes from night to night, but it tends to be extremely fresh, crunchy and light on batter. The chips, made from the Japanese mountain yam, were never crunchy and always needed more salt. Sometimes salt came with them, and sometimes it didn't. Those yam fries are an example of what happens once you venture away from seafood at Wokuni: The ingredients aren't doing the heavy lifting anymore, and everything tastes sort of, well, ordinary. Certain things are on the right side of ordinary, like the fried tofu in dashi; the warm rolled omelet, particularly when topped with grilled freshwater eel; and the tender, ghost-white baby sardines with grated daikon. Others are on the wrong side, like the grilled scallops in butter and the monkfish liver that strongly recalled canned cat food. If I worked in the neighborhood, I would eagerly return at least once a week, sticking as closely as possible to the fish specials. I doubt I'd get bored, but I would keep my eye out for something that Wokuni could put on the menu, but so far hasn't. The parent company runs a farm that raises tiger blowfish, and about 50 restaurants in Japan that serve it. Tiger blowfish is supposed to be the most delicious kind of fugu. I think New York could make it feel appreciated on Lexington Avenue. Follow NYT Food on Facebook , Instagram , Twitter and Pinterest .

{"id": 97, "data": " I was drinking gin and pineapple juice at the bar of Gabriel Stulman's newest restaurant, Simon & the Whale , and tasting folds of tongue pastrami laid over caramelized cauliflower, a combination that paid off against long odds, when applause broke out by the entrance. I hadn't heard anyone drop a glass or sing \"Happy Birthday,\" so I asked the woman next to me, who had eaten there three or four times already, if she knew what the sudden ovation was about. \"Have you been to Gabe's other places?\" she asked. \"They like to clap for people.\" I hadn't noticed that, but there were other Stulman touches that had been transferred from Bar Sardine, Jeffrey's Grocery , Fedora and Joseph Leonard to Simon & the Whale when it opened in February. Case studies in how to maximize miniature spaces, they are intimate neighborhood hangouts with elevator-size kitchens where the food and cocktails are more interesting than ought to be achievable under such conditions. It's a genre Mr. Stulman understands as well as anybody in the city. With 76 seats in the new Freehand hotel on East 23rd Street, Simon & the Whale isn't one of those. It's an Army mess hall by the standards of Mr. Stulman's Happy Cooking Hospitality group. But the design firm Roman and Williams has styled it like a California Craftsman house and subdivided it into niches and corners with open cabinets. It doesn't display its size the way Upland , another Roman and Williams project a few blocks north, does. Even the bar is personably scaled; it's configured like a horseshoe. Extensive personal research suggests this is the best possible shape a bar can have. Like all of Mr. Stulman's places, Simon & the Whale is thick with high-volume conversations when it is full, which is pretty much all night long. Like Jeffrey's Grocery and Joseph Leonard, its name comes from a relative -- in this case, Mr. Stulman's 6-year-old son, who apparently received an impressive collection of whale-decorated baby gifts. Also familiar to Mr. Stulman's regulars will be the style of the servers. They're young, talkative, fresh-faced, enthusiastic, as if they are new to the city and haven't yet grown the protective exoskeleton of the hardened New Yorker. Our waiter one night showered us with recommendations for dishes, all of which he loved. We asked him about things he hadn't mentioned. He loved those, too. He loved the cocktails, a Happy Cooking strong suit, and was especially keen on one made with mezcal. \"Mezcal never hurt anybody,\" he said brightly. Extensive personal research suggests this is untrue. One place where Simon & the Whale allows itself to spread out beyond the normal boundaries of the Stulman kingdom is breads and desserts. The restaurant shares a baker, Zoe Kanan, and a pastry chef, Charmaine McFarlane, with the hotel's second-floor cafe, Studio, also run by Happy Cooking. Both are very good at their jobs. Ms. Kanan makes the black, thick-crusted barley-rye bread flecked with anise seeds that comes with a halfhearted taramosalata and, more excitingly, a swipe of butter creamed with seaweed powder. The long thin toast, crackling with grains and seeds that sits under cured and smoked Arctic char and smoked sour cream? Hers. The poppy-seed torpedo roll that helps lift the fish sandwich with carrot-squash slaw above the ordinary? Also hers, although to be fair the long, flat fries also do their part. And if your spirits have been sunk, as mine have, by the skimpy and uninspired dessert choices around town these days, Ms. McFarlane will be an answered prayer. No mere afterthought, her panna cotta sits on a low base of semolina cake and is decked out with pink grapefruit fillets and grapefruit marmalade spiced with red juniper berries. A cooling evergreen moat of pine ice surrounds an earthy rye pudding that's enriched with brown butter; pears fried in honey are splayed out on top, and some acerbic cranberries prevent the whole thing from cloying. I defy you to eat it without smiling. I can't say I'm as taken with crunchy knotweed-rhubarb compote as a topping for a buckwheat cake as Ms. McFarlane seems to be, but the same dessert offers one of the most astonishing ice creams around. Made with beeswax, it is as deeply aromatic as honey but not as sweet, and its texture is intensely creamy but not at all waxy. The rest of the menu is in the hands of Matt Griffin, until recently in charge of the food at Fedora and Bar Sardine. He does a neat balancing trick here, giving his adventurous side free rein at times while more often using it to add interest to the standards a hotel restaurant probably needs. A winningly over-the-top recent special was a custard-soaked pain perdu under bacon jus, pickled cabbage and speck, like some kind of demented Reuben-croque monsieur hybrid. Liver and onions turned out to be a less thrilling snack: pickled onions with deep-fried and overcooked chicken livers. Until it swam off the menu, there was an intriguing sideways version of squid ink risotto that had beech mushrooms and very tender squid confit over a black porridge of barley. Now there are spring peas, swirled with mint into a sauce for just-firm shrimp; the combination suggested pasta, but I was glad to have it without any starch getting in the way of the clear, sweet flavors. If it's pasta you want, Mr. Griffin has a glossy, chile-speckled bowl of spaghetti acqua pazza with littleneck clams and cherry tomatoes, and while the sauce is thicker and glossier than a normal acqua pazza, it is very good. What he calls a pork-collar Milanese is maybe a few millimeters too thick for the name, but I'll take it. The cut is more flavorful than a normal cutlet, and the apricot mostarda makes a pungent and welcome counterpoint. If you can't finish the whole thing, it will be taken away and replaced by a plastic action figure of a New York sports hero. This is your claim check. Mine was Don Mattingly, and I wondered if maybe the applause was for him. No, Mr. Stulman said on the phone a few days later. The woman he bought Fedora from, who has since died, was 89 when she sold it and was still showing up each night. When she entered, people clapped. \"We turned that into clapping for our friends,\" he said. Follow NYT Food on Facebook , Instagram , Twitter and Pinterest .

{"id": 98, "data": " A new restaurant from the chefs Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone and their partner Jeff Zalaznick tiptoed onto the Lower East Side in September, demurely announcing its name with two eight-foot-high neon signs in peep-show pink. DIRTY, says one. FRENCH, reads the other. Diners who have reservations for Dirty French , secured with a credit card and a gentle warning of a modest $50-a-person cancellation fee, will find a dining room inside the Ludlow hotel that is decorated with a few shoestring-budget items, like a wall-length antique carnival mirror shipped from France. A few weeks ago, the partners had the artist Rashid Johnson, a frequent guest, throw oozing slicks of wax blended with West African black soap against the mirror's glass. (Around the same time, one of Mr. Johnson's wax-and-soap works sold at auction for just under $200,000.) Across from the mirror, over the bar, is a wide French flag that Julian Schnabel splotched with ink. Down on the tiled floor, in another humble little gesture, servers lope around in squeaky-fresh limited edition Air Jordans from the '80s, some of which probably cost more than I paid for my first car. Ever since Carbone and its neighbor, ZZ's Clam Bar, came along, swagger and money have been to Torrisi-Carbone-Zalaznick establishments what blinking lights and sitars are to Sixth Street's Curry Row. If the word for flaunting cash and art-world connections like this doesn't occur to you immediately, look at the strutting crowd of ceramic roosters that Mr. Zalaznick spray-painted in screaming pink: Dirty French is one cocky restaurant. It can also be an immensely enjoyable one. That sounds contradictory, but the same self-confidence that can get on your nerves also allows this crew to mess around with French cuisine with a hugely energizing lack of respect. In unnatural crossbreeding experiments, they force bistro cooking to mate with haute cuisine. To make dinner less stuffy and formal, they bring back stuffy formalities like cut-glass wine carafes and frilly oyster plates. They smudge the pages of Escoffier with strange foreign spices. It may sound like run-of-the-mill fusion, but it is a top-to-bottom remix, and nearly every weird mongrel idea leads in the direction of more flavor or more fun. Chefs more deferential to custom may not have ditched the hallowed basket of levain or baguette à l'ancienne in favor of a flatbread inspired by the mahjeb Mr. Torrisi ate, one loaf after another, in a North African neighborhood of Paris. It's no innovation, this bread, just pita dough griddled in plenty of olive oil, buried under Provençal herbs and sent out with a snowbank of fromage blanc, but people tore it up with greedy, greasy fingers at every table, mine included. Not that the chefs hide their training. (Mr. Torrisi worked for years under Daniel Boulud and takes the lead in this kitchen.) The mille-feuille is a technical showstopper, an accordion of ribbon-thin king trumpet mushroom stems folded over and over. It looks like pastry but pulls apart like buttered noodles, and when you drag them through a pool of green curry, the scene shifts to Thailand. It's a disorienting dish, and makes your head spin in a wonderful way. The restaurant creates a parallel world where French pastry turns into Thai curry; it's as if the chefs have imagined an alternative history in which the leading kitchens of France turned left instead of right several decades ago. What if nouvelle cuisine had embraced maximalism instead of minimalism, full-frontal abandon instead of lean precision? And what if, instead of teaching Americans to make puff pastry, the country's chefs had taken cooking lessons from the rest of the French-speaking world? For one thing, they might have come up with Dirty French's glorious lamb carpaccio. Brushed with a slow-burning raz al hanout oil, sprinkled with tart sumac powder and fresh herbs, dotted with sheep's milk yogurt and preserved lemon and wheels of roasted eggplant, the slices of lamb loin are saddled with as much flavor as they can reasonably be asked to carry. Or, though this probably needed a push from the roast-chicken gold rush started at the NoMad , they might have hit upon Dirty French's $72 poultry feast. First to arrive is the sneakily rich (translation: you can't see the foie gras) white meat in mustard-herb sauce. Then the bird's hindquarters show up on a cutting board. They've been soaked in a Vietnamese marinade of soy, fish sauce and lemon grass, slowly cooked in melted chicken fat (oh yes they have), then grilled and freshened up with lime zest. The chicken comes with crepes, irrelevantly; just pick up a drumstick and get to work on that burnished skin. The chefs have an instinct for the right kind of too much, but some dishes trip into the wrong kind. A deeply aromatic and fairly traditional bouillabaisse was thick with octopus, mussels, monkfish and one small, whole, wonderful red mullet. Cuttlefish ink took the broth to the outer edge of intensity, but the medicinal taste of fresh marjoram in some spoonfuls went beyond it. And while duck heart kebabs unloaded at the table added brawn to a frisée and lardons salad, the blast of mustard in the dressing was an excessive use of force. A programmatic rollout of the formula -- Something Clearly French Under Heaps of Post-Colonial Exotica -- doesn't guarantee a sprinkling of magical pixie dust on every plate. Baked clams seemed perplexed by their thick jackets of almonds and Ethiopian spices, and so was I. A beautifully cooked trout meunière was speckled with sesame seeds and herbs, a mix that came across as an oddly neutered za'atar. Still, you can eat extraordinarily well by calling your shots and rolling with the loose, genial decadence of the place. The mood is set when a server comes over and says, in as laid-back a tone as anyone can manage while lugging an enormous 19th-century sterling silver punch bowl filled with ice, \"I wanted to let you have a look at tonight's oysters.\" Oysters: Why not? It continues when Lelañea Fulton, who assembled a wine list that is all French, and fun for all kinds of budgets, shows up dressed like one of Charlie's Angels working undercover as a sommelier. Old Châteauneuf-du-Pape? Sure. It goes on through dessert, under the assured hand of the pastry chef Heather Bertinetti, who gracefully threads her way through the French-exotic conceit with a delicately architectural coconut-passionfruit Napoleon and a very short but very good pineapple tarte Tatin, rum-raisin ice cream on top. Mr. Torrisi, Mr. Carbone and Mr. Zalaznick, cautious and retiring as ever, plan to open three original restaurants next year while continuing to build new Parm locations. The question is whether this will leave them the energy to keep refining their mongrel bistro on Ludlow Street while rolling out its breakfast and lunch menus in the coming months. Dirty French needs time to grow into its ideas, and maybe to grow out of a few of them.

Even when actual skills have been learned, they are not always obvious. Or, occasionally, they're all too obvious, and you'll catch somebody in a two-person kitchen trying to replicate dishes originally assembled by a team of 40. One interesting thing about Soogil Lim is that you can almost draw a straight line from his résumé to what's on the table at his four-month-old restaurant in the East Village, Soogil . It's easy to spot the imprint of Hooni Kim's Hanjan , where he was the executive chef for four years. Mr. Lim lived in South Korea until he was 28, so what he learned at Hanjan was not how to make the country's traditional food but how to rework it into appealing, contemporary small plates. Daniel , where he spent seven years and reached the rank of sous-chef, turns up in the French techniques Mr. Lim leans on, in the crisp presentations that carry an echo of nouvelle cuisine, in the tender braised short rib, in his fondness for foie gras and in his preference for skillfully modulating flavors rather than tossing umami grenades. It's also apparent, when you look around the dining room, that in his earlier jobs Mr. Lim spent most of his time in the kitchen; the lineage you taste in his cooking doesn't show up in the design. Soogil (SOO-gil) doesn't evoke a rambunctious Korean pub the way Hanjan does. Nor is it a carpeted and tableclothed luxury liner, like Daniel. Under the guidance of Mr. Lim's wife, Sasook Youn, the dining room has been done in what we now recognize as the all-purpose Modern Asian style -- a long banquette of blond wood against one wall, a dining counter facing another wall, and a long communal table with benches running down the middle, all of them sitting on a plank floor. A few framed prints by Suzy Taekyung Kim, a New York artist from South Korea, are suspended over the banquettes. French windows on the street can be thrown open if the weather ever cooperates. Hanging in the back is a curtain. Once in a while it parts just wide enough for Mr. Lim's face to appear while he scans the tables. Sometimes they are full. They should be full all the time, because cooking like this does not just sprout up through every crack in the sidewalk, particularly at prices that, with one or two exceptions, don't go over $20. A good window into Mr. Lim's mind is the bindaetteok appetizer. Usually these mung bean pancakes present as flat, starchy discs whose golden surfaces hint at crunchiness without actually delivering it. The ones at Soogil, fried in pork fat, have golden crusts like veal cutlets; by the time you've speared a piece with some chopped kimchi and dunked it in the traditional dipping sauce, you have all the expected flavors, plus a formidable crunch to sweeten the deal. He tinkers with the glass noodle dish called japchae in less radical fashion. The noodles themselves, shaped into a swirl with crisp shreds of vegetables and oyster mushrooms, have drunk in more soy and sesame flavor than they typically do. And Mr. Lim seems to have tripled, at least, the amount of bulgogi, a point he emphasizes by mounding the meat over the noodles so it looks like a sloppy Joe missing its top bun. The care the kitchen pays to technique is obvious in the seafood dishes; I've never had one that wasn't perfectly cooked. Monkfish, which can come off as a rubber replica of some part of the anatomy I'd rather not think about, gets wrapped in a cabbage or lettuce leaf, gently poached, and sliced into neat little wheels. Arranged over stir-fried vegetables in a sea of fermented chile sauce, it's terrific, and about as French as Korean cooking should be allowed to get. An almost silky consistency marks the mackerel that Soogil serves, nigiri-style, over wads of rice that have been seasoned with ssamjang (standing in for wasabi?) and wrapped in chard leaves. The tender Manila clams, squid and shrimp in the spicy tofu-seafood stew kept more of their natural juiciness than usual, although very firm shellfish isn't necessarily a defect in that dish. Mr. Lim herds all the soft tofu into a flan at the bottom of the bowl, rather than letting cubes of it fend for themselves in the broth -- a move that nicely heightens the contrast of tofu and chiles. The least Korean thing on the menu must be the foie gras terrine, and it's also one of the only disappointments, with its crumbly Melba toasts and washed-out green-plum jelly. A dish called nurungji gras is something else entirely: a fine seared hunk of foie gras laid over spinach and pickled mushrooms on a springy, crunchy sizzled rice cake. Slabs of pork belly are braised until the fat streaks are nearly liquid. Then they're given a meaningful sear and served alongside a stripe of a sauce I've never had before, made with fermented shrimp and green plums and fresh red peppers: spicy, salty, sour and hot. The dish that breaks the $20 barrier is the short rib. If you've had Daniel's braised short ribs , the tenderness and concentration will be familiar to you, although Soogil's version is pointedly suffused with soy rather than red wine. Underlining the French connection, this block of beef is served with carrots, potatoes and winter squash. If you eat it by yourself, you could make dinner of it. After which you should probably investigate something that goes by the name Jenga Tower. Cigarettes of fried dough, chewy like rice sticks, are stacked like a log cabin, then dusted with sugar and misugaru, the powdered grain and bean blend Koreans use as an instant breakfast drink. You pull out a stick at the time until the tower falls and brings down the scoop of honey-and-chestnut gelato balanced on top. The dining room could take a few lessons in balance from that dessert. The lights could be dimmed by a few clicks. The pop music, while not actively awful, is just odd enough to be subliminally distracting. Soogil can't seem to find the right tone for service, either. Some nights it's very familiar and on others, peculiarly fussy -- a server insisted on giving the book I'd brought a chair of its own. These are minor snags, but sorting them out is tricky, especially for first-time restaurateurs. Somewhere in the middle is a relaxed, confident style that will match the spirit of Mr. Lim's cooking.

{"id": 100, "data": " Nobody goes to Rome for the pizza. Rectangles of pizza bianca cut with scissors on the Campo de' Fiori from long planks shaped like diving boards, yes, but not for regular pizza. The standard circular pie is something travelers eat only after saltimbocca, puntarelle, spicy tripe, salt cod fritters, semolina gnocchi, porchetta, artichokes fried alla giudia and the holy pasta trinity of cacio e pepe, amatriciana and carbonara have all been checked off the list. It is food for the fifth night of vacation. And now the chef Nick Anderer has come to make this lesser stop on Rome's culinary pilgrimage route the main event of his new pizzeria, Marta . For the last five years Mr. Anderer has been a faithful custodian of the more famous Roman landmarks at Maialino , in the Gramercy Park Hotel. Marta, opened in September, is a continuation of that project, a spinoff that might have found a space next door if Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group had not decided to place it about a half-mile away in the soaring, stately lobby of the Martha Washington Hotel. Marta has Roman appetizers and entire Roman dishes repurposed as toppings for pizzas with thin crusts in the Roman style. Hold on, you say. Thin-crust pies are wall to wall around here. It is the house style of New York, a city to which people actually do travel for pizza. The style came from Naples with America's earliest pizzaioli more than a century ago, and it's been rejuvenated by modern obsessives who precisely calibrate their flour blends. What do we have to learn from Rome? Let's keep local pride in check for a minute. Marta's crusts are even thinner than what we think of as thin. Cooks in gray baseball caps press the dough flat with rolling pins on a marble counter. Slipped onto the floor of one of the hulking ovens whose black-tiled chimneys disappear into the hotel's second floor, the pies bake next to flickering stacks of firewood. The crust at first-rank Roman pizzerias like Da Remo in Testaccio is often compared to a cracker, but crackers crumble. This doesn't. It is more like the crust on a loaf of peasant bread from which all the soft crumbs have been stripped. It is durably crisp, unbendingly flat, and when you hold a slice by the edge, the rest of it juts out above the table like a cliff. Because everything I know about cliffs was learned from Wile E. Coyote, I kept waiting for the tip on each Marta slice to give way, but it never did. The pleasure of biting down on this pizza is both physical and auditory. The noise detonates along the jaw and plows right into the inner ear. Every bite sounds and feels like that. There is no soupy middle of steamed dough under wet tomatoes. It's pure crunch, all the way. What you lose with this style is the soft, springy, baguette-like curls at the edges of a Neapolitan pizza. The outer crusts of a Marta pie don't puff up; they stay hard and round, like grissini. When a pizza crust is all crackle, what's on top has to bring the flavor. This is where you see Mr. Anderer thinking like a cook. He has a great pizza-fied version of carbonara, with dots of egg and grated pecorino over crumbled, starchy potatoes and baconlike curls of guanciale. For a while, he was doing an enjoyable two-dimensional trippa alla Romana, too, spreading the rich, chile-boosted tomato sauce around the pie and arranging tender, not too chewy bands of tripe on top. In a more classical vein, the margherita, spread with flavorful tomatoes that are more pulp than sauce and punctuated with mozzarella, is superb. At $16, the buffalo mozzarella, richer and with a faint taste of the barnyard or wherever it is water buffaloes pass the time, is worth the $4 upgrade from the cow's milk variety. And if $18 seems high for a funghi pizza, note that the funghi in question are quartered chanterelles and frilly hen-of-the-woods, seasoned with thyme and just enough salt. Like almost all the toppings, the mushrooms are beautifully cooked with an insinuation of smoke; only the shoulder ham, layered between fontina and arugula, seemed to want more time in the oven, or maybe it needed to be sliced thin, so the edges could crisp and curl. Few pizzerias invest heavily in atmospherics, because pizza and the people who love it come and go in a few minutes. Still, it's a surprise just how little atmosphere the Union Square Hospitality Group has tried to conjure at Marta. The dining room, with its majestic high ceilings and blocky fluted columns, has the cold, empty monumentality of a 19th-century bank. There's some energy at the counter that faces the ovens, but very little in the rows of square tables behind it. The restaurant is open to the hotel lobby, and after a while, the comings and goings can make you feel as if you're eating in the waiting room of a train station. Lingering over a long series of courses is not advised. Marta works best when treated as a pizzeria, not a restaurant. Main courses are available, but they are not as trustworthy as the pies. Pork ribs managed to be both charred and undercooked, while a slow-roasted short rib needed a more potent infusion of flavor than gremolata could give it. The mixed grill of lamb chops, ribs and sausage was a magnificent exception, but in general the larger plates are best for those who can't eat pizza. (Marta does not make gluten-free dough.) A quick appetizer while the pizza bakes is absolutely recommended, though. Wood smoke wraps around rabbit meatballs, heavily peppered and herbed. The kitchen does fine work with hot oil, swathing vegetable fritters or seafood fritto misto in a translucently thin, light-gold batter and gently browning the bread crumbs around green supplì shaped from very good basil risotto. After pizza, there is an affogato that is exactly right, an ice cream sandwich that's harder to like than it should be (the salted chocolate cookies could be thinner or softer, the pistachios crisper) and a cup of tiramisù that's bracingly drenched in espresso. It costs just $5, which is helpful because pizza and fried food both need bubbles. Marta has a few Italian sparkling wines, but the real action is in the stockpile of nearly 40 Champagnes, from a $66 Roger Pouillon Cuvée de Réserve to some $300-plus vintage treats. Nobody goes to Rome for Champagne with pizza, either, but this isn't Rome.

{"id": 101, "data": " Some restaurants hit the ground at full tilt. This review concerns one of the others, a place that stumbled at the start, as ungainly as a day-old giraffe, and only recently found its footing. Bar Bolonat opened in the West Village in March in what seemed an auspicious location, a corner spot looking out on Abingdon Square Park through yards of windows. Two months in, Einat Admony, the chef and owner, was on the verge of closing it, she said in a phone interview. Nearly half of her 54 seats had been taken away after the city ruled that one wing of the dining room was an unpermitted sidewalk enclosure. The disputed area was quarantined behind a velvet rope, although it was hard to imagine a crowd lining up for admission to this patch of bare cement floor. This put a strain on revenues, no doubt, and made the place look pretty weird. Even with reduced capacity, Bar Bolonat was afflicted by suboptimal acoustics. When I ate there early in the summer, the screeching in the dining room could have crushed scrap metal. It nearly crushed my desire to come back, too, but I held on because Ms. Admony was up to something original in the kitchen. The daughter of an Iranian mother and Yemenite father, she was combining the flavors of contemporary multiethnic Israel, where she grew up, with the idioms of modern restaurants in New York, where she has been cooking since getting a job in Bobby Flay 's kitchen at Bolo in 1999. I'd never tasted anything exactly like her shrimp in a Yemenite curry, with a fiery shot of green zhug and a small round of fried bread called malawach to soak up the spicy, turmeric-gold coconut milk. I wanted more food like this in my life, but I wasn't in a big hurry to face the decibels again. Now, with sound-absorbing tiles up above, Bar Bolonat is a quieter restaurant, though it's not entirely library-like. (One small section of ceiling, without tiles, is angled like the soundboard of a grand piano, with a similar effect.) It's also bigger. In September, Ms. Admony finally appeased the bureaucrats and returned all her seats to active duty. While fixing up the space, she made other changes, replacing executive chefs until she found Molly Breidenthal. When I ate there this month, the cooking was more assured than it had been, the spices applied more fearlessly. The giraffe is on the move. Energetic seasoning drives Ms. Admony's cuisine at Bar Bolonat, as it does at her exemplary falafel shops, Taïm , and to a lesser extent her Mediterranean comfort food restaurant, Balaboosta . One of Bar Bolonat's most likable dishes since the unsteady early days has been the lemony grilled baby artichokes with a creamy band of pistachio yogurt under a pale-green powder of dukkah. That blend of chopped nuts and herbs can get tired if it sits around too long, but Bar Bolonat's is extremely fresh, the pistachios still sweet and bright green. A swipe of corn purée takes its seductive, toasty flavor from turmeric, cardamom and ground cloves, Ms. Admony's version of a warming spice blend called hawaij that Yemenis stir into soups. Together with the creeping heat and sweetness of a red pepper sauce, the spiced corn makes something exciting out of a grilled octopus leg. Nearly everybody orders the Jerusalem-style sesame bagel, so light and fluffy it's almost an anti-bagel. Nearly everybody is right about this. What makes this racetrack-shaped bread so hard to pass up is the spoonful of really fragrant and complex za'atar that you dunk each piece into after giving it a preliminary bath in peppery olive oil. When dishes were underwhelming, as several were one August night, timid seasoning could be to blame. \"Za'atar ravioli,\" stuffed with smoky eggplant, might have been interesting had it included some actual za'atar. On the other hand, Bar Bolonat's zabzi, an Iranian fresh-herb stew served with soft specks of fresh couscous, was fantastically vivid, and it could have become one of my favorites if the short rib in the stew had not been tough and dry. The dishes at Bar Bolonat are meant to be shared -- everybody sing along -- and come out of the kitchen as they're ready. Or so the servers say. The menu is split into small, medium and large plates. As common sense would tell you if the servers weren't telling you otherwise, the bigger ones, like the lamb neck braised with dates and chestnuts until it is pull-apart tender, are a lot easier to split than the few mouthfuls of fluke ceviche with dried pomegranate seeds and juice. The kitchen could do more to help by, say, carving the pomegranate-glazed poussin instead of sending it out whole with a serrated knife. The bit about the dishes' showing up at random times is misleading, too, but in a good way. My table was never laden down with more plates than it could hold. This ought to go without saying, but in restaurants these days nothing does. Apart from one or two unscheduled leaves of absence one night, the service was generally excellent, with a professional bearing that signals Ms. Admony's intent to have Israeli cuisine taken seriously. The white napkins, polished stemware, sheer curtains and understated modern furniture are all a determined bid for the kinds of diners who would steer clear of anything resembling a hummus hut. For dessert, Ms. Admony makes a homey, from-scratch version of Milky, a chocolate pudding brand so central to Israeli life that it became the symbol of a protest this fall against the high cost of living. The halvah crème brûlée tastes more like butterscotch than sesame, but it is worth getting for the tuft of halvah floss on top. The most entertaining and probably the best dessert is a fried envelope of baklava with ice cream sealed inside, although the ice cream should be colder and the pastry hotter if Ms. Admony wants to live up to the high standards once set by the fried ice cream at Chi-Chi's . Having fought City Hall and the screaming demons of dining-room noise, she's probably ready for a new challenge.

{"id": 102, "data": " When I am on my way to a big dinner at a restaurant in Flushing, Queens, I like to limber up by eating a dozen of Helen You's dumplings. For the last eight years, Ms. You has been the chef and proprietor of the Tianjin Dumpling House, which is not so much a house as a narrow shaft of elbow room behind a sneeze guard in the basement of a Chinese food-vendors' market on Main Street. The first dumpling of hers that I tried had a sea-bass stuffing cut with minced ginger, which gave bracing clarity to the few drops of broth sealed inside. It was so satisfying that at first I felt no need to branch out. The dumplings were irresistibly priced, though, at about $5 a dozen, and I began to experiment with new ones: lamb and chopped zucchini humming with Sichuan peppercorns, maybe, or pork with threads of fresh dill. These were wildly good, too. One day, I noticed a sign inviting me to pick my own custom dumpling fillings from a grid of 24 ingredients. This paralyzed me. Ms. You clearly had a kind of genius for creating miniature worlds of flavor. Who was I to tell her what she ought to fold into her circles of dough? It was as if somebody had handed me a box of feathers, bones, beaks and flesh and said, \"Here, build a parrot.\" What I wanted was more of Ms. You's recipes, not mine, and I got my wish earlier this year when Ms. You opened Dumpling Galaxy a few blocks from her original stall. Dumpling Galaxy sits back from the street, inside a shiny new mall it shares with a Korean-French bakery and a purveyor of sparkly false eyelashes. Ms. You designed the striking, modern interior herself, splashing bold Chinese red across walls with a basket-weave relief and building deep semiprivate booths, each with its own TV screen showing highlights of the 100 dumplings on the menu. The Dumpling Channel goes heavy on cross-section shots that reveal the central core of filling. Take a good look, because this is a sight you should never see if you want to get the most out of a meal at Dumpling Galaxy. Resist the exploratory nibble. Dip one side in black vinegar and soy, and paint it with chile oil if you like, then pocket the whole thing in your mouth. It won't gush with a waterfall of broth. It will, however, hold a few drops of liquid shed by the filling as the dumpling boiled. Those drops belong to you. Sometimes those juices taste like fresh green herbs, as when Ms. You mixes cilantro with minced lamb, or dill with excellent softly scrambled eggs. Sometimes they combine those qualities with a whiplash of heat, as in the head-twistingly good spicy beef dumpling, seasoned with scallions, fresh red and green chiles, and searing dried chile sauce. As a young girl in Tianjin, China, Ms. You was taught to cook by her mother and grandparents. Her dumplings are sturdy, knobby, domestic creatures in the Northern Chinese tradition. Sometimes you see the ghostly outline of the fillings through the shiny white skins, and sometimes you can't. But her dumplings are stuffed to order, and Ms. You fine-tunes them with the sensitivity of a natural cook who listens to her ingredients. Mixing shrimp with two varieties of celery, the more bitter and self-assured Chinese and the sweeter, shyer Western kind, and using both stalks and leaves, she builds exhilarating harmonies. It would be a miracle on Main Street if all 100 varieties at Dumpling Galaxy were equally lovable. They aren't. The one with shrimp, scallops and crab meat didn't deliver the sweet seafood luxury it promised. Steamed har gow were less juicy than those wheeled around on the best dim sum carts. My strategy is to seek out the proprietary blends, which justify prices that can be slightly higher (as much as $7.95 for six) than those at other places in Flushing, including Tianjin Dumpling House. I've eaten entire meals that delivered less flavor than a single one of Ms. You's dumplings stuffed with terrific little meatballs of duck and shiitakes. And if those hadn't cheered me up, the fried dumplings would. Ms. You pours watery cornstarch into the pan, which bubbles and browns into a shatteringly thin, dumpling-studded pancake. Cracking that crust, I felt like the happiest guy in the galaxy. That feeling wavered whenever I had to lean out of my booth with one arm extended for minutes at a time to ask for water or the check or for empty dishes to be cleared. It was like hailing a cab on Broadway at 5 p.m., but less effective. As time dragged on, I wondered why nobody had invented Uber for waiters. Looking at the tables of Chinese families, I noticed that their dumpling consumption was considerably less piggish than mine. They might share a single order, a mere six dumplings, before moving on to the dishes from Northern China, Hunan and Fujian on the rest of the menu. (One cook specializes in each region.) I came to see the wisdom of allowing fish and vegetables to supplement all the boiled flour I was ingesting. The Hunanese preserved pork stir-fried with stubby lengths of pickled long beans was superb, both fiery and tart. Triple delight vegetables (green chiles, barely tender potato and eggplant so creamy it may as well be pudding) was an unusually good version of the Dongbei standby. Whole fish with spicy bean sauce was a hit at my table, even if we did use the marvelous sauce to obscure the fish's slightly muddy flavor. You can find these dishes elsewhere, but no other kitchen offers such an embarrassment of dumpling riches, including dessert. Some sweet dumplings are pinched in dough like the savory ones, such as tart dried hawthorn berries with white wood ears, or pear with eight treasures, which I now think of as fruitcake pirogi. Others, called tang yuan, are tinted orbs of dough that are springy and chewy, like mochi. My favorite was the pumpkin-flavored globe with a sugary paste of black sesame at the core. These orange globes arrived, not on a plate like the others, but bobbing in a thick, clear, steaming soup. I could stare at ingredient lists all day and never come up with a parrot like this.

{"id": 103, "data": " The deepest form of vicarious pleasure, if not the noblest, is the kind we feel when most of our joy in someone else's achievement comes from not having done any of the work ourselves. This is the happiness of thinking about a friend's newborn baby when you get into bed for a full night's rest; the thrill of knowing that at the exact moment when your marathon-running co-worker is gasping across the finish line in Central Park, you are at home, not running; and the joy of skipping over all the articles on turkey thermometers and lump-free gravy because it's not your turn to host. Of course, as a Thanksgiving guest, you still have work to do. The altruistic way of looking at this is that you should try to make the host's job easier. This assignment began back when you accepted the invitation. That was the moment to mention your allergies and to ask what you could bring with you. Now, with just a few days to go, it's time to take stock. Are your white and sparkling wines chilled, and do you have a way to keep the bottles cold while you are getting there? If you are bringing your famous yam lollipops, will they be ready to serve, sitting in an ovenproof serving dish that can be warmed up while the turkey is resting? Don't count on free counter space. Nathalie Dupree , a cookbook writer and veteran host in Charleston, S.C., ruefully recalled the year somebody showed up with boiled potatoes and proceeded to mash them on site. \"Splattering potatoes on the wall at a time when everything else is going on is not welcome,\" she said. If you absolutely must use the host's kitchen to finish the yam lollipops, today would be a good time to confirm that it's O.K. While you're at it, ask if there's something more that you can bring. \"I certainly don't always know, and would guess many a host doesn't always know, what I need until closer to the event,\" said Eric Diesel, who writes about food and lifestyle on his Urban Home Blog , and who has helped organize some sprawling Thanksgiving feasts with up to 30 guests. By the day before the holiday, he said, the host has a much better idea of what's missing: cocktail napkins, folding chairs, ice or, Mr. Diesel suggested, piles of plastic containers for sending guests home with surplus food. The last items should be brought only if the host wants them and only if there are enough for everybody. One woman whose annual spread starts with two turkeys and eight pies and goes on from there said the most egregious guests of all time -- worse even than the relative's new girlfriend who entertained the multitudes with tales of their fantastic sexual escapades -- were the couple who brought just enough Tupperware for themselves. \"We didn't get leftovers from Alan's mom,\" they explained. (The hostess, though still seething, asked that her name be withheld.) These suggestions help with the altruistic part of your mission. But remember that your highest priority is to make sure you are invited back so that you can enjoy the delicious sensation of not hosting again next Thanksgiving. Here, a small bribe is helpful. A bottle that is too good for the mob can be pressed discreetly into the host's hands as you murmur, \"This is for tomorrow.\" The more thought you put into the bribe, the better the odds it will be effective a year from now. \"Somebody brought me a nice box of stationery,\" said John Winterman, the general manager of the Manhattan restaurant Bâtard and a polished host at home, when asked about gifts from guests he has invited more than once. \"Somebody brought me a chile pepper plant, which we used, of course.\" Flowers growing in a pot (cyclamens look dapper at this time of year) beat cut stems, which will send the host rooting through the cupboards with gravy-splattered hands to find an empty vase. Your shot at a repeat performance will be seriously jeopardized if you spill Burgundy on the heirloom table linens, so a light, alcohol-absorbent lunch may be advisable if dinner will be served late in the day. On the same principle, pregaming with a few shots before you arrive is a risky maneuver. You should be relatively sober when you present your host gift and size up the situation. \"Tune into how the event is going and plug into whoever needs something,\" Mr. Diesel said. \"If the cook is hiding in the kitchen ask, ‘Can I help, or do you need me to be out there so you can be in here?' \" If you are shooed away, he said, appoint yourself coat-check clerk, bartender or babysitter. Or talk to the stray great-aunt who's on her own. If you are given a kitchen assignment, make sure you understand it down to the last detail, unlike the guest of Ms. Dupree's who piled potatoes on the turkey platter. If the host refuses help, that should not be taken for an invitation to stand in front of the refrigerator and chat, even if that's what you'd do on another, looser day. On Thanksgiving, home kitchens are almost as busy and focused as professional ones, and you shouldn't enter the combat zone any more than you would bust through the swinging doors at Jean-Georges during dinner service shouting: \"Yo, J. G.! What up, dog?\" Most of all, encourage the cooks from the sidelines. Bite your tongue if you notice the gravy hasn't been degreased as thoroughly as you think it should be. \"It's so important not to give any kind of advice on anything,\" said Denis Gainty, a professor of Japanese history at Georgia State University. \"You need to be the cheerleader for the food that's being produced by the host. I have lots of opinions about brining, but I realize I need to steer the conversation to safer topics, like religion and homosexuality.\" At last, the turkey has been carved and you can finally enjoy the fruits of someone else's labor. The urge to cash in with soaring mountain ranges of your favorite foods will be strong. This is the time to recall that you are playing the long game. If the stuffing is gone before everyone has had a crack at it, the host can't make more but can easily look around and identify the looters. For the last two decades, Tom & Jerry's bar in downtown Manhattan has been the site of an open-house Thanksgiving to which any local restaurant employees with nowhere else to go are invited. Daniel O'Connor, an architect who is one of the hosts, said the event is notable for its spirit of cooperation and sharing. Still, not everyone plays along. \"You really see the divide when it's leftover time,\" he said. \"You have some people literally taking an entire turkey home, not a piece of a turkey. Or taking a whole pie. There's always someone like that.\" As you load your plate, remember the Wall Street saying: Pigs get fat; hogs get slaughtered. While taking modest initial portions, though, it's important to act as if you have never encountered such bounty. Leo Carey, a senior editor at The New Yorker, who was born in England and has successfully extracted an invitation from the same Boston family for 15 consecutive Thanksgivings, noticed this American technique of complimenting the host early on. \"Everyone self-consciously, self-mockingly but also weirdly proudly, talks about gluttony,\" he said. \"But the literal amounts of food consumed haven't struck me as totally unprecedented.\" Compliments should be delivered between mouthfuls and scattered far and wide. Keep in mind that there may be many cooks around the table and that each one is a prospective source for next year's invitation. Most of all, though, remember that no dish in the American canon provokes more performance anxiety than roast turkey, and the host needs to hear that all the effort was worth it. One year when I invited people to my house for Thanksgiving, I suggested, in one of those fits of neurotic self-deprecation that hosts are prone to, that the white meat was a bit dry. A guest I didn't know very well agreed. Amateur move. When you don't roast it yourself, the turkey is always perfect.

{"id": 104, "data": " Look inside the head of a bright young chef and you'll see a beehive of swarming ideas, a few of them just hatched and others that buzzed in from somewhere else. It can take time to sort out which are borrowed and which have the sting of the new. Thomas Chen, fresh from the trenches at Eleven Madison Park and Commerce , opened his first restaurant in August, called Tuome. Like so many other places in the era of Noma , it is tastefully spartan in appearance. Its two small dining rooms are furnished with small tables set with small menus printed in small type. The wood chairs and metal bar stools are unsoftened by fabric or cushions. The lights are dim -- not flattering, first-date dim but I'm-too-young-to-be-going-blind dim. In terms of glitz and glamour, Tuome falls somewhere between a yoga studio and Thoreau's cabin . I've eaten in plenty of rooms like this over the last few years. And I've seen any number of dishes resembling these: the Nike swooshes of ultra-blended vegetable purées; the green leaves the size of chipmunk ears arranged just so over a deviled egg; the row of scallops all crouched together as if hiding from some scallop-hating predator on the other side of the plate. Clearly Mr. Chen and I have been following the same Instagram feeds. That egg, though. Wait a minute. This is something different. There is half of a hard-cooked white, deep-fried in panko. Spooned into the divot is a dot of deviled yolk, sharp with pickles and Dijon mustard. On top of that is a spoonful of fried garlic and dried chiles in their spicy red oil. It's fun to feel the temperatures and textures, creamy and crackling and slippery, meet in your mouth, and to taste the strange collision of church-picnic-style eggs with a Chinese condiment. How can half an egg do three or four things at once? Later, a server points a siphon into the crook of an octopus leg. Out comes a suede-colored snowdrift. He says it's brown-butter-and-potato espuma. I say it's foam and I say the hell with it. I focus on the octopus, which crunches emphatically and has a rounded, slightly fruity flavor. With it is a chewy, chunky, lightly gingered XO sauce. Chopped caramelized pork and Chinese sausage give it the sweetness of bacon; fish sauce and dried shrimp take it broader and deeper. I can't get enough of it. The foam will not be ignored forever, though. While it is not the most original notion, it does add something, unlike most foams. What it adds is a fluffy wave of toasted butter, like the frosting on a caramel cake minus the sugar and the heft. The dish is peculiarly good; it makes an extraordinary indulgence out of the octopus. And it shows off the clear and fresh point of view Mr. Chen brings to his cooking, particularly when he interprets Chinese flavors. Before working at Eleven Madison Park and Commerce, Mr. Chen was an accountant. The idea was to stay as far from restaurants as possible, and it came from his parents. After moving from China to New York City, the Chens operated a Chinese restaurant outside of the city. They wanted something higher for Thomas (he was Tommy at home, but on his parents' lips the nickname came out \"tow me,\" which is how Tuome is pronounced), but after shepherding balance sheets by day and attending culinary school by night, he came to see cooking as the higher calling. A little more than two months in, Tuome is already starting to feel mature. The one-page wine list is seriously eclectic, but it's not too cool for a Napa Valley cabernet and an Anderson Valley chardonnay. The servers take their jobs seriously, although I'm not sure the point has to be underlined by forcing them all to wear tailored T-shirts the color of wet cement. Mr. Chen doesn't need to make his staff look like a modern dance troupe to tell people Tuome isn't your average East Village spot; his cooking does that for him. (And the East Village average is getting higher every year.) He has terrific control over salt, spices, texture and contrast, weaving them together until you ask, why hasn't anyone done this before? Adding slick duck fat to packets of Cantonese sticky rice steamed in lotus leaves seems like an obvious good idea. So does the extra crackle he puts into the Chinese sausage bits to save the rice from gummy monotony. But they aren't obvious until you taste Mr. Chen's version. A few dishes show off Mr. Chen's technical command more than his originality. The scoop of chicken liver mousse with maple syrup pooled in a hollow on top, like the gravy on mashed potatoes, is exquisitely done, but feels familiar. Another dish fell out of focus between meals, when the carrot-miso purée accompanying seared scallops lost its savory, salty depth and became merely sweet. And there's one I'd like to forget, a dully sweet squash soup impaled with frogs' legs that were both mushy and stringy. But a striking number of dishes at Tuome are memorable for the right reasons. Serving sous-vide chicken on soupy rice cooked with garlic chives and shiitakes, Mr. Chen doesn't try to sex up his homey inspiration, congee; he just makes it more layered and modern, surrounding the chicken with a dark basil jus, and lets the flavors quietly win you over. I wish he would take the same approach with pork belly instead of forcing it to do double-duty as a marketing event. Right now it's called the Pig Out (a name meant for hashtagging), and it marches to the table as a $49 feast for two, 10 bite-size squares of pork belly riding on a slate shingle with a parade of sauces and bowls of spicy-peanut noodles following behind. The crashing cymbals can't disguise how easily the dish, and its price, could be divided in half. But Mr. Chen has done something amazing to this pig. His inspiration may have been Cantonese roast pork, but these compressed, intensely flavorful squares of well-rendered belly partake of Peking duck, too. After I'd topped the reflective pane of skin with ginger-scallion sauce and a few drops of sambal from a squeeze bottle, I wanted to tuck the pork into a steamed bun or a crepe, and then chew and crunch and chew and crunch some more.

{"id": 105, "data": " Halfway through dinner at Blue Hill, my server presented me with two squashes. One was the common football-size butternut that weighs down shopping bags at this time of year. The other had the same shape but was about as big as a sparrow. I held it in my palm. It felt good in there. Without thinking about what I was doing, I began petting it. The couple at the next table asked if they could see my tiny squash, and I let them stroke its smooth, cool skin. Before things got too weird, our server took my pet squash back to the kitchen. When it came back, it had been roasted and cut in half. Specks of white pepper and strands of grated chestnut lay against its dark orange insides. It was sweeter than a normal butternut, but what I mostly noticed was that it tasted squashier, as if all the flavor had been compressed. Selective breeding was responsible, our server explained. Dan Barber, Blue Hill's executive chef and a co-owner with his brother, David, had asked a Cornell agriculture professor to design a squash for him, making it as small and tasty as possible. The result is the 898 squash , served exclusively at Mr. Barber's two restaurants, Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., and this one, just off Washington Square Park. Mr. Barber opened the one in Manhattan first, in 2000, with the idea of using local seasonal produce, including some from his family's farm in the Berkshires. This put him in the company of, oh, several hundred other chefs. A few years later, though, he was chosen to lead an ambitious project at Stone Barns that combined a farm and a restaurant with research and education programs. It turned out that he was born for the job. Patient, intense, curious, enthusiastic, articulate, Mr. Barber has become a dirt poet and kitchen philosopher whose time outside with the pigs and the beans has had a deep, lasting effect on the way he cooks. Today no other chef has the information he keeps in his head (how to make pure carbon out of a cow's femur) or the vegetables he puts in his ovens (sparrow-size squash). To get the Full Barber, you have to go to Stone Barns for a $198 menu-free, open-ended meal that may include, if you're lucky, a tour of the manure shed where hot compost is put to work as cooking fuel. The original Blue Hill sits in the English basement of a townhouse in Greenwich Village, a historically tolerant neighborhood whose tolerance does not extend to manure sheds. The city doesn't afford the time or space for the leisurely unfurling of Mr. Barber's complete vision of how our appetites should fit into the land and the climate. The low-ceilinged space is too much like a saloon, the tables too close together, the restaurant's many ardent admirers too accustomed to treating it as a place to catch up over an excellent weeknight dinner. If Blue Hill had as many cooks and servers as its more favored sister upstate, they would probably iron out wrinkles like the long, stranded layovers between courses; the wineglasses that sat empty and were finally cleared with no offer of fresh ones; and the $23 glass of Rully poured ice-cold, so it was clenched and astringent. It also seems far out of character that this intensely local restaurant sells just two New York wines on its Francophilic (and not very value-minded) list, and that its only cider comes from California when there is a cider revival going on in Mr. Barber's own, apple-rich state. But while it may give you only a Half Barber, Blue Hill is still an exceptional restaurant. Mr. Barber's long search for flavor out of town pays off downtown, where you find yourself thinking, again and again, that each new ingredient may well be the best example of its kind you've ever tasted. For this reason and others, Blue Hill is one of the few New York restaurants that seem to get better and more original as time goes by. This was true the last time it was reviewed in The New York Times, in 2006, when Frank Bruni brought it from two stars to three, and it is true now. Dinner at Blue Hill can go in one of two directions: a four-course, $85 menu that you choose, or a longer, free-form \"farmer's feast\" chosen by Mr. Barber or his chef de cuisine, Shingoon Hong, for $98 or $125, depending on how hungry the farmer is. Either way, the night will include a couple of surprise cameos by fruits and vegetables that drop in like the kooky neighbors in a sitcom. A meal in September started with wispy young fennel stalks that had a clean and pure licorice sweetness and ended with firm, green-skinned, yellow-fleshed plums on ice. Both made me happy I had come to Blue Hill then, not a week sooner or later, which is the effect that certain fruits and vegetables can have when they're picked at the right time. In a more recent meal, the kitchen sent out a raw hakurei turnip as big as an apple. In fact, it had been pushed through an apple slicer. I picked up a white wedge, swiped it through a pool of tarragon vinaigrette and braced for the harsh turnip aftertaste that never came. I won't tell you that I ate the whole thing, or that it was as sweet and juicy as an apple, but it came much closer than I would have thought possible. When it comes to actual cooking, Mr. Barber's approach is to intensify ingredients that are pretty intense already. Looking at the saturated orange color of fat slabs of roasted carrot \"cutlet,\" I could tell it was going to taste richer and rounder than any carrot I had met before. The approach works on things that once had a pulse, too. Grass-fed, dry-aged veal, carved into a sampler of cuts, some fattier, some leaner, was ruddier and more bloody-tasting than most veal, but it still had a focused, refined taste that set it apart from beef. The caramelized outside edge of a slowly roasted neck from a Blue Hill Farm goat had a profoundly satisfying chew; the meat hiding under it was astoundingly tender and juicy. It had some of the primal pleasures of barbecue, and I wanted to tear into it with my hands. In the early days of Blue Hill, I respected the cooking but didn't want to wallow around in it the way I do now. The whole complicated web that Mr. Barber oversees has many purposes, spinning off in all directions, but if you just sit down to dinner, you can believe that the point of the entire operation is to provide you with one delicious taste after another. And maybe it is.

{"id": 106, "data": " If you remember David Waltuck's cooking at Chanterelle, eating at his new restaurant, Élan, can be a little unnerving. Chanterelle, a downtown pioneer when it opened in 1979, was an institution by the time it went out of business , just a few months short of its 30th anniversary. Like all institutions, it had become padded by ritual, tradition and reputation. You went there to eat, of course, but you also went because it was supposed to be one of the city's greatest restaurants, holding four stars from The New York Times at various points . You went to find out whether the artist who had drawn the cover of the handwritten menu would be at the next table. You went because Karen Waltuck, the chef's wife and partner, and her ballet corps of elegant, mildly bohemian servers knew how to make you comfortable even if grand restaurants like Chanterelle weren't usually your thing. At Élan , which Mr. Waltuck opened with George Stinson north of Union Square this summer, the institutional padding is gone. Restaurants like Chanterelle have a wine directory the size and mass of the Oxford English Dictionary, but Élan's fits on four very tempting pages of reds and whites up to $105, with a short appendix of more-expensive bottles under the heading \"treat yourself.\" The one reminder of Mr. Waltuck's downtown-bohemian past is the quintuple self-portrait by Chuck Close that hangs opposite the wide concrete bar, a black curtain from which disembodied Close heads stare grimly out of the darkness, like a trick in a haunted house. The monochromatic dining room is attractive enough, but a little too bright by night when the pinpoint lights beam straight down. Look along the banquette, and you see a row of shiny, illuminated noses. A heavy framed mirror seems to be suspended by a thick white rope, which somehow makes it look less secure. It's a reasonably quiet room, friendly to conversation, but not one whose innate beauty will draw you back. There is, in other words, little in the environment for the food to hide behind. Standing out in the open, Mr. Waltuck's cooking is revealed to be as variable, as prone to peaks and valleys, as anyone else's. This may rattle the Chanterelle sentimentalists, but it seems to have liberated Mr. Waltuck. A chef with stars to defend and a reputation to maintain does what politicians do in close elections: sticks to the script, tries to stay predictable. At Élan, Mr. Waltuck gets to play. He doesn't have to ask himself whether a pair of pot stickers filled with mashed potatoes can be a four-star dish. That's a boring question. The point is that finding potatoes inside crimped pan-fried dumplings surrounded by a haze of shaved summer truffles is a funny, delicious surprise. He must be playing, too, when he stirs sea urchin into a deep bowl of guacamole. Avocado doesn't need extra creaminess, but it takes extremely well to briny seafood, as you find out when you spread some on a grease-free taro chip. Occasionally, what seems like a fun idea will land like a bag of wet laundry. Foie gras lollipops sound decadent, but the cold wad of dull liver rolled in uncrunchy pistachios is a grim treat. General Tso's sweetbreads are another game gone wrong. If the sweetbreads were ever crisp, they aren't by the time they've been stir-fried with bok choy and sloshed around in an orange-chile sauce that seemed to need more spice and citrus tang. (This dish may fall into one of my blind spots, because the Chinese takeout classic doesn't ring my doorbell, either.) Servers at Élan will announce conspiratorially that there is an \"off the menu special,\" a burger of duck and foie gras, even though it's always available. The whispered hard sell is a tired ploy to begin with, and this slightly mushy pile of meat sweetened with onion chutney and figs isn't spectacular enough to make the gimmick pay off. At times, Élan seems a little unfocused, as if Mr. Waltuck is hedging his bets by combining a grown-up bistro with a gastro pub in the crazed-carnivore style of the past decade. One of Élan's least pleasant dishes is scallop fettuccine dressed with a sauce that seems to be pure duck fat. After one forkful, I wanted a salad. Fashions have changed since Chanterelle closed, of course, but Élan is at its best when it is not trying to keep up with the youngsters. The mere sight of tea-smoked salmon on the menu may cause Asian fusion flashbacks. (Enormous Buddhas! Chopsticks as hairpins! Raw tuna served over bowls of live Siamese fighting fish!) But Mr. Waltuck's salmon is no throwback. It is silky and elegant, given a sweet-sour depth by a lightly curried tamarind sauce. The dish that made Mr. Waltuck's name, the seafood sausage in which sweet bits of scallops and shrimp are bound together by a subtle fish mousse, is back, looking hopelessly behind the times in its sauerkraut beurre blanc. Do not be fooled: It is also one of the most delicious things at Élan. I enjoyed Mr. Waltuck's steamed zucchini blossoms at Chanterelle and enjoyed them again at Élan, where they were stuffed with zucchini and Parmesan and served with slow-cooked tomatoes and very fresh, clean-tasting lemon crème fraîche. With dishes that call for lightness and delicacy, Élan comes into its own. The menu changes all the time, and at every meal, one or two recipes seemed to need more time in the test kitchen. A red-wine butter sauce with striped bass was very vague, as if it needed to be reduced longer. But a special I had the same night, fluffy fish quenelles bobbing in an aromatic Thai soup, skillfully combined Mr. Waltuck's longstanding love for Asian traditions with his habit of jumping outside tradition when the mood strikes. Diana Valenzuela, the pastry chef, seems to work the same way. She will be zigging in one direction, then she'll zag left on you. Panna cotta with Concord grape jam and fragile sheets of pine-nut brittle starts like dessert but ends like a cheese course; Ms. Valenzuela makes the panna cotta from Gorgonzola. A pastis-soaked chocolate cake might have been more interesting if it hadn't been topped with an oddly waxy chocolate mousse. But a swatch of basil pastry cream is an unexpected and excellent addition to blueberries in a thin, crisp corn-flour tart shell. Ms. Valenzuela's desserts are just right for a restaurant that takes the predictability out of tradition.

{"id": 107, "data": " Morten Sohlberg designed the tables for Blenheim, the West Village restaurant he and his wife opened in May. The concrete tops are polished smooth with beeswax, and the sides are edged with copper. The shapes look irregular, but the sides are slightly bowed so that a pair of two-tops can spoon against each other and become a four-top. \"That's the idea, anyway,\" our server said. \"But they don't all fit together.\" Blenheim is like that, too. A tremendous amount of thought and effort has gone into the food, drinks and design, but they don't always connect. This seems to have been an issue since the beginning. The first chef left about three weeks in because of what the owners called \"irreconcilable differences.\" In July, they hired Ryan Tate, who had been the chef at Le Restaurant in TriBeCa until it suddenly closed. I admired the $100 set menus he served there enough that I happily gave the place two stars in a review last year. Mr. Tate has set his ambitions even higher this time. Besides a sizable à la carte menu, he offers a $115, nine-course tasting loaded with extra dishes. At times, his cooking is as thoughtful and transporting as it was at Le Restaurant, but with a higher degree of intricacy. At other times, the kitchen is obviously struggling to keep up. Meanwhile, the service runs the gamut from charming and slightly lost to nonexistent. On my first night there, the disparity between the two was the widest I had ever seen in any restaurant. That is not the only disconnect. When tables are set up outside next to the cobblestone streets, Blenheim looks as if its only desire is to be your drop-in-and-hang-out corner tavern. The dining room, with an antique tree saw, a wooden yoke and a whole array of carpentry tools on the walls, looks like the historical society of some upstate village, where it would be the only tourist attraction. Underlining the point, servers tell you right away that this is a farm-to-table restaurant, that ingredients are trucked in from Blenheim Hill Farm in Schoharie County, southwest of Albany, owned by Mr. Sohlberg and his wife, Min Ye. You might reasonably expect pork cutlets, creamed corn, maybe pie. Mr. Tate has other ideas. Terrific ideas, often, even if they have as much business in a rusticated farm-to-table tavern as white tie and spats. The stream in Schoharie County where tilefish and sea urchin splash around together hasn't been discovered yet, but at Blenheim they swim happily side by side on one plate. The tilefish falls into big, sweet white flakes that taste of shrimp. The urchin is whipped into a creamy, slightly briny sabayon that is like a richer, more luxurious taramosalata. Also on the plate are fat blueberries and carrots roasted in coffee bean oil. I can't explain why blueberries taste so good with sea urchin sabayon, but they do. Alaskan king crab meat had been made almost as sweet and tender as some tropical fruit, but the midnight funk of squid ink sauce brought it back to the sea. With dense roasted chanterelles and wands of naturally pickled sea bean scattered around the plate, this was an appetizer you could go quietly crazy over. And it would take a crazy person to complain that Alaskan crab and sea urchin are insufficiently farm-to-table when they're cooked this skillfully. Not that Mr. Tate turns his back on the owners' land entirely. The carrots and the chanterelles come from Blenheim Hill Farm. So does the pork loin, which is slowly roasted until it drips with juices and then sent to the table with a cast of cool Southern characters: pickled peaches, okra charred to a crisp husk, and sorghum syrup, like molasses cut with espresso. Those are Blenheim lettuces and crunchy chips of smoked Blenheim ham in the gloriously crisp and fresh salad, and that's creamy Blenheim pork fat spackling the side of the bowl. The lemon balm, thyme and pineapple sage in a sensational group of herb sorbets: Blenheim-grown. The gap between the farm-to-table ethos and Mr. Tate's style is minor compared with the gulf between the restaurant Blenheim could be and the restaurant that currently sits at 283 West 12th Street. The same dish can be stunning one night and a contorted mess on another. The first time I had the roasted king mushrooms with spaetzle and sauerkraut, the mushroom stems had something like the flavor and texture of weisswurst. A German-inspired vegetarian main course with mushrooms standing in for sausages is a fantastic notion, and I couldn't wait to taste it again when I returned. But when I did, the stems were watery inside and rubbery outside, like a steamed hot dog wrapped in a balloon. An unusual dessert soup of cooked barley and Champagne grapes in a chilled barley-jasmine tea went out of whack between visits, going from fascinating to weird. And there were glitches that were surprising in such a technique-focused kitchen. The grapefruit pearls with cured Tasmanian sea trout were meant to burst with juice, but they had solidified. Eating them was like chewing on the drippings of a grapefruit-scented candle. On Blenheim's better nights, I might have ranked the food among the most exciting and interesting I've eaten in the last year. But it came to the table so very, very slowly that it was hard to stay excited or interested. It took more than three hours one night to order and eat appetizers, main courses and desserts. I wondered if the kitchen was overwhelmed. I was sure our server was. We had to flag him down to ask for more of the soft, warm and yeasty rolls made with Cheddar and Marmite. They never came. It took two tries and about 20 minutes to get a second glass of wine. We were left alone with menus for three-quarters of an hour before we waved like drowning sailors and begged him to take our order. \"There are some additions to the menu tonight,\" he began. Additions? When the kitchen can't send out more than one course an hour, the menu needs subtractions. And Blenheim has no business offering nine-course tastings unless it is ready to provide pajamas and sleeping bags. Maybe its pieces would fit together better if there weren't so many of them. I hope so, because I'd like to see it transform itself from a puzzle to a restaurant.

{"id": 108, "data": " We were halfway through appetizers at Cherche Midi, passing the steak tartare and spreading anchovy toasts with softly jiggly Parmesan custard, when one of my guests suddenly tilted his head and listened. He looked like the boy in a tornado movie who notices that the birds have stopped singing. \"There's no music,\" he said. \"They have speakers all over the dining room, but they're not using them.\" The restaurateur Keith McNally opened Cherche Midi in June on the corner of Houston Street and the Bowery, in a neighborhood where you don't go out to dinner unless you are prepared to shout over some Pavement song the chef loved in college. But we were talking, with no recorded soundtrack, as if we were in some Continental restaurant off Sutton Place in 1964 eating veal Orloff by candlelight. This is the paradox of Mr. McNally. Food writers who were still eating applesauce through a straw when he opened his first restaurant ( the Odeon , 1980) write about him with the same reverence that music writers have for Leonard Cohen. He's \"the king of cool,\" the restaurateur who \"owns NYC.\" Yet when it comes to current dining trends, particularly those in favor downtown, Mr. McNally shows a healthy disregard, verging at times on hostility. Of the six restaurants he operates between 14th Street and Canal Street, Cherche Midi may be his most thorough repudiation of the downtown scene. It isn't just music that's missing. There's almost no view of the street. Tapas, shared plates, tasting menus, wine pairings, \"Chef recommends,\" two-hour waits for a table the size of a chessboard -- no, none of that. Nor did Cherche Midi's servers try to tell me \"how the menu works,\" as if it were some complicated and expensive piece of machinery that I was likely to break. In Mr. McNally's restaurants, chefs are rarely treated like stars. At Cherche Midi, two men, Shane McBride and Daniel Parilla, share the work and the credit. As a result, perhaps, their cooking is almost egoless; it's not about what they want. It's about what you want, especially if that happens to be red meat and French wine. The prime rib may be the only dish at Cherche Midi that could be accused of trying to make an impression. The dark, roasted edges had the irresistible intensity of the bark on great barbecued brisket, even on the night they were aggressively salted. Lending this slab of dry-aged beef a bit of finesse is the side dish of pommes soufflées, like inflatable potato chips or, as one guest said, \"gluten-free beignets.\" The menu gives three more main-course slots to beef. Steak frites does a fine impersonation of a Parisian bistro steak, the kind you don't mind chewing and chewing between glasses of the house Beaujolais Villages, served at Cherche Midi in an $18 carafe. Filet mignon au poivre is far more tender, of course, with less sacrifice in flavor than usual. The tall, compact, rather lean, drip-free and wholly excellent burger is made from dry-aged prime rib; if you put your nose close enough, you can smell the meat locker right through the aroma of onion-bacon jam. All three dishes come with dark, skinny fries. Cherche Midi is so good with beef that even the best of the other main courses may register as a half step down: a pot of fat, clean mussels with bits of preserved lemon clinging to them; a roast chicken done right; a salade niçoise that pays attention to the last detail, including, in a wonderful departure from tradition, the pile of smashed potato salad at the bottom of the bowl. Here and there, the kitchen tends to overembellish. The decent roasted salmon comes with a lentil salad that tries to do too many things at once, and limp white stewed onions and fennel did not give skate Grenobloise (billed as meunière) anything that it really needed. It would be nice, too, to taste the meat under the aggressive seasoning in the steak tartare appetizer, given the chefs are clearly buying good beef. At least it made a strong impression, which is more than I can say for the $18 heirloom tomato salad. Heirlooms from where, exactly? Food Emporium? Still, unless you are coming to Cherche Midi to commune with the essence of summer, it is a good enough salad. The desserts are much better than that. The floating islands, the mocha pot de crème, the small pink raspberry soufflé hovering above a bed of warm berries -- the lineup is one argument after another for bringing back old-fashioned pleasures. After a recent tour of all his restaurants, I think Mr. McNally's great talent may be knowing which things are worth worrying about and which can get by with being just good enough. At Morandi , the main courses were almost impressive in their mediocrity, but the pasta was just swell, which may be all the place needs to keep its chairs full. The short-rib patty melt was the only good dish on a table full of disappointments at Schiller's Liquor Bar , but I enjoyed myself more than I have at far better restaurants. There is a limit, though, and Balthazar is approaching it. The cooking, under Mr. McBride, has become utterly mundane, a pretty but flavorless imitation of French food of the kind found at any generic fake bistro. Cherche Midi's salade niçoise is delicious from start to finish; Balthazar's is a bowl of ingredients that can't remember what they're supposed to taste like. How can the same chef and the same restaurateur be responsible for both? Mr. McNally does worry about service, which at Cherche Midi manages to be everywhere without crossing the line to helicopter waitering. And, of course, he worries about the interiors. Cherche Midi's is lovely. Outside is a dystopian intersection. You'd never know it in the dining room, which feels intimate, almost private, although of course every face is on display, bathed in light the color of apricot jam. For three decades, Mr. McNally has been rooting around in the same Lego kit: distressed mirrors, chipped subway tiles, bottles backlighted to look like stained glass. In his hands, these well-worn tricks give restaurants the battered nobility of a vintage Saab. When anyone else tries, they end up with a 1986 Ford Escort. Sets and lighting will never be the whole show.

{"id": 109, "data": " \"They say we're looking at two hours. They'll call us.\" This was the grim report from inside the latest East Village restaurant to have turned its no-reservations policy into a viral marketing campaign. A small, hungry mob was gathering on the sidewalk. Hoping to find a pleasant place to drink and snack until the phone rang, I herded my group to Huertas, a new Basque-leaning tapas place a few blocks away. The room smelled like garlic and smoke. A cured pig's leg sat at the end of the bar, its ankle held tightly in a clamp. A sharp knife had exposed its interior architecture of meat and fat and sinew. Later, we ordered a few slices of this Iberico ham, and as it melted on our tongues, warm and salty, we all traded looks. We did it again when we ate crumbly shards of aged manchego that tasted of brown butter and caramel. The looks meant: This kitchen knows where to get the good stuff. That applied to many things we ate that night. Jonah Miller, Huertas's chef, has written a concise menu of Basque-inspired tapas, not all of which could be called cooking and a fair amount of which is canned. I am not revealing any secrets here. Some food is still in its can when it comes to the table, like the dense mackerel in olive oil, which we ate, happily, on sliced baguettes with pimentón aioli. \"All the best Basque seafood goes straight into cans,\" our server told us, and she was so convincing that we asked if she knew a store that sold these marvelous cans. She did. She also knew where we could buy the manchego, which she was as excited about as we were. From the front door to the table, our service had been proactively friendly and enthusiastic. In New York, servers who learn that night's menu are rare enough; here was one who seemed to know everything about every ingredient. She told us about a restaurant in San Sebastián, where the chef had come out of the kitchen to point out the most delicious parts of a turbot, showing her how to scoop out his favorite part, the cheeks. Then she took a deep breath and said: \"Spain, you guys.\" It wasn't all cans and hams in Mr. Miller's kitchen, not that I would have minded. We asked for something called Huertas rotos, which turned out to be the Basque dish huevos rotos interpreted as a kind of pasta dish. Skinny threads of potato were cooked al dente and tossed with chorizo and its oil, with a soft-cooked egg on top. It was gone in 30 seconds. We drank vermouth, made on site, while every few minutes somebody came around with a tray of small bites straight from the kitchen. There was egg salad on a slice of baguette, with a sweet red shrimp on top; a golden croqueta of rice with creamy mushrooms in the center; and sweet roasted piquillo peppers stuffed with a cheesy, porky froth of fresh sausage whipped into goat cheese. These came in single servings that you could take or decline, depending on how good they looked and how hungry you were. Each plate you took was marked down on a card, dim-sum style, by servers. Huertas calls these items pintxos, a Basque term for snacks smaller than tapas and pinned together with a toothpick. In Spain, pintxos do not circulate like dim sum. (Mr. Miller got the idea from State Bird Provisions in San Francisco.) Yet we felt much closer to the Spanish tapas-bar spirit than if we had ordered 10 or 15 \"small plates meant for sharing\" at once, passed them around the table and called it dinner. This is rarely a satisfying way to eat, but it's how many Spanish restaurants in New York deal with tapas. The Huertas modified dim-sum approach was perfect for people like us, who want to start with drinks and see how the night goes without being forced to turn tapas into dinner. The way this night went was that by the time the other restaurant called, we didn't want to leave. I went back to Huertas a week or two later. I had made reservations for the small, square back dining room, where Mr. Miller serves a set menu for $55. In the front room, the plates are unconnected episodes, and you supply the narrative yourself. In the back, you settle in while Mr. Miller tells a story in five courses. He started with a nod to the front room, a plate of little bites. There were gildas, found in every tapas bar in San Sebastián, sharp, clean and salty skewers of white anchovy threaded with spicy green pepper and an olive. There was a blistered mound of Padrón peppers and garlic shrimp on toothpicks, too, not the sweetest or firmest I'd ever eaten. This was an anomaly; in general, the cooking at Huertas stands out for its pure, fresh flavors. Then a separated egg. The white, fried, lay under a jumble of corn and tomatoes cooked quickly with crisp-chewy pimentón-cured bacon. The yolk, raw, sat on top and served as sauce. Next was skate, sweet and still a little juicy inside, with roasted turnips and a pale-green, herbaceous sauce of puréed turnip greens and fennel. The seasonal Greenmarket aesthetic was familiar to me. Would any Basques recognize the dish? They would know the next course, wonderful garlic-and-pimentón-scented lamb hot dogs called chistorra, even though they would be used to seeing chistorras made with pork or beef. Alongside these house-made sausages, Mr. Miller had a wonderful succotash of late-summer beans. Dessert was a dream, a round and closely packed little goat-cheese cheesecake with a topping of candied almonds instead of a bottom crust. More tangy than sugary, the cake took beautifully to a sauce made from ripe nectarines. This night and a later one made it clear that dinner in Huertas's back room ranks among the best deals in town, up there with the how-do-they-do-it bargains at Contra and Delaware & Hudson. Mr. Miller shapes his menus so skillfully that it's hard to imagine wanting more. Still, once the familiar conventions of the modern tasting menu kicked in, I did steal a few looks at the front room, where a tray of hot croquetas always seemed to be going around. Maybe I wanted more spontaneity. Or maybe I just wanted a croqueta.

{"id": 110, "data": " The age of French dining in New York that blossomed in the unpromising soil of the Corona ash dumps during the 1939 World's Fair, at the French Pavilion's restaurant, seemed to come to its close about 10 years ago as mastodons like Lutèce lumbered into the fossil record. Today, that seems less like the end of an epoch than a salutary cooling-off period. If you are having trouble getting a reservation at a new place this year, odds are high that the menu is speckled with accents grave, acute and circumflex. Dirty French is turning away customers at the door. Keith McNally sent frogs' legs marching to the rescue at Cherche Midi after his pizzeria there fizzled. And just north of Washington Square Park, at an address that had started to look like a certain restaurant-killer, the doors at a new Provençal spot called Claudette have been thrown open to reveal closely packed rattan chairs, none of them empty. Claudette's charms are many and begin with those doors, which replace the woebegone sidewalk enclosure that used to make it look as if nobody were home. Losing a few seats has made reservations harder to land, but the reward is that the doors have let in the atypically cool breezes all summer, along with a view of lower Fifth Avenue's wide, leisurely sidewalks, where somebody is always walking a bichon frisé. Inside, Claudette looks like an expensive summer rental that is being used as a French street-corner cafe. (Rattan connects the two motifs.) The beach rental aesthetic is supplied by the whitewashed tables, throw pillows and shelves lined with books that are arranged by color and separated by anonymous knickknacks. Contributing to the cafe look are the compact bar and the winning cast of aperitif cocktails, which all seem to be named after Roger Vadim's wives. Small, gentle and very appealing, the Brigitte and her cohorts cheerfully buck the trend toward potent, convoluted cocktails that don't know how to behave at the dinner table. Claudette's food follows the example of the aperitifs; it is light, approachable and unlikely to impair your ability to stand up at the end of the meal. If you are in the mood for an intelligent salad, Claudette has plenty: green beans and vinegared hearts of palm with heaps of fresh mint; a nest of freshly shredded zucchini, still crisp under its anchovy vinaigrette; a crunch-fest of raw radishes and snap peas tugged in an unexpected, intriguing direction by cumin. Even less expected was the cinnamon-laced raz al hanout spice blend dusted on the bistro-style fries. More brushes with North Africa lay ahead. Claudette makes an unleavened, layered flatbread, similar to traditional kesra, that is good when hot from the griddle, especially with a thick smear of pistou. (I couldn't see the point of another spread, the bland and expensive hummus with chopped truffles.) Gradually, it becomes clear that Claudette's chef, Wade Moises, and chef de cuisine, Koren Grieveson, have made a smart decision about Provence. Rather than treating it as if it were frozen in time and sealed off from the world -- Peter Mayle's \"A Year in Provence\" repeated forever -- they cast a few glances at the North African immigrants who live and cook there. Claudette's owners, Carlos Suarez and Mark Barak, were traveling in Provence when, like many English-speaking tourists, they fell under the sunny spell of Lourmarin. They had a charmed meal in that town at a restaurant founded by Claudette Sammut, a Frenchwoman who lived in Tunisia until the 1950s. Before it was over, they had asked her family if they could take her name back to Manhattan. They brought her bouillabaisse, too, an eccentric white version that has a puff-pastry hat and lemon juice but no tomatoes and an undetectable quantity of saffron. I was not as smitten by its tenaciously sour broth as they were. As a sauce for the monkfish, baby octopus and shellfish, it might get by, but as a soup, it lost its appeal after a few spoonfuls, and even sooner the time it was oversalted. A somewhat more successful souvenir from Lourmarin is the pieds paquets. Traditionally an all-day stew of sheep's trotters and tripe, it has been de-trottered for New Yorkers. Or, as a server with an oratorical flair put it, \"we absented the feet for cleanliness of flavor.\" What we get instead are tripe-wrapped bundles of pork shoulder braised in white wine and tomatoes. Tender but polite, they are upstaged by the grilled bread, fantastic when dunked in the expanse of rust-colored sauce. As the absented feet suggest, Claudette's exploration of Provence can be undercut by its impulse to play it safe, to water down the pastis. Braised chicken thighs on a bed of nutty toasted bulgur arrive in a tagine, but they aren't cooked in one. When servers lift the glazed lid, the mint and other aromatics don't rush into your lungs the way they would in Tangier. The tiny dab of harissa doesn't go far, either. But the chicken is moist and well browned, the sauce gets sunny Mediterranean sweetness from oranges, and for complexity and originality, the dish leaves the other main courses in the shade. After making its opening moves so gracefully, Claudette grows oddly clumsy at the end. The most reliable dessert is the pistachio cake sandwiching a layer of citrus cream, smartly accompanied by candied orange peel. But a chocolate pot de crème with harissa was grainy, and a supposed bread pudding of chocolate-almond croissants looked and tasted exactly like a stack of stale pastries. Most of the time, though, the kitchen does what it sets out to do, even if it seems to be holding back. If Mr. Moises and Ms. Grieveson choose to dive a bit deeper into their vision of an African-tinged Provence, they could make the Gallic revival more interesting by cleaning the dusty windows of nostalgia through which New Yorkers like to view French cuisine.

{"id": 111, "data": " \"I want everybody to sing on this one,\" the man behind the Casio at the far end of the dining room calls out. \"Come on, the two North Korean Jews in the back!\" Do I have to fill in the picture? To know where we are, do you need to see the smeared pitchers of schmaltz on every table? Smell the chopped garlic on every steak? Hear the yip of the small child whose head hits the ceiling as he is hoisted on a chair by adults drunk on \"Hava Nagila\" and Stolichnaya? Did you think the person commanding the imaginary visitors from North Korea to get up and dance the hora was the maître d'hôtel of Per Se? No, the only possible setting is Sammy's Roumanian Steakhouse , the most wonderful terrible restaurant in New York. What happens at Sammy's doesn't happen at other restaurants, and vice versa. The rest of the Lower East Side can obsess over filament light bulbs and salvaged barn beams; Sammy's, virtually unchanged since opening in 1975, will be ready when fluorescents and drop ceilings make their triumphant return to fashion. Inside the dining room, lighted like a bail bondsman's office in Detroit, are hundreds of faded business cards, yellowed newspaper clippings and curled snapshots taped and tacked to every surface. Outside on Chrystie Street, scaffolding obscures the faded red and yellow painted signs in front of the building, which looks as if it has been marked for demolition. Like a Mississippi juke joint, Sammy's seems to have been put together under the theory that nobody is likely to stay sober long enough to inspect the décor. (Known for selling vodka bottles encased in ice, Sammy's is New York's original bottle-service restaurant, and still the only tolerable one.) Other steakhouses can drive themselves crazy over internal temperatures. At Sammy's, the meat will be cooked. If you have something more specific in mind, if you want it medium or black and blue, then write your request on a sheet of paper, tear it into small pieces and throw them into the air when the piano player sings \"Happy Birthday.\" Two times I asked for garlic-smeared skirt steak, called Romanian tenderloin at Sammy's, cooked medium rare. One steak arrived medium well, and the other time a single steak ranged from well done to bloody, and every degree in between. I wasn't asked how I wanted a broiled veal chop. It was seared on the outside and raw inside, the way other places serve tuna. When nobody asked how I wanted sweetbreads broiled, I feared the worst. Another surprise: Scored and blackened on top, they were close to perfect. The servers follow a template unique to this restaurant, too, dressed in Sammy's T-shirts and jeans with a dishrag swinging from one pocket. Speed trumps ceremony. Standing over a metal bowl of chopped liver, they pour a cascade of schmaltz from on high, go at the liver with forks to mix in the shredded radishes, fried onions and lumps of fried chicken skin, and do not necessarily notice the stray bits that escape the bowl and land on the table. The ritual ends, not with \"bon appétit\" or \"enjoy your meal\" but with, \"O.K., start eating.\" The classic style of waiting tables at Lower East Side Jewish restaurants, by turns cranky, funny and crankily funny (discerning one from another could take decades of practice) probably died with Ratner's, but flashes of it still surface at Sammy's. One night, when we kept asking our server if we'd ordered enough, he rolled his eyes, checked his watch and said, \"Tell you what: If you're still hungry, the Chinese food will be here at 9:30.\" Hungry we weren't. As always at Sammy's, I walked out feeling as if I had eaten a football stuffed with chicken fat and beef. The kitchen, so unpredictable when it comes to meat temperatures, is absolutely consistent in its ability to produce starch that detonates inside the stomach. The fried kreplach are grenades of dough with a tiny core of chopped meat that tastes like dough, too. The latkes are flavorless and textureless, but not weightless. Better than either, the kishke could stand some gravy and some salt. In fact, with the exception of the grandmotherly sweet-and-sour stuffed cabbage, almost everything at Sammy's needed salt. Once it was added freely, the chopped liver was beyond reproach, the skirt steaks and lamb chops were excellent, and the fried silver-dollar potatoes were worth talking about. I can't figure out why Sammy's is cutting back on sodium after all these years, unless it is suddenly trying to atone for decades of treating schmaltz as a dietary supplement. The menu is less distinctively Romanian than it once was. The last review of Sammy's in The New York Times, written by Mimi Sheraton in 1982, praised the Romanian salad of whipped eggplant with green peppers; the broiled brains; the mush steak; the pitcha, a seasoned gelatin made from calves' feet and garlic; and the baked unborn eggs. The recent menus, stapled inside manila folders as they have been since the Koch administration, haven't offered any of these specialties. This is how a culture disappears. But if Romania has faded, Sammy's is still loudly, raucously, endlessly, embracingly Jewish, a permanent underground bar mitzvah where Gentiles can act like Jews and Jews can act like themselves. One night, I went with a woman who had spent the summer in Europe, as synagogues and Jewish-owned shops burned in one city after another. In Sammy's basement, when strangers joined their hands in the air and danced between the tables, eyeing our food as they passed, I could see her grow less tense every minute. \"It feels so good to be back in a place where I can be out,\" she finally said. And if this is not your heritage -- if you aren't quite sure what is happening when the man at the keyboard belts out \"Sing us a song, you're the schmatte man\" -- the entertainers at Sammy's will still get to you. Dancing and singing along to some dumb old tune being played by a musician in the corner: This is how people had fun in the Old World, by which I don't mean just the parts of Europe where the Lower East Side's Jews came from, but also the world before amplifiers and apps and first-person-shooter video games and all the forms of entertainment that drive us into ourselves. Sammy's forces you out of yourself; I don't think there's another restaurant in New York where people talk to strangers as readily as they do here. \"Would you like me to take your picture?\" somebody at the next table asked one night. \"Do you want our seltzer charger for your egg creams?\" another asked us. As a table of about two dozen people filed out, a woman in the back called to them, \"Thank you for dancing with us!\" Is this a three-star restaurant, as Mimi Sheraton thought in 1982? By today's standards, of course not. It is closer to one. But if you need stars to tell you what to think of Sammy's, I'm not sure I want to share my seltzer charger with you. I'll give it to those nice North Korean Jews instead.

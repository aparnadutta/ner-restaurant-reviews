{"id": 43, "data": " Hanon, a new udon shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was produced by the union of a Tokyo video-production company and a Japanese manufacturer of unusually thin condoms. The condoms became the subject of a series of advertisements on which the production company worked; in one of them, called \"Acts of Love,\" dancers in London re-enact, with surprising grace and dignity, the mating rituals of blue-footed boobies, fiddler crabs and other animals. Well, kids, when two companies like each other very much, sometimes they decide to create a new company together. That is what happened with the production firm and the prophylactics people when, for reasons that are perhaps best not to question, they hit upon the idea of expanding their product line from condoms into noodles. The restaurant lies across Union Avenue from Kellogg's Diner. Its door is marked during business hours by the fluttering white noren curtains. It is the second Hanon location. The first is about 6,700 miles away, in the city of Kamakura, which lies south of Tokyo and is known for soba, not udon. This gave Hanon the advantage of not competing against any of Japan's established udon styles, leaving its chef, Takahiro Yanagisawa, free to come up with his own. Mr. Yanagisawa, who had spent 25 years making sushi before turning to noodles, focused his innovative urges on the dough. He began by adding wheat germ and bran to the white flour that in udon is typically used alone. The resulting noodle is called zenryufun or whole wheat. The bran and germ are Mr. Yanagisawa's attempts to make a more healthful udon, but they also add flavor, a mottled color and a slightly rough texture that holds on to the dashi-based broth. This dough is also made into a green noodle, called sasauchi, by mixing in powdered barley shoots and leaves of kuma-zasa, a bamboo variety that pandas dote on . To the human palate, or at least this human's palate, sasa tastes something like green tea. Both the speckled zenryufun and the green sasauchi are flat noodles, resembling fettuccine that has been working out. Avoiding extremes, they are moderately chewy and reasonably springy. Either flavor, or both, can be ordered cold and spread on a bamboo mat for dunking into a sauce, either a peanut-buttery sesame sauce or the traditional dashi-based dipping sauce. For larger or more curious appetites, these dipping noodles, called seiro udon, can be dangled into a hot duck soup in which a few hunks of well-boiled duck meat swim. The cold noodles can also be accessorized with whipped mountain yam or tempura or both. If you had stumbled into Hanon under the impression that it was another generic Williamsburg noodle mill, the tempura would set you straight. The crust is engineered for udon, thick and substantial enough that it will not dissolve and float away in the soup, yet somehow not oily or clunky. The tempura is served with sea salt, which will not only season the fried blowfish tails, shrimp, mushroom and vegetables, but will also do very good things to any noodles it happens to meet. With the hot soups, there is no choice of noodles. All are made with zenryufun. The plain broth, a dashi augmented by white soy sauce, is not so salty or concentrated that I didn't want to drink it all. It also performs well made into a thick-but-not-sludgy curry soup with thin pink slices of washugyu beef; a shaggy, mossy, salty-sour mass of ume and kombu; and a soup of shaved beef and onions that tastes like a deeper, stronger version of French dip jus and is blitzed by a little grated yuzu peel at the end. A few near-relatives of udon make it to the menu as well. The beef-and-onion combination can also be had over rice. Creamy, slightly spicy cod roe is tossed with zenryufun for an excellent mentaiko pasta that, for once, relies on the roe rather than Kewpie mayonnaise to make an impression. The eventual plan is to sell both colors of noodle to grocery stores and other restaurants -- to become, in essence, the Sun Noodle of the udonisphere. This would be a gain for New York, but for the moment Hanon's udon is found only at Hanon, where the noodles are made fresh each day. Any plan for world domination is not hinted at on the restaurant's Facebook page , which seems to be its home base online, though nobody has bothered to post a menu there yet. Nor does the dining room suggest a budding global chain. Atmospheric and presumably expensive prints by the photographers Takashi Homma and Nobuyoshi Araki hang over the tables, and a signed Cy Twombly lithograph has been placed by the door to the backyard. The music -- torch songs, jazz piano -- seems to be coming from a radio tuned to another decade. A lot of this cocktail music will make more sense once the liquor license comes through. Hanon is getting set to offer sake, shochu and wines chosen by Jorge Riera, who built the list at Frenchette and has turned countless New Yorkers on to the fizzy, fuzzy and furry delights of natural wines. The idea of Hanon is not to slurp and slide out, but to stay for a meal: a chilled French red with the fried chicken and Japanese omelet, maybe, and something a bit brawnier with curry soup. Dessert could be a tofu blancmange, smooth and white and somewhat sweet, but there is more satisfaction in the grainy, earthy bricks of red bean paste. The meal might end with tea, to which the restaurant takes the same unhurried approach it applies to everything else. The iced oolong is slowly cold-brewed; a bamboo whisk and ceramic chawan are kept on the dining counter for painstakingly whipping up bowls of matcha; an appliance imported from Taiwan will transform freshly steeped hojicha and ice into a tan froth, a process that takes about five minutes. This foam tea is dairy-free, unlike Taiwan's infamous cheese tea. It is served in a wine glass, and the experience of drinking it is similar to tackling a pint of Guinness before the head has settled down.

{"id": 44, "data": " You will find Kawi , the latest Momofuku restaurant, on the fifth floor of 20 Hudson Yards, assuming you stay determined and swallow back the urge to run for the exits that may grip you as you negotiate escalators that don't connect to one another, elevators that are hidden out of sight like somebody's crazy grandfather and shiny retail windows that seem to be trying to provoke a class war. By the time people reach Kawi they tend to look rattled; New Yorkers who will easily weave their way around broken sidewalks, potholes, garbage piles and al fresco rat conventions come undone when faced with the interior of a shopping mall. Kawi, now two months old, can be disorienting in its own way, but at least you can have a seat and a drink while you get your bearings. Space there is used, or not used, the way it is in Las Vegas. There's a very long bar behind a line of black, geometric bar stools receding toward the vanishing point; low lounge tables; taller, square wood tables; round wood tables; black-leather booths; red-leather booths; red-leather banquettes; and a row of chairs facing a kitchen counter. Between all this furniture are aisles wide enough for a Zamboni. All those seats have backs, too. Kawi is loaded with the comforts and accommodations that critics, including me, were begging Mr. Chang to pay more attention to as recently as the opening of Nishi three years ago. Has anybody complained before that a David Chang restaurant was too quiet? They're saying it about Kawi. If there is anybody left who still thinks of Mr. Chang as a downtown punk, Kawi will clear up that misconception. The early Momofuku restaurants were skateboards; Kawi is a minivan with sliding doors, armrests, cupholders and Don Henley on the stereo. The ride may not be as fast, but it's a lot smoother. Kawi is also the first Momofuku restaurant in New York to address Korean cuisine head on and at length. Majordomo , which opened in Los Angeles last year, is at least half Korean, but the menu is loaded up with other stuff, a lot of which is big and showy and seemingly designed to dazzle the high rollers. It can be hard to remember you're eating galbi-jjim after a server buries it beneath a tableside avalanche of shaved raclette. Eunjo Park, Kawi's executive chef, avoids this type of distraction. This is lucky, because she makes food that you want to concentrate on. Before joining the Momofuku stable, she worked in the formal and highly fastidious kitchens of Daniel , Le Bec-Fin and Per Se . She later returned to South Korea, where she had lived until she was 12, for advanced studies at the Seoul restaurant Gaon and at the kitchen of the Chunjinam hermitage, presided over by Jeong Kwan , certainly the most celebrated cooking Zen nun in her country. A strong interest in tradition marks Ms. Park's food at Kawi. Her dishes are set apart from versions you may have had before by the exactitude of the technique and the quality of the ingredients. One section of her menu is turned over to kimbap, those wide, nori-wrapped sushi rolls often spotted at salad bars, languishing under plastic wrap. Most kimbap is designed to be portable, filling and inexpensive. Ms. Park's kimbap, on the other hand, is built for pleasure. She has a pickled vegetable kimbap on the lunch menu that is truly exciting; you are meant to dip it in a dark liquid that tastes a bit like soy sauce but is made with beets. The dinner menu brings kimbap filled with chives, pickled daikon, citrus jelly and a buttery pink vein of foie gras terrine. Has this really never been done before, you wonder as you eat it, and if not, why not? Among the other gussied-up raw fish that you expect in Momofukuland, like a refreshing if somewhat staid madai tartare, are some dime-size clams in chile sauce and an elegant, inspired interpretation of gejang. Blue crab legs and claw are cracked and given a three-day soak in soy sauce, among other things, which gives them an impressive amount of flavor. Then, in case you haven't noticed that you're dealing with a real chef, Ms. Park stirs the crab's roe with creamy rice and spoons this Korean risotto into the open belly of the shell. At moments like this, or in the hwedupbap filled with raw fish as strikingly good as any you'll find in a $200 omakase, or in the doenjang jjigae, a potful of braised fermented bean paste with pork belly that appears on the menu as \"yesterday's stinky soybean stew\" and manages to be homespun and polished at the same time, it's possible to see Kawi as Ms. Park's response to Atomix . It's as if she had looked at Junghyun Park's dazzlingly complex compositions at his year-old modern Korean restaurant and decided that she could cook in a style that was every bit as modern and painstaking, but that instead of turning traditional dishes into tasting-menu food she would keep the old forms and innovate inside them. With her tidy, refined, French-influenced neo-traditionalism, Ms. Park could become something like the Alain Ducasse of Korean cooking. It's not obvious, though, that Kawi needs an Alain Ducasse. Certain appetizers seem to belong on another planet, more beautiful and gentle than ours, such as the soft tofu with soy syrup that, sitting under a shattering thin crust of caramelized sugar, is like a savory crème brûlée by way of Seoul. And there are others, such as the sticks of fried cod that a server pointlessly snips in half with scissors and then spritzes with atomized yuzu juice, that are right at home at Hudson Yards. The presentation seemed forced. That could also describe the boiled chicken dish, one of the menu's showiest items and, at $64, one of its most expensive. The whole bird is steamed, then the breast is sliced and served plain while the dark meat is fried and coated with spices. Neither is spectacular on its own, and the combination is bizarre. More successful versions of elaborate, oversize, multicomponent dishes are proven moneymakers elsewhere in the Momofuku republic. But arm-waving platters like that seem out of place at Kawi, which is the least Momofukian of the Momofukus. The most uncharacteristic thing of all is that the dining room has never been operating at anything close to capacity, at least when I've been there. Maybe tables are being kept off the reservation books to give the cooks time to learn where the spice cabinet is. Or maybe the fans who are so devoted to Mr. Chang's downtown spots are still trying to figure out the escalators.

{"id": 45, "data": " More than a year ago, I was on the verge of reviewing Del Posto when the news intervened. The restaurant had changed significantly since the last time it had been evaluated by a Times critic: Sam Sifton promoted it from three stars to four in 2010, when Mark Ladner was the executive chef and Brooks Headley was running the pastry kitchen. First, Mr. Headley had quit this stately, expensive Italian restaurant in Chelsea so he could sell fast, cheap vegetarian burgers . Next, Del Posto had spent about $1 million on crystal candle vases, white leather chairs and other luxurious fittings that made it even more stately and expensive. Finally, Mr. Ladner had left to sell fast, cheap pasta. A fresh review was clearly in order. Before I could write it, though, a number of women who had worked for Mario Batali, one of the owners, started talking about the sexual harassment and abuse that they say he had doled out. Suddenly there seemed to be more important questions than whether the braised-rabbit agnolotti were cooked al dente. Negotiations took more than a year, but Mr. Batali no longer profits from Del Posto, having sold his stake in March to a group led by his former partner, Joe Bastianich . Employees have said that Mr. Bastianich himself helped, at a minimum, to build the sexist and disrespectful environment in which Mr. Batali operated. Mr. Bastianich has apologized, saying that he had heard Mr. Batali speak inappropriately to employees, and that he should have done more to stop the sexual harassment. Some diners will stay away, feeling that Mr. Bastianich has not sufficiently atoned. I understand this, but I am also interested in the way employees may be treated at the restaurant now and in the future. Here, there is reason to hope. Among other human-resources reforms, employees can now report complaints about owners or corporate officers to an independent investigative firm with the power to refer cases to outside counsel. As part of the restructuring, Melissa Rodriguez, who has been the executive chef of Del Posto since 2017, was made a partner in the restaurant, along with Jeff Katz, now the managing partner. A new pastry chef, Georgia Wodder, was appointed last spring. Del Posto is, with the possible exception of Aquavit , the grandest and most expensive restaurant in New York where women are in charge of everything you eat, starting with the miniature saffron waffle rolled like a cannoli and stuffed at one tiny end with taleggio and at the other with fennel pesto, and ending with the prosecco marshmallow tucked into the wooden drawer of a custom-made cheese grater. The cooking is more subdued now. The kitchen is not seen as a beacon of innovation the way it used to be, perhaps because Ms. Rodriguez is less interested than Mr. Ladner was in feats of technical derring-do like 100-layer lasagnas . She gets her effects by following old Italian templates and putting them together so elegantly that they seem to light up from inside. There's an honesty to her approach -- she doesn't try to shoot out all the lights by supercharging dishes with fat -- but it's not the kind of peasant simplicity people usually mean when they talk about honesty in Italian food. It's a sophisticated honesty. You know chicken cacciatore, of course. Ms. Rodriguez's version is made from guinea hen breast, roasted until the skin crackles like parchment. What would be the body of the stew is now a sauce; the tomato, celery and onion in it come through distinctly. Occupying a little sidecar is a pressed puck of braised leg meat under a single, Roman-style gnocco, a small featherbed of semolina held together by eggs, milk and cheese. One side has been broiled so hard it is nearly burned, which seems like a mistake at first, but turns out to supply the bit of campfire that this hunter's stew needs. It has to be far more complicated to prepare than the cacciatore at your neighborhood Italian restaurant, but it seems simpler, pared to essentials, and wonderful in every bite. I've never seen anyone wring as much flavor out of salsify as Ms. Rodriguez does. Sliced transparently thin and fried, it makes crunchy brown chips about half the size of an M&M. These decorate the top of a grilled-salsify pudding that has the refreshing bittersweetness of one of those plant-based Italian aperitifs. If it were not garnished with streaky leaves of radicchio, it could pass for a dessert. The menu structure has not changed, although the prices have. Everything can be had à la carte. Lunch is still a relative bargain, though the price has shimmied up to $59 for three courses. For a blowout $194 dinner, the Captain's Menu yields eight courses or so. Most people, however, go with the $164, five-course Menu del Posto. The primary argument in favor of this strategy is, to me, an overwhelming one: Two of those five courses are pasta. Del Posto's pastas are worth doubling up on. They can come in many forms. Delicate conical tortellini have hidden pockets of nettles and spring peas; they are half-submerged in a light spring-vegetable brodo in which Parmigiano-Reggiano rinds once bobbed like bay leaves. This is the spring minestrone. A single, plate-spanning raviolo, called a fazzoletto, is topped with poached mussels and filled with spinach and fresh herbs -- not a lawnmower-mulch of greenery but a layer of emulsion as thin and velvety as the dough that envelops it. The sauce of mussel juices, white wine, butter and saffron makes this the only convincing mussel pasta I've ever had. The range of flavors Ms. Wodder commands in her pastry kitchen seems unnecessarily limited to me, although I may be unfairly comparing her desserts with Mr. Headley's, which roamed all over the place. Individually, her desserts are soothing, often showcasing the comforts of dairy. More emphasis, some extra acidity or bitterness, might have brought an assemblage of quince paste, brown-butter gelato and griddled brioche into relief. But I appreciated the way winter squash in the batter modified the sweetness of an olive oil-orange cake, and I enjoyed the moody sulkiness that amaro lent to a citrus salad served with the cake. Del Posto has in recent years picked up a reputation as a restaurant for one-percenters. It rarely gives that impression once you are inside, where servers solemnly accommodate just about anyone. There is a vegan menu at Del Posto. A vegetarian meal can be put together easily, and almost everything can be made without gluten, including the pasta. Yes, the stockpile of Champagnes includes some lock-and-key stuff, and should you require a Barolo costing between $2,000 and $4,000, one will quickly be added to your bill. But among the 3,100 or so Italian labels superintended by Evan Clagnaz, the wine director, are more marked from $60 to $75 than I can count. Piemonte is a place to hunt, and Friuli, and the Valle d'Aosta, for starters. Though the restaurant is not exclusively for rich people, it is explicitly for occasions. Once, when a reservationist called to confirm and asked whether I was celebrating anything special, I said no, and was gently laughed at: \"Just a normal Tuesday night at Del Posto?\" There is little danger that anyone will mistake a night at Del Posto for normal. If nothing else, the napkins and towels are a tip-off. First, there is a small hot linen napkin scented with tomato-vine oil, to wipe the dust of the outside world from your hands. Then a large white linen napkin, followed just before dessert by a small yellow one. It is given to you, and the white one is taken away, by a server using a large fork and spoon as tongs. When you go to the restrooms, you may encounter an attendant who has just restocked the hand towels from a large basket she carries on one arm, like Heidi out gathering wildflowers for Grandfather. There are little ceremonies like this from start to finish; I don't know of any other restaurant that performs quite so many tasks whose only real purpose is to draw attention to themselves. And these things are rarely done with a smile; employees seem to have been directed to keep a respectful, formal distance as they carry out your requests and perform other services you'd never think of requesting. They rarely seem comfortable. Their solemnity is underlined by the sepulchral lighting at night, so gloomy it makes the crypt of Grant's tomb look like a tiki bar. A good deal of the service is the attentive, helpful kind that you really want, but the rest of it seems designed only to give customers the sensation of temporary power over other people. Some people may love this, but it reflects a serious lack of imagination when you think about the ways the service at Blue Hill at Stone Barns or Noma , for instance, is integrated into the experience. Is it stretching a point to ask if enshrining subservience, as Del Posto does, reflects the same twisted sense of priorities that allowed Mr. Batali to get away with abusing his own power for so long? (And is it a coincidence that far more men than women seem to work in the dining room, particularly in the upper ranks?) Now that Ms. Rodriguez owns a piece of the restaurant, perhaps she can lead a reconsideration of priorities in the front of the house, and find a tone that more closely matches her philosophy in the back. She shouldn't have to clean up the messes men made.

{"id": 46, "data": " How clam pizza, with all its charms, remained trapped in New Haven for most of a century is a mystery that may never be unraveled. At least it has escaped now. For the past decade or so, Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana , the 93-year-old establishment said to have invented the regional delicacy, has been exporting it to its other branches in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. There is also a small cult of the clam pie among New York pizzaioli. It has become a fixture at Lombardi's and some Staten Island pizzerias, as well as inspiring lovingly considered tributes at Pasquale Jones , Motorino and the Clam . I have eaten most of them, and happily, but on a recent trip to Connecticut I was led to what I now realize is the clam pie against which all others should be measured. It is baked at Zuppardi's Apizza in the city of West Haven. Unlike the coal ovens used to fire New Haven's more famous \"abeetz,\" to use the Connecticut-Neapolitan dialect, the ovens at Zuppardi's are fired by gas. As a result, Zuppardi's pies are not nearly as blackened as the ones from Pepe's, but the crust still bulges with air pockets and emerges with a pleasingly dry, thin and crackery crunch. [ Learn how to make pizza at home with this guide from NYT Cooking. ] Zuppardi's tops its clam pizza (market price, typically $32.45 for a medium pie) with fresh garlic, olive oil, dried oregano, cracked red pepper and littlenecks. Smaller clams may be opaque when they reach the table. Larger specimens will be just warmed through. All will taste as if they had just been shucked, as in fact they were. Opening clams to order means that the clam pizza takes longer than Zuppardi's other specialties, like the plain pie (tomato sauce, grated cheese, no mozzarella), itself worth a detour from Interstate 95, which rumbles by about a cherrystone's throw away.

{"id": 47, "data": " It is true that the bacalaitos at the Freakin Rican in Astoria, Queens, are not quite as big around as the ones you will see browning in veritable caldrons of oil over wood fires at kiosks scattered along the beach road in Piñones, outside San Juan. These flattened cod fritters are the size of pie plates in Puerto Rico, while in Queens they are roughly the diameter of a coffee can. Dimensions aside, they give off all the right signals. They are the color of a corn muffin, with green specks of chopped cilantro under the surface that let you know they are not made from Goya's mix. They don't leave your fingertips entirely free of grease, but they come close. They have an exterior crunch that surrenders quickly to the firm, chewy interior of mashed salt cod; the texture is less fried dough than fish taffy. You could start to build a business around bacalaitos like these. That, in fact, has been Derick López's plan for some time now. Mr. López, who was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the South Bronx, is the Freakin Rican's chef and, with his husband, Victor Vargas, its owner. About four years ago, armed with picnic coolers and a couple of folding tables, the two men began selling a short menu of Puerto Rican staples at the street fairs that seem to infiltrate a different New York thoroughfare each weekend. As they promoted the Freakin Rican catering operation, the Freakin Rican product line, the Freakin Rican Facebook page and the Freakin Rican YouTube channel, they saved their earnings so they could found the Freakin Rican restaurant. After a false start in another part of Queens, it opened a short distance from the Museum of the Moving Image one year ago this month. The dining room has 19 seats. The banana-plant wallpaper on the left wall is reflected in the mirrors on the right. In between are some metal chickens and bright-green figurines of coquís, the little frogs that chirp from every Puerto Rican tree. Diners sip on tropical-fruit shakes or bottles of Kola Champagne, Coco Rico and Malta India, the Harry, Ron and Hermione of Puerto Rican soft drinks. Héctor Lavoe may be playing over the speakers, or Víctor Manuelle, not so loudly that they can't be drowned out by the sounds of a small number of employees singing \"Happy Birthday\" while wielding a tambourine and a pair of maracas. If you have spent any time at all on the trail of chicharrones, mofongo, sancocho and other wonders of the Puerto Rican kitchen, you know that Astoria is not a primary hunting ground for any of them. You also know, though, that blinking-light cuchifritos parlors and family-run cocina criolla luncheonettes have been disappearing from the Bronx, East Harlem and the Lower East Side over the past few decades, along with many of their customers. The Puerto Rican population in New York peaked around 1990, when residents of the old barrios began to flow to the suburbs in large numbers, according to Laird W. Bergad , the director of the Center for Latin American, Caribbean and Latino Studies at City University of New York Graduate Center. Beacons of Puerto Rican cuisine still survive; Casa Adela, for instance, is still busily dispensing chickens from its venerable lemon-yellow rotisserie on Avenue C, despite the death last year of its founder, Adela Fargas. But there are not so many of these places left that we can take an unlimited supply of tostones and mojo de ajo for granted, either. The Freakin Rican developed its act on the street-fair circuit, but it applied the same tactics that succeed at Smorgasburg and similar urban foraging grounds, where the ideal dish can be held in one hand, gets immediate attention, costs under $10 and can serve as a plank in a branding platform. This may explain why appetizers are the strong suit on the Freakin Rican menu. The sorullitos, Puerto Rico's answer to hush puppies, are an exception; they are dense and dry, as if the cornmeal hadn't absorbed enough water. Mr. López's alcapurrias, though, are very good, even if the picadillo that runs down the middle of a tube of mashed fried plantains like the graphite in a pencil could be seasoned a little more forcefully. And his pasteles are exceptional. Pasteles are structured like tamales. Where the masa would be, Mr. López makes a sweet, enjoyably gummy mash of green plantains, taro root and kabocha squash. The filling is a soft, rich vein of stewed pork shoulder with ham, bacon, red peppers and green olives. Rolled up in a banana leaf, these pasteles probably deserve their own float in the Puerto Rican Day Parade. Mr. López fries chicken in two styles. One, the chicharrones de pollo, is traditional. The other, the Freakin Crispy Wings, is not. Each has its rewards. The chicharrones, hacked into three-bite hunks, taste of cider vinegar and garlic powder and have a smooth, achiote-tinted buttermilk crust that breaks open with a pleasing crackle. The Freakin Crispy Wings are spicier, and the shell is thicker and more deeply crevassed. These wings may owe more to Atlanta than to Mayagüez, although you can get them with a guava barbecue sauce that's reasonably tropical. Leave behind these appetizers, the core of the street-fair business, and the menu can start to appear unsteady. At dinner, the main courses tend to be fairly plain fried or grilled meat. Grilled pork chops splashed with mojo can be dry and dull, and the grilled chicken breasts are not much more interesting. Baked pork ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce are tender enough, but they aren't very persuasive. On several nights, I found myself gazing longingly at the lunch specials on the back of the menu, wondering why I couldn't have a brick of pastelón for dinner. (I came back for it one Thursday afternoon, and was glad I did.) Until more long-cooked dishes like it appear at dinnertime, consider a bowl of sancocho. Listed as \"vegetable root soup\" for $7, it doesn't sound like much of a meal. But it is a grab bag of a stew with at least two kinds of meat, great hunks of taro and yuca, a couple of inches of corn on the cob and a magical squash broth that has the consistency of heavy cream and the color of very ripe mango. In the unlikely event that you finish it and the bowl of rice that comes with it and then cry out for more, the Freakin Rican has just the thing for you: mofongo. A dome of mashed plantains possessed by garlic, the mofongo is cooked to order to keep the crunchy bits crunchy and the whole thing from getting boggy. You can have it with chicharrones or sliced roast pork, which leaves behind a happy impression of garlic, oregano and salt. If you have come for a birthday, a candle stuck in the meringue icing of a tres leches cake is probably in your future. If not, flan and espresso will do, and a bag of pasteles for tomorrow.

{"id": 48, "data": " If you ate at Spice Market before it closed two years ago, you may experience low-key but persistent flashbacks at Wayan , which set up shop in February on the east end of Spring Street in NoLIta. Again the flavors come from Asia and the methods, generally, from France. Again the far-off tropics are evoked through the play of indirect, dappled light, as if filtered through jungle foliage or a carved wooden screen. Again the presiding culinary sensibility belongs to a Vongerichten. Jean-Georges Vongerichten put together Spice Market in 2004, a confection of teak, silk, vodka, peanut sauce and high heels that brought the Asian Party Temple restaurant genre to its apotheosis. All the earlier examples suddenly seemed fumbling and unsophisticated, and with the possible exception of the Spice Market spinoffs in Qatar and Mexico, the ones that would follow seemed increasingly mindless and out of touch. Interior design that rummages through the musty old trunks of Orientalism doesn't look as alluring as it did 15 years ago, and cooking that filters Asian flavors through a Western sensibility isn't automatically met with gales of excitement. Wayan, where Mr. Vongerichten's son, Cédric, is the chef, avoids both traps, I think. The restaurant is a tribute to Indonesia, the home of his wife and business partner, Ochi Vongerichten, and the site of two restaurants that he opened recently. (He is also the chef of Perry St. in Manhattan, which his father owns.) The scale is more personal and the cultural references are more specific at Wayan than at Spice Market and its kind. The menu is far from encyclopedic, but it is clear that Indonesia's cuisine has been given more than the quick glance that informs a lot of Asian fusion. Ms. Vongerichten works in the dining room, stopping by tables to offer explanations of the menu and how the cooking differs from that at some other Indonesian restaurants in New York, which she cheerfully calls \"more authentic.\" More than any other factor, she helps keep Wayan from turning into a junior version of one of her father-in-law's restaurants -- Young Vongerichtenstein. Servers will tell you to start with a stick or two of satay. You can, although the skewers are cooked on a flattop instead of a grill, and inconsistency is an issue. The pork skewers that are so appealingly juicy and savory with sweet soy one week can be scorched and bitter the next time you see them, and just ordinary the following week. (The pickled watermelon radishes on the side, though, are always terrific; they're brined with lime leaf.) The peanut sauce on chicken satay may hum with red curry and chiles, or may present as a sweet, inert blob. A more promising opening move, and one that will help place Cédric and Ochi Vongerichten's mental map of Indonesia in perspective, would be the Jimbaran-style clams. This is not a dish that is likely to have been stirred by generations of sainted grandmothers since the dawn of time. It is, in fact, a specialty of the seafood vendors who sprang up on a stretch of Balinese beach where resorts first began to appear sometime around the birth of Taylor Swift. Littlenecks, flavored with soy sauce and garlic paste, are grilled under flakes of coconut, which form the golden crust that would be provided by bread crumbs if these were clams oreganata. A slice of pickled red chile sits on each one, waiting. If you were on vacation, you would order tray after tray of these. Here on Spring Street, other things will keep you distracted. In the hearts-of-palm salad, sweet and sour are carefully pitted against each other by means of a mango vinaigrette, a lime-and-fish-sauce dressing and a neon coat of passion-fruit pulp. The crab cake is, despite its sweet chile sauce, about as Indonesian as Betty White, but it is fresh and fluffy and not worth arguing about. Wayan's rendition of the street snack bakwan jagung is a golden agglomeration of corn kernels and shallots fried into a flat, crunchy disc. There had better be nasi goreng at any restaurant that is even playing at being Indonesian. There is, the rice fried just until it crackles a bit between your teeth. It has a gentle but genuine spice undercurrent that would be welcome in more of the cooking. Of course there is a gado gado, and this being 2019, of course the main ingredient is avocado; the hard-cooked eggs belong to quail. This time the peanut dressing isn't cloying or clumpy. As the plates get larger, few dishes really come forward as the kind of knockout that everybody will talk about later. The closest contender must be the lobster and basil with wavy noodles in a sauce containing, among other things, sweet soy and melted butter -- a combination that the senior Mr. Vongerichten has used so successfully that it may be his son's inheritance. Should the calamansi vinaigrette poured over the steamed black sea bass be more sour and spicy? Probably. But if there are few stars on the table, the contrast of flavors, colors, textures and techniques makes the meal into a memorable ensemble piece. The drumsticks in yellow chicken are crunchy, and the thighs are tender; both are mellow with a yellow curry seasoned by lemongrass and ginger. The tomato-chile sambal pressed into the surface of cod \"bilindango\" is potent enough to carry over to the spears of asparagus and fiddlehead ferns sprawled alongside. All of this looks very come-hither in the dining room, where the Rockwell Group has abandoned stadium-size props, building atmospheric effects instead out of contrasting textures and light values and the movement of shadows. This is the visual language of expensive tropical resorts, and Wayan seems to give people the feeling they're on vacation. It is not necessarily a loud restaurant, but New Yorkers are a loud people, and around 10 the noise can start to press down. It is a good time to call for dessert. The purple-yam ice cream with banana cake and caramelized bananas is good if sundaes are your thing. The pandan custard under passion-fruit pulp gets a lot of mileage from just a few flavors. But the one that sounds too boring to bother with (\"assorted exotic fruit?\") is worth a second look. Lychee, mango, pineapple and dragon fruit may not be particularly exotic, but a dip or a dunk into a dark, spicy syrup of tamarind and palm sugar will wake them right up.

{"id": 49, "data": " Looking around Haenyeo's dining room one night in early March, I thought maybe Jenny Kwak's time has finally come. Her third restaurant, Haenyeo was about three months old and already filled with people who looked as if they'd been going there for years. It sits on a prime corner lot, on a stretch of Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that is rich in local minichains serving banh mi, burritos, lobster rolls and so on, to take out or eat in. Intimidating restaurants don't tend to prosper here. Very few people inside Haenyeo look the least bit intimidated as they lift grilled oysters by the shell to pour the dregs of hot seaweed butter over toast; or carve wedges of zucchini-scallion pancakes fried to a dark and satisfyingly rich brown; or stir mushrooms, squid, bean sprouts, steamed spinach and cabbage kimchi with a just-cracked egg into a bibimbap whose bottom layer of rice is golden and crunchy where it meets the hot stone bowl. The customers at Haenyeo seem to have an easy familiarity with Korean food. Some of them, at least, can probably thank Ms. Kwak for that. In 1992, when she began serving the cuisine in the East Village at her first restaurant, Dok Suni's, the words tteokbokki and seolleongtang and jajangmyeon did not roll off the tongues of most non-Koreans. But that's who she wanted to lure in with American music, date-night décor and Western-style service. Once she had them, she would tempt, teach, turn them on to the flavors she'd grown up with. Her mother, Myung Ja Kwak, shared cooking duties. Ms. Kwak's was not the take-it-or-leave-it approach of 32nd Street, and she kept at it. She wrote \"Dok Suni: Recipes From My Mother's Korean Kitchen,\" which was one of the few Korean cookbooks in English when it came out, in 1998. At her second restaurant, Do Hwa, she and her mother led customers deeper into unfamiliar ground. Each of the restaurants stayed open for about two decades, which is a very long time in New York. If you want a metaphor for how effectively Ms. Kwak paved the way for restaurants like Atoboy , Soogil, Danji and others whose chefs weave Korean cuisine into new patterns, consider that one of them, Oiji, moved into its address on First Avenue right after Dok Suni's moved out. What Ms. Kwak is doing in Park Slope isn't all that different from what she has done all her career, except that by now South Korean comfort food has become comfort food for New York in general. Haenyeo does pay more attention to seafood than Dok Suni or Do Hwa did, though. Ms. Kwak hasn't gone pescatarian on us. She still serves impressive pork and beef bulgogis with ssamjang and lettuce, and the pan-fried dumplings are filled with high-fat ground beef seasoned with kimchi, garlic and soy. But her menu's orientation has shifted slightly toward the ocean. This is good news, because the seafood at Haenyeo has a sparkle and sweetness you don't always find in the smoke-filled rooms of 32nd Street. A bibimbap variant may be the menu's sleeper dish, partly because it starts out looking like a lunch bowl from Sweetgreen. It is a version of hwe dup bap. At first you just see raw tuna, shredded romaine and perilla leaves, grated carrots and cucumber, and strips of seaweed. Hidden underneath is warm rice. But there is a pink mound of spicy cod roe in the bowl, too, with cured salmon eggs and a few lobes of sea urchin. Both of them will break apart as you stir, bringing their distinct saltwater intonations to the rice and vegetables. What the menu calls \"white fish fillets\" -- pan-fried cod with rings of scallion showing through their thin gold sheet of egg batter, otherwise known as saeng seon jeon -- is so modestly named it might get overlooked; it shouldn't. The menu plays Don't Mind Me again with \"mackerel, grilled or braised.\" Just get the mackerel, because the kitchen knows how to cook it, whether over a flame or in a dark, smoky pan of garlic and gochujang. In truth, the kitchen seems to know how to cook every kind of seafood, although perhaps it could come with a better partner for the fried scallops than the sweet, yellowish tartar sauce with corn in it. The walls are hung with photographs of Korean women in wet suits. These are the haenyeo of Jeju island , who dive up to 30 feet deep for conch, abalone and seaweed while holding their breath for several minutes at a time. The money they made diving is probably the reason parts of Jeju have a matriarchal family structure. Naming the restaurant after them, Ms. Kwak continues a theme started with Dok Suni's, which means \"strong women's.\" One dish that seems out of place is a revival of Dok Suni's fried chicken. Was the batter always so pasty and airless? That's not how I remember it, but it's possible my standards have changed as Korean fried chicken has infiltrated nearly every part of town over the past decade. In any case, there is better chicken to seek out here, not just the home-style dokdoritang stewed in chile sauce but also the wings. Haenyeo double-fries wings that have been dipped in potato starch, then coats them with a fine version of a yangnyeom chile sauce, tangier and a little less sweet than some. When Ms. Kwak detours from the Korean straight and narrow, consider traipsing along behind her. You may wind up having beignets for dessert, buried under a fresh coat of powdered sugar in the best Café du Monde style. (This and the grilled oysters may betray the hand of her business partner, Terrence Segura, who is from New Orleans. He is also her husband.) Or you may follow her all the way to the joyous rice cake fundido, which starts out as tteokbokki in chile sauce and becomes totally atypical through the addition of chorizo, sliced jalapeños and a melted, browned topcoat of Oaxacan cheese that comes up in long, stretchy strings when you pull on it. It is, in all likelihood, the best Tex-Mex dish in New York. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 50, "data": " In 2012 and 2013, when people were lining up at Smorgasburg and then on the second floor of the Houston Street Whole Foods Market for biodegradable bowls of Yuji Haraguchi's mazemen -- noodles that might be dressed with crisped twigs of bacon and a jiggling onsen egg, say, or yuzu-cured salmon and some Camembert soft enough to transform into a sauce -- I was sure the crowds would multiply and fan out, demanding more of this strange brothless ramen. And they did, in a sense. Soon Mr. Haraguchi had established his own free-standing establishment, Yuji Ramen in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where he serves that bacon-and-egg mazemen along with his possibly visionary \"tunakotsu\" ramen. In 2014, when Ivan Orkin came to New York , he brought along his own mazemen recipes. Over the next few years mazemen turned up in other restaurants, too, but all of them remained better known for soup ramen, and sold more of it. It began to look as if mazemen would never be more than a sideshow act, the one-armed ax-catcher of the ramen circus. Then at the start of the year, the chef Shigetoshi Nakamura, who operates an intimate ramen shop on the Lower East Side, opened an annex next door that is dedicated to mazemen. All the seating at this new place, Niche , is at a dozen or so stools arranged around one long, narrow table. When the dining room is fully occupied, the only way to get from one end to the other is to walk sideways while holding your breath and picking up all the coats that you are going to knock off their wall pegs as you go. Not that there is much reason to roam around. Orders are taken from and delivered to the table, and there is no public restroom on the premises. As is the case next door at Nakamura, seats by the window offer a close-up view of the stone walls that support the last few yards of the Williamsburg Bridge before it empties onto Delancey Street. Before he came to New York, Mr. Nakamura was already well known in Tokyo, where he proved to have a theatrical streak. Before filling a bowl with noodles, he would yank them from the boiling water with his left hand and then hold them high in the air for a few seconds, letting them drain while standing completely motionless. Suddenly he would drop his arm and the basket would plunge toward the water again, before stopping just in time and getting one quick, emphatic shake. When Mr. Nakamura was immortalized as one of four \"ramen gods\" in a set of Hello Kitty notepads and phone straps, Kitty was posed with her left paw raised high in emulation of the Nakamura Shake. If Mr. Nakamura has been practicing his choreography on the spaghetti-like, crinkly noodles at Niche, I haven't seen it yet. The Nakamura Shake seems designed to extract cooking water as quickly as possible before the noodles cool, and temperature is not especially critical in mazemen. The idea of noodle soup without the soup has been on the loose in Japan for decades. Broth is the most expensive and labor-intensive part of a bowl of ramen; in the 1950s, a Tokyo noodle shop, in the pitiless logic of the restaurant business, began omitting the broth when ladling out noodles at staff meals, or so the story goes. This \"abura soba\" -- oil noodle, because it was moistened with lard along with the seasoning sauce called tare -- wasn't half bad, so it went on the menu at a discounted price. As an even cheaper version of an already cheap and filling meal, abura soba was quickly embraced, especially by students. As food ideas tend to do in Japan, it evolved rapidly. Today, abura soba tends to refer to dry soups that have more or less the same toppings you'd find in a bowl of normal ramen, while mazemen generally has toppings that are rarely seen in soup and often would not respond well to being submerged in hot liquid. There is Italian-style mazemen, with anchovies, salami, olives and tomatoes. Some mazemen shops specialize in fried beef cutlets. At a Tokyo restaurant called Beefst , the centerpiece of each bowl is sliced roast beef, served rare. Mr. Nakamura has an answer to that: steak mazemen. The steak is rib-eye, in cubes that have been browned with a kitchen torch. When you stir them with the noodles and a smooth, creamy spoonful of something the menu simply calls \"pork sauce,\" their juices and flecks of char flavor the whole bowl. Plain spinach and fermented bamboo, meanwhile, keep the total effect from being queasy-making. Novel, straightforward, refined, unruly and impure of heart, steak mazemen has the makings of a classic New York dish. So does the duck, a common special. A sliced breast of moulard duck cooked to a deep violet-pink, it is served with a bright, focused sauce built on soy and enough warm duck juices to lubricate the whole-wheat noodles. It is not an austere dish by any means, but it is balanced and restrained. The same cannot be said for another special that is always offered on the same nights: a bowl of liquefied foie gras topped with pistachios and truffle oil. It is not clear what will happen to anyone who tries to eat this with a spoon, but the prognosis does not seem good. Instead, everybody orders it with the duck mazemen and dips the noodles into the foie gras, after which conscious thought tends to stop for a minute or two. When cerebral activity resumes, you might wonder why the sauce doesn't come with its own noodles. No other mazemen is such a joy ride, but the vaguely Italian one with tomatoes, mushrooms, kombu and an angry red soak of chile oil is not the kind of thing you want to turn your back on. Even the tribute to Russ & Daughters , where the noodles are coated with spicy cod roe and the topping is sliced smoked salmon, can sneak up on you. Niche is one of the few ramen-yas in town where the appetizers are worth noticing. Sea urchin perched on tiny corners of toast is a strange and awkward affair, but the sardines on toast, dressed with chile flakes, are very good, as are the raw scallops with yuzu juice and the avocado salad showered with tempura flakes. Should fries be an appetizer? Maybe not, particularly Niche's \"umami kombu fries,\" which have been sprinkled with powdered shio kombu until they are almost subliminally green. Apart from the color, they look like the fries at McDonald's. The difference is that the shio kombu makes them almost diabolically hard to stop eating. And if you don't eat them before the mazemen arrives, then when will you? Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 51, "data": " Nothing about the appearance of the Cornish game hen at Blue Smoke screams, \"I am the best thing you will eat today!\" It looks a bit like a deflated football that somebody punctured with a pair of sticks and dragged through the mud. In fact, in Blue Smoke's attempt to bring together the barbecued game hen of Cozy Corner , in Memphis, with the fried hot chicken of places like Prince's, in Nashville, the bird has been through a good deal more than that. The process goes like this, approximately : spatchcocked, brined, rubbed with spices, smoked, chilled, dunked in a frothy batter, tossed in seasoned flour, deep fried, dipped in spicy oil and sprinkled with four kinds of ground pepper. \"Just a little pop-pop dust right on top\" is how Jean-Paul Bourgeois, Blue Smoke's chef, describes the last step. \"That introduction of fresh chile onto that fried chicken, it just brings the zing.\" Then came one final touch, he said: \"a little swirlybird of Tabasco hot honey.\" Handily, this can all be shortened to smoked, fried hen when you order ($24 at the Battery Park City location and $26 on East 27th Street). But you'll know there's more to it when your jaw smashes through the dark crust with a sonic boom; when the particular forms of heat contributed by habanero, black pepper, Sichuan peppercorn, Aleppo pepper, cayenne and Tabasco sauce all start to pile up and reverberate like My Bloody Valentine guitar chords ; when the meat gives up juices that swirl with wood smoke.

{"id": 52, "data": " I'm starting to think the American cult of chef worship may really be on the way out. At the very least, it has paused to catch its breath. Since the seven-story food court in Hudson Yards was unveiled last month, the public reaction has been somewhere between shrug and ugh. Attitudes may improve as visitors eat their way to the top floor. So far, though, the response hasn't come close to matching the greeting bestowed on the restaurants at Time Warner Center in 2004, even though the project represents the same basic idea executed by the same developer with at least one of the same chefs, Thomas Keller . Even more striking has been the low-key reception to Rocco DiSpirito's return. Late last year Mr. DiSpirito took over the kitchen at Standard Grill in the meatpacking district. At one point, when he was the chef at both Union Pacific and Rocco's on 22nd while starring in a television show, he was arguably the most famous chef in the country. Then both places closed, and the show was canceled. Mr. DiSpirito has not been in charge of a restaurant since George W. Bush was in the White House. For that matter, it has been some years since Standard Grill itself has done anything noteworthy. In 2009, when it was new and Dan Silverman was the chef, I reviewed it, gave it one star and then lost track of it. In other words, the selection of Mr. DiSpirito did not just come out of left field. It came from the weeds across the street from the parking lot behind left field. For surprise value alone, it should have been one of the year's most buzzed-about news items. But the trumpets have been muted, and the back handsprings seem to lack a certain bounce. This, at least, is the view from outside the restaurant. Once you're sitting at one of the tables -- newly topped with leather pads in a major retrofitting that has made the dining room look like an expensive cabaret, blue velvet and all -- you will hear quite a lot of talk about Mr. DiSpirito, or as they call him here, Chef Rocco. Chef Rocco, you learn, conceived each dish on the menu so that it can be eaten by one person or shared with others. No, I didn't believe it at first, either, but apparently it's true: Rocco DiSpirito invented food. There is also something that servers call Chef Rocco's Game Changing Toast, although sometimes they shorten it to Rocco's Game Changing or simply Game Changing, as in \"Here's a little more Game Changing for you.\" The item in question is a toasted, cracker-thin slice of bread made of nuts, oats, seeds and psyllium-seed husks held together without benefit of wheat flour. Like nearly everything on the menu, it is free of gluten. Being mostly made of browned nuts, it is also delicious. Whether it is truly Rocco's is up for debate. It seems to strongly resemble the Life-Changing Loaf of Bread recipe that Sarah Britton published on her blog, \"My New Roots,\" in 2013, and that appeared on another blog two years later, with minor changes, as Game Changing Nut & Seed Bread . It's one of the items that reflect Mr. DiSpirito's recent obsession with nutrient-dense dietary supplements , although the way it keeps coming up in the servers' patter makes you wonder if Mr. DiSpirito spent too much time as a QVC pitchman. Anyway, somebody-or-other's toast sits under the smoked gravlax, red with beet juice and very silky on its bed of coconut crème fraîche, that Mr. DiSpirito sends out as an amuse. A plate of the toast will also appear if you order the platter of acorn-fed, hand-sliced Ibérico ham or the chilled Maine sea urchins served on the spiky half-shell. Either one will convince you that Mr. DiSpirito knows how to get his hands on raw materials that can stun with almost no assistance. The best things at Standard Grill, and there are quite a lot of them, depend on very good ingredients touched as little as possible. Back in the Union Pacific days, Mr. DiSpirito's interest in East Asian cuisines came out in the form of complex preparations, arcane ingredients and out-of-nowhere juxtapositions. Now he seems to have moved on to the luxury minimalism of an omakase sushi chef, a style that was foreshadowed by the only Union Pacific dish he's brought back, bay scallops and sea urchin with a few throat-searing drops of mustard oil. Standard Grill's ice-cold cubes of bluefin chu-toro stirred with golden osetra caviar, meanwhile, could have come straight out of Masa , while the yellowfin tartare, barely dressed with crushed macadamias and freshly grated wasabi, is like one of the better items at Tetsu . Each night there are half a dozen or so skewers cooked over Japanese charcoal and wheeled to the table on a mini-grill the size of a toaster oven. Speared on a stick might be fantastic small scallops out of Peconic Bay; a feathery mop of maitake mushrooms; buttery chicken livers with barely a hint of bitterness; or firefly squid, a little bigger than a fava bean and grilled whole so they can be swallowed guts and all. Again, the ingredients are exceptional. The skewers look simple enough, but they are all, you learn, brushed with \"a little sauce Chef Rocco came up with to complement the charcoal.\" The sauce for seafood involves coconut nectar and lemongrass, and what it actually does is put you, vaguely and pleasantly, in mind of Thailand. While I am one of those increasingly stooped and wizened diners who remembers, in detail, Mr. DiSpirito's cooking at Union Pacific, far more people recall him as the meatball-pushing antihero of \"The Restaurant,\" an NBC series about Rocco's on 22nd, an actual (and doomed, it turned out) Italian-American restaurant. The show, which debuted in 2003, was a pioneer in the genre of cooking-focused reality television, although when everybody started suing everybody else, it became clear it was a pioneer in the way the members of the Donner Party were pioneers. The handful of Italian dishes at Standard Grill may be meant for \"Restaurant\" fans. Neither of the two pastas showed Mr. DiSpirito at his best, but a chewy risotto with red shrimp and what seemed like half a dozen forms of black truffles may make you understand why Ruth Reichl started her 1998 Times review of Union Pacific with a woman moaning at the next table. Standard Grill's Norwegian salmon on an ivory puddle of vegan cashew sauce won't inspire the same reaction, but the steaks might; they are dry-aged until ripe, and earn their deep-brown crust over extremely hot Japanese charcoal. Given what Mr. DiSpirito is capable of doing with a piece of halibut and some goose fat, I can't quite believe that I'm recommending the rib-eye over the seafood, but I am. It may be that Mr. DiSpirito knows exactly what he is doing. Simplicity is the whole point of a grill, which is first cousin to the steakhouse. He has also designed a menu so straightforward that if, after a respectable period of time, he is no longer in the kitchen, the food quality can stay roughly the same as long as the hotel doesn't argue about ingredient costs. The Standard has not left the restaurant's fate entirely in his hands, either; besides redecorating, it hired a maître d'hôtel, Michael Cecchi-Azzolina, away from Le Coucou ; he is hard at work building an audience every night, handing out old-school business cards to old-school producers, chefs and publishers, sitting down to chat with Brooke Shields and Ms. Reichl. Standard Grill is so much better than it used to be, and so much better than almost any restaurant serving a comparable menu of grilled meats and chilled seafood, that it's foolish to wish for the return of the same Mr. DiSpirito who gave us Union Pacific. It's a little bit as if Barbra Streisand had returned to Broadway, and then sang all her songs in a whisper sitting on the edge of the stage. It might not be what you had been waiting for, but you'd watch. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 53, "data": " Over the years, I have eaten many bowls of pasta with clams that have been rewired by a chef who was trying to stand out. But I had not come across one that made as much sense to me as the big, sloshing platters you get at old-line Italian-American clam bars like Randazzo's until tripping into a new Greenwich Village restaurant called Babs this summer. Mind you, virtually the only Italian thing about the tagliatelle with clams at Babs was the tagliatelle. The sauce was a mustard beurre blanc, one of those French sauces that all culinary-school students are supposed to be able to make in their sleep. Mustard beurre blanc is often found providing a decorous yellow veil over a chicken breast or salmon fillet. It is not normally poured over noodles. But, tossed with salty French ham and Manila clams smaller than a thumbprint, it made a strangely exciting bowl of pasta that was much more coherent than it sounds. Once I got to know Babs better, I understood that strange excitement is what it does best. Its chef, Efrén Hernández, has talked about Babs as a European grill, and many of the dishes are seared over hot charcoal, but he has a wider frame of reference than that. He was raised in Southern California by immigrants from Mexico, and Mexican cuisine runs through his menu like an underground stream that sometimes gurgles up to the surface. Mr. Hernández is not particularly interested in fusion, though; as far as I can tell, he likes rubbing cultures together to see what color the sparks will be. See, for example, what the menu calls divorced sea bream, a handsome dish that would be splashed around Instagram even more frequently than it already is if the dining tables were lighted by ceiling pinspots rather than disco-era chrome globes that look as if they were salvaged from Regine's . The bream is split, and one side brushed with a red sauce and the other with a green sauce, before it is grilled over charcoal. The dish is an allusion to the two-tone pescado a la talla served at Contramar in Mexico City, itself derived from huevos divorciados, a breakfast of two fried eggs beneath two contrasting salsas. In Mr. Hernández's kitchen, though, the red adobo at Contramar is replaced by a Catalan romesco, and the parsley salsa becomes a French pistou. But surely the tortilla on its own plate off to one side brings it back to Mexico? Not so fast. According to the menu, it is a taloa, a Basque cornmeal cake that cooks from Bayonne to Bilbao have been griddling for centuries. The taloa at Babs is tender, smooth and floral. Mr. Hernández has been cooking at Babs since it opened in July. He is also the chef at Mimi , a French restaurant a block away that is owned by the same people (Daniel Bennett, his brother Evan, and Louis Levy; they named Babs and Mimi after their grandmothers.) I haven't been back to Mimi since Liz Johnson was the chef . She was aiming for a style that was at once brawny and lavish, and since taking over last year Mr. Hernández has seemed to continue in that vein while bringing his far-ranging curiosity to bear. As they did at Mimi, the owners have planted a small curved bar right by the door at Babs. The cocktails stirred and shaken there are mostly recognizable relatives of classics, like a martini made with two brands of gin. There's something charmingly self-deprecating about a cocktail list that includes Mount Gay and tonic, which seasoned barflies know as one of the drinks you can safely order in dives that don't do anything else right. The wine list, meanwhile, is mostly French and sticks to the old guard; you can tell it's not trying especially hard to be cool by the way it has just one orange wine, lumped in with the sparkling wines. Only the wine geeks will wish for more, but the rest of us might wish there were as many bottles costing around $50 as there are in the $90 range. The numbers on the menu can sneak up on you, too. My $48 lobster was a small creature that couldn't have weighed much more than a pound. The server brightly suggested dunking its tomalley into the smoked potato purée, and I would have tried it if I had found any tomalley. And while I can imagine happily paying $36 for Babs's lamb chops, I'd want them to be served with something more compelling than the cold, underseasoned \"Basque potato salad\" into which some baby sardines had apparently disappeared without a trace. But there is nothing wrong with the charcoal-grilled swordfish with mint salsa verde, fennel and green olives, and if you ordered the chicken andouille this summer you found Mr. Hernández knocking cuisines together again, this time with a corn-and-chanterelles risotto under a slow-burning splash of Calabrian chile oil. He shows how well he can work in small strokes with a layered appetizer of raw sea scallops, sweet potato purée and trout roe, seasoned with a briny and fascinating salsa of chopped cucumbers, seaweed and fermented serrano chiles; or the fried cod cheeks, tender and crunchy over an orange slick of romesco aioli. Mr. Hernández's imagination fights against predictability. A crab salad, for instance, doesn't need to be interesting if it is fresh, but the one at Babs is both. It's seasoned with a gribiche that's full of chopped fresh dill, and then it's piled up in a big beehive on top of a smoked potato pancake. Like many small restaurants these days, Babs doesn't offer many desserts, but the ones it does are far more intriguing than average. A fine apple galette is improved by a grating of Swiss-style cheese from Edelweiss Creamery in Wisconsin and by a drizzle of 20-year-old Pedro Ximénez sherry, thick as syrup and tasting like chocolate and coffee. Why sherry with Swiss cheese? I don't know, but Mr. Hernández does. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 54, "data": " I can count on Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn to produce certain sensations at every meal. There is the insistent smell of broiled dry-aged steak that hits me the minute I open the door and sometimes sooner, while I'm still outside on the South Williamsburg sidewalk, producing a raised pulse, a quickening of the senses and a restlessness familiar to anyone who has seen a tiger that has just heard the approach of the lunch bucket. There is the hiss of butter and melted tallow as they slide down the hot platter, past the sliced porterhouse or rib steak and their charred bones, to make a pool at one end. The server will spoon some of this sizzling fat over the meat he has just plated, generally with some line like \"Here are your vitamins.\" There is the thunk of a bowl filled with schlag landing on a bare wood table when dessert is served, and soon after, the softer tap-tap-tap of waxy chocolate coins in gold foil dropped one at a time on top of the check. And after I've paid, there is the unshakable sense that I've been scammed. The last sensation was not part of the Peter Luger experience when I started eating there, in the 1990s. I was acutely aware of the cost back then because I would settle the tab by counting out $20 bills; cash was the only way to pay unless you had a Peter Luger credit card. At the end of the night my wallet would be empty. Because a Peter Luger steak made me feel alive in a way that few other things did, I considered this a fair trade, although I could afford it only once a year or so. I don't remember when the doubts began, but they grew over time. Diners who walk in the door eager to hand over literal piles of money aren't greeted; they're processed. A host with a clipboard looks for the name, or writes it down and quotes a waiting time. There is almost always a wait, with or without a reservation, and there is almost always a long line of supplicants against the wall. A kind word or reassuring smile from somebody on staff would help the time pass. The smile never comes. The Department of Motor Vehicles is a block party compared with the line at Peter Luger. [ Sign up for Sam Sifton's Cooking newsletter for recipes, food writing and culinary inspiration. ] The management seems to go out of its way to make things inconvenient. Customers at the bar have to order drinks from the bartender and food from an overworked server on the other side of the bar, and then pay two separate checks and leave two separate tips. And they can't order lunch after 2:30 p.m., even though the bar and the kitchen remain open. Since its last, two-star review in the Times , written by Frank Bruni in 2007, the restaurant has started taking online reservations. It accepts debit cards, too, which is nice. But the credit card you use to buy a cortado at the cafe or a bag of chips at the bodega will still not buy you a meal at Peter Luger. The servers, who once were charmingly brusque, now give the strong impression that these endless demands for food and drink are all that's standing between them and a hard-earned nap. Signals that a customer has a question or request don't get picked up as quickly; the canned jokes about spinach and schlag don't flow as freely. Some things are the same as ever. The shrimp cocktail has always tasted like cold latex dipped in ketchup and horseradish. The steak sauce has always tasted like the same ketchup and horseradish fortified by corn syrup. Although the fries are reasonably crisp, their insides are mealy and bland in a way that fresh-cut potatoes almost certainly would not be. The sole -- yes, I'm the person who ordered the sole at Peter Luger -- was strangely similar: The bread crumbs on top were gold and crunchy, but the fish underneath was dry and almost powdery. Was the Caesar salad always so drippy, the croutons always straight out of a bag, the grated cheese always so white and rubbery? I know there was a time the German fried potatoes were brown and crunchy, because I eagerly ate them each time I went. Now they are mushy, dingy, gray and sometimes cold. I look forward to them the way I look forward to finding a new, irregularly shaped mole. [ Readers respond to the Pete Wells review of Peter Luger .] Lunch one afternoon vividly demonstrated the kitchen's inconsistency: I ordered a burger, medium-rare, at the bar. So had the two people sitting to my right, it turned out. One of them got what we'd all asked for, a midnight-dark crust giving way to an evenly rosy interior so full of juices it looked like it was ready to cry. The other one got a patty that was almost completely brown inside. I got a weird hybrid, a burger whose interior shaded from nearly perfect on one side to gray and hard on the other. The same issue afflicted a medium-rare porterhouse I was served one night: The fillet was ideal but the other side of the T-bone, the strip, ranged from medium-rare to medium-well. I could live with this; big cuts of meat don't always cook evenly. What gnaws at me every time I eat a Luger porterhouse is the realization that it's just another steak, and far from the best New York has to offer. [ Melissa Clark shows you how to cook a steak at home . ] Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, can put a formidable crust on both sides of the cut; Luger caramelizes the top side only, while the underside is barely past raw, as if it had done all its cooking on the hot platter. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, buy beef that is tender, richly marbled and deeply flavorful; at Luger, you get the first two but not the third. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, age that beef to make flavor grow and intensify and double back on itself; dry-aging at Luger still results in a tender steak, but it rarely achieves a hypnotic or compelling or even very interesting one. But those other restaurants are not Peter Luger, as Friedrich Nietzsche might have said. \"When in this essay I declare war upon Wagner,\" Nietzsche wrote in \" The Case of Wagner ,\" \"the last thing I want to do is start a celebration for any other musicians. Other musicians don't count compared to Wagner.\" I could say the same thing about other steakhouses -- compared to Peter Luger, they don't count. Luger is not the city's oldest, but it's the one in which age, tradition, superb beef, blistering heat, an instinctive avoidance of anything fancy and an immensely attractive self-assurance came together to produce something that felt less like a restaurant than an affirmation of life, or at least life as it is lived in New York City. This sounds ridiculously grand. Years ago I thought it was true, though, and so did other people. The restaurant will always have its loyalists. They will laugh away the prices, the $16.95 sliced tomatoes that taste like 1979, the $229.80 porterhouse for four. They will say that nobody goes to Luger for the sole, nobody goes to Luger for the wine, nobody goes to Luger for the salad, nobody goes to Luger for the service.

{"id": 55, "data": " Tsismis is the opposite of a speakeasy. It isn't hiding anything; its glass facade on Orchard Street wants to strike up a conversation so badly that it almost follows you home. The windows are stenciled with cartoon characters and with text-message bubbles that call out in English (\"Hello! New York\"), Spanish (\"que rico!\"), French (\"bon appétit\") and Tagalog (\"masarap,\" for delicious). The language lessons continue on the front door, which gives translations for \"tuloy po kayo\" (welcome) and the restaurant's name (gossip), pronounced chiss-miss. In case you miss all of this, a sandwich board straddles the sidewalk, advertising discounted beer, wine and wings at the bar during happy hour (\"5:thirsty\"). If you accept the facade's invitation to benaquitodits (come here here, a repetitive bit of Tagalog slang), the conversation will continue inside. Tsismis, which opened in June, is a chatty restaurant. At times, when one of the owners pulls up alongside your table and expounds on how the chef's interpretation of the dish you're trying to eat differs from what you might find in the Philippines, you may find yourself eyeing the exit. If you've found your way to the menu's strengths, though, odds are you won't want to go anywhere. Kinilaw, a Filipino ceviche in a piercingly sour calamansi and cane vinegar marinade with a jab of bird's-eye chile, is worth sticking around for, especially on those nights when it's made with bay scallops instead of fish. After that, you might look into the fried pork-and-carrot won tons called pinsec frito (or, as the menu has them, pinsit frito). They are typically folded into triangles, but the ones at Tsismis are twisted into little cones that look like Hershey's kisses, though slightly bigger and golden-brown. Once they stop steaming, you can hold them by the cowlick of fried wrapper at the top and swish them around in the sweet chile sauce. Won tons with the same filling flop around in the soup called pancit molo, although these are boiled. There is almost as much ground pork inside them as outside in the broth, which is thick with garlic and chopped scallions. Even if it's well after 5:thirsty and you're not sitting at the bar, Jappy's wings are worth considering. Jappy is the chef, Jappy Afzelius, and he fries those wings with thinly sliced garlic and sends them out to the dining room with a salsa of raw mangoes, charred onions and chiles. The heat of the salsa will not cause your shirt to burst into flames, but it is hot enough to make your memory of Jappy's wings a lasting one. Mr. Afzelius is a native of the Philippines and a graduate of a cooking academy in Manila, which shipped him off to Paris to intern in one of Alain Ducasse's bistros. The Ducasse masterminds then sent him to work at Benoit in New York, after which he turned up as the sous-chef at a Filipino restaurant in Brooklyn that was best known for its $100 doughnut -- ube-filled, Cristal-frosted and gold-leafed. Happily, nothing at Tsismis approaches that level of look-at-me desperation. Mr. Afzelius's cooking is loose, unfussy and liberated. He tosses tradition under the bus when it suits him. The result is Filipino-American drinking food that tends to be charmingly offhand. From time to time, it can lean toward sloppiness. One night the fried milkfish in pritong isda was so overdone that even topping it with calamansi juice, fish sauce and a crisp, juicy spoonful of marinated chayote on top didn't revive it. A version of adobong manok, which Mr. Afzelius makes as a roasted chicken plus a soy-turmeric sauce rather than an all-in-one stew, would have been more successful if the smoked eggplant hadn't been so undercooked it squeaked. But the grilled eggplant on top of the kare-kare was as soft as warm marrow, and the other vegetables -- crisp green beans, bok choy, enoki mushrooms -- made a refreshing counterpoint to the stewed oxtails in thick peanut sauce. Already pungent with shrimp paste, the kare-kare comes with extra on the side that you can add to your heart's content. As they do at Bad Saint in Washington, probably the country's most talked-about Filipino restaurant, Tsismis makes its laing by simmering local kale, rather than the more traditional taro leaves, in coconut milk. And if this version doesn't have the perspective-altering funk of Bad Saint's, it still draws plenty of depth from the shrimp paste and smoked fish in the milk and the big handful of dried baby shrimp dropped on top. By this point, you will probably want to have a glass in your hand. Housemade calamansi soda sounds lovely, but mine was a little flat and weak. In lieu of hard spirits, sake is the backbone of most of the cocktails. They are typically fleshed out with half a dozen other ingredients -- vermouth, Aperol, artichoke liqueur and bitters, in the case of the A La Bira -- which sound at first as if they had been assembled by walking through a liquor store blindfolded, but which after a closer look reveal a degree of inner logic. If this does not pique your curiosity, the list of wines by the glass is almost long enough to qualify Tsismis as a wine bar, although the choices are not as outré as they are across the street at Wildair . In a city crazy for kakigori , patbingsu and other varieties of flavored snow, Tsismis's halo-halo will probably be an instant hit. Mr. Afzelius has the very good idea of putting coconut sorbet where the shaved ice would usually go; from there he goes to town with coconut jellies and what seems like every fresh fruit he can put his hands on. But discerning collectors of Filipino sweets should note that Tsismis serves excellent silvanas. A silvana is either a shrunken cake or a cookie with big ideas, depending on your perspective. It is made of two cashew meringues that are sandwiched together with buttercream and then painted with more buttercream, which holds cashew crumbs to the outside of the whole package. Once frosted and crumbed, it has to be refrigerated or the buttercream will melt before it gets inside your mouth. No gold leaf adorns the silvanas. It would only get in the way.

{"id": 56, "data": " For a long time, the seriousness of a pizzeria could be gauged by a simple yes-or-no question: Did it sell pizza by the slice? The ones that cared the most about upholding traditions, maintaining quality and so on -- like Totonno's , John's of Bleecker Street , Kesté , Lucali , Una Pizza Napoletana -- emphatically did not. Today, we live in the era of the elevated slice joint. Some of them, like Scarr's , grind wheat berries into new flour every day. Many use minuscule quantities of yeast; others abandon commercial yeast altogether in favor of the natural leavening in sourdough starters. There are slice joints that ferment their dough for a day, some that let it bubble away for two days and a few that go in for three days. A new example of the breed, F&F Pizzeria , opened in Brooklyn last week with the help of a baker whose starter dough has traveled internationally and another baker who has decades of experience at the end of a pizza paddle. Among themselves, these new-school pizza makers speak of hydration levels, fermentation periods and digestibility. Many of these slice masters are chasing an ideal version of the foldable, portable triangle sold across linoleum counters in all five boroughs, a search suffused with nostalgia for an era before processed cheese, sweetened sauce and wholesale dough. Others are celebrated for achievements in the square slice, a descendant of the Sicilian, with an airier, less doughy crust; leaders in this style include Corner Slice and Mama's Too . Perhaps the smallest group of all are the bakers who turn their eyes toward Rome, where the slices are rectangular and are known as pizza al taglio. They resemble focaccia more than a $3 slice from Ray's , and it's doubtful that the practitioners of this style even think of themselves as belonging to the elevated-slice movement. But I'd argue that they do belong to it, and that some of the most elevated slices in the area at the moment are the Roman-style ones that Bread and Salt sells inside its bakery and restaurant on Palisade Avenue, up in the Jersey City Heights. At any given time, three to six pizzas sit on the counter. They are oblong and, because they are baked without a pan to shape the dough, they have rounded corners, like a horse track. The crust is noticeably lightweight when you pick it up, an impression that is confirmed by the mouth and, later, the stomach. The interior is honeycombed with air pockets. The underside of each slice is strong enough to carry a relatively heavy load of toppings without bending or collapsing. This structural soundness is key to the pleasure. The toppings on a Bread and Salt slice are not decorations or seasonings, as they often are on round pizza. Each one is the point of its slice: a mix of fresh mushrooms with pepper, parsley and flecks of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano; zucchini shaved into fine threads and showered at the last minute with mint leaves; slices of late-summer red and yellow peppers picked while they still had few faintly bitter streaks of green reaching up their sides; a rough, dark pesto spooned around cherry tomatoes that were roasted until their skins turned black and pulled away from the globes of pulp inside; Concord grapes that blotch the dough with purple like exploded jelly grenades. A chef's hand is at work here, tossing black pepper and rosemary over the grape pizza, adding salt and excellent Sicilian olive oil to the tomato pulp, and hammering basil and hazelnuts for the pesto in a mortar. The hand belongs to Rick Easton, who oversees the pizzas and the nonpizzas and owns the restaurant. He also owned its predecessor, the Bread and Salt that operated in Pittsburgh for all of 2015 plus a few weeks on either side. For a short-lived place, it got a lot of media attention, luring restaurant hunters and recipe gatherers from across the country. By the start of 2016, he had decided to move to New York City. When his first job fell through, he began shopping for a location for Bread and Salt. The real estate market had ideas of its own, as it often does, which is how the incarnation of Bread and Salt that Mr. Easton opened early this summer wound up in New Jersey. In addition to cheaper rents, Jersey City has ordinances that allow customers to show up with bottles of wine or beer and drink them, a handy policy because Bread and Salt's beverage list has nothing more potent than Italian sodas and sparkling water. Each night's menu, written in chalk on a blackboard next to the counter where you order, contains at least as many things that are not pizza as things that are. Generally these other items are modest in size and trattoria-ish in spirit; prepared ahead of time, they need at most five minutes in the oven before a cook will arrange them on a board and carry them to one of the 25 or so seats. I wish the tripe stewed in spicy tomato sauce, the way Romans do it, were available all the time. It is not, but the meatballs almost always are, and they are wonderful, made with enough bread that they are extremely tender in a bright marinara. Another reliable find is a sandwich of some kind, made with plain, untopped pizza. Twice I've had a warm mortadella sandwich there, and both times I was convinced there was no way to improve on it. One dish was denoted on the menu by a single word: beans. I've thought of it nearly every day since, partly because the beans -- scarlet runners -- were perfectly intact but perfectly tender; partly because of the brooding depth they took on from being finished with sweet red peppers that the kitchen dried and fried, an ingredient the Italians call peperoni cruschi; and partly because their broth tasted so good when given a chance to soak into the slice of thick-crusted sourdough bread that came on top. That bread is Mr. Easton's, too. It comes with a lot of things, and it is excellent. Bread and Salt is still settling into New Jersey. Some ingredients may be better when Mr. Easton has had time to infiltrate the local farm scene. In August, when the state was rolling in juicy peaches, he was serving crunchy unripe ones in red wine for dessert. There was also a very strange cantaloupe pudding. By September things were looking up; one day there was a scoop of Tristar strawberry sorbet served with anise-seed-flecked polenta gelato, both made by Superiority Burger. (Mr. Easton is friendly with that restaurant's owner, Brooks Headley , and helped devise the recipe for the focaccia Superiority Burger serves on Fridays.) Although Mr. Easton has a handful of employees, Bread and Salt has some of the blind spots of a one-person operation. It is not the easiest restaurant to communicate with, having an Instagram account but no website or phone. On a recent Sunday, when the restaurant was supposed to open at 1 p.m., a sign on the front door announced that it would be delayed until 1:30. That was the last communiqué; the doors were not unlocked until 2. But Mr. Easton has a singular vision, and it is the reason the food is so compelling. Looking around at the place, you're not sure how it can keep going like this. But then the plates start to come out of the kitchen and you don't want them ever to stop.

{"id": 57, "data": " Last month I had dinner with a friend who lives a thousand miles away and doesn't get to Manhattan as often as he once did. When I asked where he wanted to eat, he answered, a bit wistfully, \"Somewhere that speaks of New York, a city I have lost touch with.\" At first, I looked for a place where we could be in the thick of it all. I thought of Bar Pisellino , that narrow glass sarcophagus run by Rita Sodi and Jody Williams, where you drink your sgroppino standing up between the window along Grove Street and the one along Seventh Avenue. People trickle in, eat some olives and a tuna tramezzino, and head out again. Although it's about the size of a subway car, you get the feeling that if you stayed long enough, you'd eventually see everybody you know. But a restaurant that truly speaks of the place New York has become over the past decade or so would be nearly the opposite of Bar Pisellino. This restaurant would not be in the thick of it all. It would be hushed, sheltered, exclusive, admitting no more than a handful of people at a time. It would protect those people, once they were inside, from crowds spilling in from the street, even from the street itself. It would join the steady march of new tasting counters and omakase hideaways. And it would illustrate the growing ease with which New Yorkers of means can glide through and above the fray, slipping from one cloistered room to another in black cars without touching down. That restaurant would be a lot like Frevo , which has been serving suave, $124 tasting menus with a modern-French sensibility in Greenwich Village for the past four months. Frevo is the work of Franco Sampogna, who is the chef, and Bernardo Silva, the manager. Mr. Sampogna is from Brazil and Mr. Silva comes from Portugal; they met 10 years ago while working in restaurants in France, and quickly decided that one day they would open a restaurant in New York City that would give diners \"that feeling of being in your own secluded safe haven,\" as Mr. Sampogna put it. To get into Frevo, you first need to know that Frevo exists. There's no sign. When you arrive at the correct address, what you see is an art gallery with just enough room on its white walls for the six abstract paintings that hang there fairly close together. The paintings are real paintings made by a real artist, Thomas Labarthe, who goes by Toma-L , but the gallery is not entirely a real gallery. If it were, the young woman who sits there keeping an eye on things would stare blankly ahead when you entered, instead of walking up to you with a smile and reassuring you that, yes, you've come to the right place. Then she reaches behind one of the canvases and it swings out on invisible hinges, leaving in its place a doorway through which you can see, illuminated in a large, dark room, a stainless-steel kitchen and a long, curving counter of polished quartzite. You hop up on one of the 18 padded seats, and the door clicks closed. You are in. When the door opens again, typically not for another half an hour, in will walk another set of people who, like you, knew that the gallery was not a normal gallery. Let's say that the misdirection of the gallery and the secret door do not make these newcomers feel sufficiently insulated from the outside world. Frevo gives them the opportunity to sit at a round chef's table in a back corner around which a curtain can be drawn, as in a hospital room. Much of this comes right out of the neo-speakeasy handbook, although Frevo does throw itself into the act with an unusual level of commitment. The gallery, for instance, installed a new batch of Mr. Labarthe's canvases around Labor Day. But each time I went to Frevo, I stared at that curtain. Nobody ever closed it while I was there, but it still reminded me how easy it is now for some New Yorkers to climb into the treehouse and pull the ladder up behind them. I have to admit, though, that I like Frevo more than I like the version of New York that it brings to mind. The pleasures of this secluded safe haven are real, and Mr. Sampogna's cooking is focused and refined. I haven't been able to get his halibut dish out of my mind, for instance. The fish rests on a thin, crisp platform of fried bread shellacked with a dark mushroom marmalade; this miniature mushroom tart drinks up the flavor of the halibut as it goes, in the oven, from raw to that just-cooked state where its flesh slides apart into thick and almost fluffy white flakes. Alongside the fish are bulbs of melted fennel, their spiced cooking juices boiled down to a bittersweet syrup. Mr. Sampogna's opening salvo often involves quinoa doing something quinoa doesn't usually do, and doing it quite nicely. I liked its freshness when it was used in a salad spooned over a demitasse of creamy hummus; I liked its crunch when it was dehydrated and sprinkled over a few mouthfuls of black lentils topped with glistening orbs of smoked trout roe. A dish from early July brought peas, at the tail end of their season, together with a rich pistachio-tarragon cream and white puffs of coconut mousse: light and charming. I wished Mr. Sampogna had exploited summer produce as sensitively when I went back in August and September. His kitchen is small enough that he could respond to the market day by day, but so far this doesn't seem to interest him. Frevo, at $124 for five courses, is not a huge splurge by New York standards, but servers try to inflate the total by pushing supplements. For $30 you can get Kaluga caviar troweled on to your first course; $20 gets you upgraded to a foie gras torchon instead of the less-thrilling mushrooms with gnocchi; it's $18 for a serving of aged Comté before dessert, and another $30 to have white truffles with the cheese. This tactic is not as grating as it is at Per Se , where the supplements are piled onto a base charge of $355, but it is still a snag in the otherwise smooth hospitality provided by Frevo's small crew of servers and cooks. Everyone I've brought to Frevo has fallen under its spell, which is hard to resist. The music is slinky and sinuous. The room has a nocturnal theatricality; sitting at the counter with darkness behind you facing the spotlighted kitchen can feel like attending an extremely elegant campfire. I still think Frevo is a perfect spot to familiarize yourself with the frictionless New York of 2019. Still, when my out-of-town friend arrived, we had our dinner at Bar Pisellino. We were hungry for a taste of the old chaos. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 58, "data": " Billy Durney, the Brooklyn restaurateur and pitmaster, has been talking for several years about the fried chicken that he planned to bring to Red Hook. At first, there was no reason to doubt him. That the man is comfortable with long time horizons was clear to anyone who watched how patiently he studied the science of indirect heat at his first establishment in the neighborhood, Hometown Bar-B-Que . After Hurricane Sandy flooded streets and knocked out power in the area shortly before the scheduled opening in 2012, he gave away smoked briskets, ribs and shoulders to local residents until electricity was restored almost three weeks later, honing his technique all the while. The years rolled by without a drumstick in sight. But as recently as March, it was still possible to take Mr. Durney at his word when he talked about the star attraction of his nearly completed fried-chicken emporium , to be called Red Hook Tavern. The doors were finally unlocked in July, revealing a row of tables under electrified gas lamps and a row of stools in front of a white-oak bar that looks as if it was built to last at least until Van Brunt Street sinks into the sea. Wearing wallpaper and wainscoting and pressed tin, Red Hook Tavern does a straight-faced impression of a whiskey-simmered New York corner bar of a certain age. The attention to detail was to be expected, given how convincingly Hometown conjures a Texas Hill Country barbecue palace. What was something of a surprise, though, was that chickens were not being fried anywhere on the premises. In fact, Red Hook Tavern's star attraction turned out to be a cheeseburger. To be fair, Mr. Durney probably would not have drummed up much enthusiasm had he gone around telling people he was going to open a bar that served hamburgers. New York has so many of those already that the style they typically serve is a recognized subgenre that George Motz calls \"the New York City pub burger.\" According to Mr. Motz, a filmmaker and author whose work explores all things ground-beef-and-bun-related, the hallmarks of a pub burger are a thicker-than-average patty and a relative lack of adornment. It is the plain, sturdy and hunger-calming burger you get at P.J. Clarke's , JG Melon and Fanelli Cafe in Manhattan and at Donovan's Pub in Queens. Mr. Durney has said that he intends the Red Hook Tavern burger as a homage to the one at Peter Luger Steak House . (You might think that Luger traffics in the style known as the steakhouse burger, but most burger taxonomists agree that what it serves, only at the bar and only at lunch, is a pub burger.) Like Peter Luger, Red Hook Tavern employs a toasted and buttered hard roll with a smattering of sesame seeds -- about as many as the stars you can see in the sky over Manhattan on a very clear night. In both places, the patties are made with some portion of dry-aged prime beef, stand about an inch and a half tall, and possess a dark crust that fills your head with the instinct-triggering aromas and flavors whose creation in browned meat was described by Louis Camille Maillard . There are some minor divergences. At Peter Luger, cheese is optional, while the top and sides of the burger at Red Hook Tavern are tightly wrapped in glossy yellow American cheese by default. A thick cross-section of white onion is laid below the top bun at Luger. At Red Hook Tavern, the onion is stationed below the patty, where it helps keep the bottom bun dry, like a coaster. They give you a half-sour pickle spear and fries, too, which are about the same dimensions. The important difference between the burgers, though, is that lately Peter Luger's have tended to be better in memory than in reality, while the Red Hook Tavern's is, right now, one of the few absolutely mandatory burgers in New York City. The kitchen is overseen by Allison Plumer, a chef who has done most of her cooking in Brooklyn. She has an excellent dry-aged steak -- New York strip, naturally -- impressively browned and served with a small cast-iron skillet full of creamed spinach, a touch so right it may qualify as art. It is the kind of detail that makes Red Hook Tavern something more than a place for the locals to get beer and burgers. Another is the golden chicken gravy with a hint of butterscotch that is ladled into a well in the mashed potatoes that come with the half-chicken, which is advertised as simply pan-roasted, although it has the wonderfully stiff shards of skin you get from weighting down the bird as it cooks. Everybody who has eaten at Red Hook Tavern will tell you to get the country-ham-and-Cheddar croquettes on a creamy pool of whole-grain Dijonnaise. Everybody is right, too. Consensus has also formed around the wedge salad, which is clearly not a wedge, but is still a very fine salad, with blue cheese and a thick, Lugeresque bacon slice flopped over individual leaves of romaine. There is considerably less unanimity about the roasted corn, kernels of which you are supposed to wrap in radicchio that you've first smeared with 'nduja; I'm in the camp that thinks it would be a fine dish for another restaurant. There is no restaurant where I'd be glad to see littlenecks steamed with way too much stale, acrid garlic. Of course, there's no correct amount of stale, acrid garlic, but the kitchen really goes all in. There are two desserts. Both are sundaes . They do not have the thematic inevitability of the creamed spinach, but they're put together with more sophistication than average. The truth is, though, that nothing on the menu gives the burger a real run for its money. What does, or at least equals it as a reason to reserve a table a couple of weeks in advance, is the list of drinks Mr. Durney has put together with Jeff Porter and Kenneth Crum. Mr. Durney's enthusiasm for wines made by small, eccentric producers is on view at Hometown, surely the only place on earth where you can drink Milan Nasterec's skin-fermented Moravian pinot noir alongside a taco filled with a slice of barbecued brisket and, in lieu of salsa, a glowing yellow stripe of queso. Mr. Durney indulges his curiosity more deeply at the tavern. Ten grower Champagnes can be had for under $100 a bottle, and there's a $40 sparkling red from Maryland. Darlings of the nonconformist wine movement such as Radikon , Marcel Lapierre and Frank Cornelissen are all given the space you'd expect, but there are also less familiar names like Subject to Change , a Forestville, Calif., outfit that has the peculiar idea of making a bright-toned, low-alcohol zinfandel-syrah blend and calling it Moon Juice. A small number of brews from Other Half, Folksbier and Threes Brewing, leading lights of the Brooklyn suds scene, are on tap, along with uncredited light and dark ales billed as \"A Tribute To McSorleys Ale House.\" McSorley's, famously, has you buy two mugs at once, which Red Hook Tavern doesn't do. It's less well known that McSorley's serves a burger. Like the one at Luger, it's only available at lunch. It is, of course, a pub burger.

{"id": 59, "data": " There are no roving carts loaded with bamboo steamer baskets at the new Chinese restaurant Hutong , no menu cards to be stamped each time you take a dish of har gow or turnip cake. In fact, dim sum is only a small portion of what the menu offers at Hutong, which opened in Midtown in July. But you would do well to make it a large portion of what you order, because only one or two other restaurants in town can plausibly claim to make dim sum that rivals Hutong's. Where else will you find cooks who have the dexterity to make Wagyu-beef mille-feuilles whose flaky layers of pastry overlap each other by only a few millimeters, like the feathers on a songbird's wing? Who can craft steamed buns that look just like shiitake mushrooms, which happen to be the chief ingredient in their filling? Or who knows the secret that allows the crunchy, chewy, charcoal-black mini-footballs stuffed with pork (in what is known in Sichuan as \"fish-fragrant\" seasoning) to sparkle as if diamond chips had been kneaded into the dough? There is real skill in the kitchen at Hutong. You see it most clearly in the dim sum, but much of the other cooking evinces the kind of discipline, precision and technical mastery that has rarely been seen in this city over the past few decades, to the dismay of eaters who know what Chinese food is capable of. \"While expensive French restaurants in New York can hold their own against many places in Paris, if you want to move beyond steamed dumplings and stir-fries to experience the complexity of Chinese banquet cuisine, the possibilities grow dimmer each year,\" Ruth Reichl wrote in The New York Times in 1998. She gave reasons for the poor showing, including talented chefs being paid more in Hong Kong and China. That is as true as it was 21 years ago, but what has changed is the rise of global Chinese restaurant groups, from the disappointing duck specialist DaDong to the surprisingly solid Hao Noodle outposts and, now, to Hutong. The original Hutong opened in 2003 on the 28th floor of a glass tower overlooking the Hong Kong harbor, but the dining room tries to conjure the atmosphere of Beijing's vanishing premodern alleys, or hutongs, by means of red paper lanterns, carved wooden doors and birdcages. The Manhattan branch makes a different impression. The entrance is on the east side of the circular driveway below the Bloomberg Building between East 58th and 59th Streets. Turn right and you are in a narrow hallway between two soaring glass stacks of wine bottles, every one of them for decorative purposes only. Turn left and you are in a glittering, soaring, hard-edge dining room. The inspiration seems to be Art Deco with a pinch of cocaine; the blue leather banquettes, beveled mirrors and chandeliers of mirror-polished steel could come from the set of a nightclub in some cross between \" Scarface \" and \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\" A guest who has lived in China allowed his eyes to adjust to the glinting light as he looked toward the ceiling, which seemed to be far away. \"It's very x yin,\" he said. Hutong is ostensibly a Northern Chinese restaurant. This is more apparent in Hong Kong than in Manhattan, where the menu has been pruned to about half the size. Lamb, a mainstay in the northern provinces, was represented in August by a single dish, cumin-speckled ribs roasted languorously to a mind-altering tenderness. By the time of my last visit, lamb had ambled off the menu entirely. The most famous preparation from northern China, Peking duck, arrived at my table worse for wear and tear, carved haphazardly, with blobs of unmelted fat clinging to limp skin. The second course, a dark-meat stir-fry to be folded in iceberg lettuce, was more skillfully done, but the sting of paying $84 for a whole duck with uncrisp skin lingered. Much of what hasn't been trimmed from the Hong Kong menu comes from Sichuan. So does Fei Wang, the executive chef of the New York branch, and a native of Chengdu. Most recently seen running the kitchen of the Hutong in London, Mr. Wang weaves chiles -- fresh, dried, roasted, pickled, name it -- into nearly everything. In the dish known as Red Lantern, the whole dried peppers the size of cherries are mostly decorative; fried soft-shell crabs are buried under the chiles in a pan with an arcing bamboo handle, like jelly beans in the plastic grass of an Easter basket. The ground spices on the crabs' shatteringly brittle crust -- lightly sweet and more aromatic than searingly hot -- may remind you of a Chinese rice-cracker snack you grew up on, or it may make you think of Old Bay. Fermented chiles provide an electric buzz, and a modicum of heat, to the steamed halibut that arrives boxed up inside a red bell pepper and sitting on a nest of rice noodles. (The pepper opens into a six-pointed star that gives the dish its name, halibut red star noodles.) Kou shui chicken is nearly submerged in an orange lake of excellent chile oil, although the adroit way the oil is balanced by rice vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger and other flavors is what gives Hutong one of the city's most impressive versions of this traditional cold dish. If Hutong has another appetizer that equals it, I haven't found it yet. I did, however, have a cryptic encounter with a log-cabin stack of okra doused in a sweet wasabi sauce, and an inconclusive rendezvous with some steamed asparagus stalks whose tips were enrobed in white sesame sauce; it was as if somebody had tried to replicate strawberries dipped in white chocolate without access to strawberries or white chocolate. You could attempt to unknot these mysteries. Then again, you could simply begin your meal with dim sum. And then, after picking your way through the chile-besotted main courses, you could end it that way, too. There is a dessert that mimics the shape of a steamed bun, pleated and twisted into a pucker at the top. It is made of white chocolate, the wrapper on this trompe l'oeil bao, and filled with white sesame cream and a core of bittersweet salted caramel. Alongside it is a single scoop of ice cream made from lightly sweetened soy milk. The soy milk is extremely fresh. I don't mean that the carton won't expire for another three weeks; I mean that somebody in the kitchen was squeezing the soybeans shortly before the ice cream was frozen. This is a snack from a Chinese childhood, bread and a glass of milk, and it would be hard, after several courses of spice, to think of anything more welcome.

{"id": 60, "data": " Four summers ago, a young chef named José Luis Chávez began leveraging the poke craze and the salad-bowl trend into a string of fast-casual ceviche bars. He began with a counter in the Gansevoort Market food hall called Mission Ceviche ; there is now another in Canal Street Market and a third is supposed to open in Norwalk, Conn., later this year. At all locations, the stock-in-trade is citrus-marinated raw fish with sweet potatoes and kernels of chubby Andean corn, in both its soft and crunchy forms. This is of course the standard Peruvian formula, but Mr. Chávez had the inspiration of serving his ceviche in a clear plastic bowl over a base of salad, rice or, for a dollar more, quinoa. The supplemental ingredients make a plausible desk lunch out of a dish that some New Yorkers still aren't quite sure what to do with. The surprising thing about Mission Ceviche's salad bowls is that they taste like real Peruvian food. The raw fish is firm and cold and neatly cut up into solid pieces that hold their shape. The leche de tigre marinade in Mr. Chávez's \"ceviche clásico\" is a bright and precise cocktail of lime and rocoto chiles, although you might wish that the rocotos had been applied with a little less restraint. You get a higher-caliber shot of spice, this time from ají amarillo chiles, in the ceviche mixto, a combination of octopus, shrimp and fluke enveloped in a creamy, goldenrod-colored leche de tigre. The clásico is accessorized with sweet potato purée; the mixto gets avocado purée, too. The purées are piped out of pastry bags like buttercream roses on a wedding cake, and they are delicious. When I wandered into the Gansevoort Market location in February, it seemed clear that Mr. Chávez could run an interesting restaurant if he ever decided to put his food into something other than recyclable salad bowls. Then, at the beginning of the summer, he did just that, opening a sit-down restaurant on the Upper East Side with real plates and bowls. The new space is not particularly large or lavish, but compared with the earlier efforts, Mission Ceviche Restaurant & Bar is a palace. There is seating for 65 or so people beneath a wall sculpture of a fish that glows from behind and a pink neon sign that reads \"tiger milk effect,\" probably a reference to the belief that drinking leftover leche de tigre can put extra topspin on sexual performance. The menu now paints a slightly fuller picture of Peruvian cuisine, extending into new foods including the grilled skewers known as anticuchos. Mr. Chávez dresses up the country's most popular anticucho, grilled beef heart, brushing it with a creamy rocoto sauce and serving it with newly fried blue potato chips and kernels of choclo corn. The trio of rocoto, blue potatoes and choclo is so solidly Peruvian that it can withstand the chimichurri that Mr. Chávez brings in, by way of Argentina, as a final touch. He clearly has a soft spot for chimichurri because he deploys it again with the shrimp anticuchos (the shrimp are very big and look even bigger because they're grilled with their heads on), served with a squirt of huancaína, the spicy yellow cheese sauce that is something like Peru's version of queso dip. My favorite anticucho is a more straightforward situation, grilled scallops under arugula, lime zest and a smooth Parmesan fondue. But Mr. Chávez has the ability to put several flavors in motion at once and keep his balance, as evidenced by the beef-heart skewer and his octopus causa. This is, reduced to bare bones, a tendril of octopus curled around a disc of mashed potatoes. But the potatoes, seasoned with lime and yellow chiles, are coated in a smooth lavender-colored sauce made from Peruvian black olives; the octopus has been rubbed with cumin, oregano and ají panca paste and grilled to a crackle; the plate is decorated with a few wobbly curls of paper made with purple Peruvian potatoes. Mission Ceviche's servers, while eager to be helpful, have a habit of singling out the most obvious dishes -- the classic ceviche, the octopus leg -- and pushing them so hard you might suspect the rest of the menu is a minefield. It isn't. There is nothing to avoid unless the kitchen brings back the bizarre strawberry-kiwi ceviche that showed up as a special one night. If you are being herded into getting the \"Peruvian paella,\" you should know that the other three main courses are also worth looking into, like the ají de gallina, shredded chicken breast in a creamy ají amarillo sauce that is both soothing and spicy; or the seco norteño, a slowly braised short rib in cilantro sauce. All are larger than average, too. Still, nothing on the menu quite rivals the ceviches. They are served, yes, without lettuce or rice, and they are better for it. Mr. Chávez's creative engine seems to have a high idle, and he has come up with different ways to present dishes that are also on the menu at the fast-casual counters. The \"Nikkei\" ceviche, for instance -- tuna in a kind of modified ponzu sauce seasoned with ají amarilllo and togarashi -- now comes with watermelon and a bloop of ginger foam that would never survive a trip from the food court back to the office. Neither would the odd but intriguing attempt at a vegetarian ceviche where the fish is replaced by shiitakes and the leche de tigre takes the form of snow, frozen by liquid nitrogen. The art of ceviche-making has at least as much in common with mixology as with cooking, so it is no surprise that the cocktails are well calibrated and sing out with fresh lime. There is a twist on the pisco sour made with passion-fruit juice and another with the purple-corn drink chicha morada, although neither quite achieves the bracing elegance of the original. And it's nice to see the less well-known chilcano, a pisco highball made with lime juice and ginger ale. (Would ginger beer be better?) Chicha morada appears again in the raspadilla dessert. This time it is a syrup poured over shaved ice and sprinkled with lucuma foam. When I had the raspadilla, it was sprinkled with candied pecan crumbs but in a phone interview on Monday Mr. Chávez said he had replaced the nuts with crumbled Oreos. This, it hardly needs pointing out, was not exactly a staple in the diet of the Incas. \"What can I say?\" he asked. \"I just really like Oreos.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

{"id": 61, "data": " New York is getting crowded with hot pots. The city is not yet in the same league as, say, Chongqing, where the dish is said to have originated and where an association dedicated to keeping track of such things says there are about 50,000 places to eat it. New York, by my count, has a mere two or three dozen, most of them in the sections of Brooklyn, Queens and Lower Manhattan that have considerable Chinese populations. But new hot pot restaurants seem to arrive every few weeks, with some independent operators among a growing number of chains from China. Downtown Flushing, Queens, has Little Sheep Hot Pot , founded in Inner Mongolia and one of the first hot pot purveyors in New York to move beyond the all-you-can-eat model, which led to widespread improvement in ingredient quality; Mister Hotpot, known among the city's pig worshipers for its creamy, ivory-toned pork-bone broth; and Liuyishou Hot Pot , a Chongqing-based concern where the spiced beef tallow that is an essential component of Sichuan hot pot is molded into the shape of a smiling, bow-tied cow. Farther south in Flushing is Niu Pot , the city's best hot pot establishment by several measures, including the number and complexity of its broths. Niu Pot cooks a very good winter-melon soup and serves it inside the melon's hollow shell, although it is most widely known for serving marbled slices of raw beef wrapped tightly around a Barbie doll , like a dress for Lady Gaga . In Manhattan, hot pot outposts have been planted along the Bowery in a line advancing toward Chinatown, starting with Zhen Wei Fang . If there had been a hot pot restaurant in \"Blade Runner,\" it would have looked like Zhen Wei Fang, an import from Miami that has private booths, simultaneous videos projected side by side on the walls and a robot host by the entrance. (Adding to the sense of a future gone awry, the robot wasn't working the last time I went.) A few blocks south is Tang Hotpot , probably the most luxe hot pot in the city. The menu is illustrated with still-life ingredient photographs that look as if Vermeer painted them, and the pictures aren't that far off from reality. Almost all of these emporiums offer Sichuan hot pot, a broth covered in a deep slice of chile oil in which dried red chiles, Sichuan peppercorns and various other spices churn around like the remains of toy sailboats after a hurricane. But Da Long Yi Hot Pot, which opened in May in a second-story space above Canal Street, has the advantage over most of its competitors of having originated in Sichuan. Its home base, from which more than 200 Da Long Yis have issued, is the provincial capital of Chengdu. Chongqing was administratively sheared from the rest of the province in 1997. Although you key your name into a touch pad at the top of the stairs to get on Da Long Yi's waiting list, and you learn that your table is ready from an automated text, you order by penciling an X on the paper menu, in a box next to the item you want. The menu also suggests the length of time each item should be held down in the boiling soup. It goes without saying that you will want a Sichuan hot pot at Da Long Yi. You will be asked whether you want it mild, medium or spicy, although in my experience there isn't much difference. A more important question is whether you will cook your meal in Sichuan broth alone; in a split pot with Sichuan broth on one side and either tomato or mushroom broth, neither of them spicy, on the other; or in a three-chambered pot with some of each. The narrow range of choices can be an advantage for a novice hot potter, who might be swamped by the maximalist menus at Tang or Niu Pot. The split pots make Da Long Yi a good place to take somebody with a low tolerance for heat, although as a practical matter it is impossible to eat a Sichuan hot pot meal without ingesting at least a spoonful or two of chile oil. Old hands know that the oil tends to pool away from the region of the broth that is bubbling most furiously, and ingredients that, after cooking, are removed from the pot in this area will emerge relatively clean. Whether this is desirable varies from eater to eater and from ingredient to ingredient. Deeply furrowed, folded or layered foods -- the Kungfu beef tripe spread out on a mound of chipped ice; the tofu skins; the fried dough sticks known as youtiao or, on Da Long Yi's menu, \"fried bun\" -- retain spicy oil in quantities that may become challenging. Extremely smooth items, like the hard-cooked quail eggs, the rabbit kidneys speared on a toothpick, or the long and surprisingly slippery tubes of duck intestine, on the other hand, can survive a trip through the deepest patch of chile oil without any appreciable damage. You can, if you like, follow the custom of Chengdu or Chongqing by focusing on ingredients that are prized more for feel than flavor. The duck intestines, for instance, which quickly contract in the hot broth and come out about 30 seconds later with the texture of barely cooked squid. Or the pale ivory sheets of flattened artery, which after cooking about twice as long have a long-lasting chew that reminds me of geoduck. On the other hand, more flavorful ingredients, once they've cooked for a few minutes, can help punch up the broths, which aren't quite as deep or complex as they are at some other hot pot providers. This does not apply to the lengths of corn on the cob, which don't taste like anything to begin with. And I would avoid the \"vegetable platter,\" which was more like a lettuce platter. But it is useful to keep in mind that if you toss sliced king oyster mushrooms, or crown daisy greens, or bands of kelp tied into knots, or even the Hershey's Kiss-shaped fish balls with gooey orange roe inside, into the soup and forget about them for a while, both the ingredients and the soup will rise to the occasion. Some ingredients, though, you hold in your chopsticks, watching for 30 seconds or a minute until you can see they're ready. The marble tiles of Wagyu rib are in this category, and the New Zealand lamb shaved as thin as prosciutto, and the Kurobuta pork belly from Japan. The whole prawns on wooden skewers will be tender and running with juices in just over a minute. The sweet, small flounder fillets might need twice that. Even if you are careful to pull these bites out in the bubbling center of the pot, away from the oil, the chiles and Sichuan peppercorns will catch up with you sooner or later. They build up on your tongue, they slowly infiltrate your dipping sauce, and the mala tingle will take over. There is no fighting it at that point, of course, though a bowl of white rice is a good investment in the future. And when conversation at the table has stopped completely, when the water you keep pouring into sadistically small cups won't help any more, there is one thing that will: fresh watermelon juice, sold by the carafe.

{"id": 62, "data": " Lately I have fallen under the spell of an East Village restaurant called Foxface . The cooking there is hard to pin down, geographically. Stopping in a few weeks ago, I ate Low Countryish wild red shrimp on grits, with sweet corn off the cob and a potent saffron-lobster sauce. More recently, I had skinless pork sausage inspired by sai ua, the spicy and tangy specialty identified with the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai. The soft tripe I enjoyed the other weekend had been simmered with 'nduja, the fiery and malleable Calabrian sausage, and then covered with a few thin shingles of shaved pecorino. If I had started hanging around at Foxface sooner, especially during the cold months after its opening, in February, I might have run into a wider variety of cuisines and main ingredients. I did manage to get some of the elk osso buco while that was still on the menu. I never got to try the wild hare, though, stewed in red wine with a bit of chocolate and thickened with its own blood, a formula that students of very old-guard French cooking will recognize as lièvre à la royale. Nor did I make it in time for the venison, left to bubble for hours in white wine with mushrooms and dark juniper berries. The Foxface dish I may never forgive myself for missing, though, is the kebabs served with preserved lemons and tahini, because the kebabs were made from ground lamb and camel. Although these foods may lack any unifying cultural background, they did have one thing in common: They were all served on rolls. Apart from an occasional salad or soup, everything cooked at Foxface arrives in sandwich form. And with the exception of a muffuletta that briefly manifested a few months back, every sandwich at Foxface is filled with hot, cooked meat or seafood or vegetables. In Mexico, certain taco stands specialize in tacos de guisado, tortillas filled with one kind of stew or another. Most of Foxface's offerings are, in effect, sandwiches de guisado. Which reminds me of another impressive Foxface sandwich, a magenta and green tangle of cilantro stems and pickled onions pressed into an engagingly tart pile of pork, marinated in sour orange juice and roasted very slowly under a banana leaf in emulation of cochinita pibil from the Yucatán. There is no guarantee that any of these items will be available when you go to Foxface. The menu is printed daily and taped up next to the window on St. Marks Place where most of the business is transacted. Sometimes a new sandwich appears after the printed menu has already been posted, so it will be written out by hand on a card that has in its upper left corner the restaurant's logo, a drawing of an elegant fox in cat's-eye glasses with a cigarette holder in one gloved hand. The sandwiches have names like It's What's 'Nside (for the tripe with 'nduja) or 120 BPM (bison heart with tahini and \"many spices\"). The Smoking Fox is sold every day. It is filled with smoked pork rib the color of a dry rosé, separated from the bones and covered with coleslaw, pickles and a few splashes of habanero-orange vinegar. Your mind, of course, goes either to Memphis or to the McRib , and neither is exactly wrong, but the meat is of a superior grade and is smoked with the attention to timing and nuance that characterizes Foxface's cooking. It's a great sandwich. To place an order, you lean in to the window and speak with Sivan Lahat, who owns and runs Foxface with Ori Kushnir, her partner in life and in sandwiches. They immigrated to New York from Israel almost 20 years ago and have lived here ever since, apart from a brief flirtation with the Midwest and a longer experimental period in Tokyo. While they were in Japan, they operated a pop-up restaurant, which is the closest either of them came to running a food business before opening Foxface. Like the fox in the logo, Ms. Lahat has coppery hair and wears cat's-eye glasses. She prepares the orders in the room behind the window, which measures 48 square feet. Inside the building, under the stairs, Foxface has a second room. Mr. Kushnir thinks it could be as large as 14 square feet. A variety of equipment is stowed in the two rooms, including three induction burners, a roaster, a smoker and a dishwasher. After business hours, some of it comes out as Mr. Kushnir supervises the more time-consuming roasts and stews. He describes the food that he and Ms. Lahat cook as \"dishes we like to eat, reimagined as sandwiches.\" I like to eat a lot of the same dishes, as it happens, but they have been hard to come by lately, especially those shapeless brown stews that are so out of style. Following some of the world's most influential chefs and shamed, perhaps, by the unflattering lenses of a million amateur photographers, restaurants have shifted away from plain and plain-looking cooking. The subtlety and the thrill of plain cooking comes from searing, simmering, reducing, skimming and so on. All the people who own Instant Pots know this, but the segment of the restaurant scene with artistic leanings has forgotten it, focusing instead on plating, arranging six or seven things in some photogenic design and hoping they will cohere. Slapping a roll on it is one way to get a shapeless brown stew ready for its close-up, although it has to be said that on the mean streets of Instagram, an elk osso buco sandwich is no match for a rainbow unicorn ice cream sundae. Because space is at a premium, there is no room to sit and eat your Smoking Fox at Foxface itself. You can, however, take it to a table a few steps away inside an adjoining business called the William Barnacle Tavern . This is a reassuringly gloomy bar that is said to have originated as a speakeasy. Model ships and other nautical paraphernalia are strewn about, references to the rumrunning operation a former owner of the building presided over during Prohibition. (The stairs that Foxface's dishwasher is housed below lead to an exhibition space called the Museum of the American Gangster .) The bar's current owner has resisted some modern conveniences. Most of the lighting at night comes from small candles, and all of the music is provided by old films -- of Irish folk recitals, Cab Calloway concerts -- that run in looping, watery projections on the back wall. All Foxface sandwiches are presented in a trim little white box that can be unfolded into a place mat. You can purchase an Italian fruit soda for $3 from Foxface, or buy alcohol from the tavern. The beer is not expensive, but the specialty of the house is absinthe. Most patrons drink theirs diluted with ice water poured from a four-spigot absinthe fountain at the end of the bar. The bartender will make absinthe cocktails, too, including the one Ernest Hemingway supposedly invented that is just absinthe and Champagne in a big glass .

{"id": 63, "data": " When I left my home state of Rhode Island at 18, it didn't take long to discover that there was almost nothing about its local food customs that didn't make outsiders laugh. That small children routinely bought coffee-flavored milk in school cafeterias; that \"beer\" was not pronounced with an \"r\" at the end, but pizza was; that a hot dog shortened to about four inches and topped with meat sauce is called a hot wiener , and that a counterman preparing six of them at a time may deploy a maneuver known as \"wieners up the arm\" -- all of this apparently strikes people who grew up more than 20 miles from Providence as very funny. When New Yorkers hear that Violet , a new restaurant in the East Village, serves a style of pizza that comes from Rhode Island, they start to smile, as if getting ready for the punch line. In fact, though, Violet's pies are a homage not to the whole state but to a specific restaurant, Al Forno, in Providence. If you know one thing about Al Forno, you know that its pizza is not a joke. One of the restaurant's two founders, George Germon, originated the recipe in the early 1980s, more or less out of desperation. After failing to get an oven hot enough to produce a crust as thin and crunchy as the ones he remembered eating in Italy, he tossed dough on a wood-burning grill and watched in awe as it stiffened to a crisp almost instantly. The pizza he and his wife, Johanne Killeen, would develop and elaborate from there was in a category of its own. The skills required to bake dough in a pizza oven, whether it runs on gas, coal or wood, don't apply to grilled pizza at all. This makes it an unending source of fascination to pizza technologists including Violet's chef, Matt Hyland. With his wife and business partner, Emily Hyland, Mr. Hyland paid tribute to wood-fired New Haven and New York pizza at his first place, Emily , then took on Detroit pan pizza at Emmy Squared . They have expanded both restaurants to new locations, including Citi Field, where Emmy Squared is now the \"official pizza.\" But Mr. Hyland has been a student of the Al Forno school of pizza for years, since going to college in Rhode Island. Violet, which he opened at the start of the year, is dedicated to the style. He has worked allusions to other features of the state's cuisine into the menu, which makes forays into pasta and small seafood dishes, but the pizza grill is at the center of the action. Anyone who has eaten at Al Forno will recognize the lineage of Violet's pies. Both are as thin as a saltine all the way to the edge, with parallel lines of grill marks on their undersides. Al Forno puts fontina on its margheritas, as Violet did with all its pizzas until recently, when it began experimenting with havarti. In any case, the cheeses are on the dry side and grated for fast, thin distribution. Sauces are splashed down by the spoonful, quickly, before the crust burns. That's the template for a pie called the Atwells: a base coat of grated havarti and pecorino under big blots of a garlic-laden pesto made even greener than usual by the inclusion of broccoli and pistachios. While Al Forno tosses raw, slivered scallions on almost every pie, Violet may chop its scallions or grill them. One appealingly eccentric pie that combines a New Haven clam pizza with a Peking duck pancake is finished with fried julienned leeks. Olive oil does give Al Forno's crust extra crackle and flavor, but Violet's less lavishly oiled dough, made with a sourdough starter, has more flavor of its own. It's a little salty, crunchy but not brittle, more substantial than you expect, and highly chewable. Violet gives you a heavy pair of shears to snip the pie into wedges, or any shape you like. Wielding them supplies the palpable thrill of using exactly the right tool for the job, and it's even better than that because the job is eating pizza. A trip to Providence last weekend, though, turned up more than structural similarities between Violet and Al Forno. Three of the four pizzas on Al Forno's menu reminded me of pies I'd eaten at Violet. One resembled the Atwells, but its pesto was made with asparagus rather than broccoli. For Violet's Beech Vibes, a thin layer of duxelles is spread from rim to rim, then topped with tahini, caramelized onions and pickled beech mushrooms. It reminds me of a pissaladière in which the anchovies have been replaced by mushrooms. Al Forno makes a duxelles pizza, too, but tops it with unpickled white mushrooms, and doesn't use tahini. And, of course, both places do a variation on a Neapolitan margherita, called the margarita in Providence and the Classic in the East Village. The difference between their dough recipes doesn't quite put to rest the suspicion that Violet should be more conscientious about avoiding overlap even though Al Forno is 180 miles away. Most diners, of course, will just be happy to have a new style of pizza in town. Any of Violet's pies, eaten before or after the iceberg-wedge salad with blue cheese and a jolt of ranch dressing, or the frisée salad tossed with fried artichokes, would make an ideal fast dinner. Beyond that, the going can get tricky. All the pastas I tried seemed like rough drafts, from the radiatore baked in a very salty vodka sauce to the spaghetti con vongole con dashi, a Japanese-Italian blind date that doesn't have the right chemistry. The two desserts I had were even stranger. Describing one of them, a cheesecake with banana pudding on it, the server said, \"I'm just going to tell you what it is and if you guys want it, you can order it.\" If the warning had been any stronger it would have come with liability waivers. If you did want to build a longer meal, some of the seafood appetizers can help. Not the \"stuffies,\" baked stuffed littlenecks or cherrystones that could use more clam. The smoked mackerel, though, is excellent and comes with some unusually good fresh-fried potato chips. There are also shrimp that have been grilled with their heads and shells on, placed over johnnycakes and splashed with spiced piri-piri sauce. Johnnycakes, which are made of fried cornmeal mush and taste like it, are probably more strongly identified with Rhode Island than any other food. I have never been sure why, because johnnycakes can be found, if you really want to look for them, all along the Atlantic Coast. The only time I've seen Rhode Islanders eating them was on a Boy Scout camping trip, and boy scouts will eat anything if you leave them in the woods for a few days. In any case, the johnnycakes that Violet places under the shrimp and the piri-piri sauce are kind of wonderful. The cornmeal has a lush, right-off-the-cob flavor. I'd have them for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Is it possible that the joke has been on me all along? Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 64, "data": " Before I tell you about the seasonally attuned courses the chef Hiroki Odo prepares at his new and virtuosic kaiseki restaurant, Odo, I want to tell you about some that he does not prepare. At two points during the March menu, a person who is not Mr. Odo faces you across the thick plank of Lebanon cedar that forms the dining counter and makes something for you. The first time is about halfway through the meal, when Seong Cheol Byun shows up, shapes half a dozen pieces of sushi and lays them down, one by one, in front of you. Some of his ingredients, kept on wooden trays that he carries from place to place, are typical, like the warm short-grain rice and the dark nikiri that he will brush over certain fish. Others are less typical. The ginger he mounds on your plate is pickled together with sliced lotus root and daikon. On March 1, looking forward to spring, he added cherry leaves to the mix. Mr. Byun, a Korean-American, ferments daikon, cabbage and sesame seeds to make white kimchi, which he wraps inside nori for a tuna roll. You eat it like an ice cream cone, but faster. When Mr. Byun worked at Sushi Nakazawa, much of the seafood he used was flown in from Japan. At Odo, almost all the fish have been caught off the East Coast of North America: Long Island black sea bass, Florida mackerel and North Carolina bluefin tuna, which may be several weeks old before Mr. Byun is ready to serve it. This sushi reflects the American region where it is made, incorporates the Korean background of the chef making it and still has an unmistakably Japanese spirit. This one course, if tripled in length, could be spun off into a separate establishment that would probably be among the top two dozen sushi restaurants in the city. The second time an Odo course is prepared while you watch, it is made in a cocktail shaker and served in a cocktail glass. It is, as you may have guessed, a cocktail, though it is also the first of two desserts, sweetish and not especially boozy. Frank Cisneros, the sommelier, subordinates the alcohol to fresh fruit, in the style of the revered Tokyo bar Gen Yamamoto . Barrel-aged shochu is muddled with one or two sprightly segments of mikan orange, subjected to a calisthenic shake and strained into a delicately etched glass before a shimmer of sparkling wine is laid down on top. Orange juice in cocktails usually tastes diluted and weak; in this drink, it was radiant. I would say that the drinkable dessert course could be expanded into a separate cocktail bar, except that Odo already has one of those. Odo, which opened in December a few minutes' walk from the Flatiron Building, is entered through a door hidden in the back of a compact den -- cafe by day and bar by night -- called Hall. This arrangement seems to remind people of a speakeasy, although it would take an especially clueless bootlegger to open a speakeasy inside a bar. So far, Hall has not been fully discovered, but it still gets busy enough at dinner time that you can be stranded by the front door for a few minutes before anyone on staff notices. Some diners on their way to Odo will find this an awkward start to a meal that costs $200 before tax, tip and drinks. But they may also discern that Hall, lined with carved oak panels salvaged from what appears to have been a library or church vestry from around 1900, is one of the neighborhood's most entrancing rooms; that the corridor, which seems too narrow and definitely climbs on its way toward a too-short brass door with no handle, is perspective-altering in a way a Surrealist would enjoy; and that Odo, a shadowy and windowless space on the far side of that door is an unusually tranquil shelter from crowds, noise and anything else you might want to get away from for a couple of hours. The 14 counter seats face the kitchen and, in the middle of it, a charcoal-gray island. This is where Mr. Odo and his cooks assemble the other courses I promised to tell you about. Duck breast has been grilled over charcoal and positioned between two sauces. One is a black spill of concentrated soy spiced with sansho pepper; the other is an ivory pool of puréed apples and cream. These sauces contrast in every way you can think of, including East versus West, and they come together like opposing poles of a magnet. A springy chunk of truffle-flavored mochi is crisped on the grill and engulfed in a white-miso soup that has grated white truffles floating on the surface. You smell truffles in the air first, get them on the tip of your tongue next and finally taste them everywhere when they're released from the mochi. A croquette tastes something like an Italian rice ball made from New England clam chowder that has young bamboo shoots in it. This golden, breaded arancino is finished with dots of grated goat cheese. Shaved lamb shoulder, baby harukei turnip and two asparagus stalks as thin as licorice whip are served, still cooking, in a hot broth, a kaiseki version of shabu shabu. Odo -- incidentally, the name is pronounced as a set of initials, O.D.O. -- pursues local ingredients not just for its sushi course but throughout its menu. The simmered lamb used to gambol in the Hudson Valley, the croquetted topneck clams were raked in off Long Island and so on. Kaiseki's near-liturgical focus on timeliness almost seems to demand local ingredients, and they have been central to Niki Nakayama's strategy at n/naka in Los Angeles, but less so for New York's few kaiseki chefs. Chikara Sono at Kyo Ya , for instance, takes pains to import traditional ingredients from Japan the minute they're available. Mr. Odo came to New York as the chef of Kajitsu , the extraordinary restaurant on East 39th Street that follows the vegetarian cooking tradition known as shojin ryori, born centuries ago in Zen Buddhist temples. One contribution he made in his five years there was to freshen up the menus with more food grown nearby. In the first and last tastes of his February and March menus, he anchors Odo firmly in the New York region. When you sit down, you are immediately poured a cup of cold sake. It is brewed in Brooklyn, and it is very good, swirling with fresh-fruit aromatics. Then at the end, after the fresh fruit, Mr. Odo serves ice cream made with kasu, the creamy solids left over at the end of sake distillation. The ice cream looks like vanilla and tastes, not surprisingly, like fermented rice. This particular kasu is supplied by the same brewery in Brooklyn that makes the sake. Expanding his range to meat and fish at Odo, he has kept the resourcefulness that limitations encourage. Somewhere along the way Mr. Odo also picked up technical skills in traditions far outside kaiseki. Each night, in the gohan course, Odo offers a choice of three starchy dishes. This is where I encountered a very fine seafood curry over rice; an elegant bowl of short ramen noodles in king crab broth; and fresh soba served with little pieces of pickled vegetables and wasabi blossoms, looking a bit like broccoli florets but tasting like mustard. As with the cocktail and the sushi, each of these dishes could, if Mr. Odo wanted, be leveraged into separate specialized restaurants, or food-hall stands. You could tell yourself that $200 is a large amount of money for a single meal or you could say that for the chance to visit all these different establishments without leaving your seat, it's a pretty good deal.

{"id": 65, "data": " The best way to enter the Albanian restaurant Cka Ka Qellu , if not the most direct, starts on Arthur Avenue. Arrive before the fish shops along this famous, not-quite-faded Italian strip in the Bronx take in the iced clams and octopus for the night. Across from Dominick's, turn into the indoor market that Fiorello La Guardia ordered up. Move on past the hand-rolled cigars and the T-shirts reflecting various tenets of Bronx philosophy. Keep going beyond the scamorza, the soppressata and the ready-to-go heroes, and walk out the door on to Hughes Avenue. Just to the right is a spinning wheel that looks old enough to have been Rumpelstiltskin's and next to it, another door. Open it, walk inside. The short trip seems to have taken you back in time. The spinning wheel turns out to be just one piece in Cka Ka Qellu's collection of antique tools, stringed instruments, yokes, brass coffee mills, manual typewriters, dishes of hammered metal and embroidered costumes that the owner, Ramiz Kukaj, brought over from the old country. Some, he says, go back to the 18th century. The floors and walls seem to have been airlifted from an Albanian farmhouse, and the speakers play wistful folk tunes on traditional instruments, not the modern, globally aware wake-up calls of the brass band Fanfara Tirana . The restaurant is soaked in nostalgia. The other reason for the walk from Arthur Avenue is that it recapitulates a pattern that's repeated throughout this neighborhood, where the signs and menus facing the street are still written in Italian but many of the people in the back rooms, seasoning the sausages and frying the veal cutlets, are Albanian. Here and there, those Albanians have brought a little of their cuisine into those Italian businesses. Cumin-laden suxhuk sausages hang to dry in the salumerias. In some pizzerias, the burek challenges the Jamaican beef patty for outsider meat-pie supremacy. One such place, also owned by Mr. Kukaj, is in the Norwood neighborhood and is called Tradita. ( Ligaya Mishan reviewed it in 2017.) But if you want a deep-end Albanian experience, Cka Ka Qellu, pronounced SHA ka chell-OO, is the place to go. The kitchen does not focus on the seafood of Albania's Adriatic coast, or the more intensely Greek- and Turkish-leaning cuisine of its southern reaches. Instead, it heavily favors the north, which shares many dishes with the former components of Yugoslavia that are its neighbors. In particular there is a strong overlap with Kosovo, home to many ethnic Albanians including, at one time, Mr. Kukaj and his chef, Afrim Kaliqani. In their kitchen, yogurt and cream are everywhere, along with curds of soft fresh cheese and triangles of creamy, unsqueaky feta. A good portion of the menu could be described as things in a creamy white sauce. Another, entirely different portion could be described as creamy white sauce with things in it. Included in the second group are some of the dips that are almost obligatory at the start of your Cka Ka Qellu experience: tarator, tart yogurt with minced cucumbers, garlic and parsley, similar to tzatziki, but nearly as fluffy as whipped cream; cream stirred with bits of suxhuk to give it a pinkish tint and a suggestion of spice; and kajmak , which our server described as \"like butter for bread\" and I would say was like crème fraîche blended with cream cheese and butter. (In parts of Albania, it would be made by boiling unpasteurized milk from water buffalo.) I found myself dipping sausages, vegetables and just about everything else into the kajmak, but it is exceptionally good with a warm slice of the bread that Cka Ka Qellu bakes in the pizza oven that is the first thing you see when you walk in. When the menu defines kacamak as \"cream with polenta,\" the cream in question is kajmak, stirred into a fine-grained, nearly white mass of cornmeal that takes on the lightly fluffed quality of really well-made mashed potatoes. Sometimes there is a creamy sauce where you don't expect one. Each slice of lecenik, a cornbread with spinach and cottage cheese that is so rich it is only a few rungs in the ladder from cheesecake, comes to the table under a spoonful of kajmak. Sometimes there is no creamy sauce where one would do some good. The restaurant's version of fli, the slow-baked, many-layered pancake, is served as a long, narrow wedge with no accompaniment, although it is somewhat less than fully tender and moist. Luckily it responds immediately to any spare yogurt you can forage from elsewhere on the table. The mantia, baked dumplings filled with ground veal and onions, will seem tough and dry, too, if you order them alone. The same mantia cooked with yogurt in a clay dish will seem perfect. Is there another restaurant in New York that makes as much use of veal, and as little of any other meat, as Cka Ka Qellu? It is the main ingredient in the restaurant's qofte, ground and mixed with onions and red pepper; and in its qebapa, mild skinless sausages cooked on the grill. (The sausages would be called cevapi in other corners of the Balkans, where they are likely to be made from lamb or beef.) Veal works its way into many of the clay-dish stews, including the veal tava, something like a Mediterranean ratatouille that got itself entangled with a meat-and-potato stew from another part of Europe. Rolled up with cheeses and smoked meat, breaded and fried, veal also serves as the filling for the alluring Skanderbeg. Named after a great patriotic hero of the 15th century, Skanderbeg is generally called Albania's national dish, although its resemblance to a kayak made from chicken cordon bleu renders it something of an outlier in the cuisine. Ladled along its crunchy, golden length is -- please rise and face Hughes Avenue -- a creamy white sauce. Eating all of this without a salad is unimaginable and probably unadvisable. Each of Cka Ka Qellu's several salads seems to consist of cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions and cheese in slightly different arrangements. If the vegetables were any fresher, you'd be embarrassed to eat them in public. Surprise appearances by olives and their ilk provide extra variety. Like the breads, the desserts are baked on site: syrup-soaked baklava, a nut cake called haxhimak, a sugar cookie with nuts pressed into the top whose Albanian name is sheqerpare. I like them best with coffee boiled on the stove in a long-handled brass pitcher and served on a matching tray, both of them engraved with ancient, geometric designs that repeat and repeat.

{"id": 66, "data": " The main attraction at Madame Vo BBQ , now two months into its run on Second Avenue in the East Village, is a seven-course dinner on the theme of beef. This is a familiar concept in Vietnam, where it is known as bo bay mon, as well as in San Jose, Calif., Houston and other areas with robust Vietnamese populations. In New York, where the Vietnamese restaurant scene is more anemic, bo bay mon is still a rarity. The rough outlines of the setup at Madame Vo, though, will be familiar to any New Yorker who has gone out for Korean barbecue. New York City bureaucracy is unwelcoming to the tabletop charcoal grills seen in Hanoi, so an electric grill under a metal screen is embedded in each table. Once the grill is switched on and the metal rods down at kneecap level begin to warm up, an array of sauces, condiments and vegetables will arrive. When the rods are red, a server with a pair of tongs will lay some meat down on the screen, return periodically to fiddle with it and eventually decide when it is ready to be eaten. The similarities with, say, Han Joo Chik Naeng Myun & BBQ in Queens end, of course, with the actual food. Yes, both offer lettuce for wrapping, but at Madame Vo BBQ it is part of a Vietnamese table salad, along with fresh herbs; raw cucumbers, pineapple and apple; and pickled carrots and daikon. The restaurant also sets out a nifty caddy that holds circles of rice paper and warm water, in a miniature bathtub, for wetting the paper until it is soft enough to fashion into rolls. Rather than gochujang and sesame oil, there is a classic Vietnamese nuoc cham, an intoxicatingly good version of the pineapple-and-fermented anchovy sauce known as mam nem, and lastly a tamarind sauce, which suggests Madame Vo BBQ can follow or leap over Vietnamese tradition at will. This is about what you'd expect if you've eaten at another restaurant, a few blocks north, simply called Madame Vo . Jimmy Ly is the chef in both places; he and his wife, Yen Vo, are the proprietors. Each was raised in the United States by immigrants from Vietnam, and like many children of immigrants they seem to be fluent not just in two languages but in two cultures, enabling them to serve dishes their families might recognize in a setting that outsiders might embrace. The wings at Madame Vo, sticky with caramel and fried garlic, are drive-straight-from-the-airport good. The restaurant produces some of the only pho in Manhattan worth talking about. One of them, in a porcelain bowl the size of a baptismal font, is filled with a potent beef broth, a short rib on the bone and enough other cuts to make a butcher smile. At least one dish at the couple's new restaurant can stand alongside the wings and the pho at their first: the oxtail congee. Congee, or chao thit bo, is customarily the last course in bo bay mon. It frequently takes the form of a cloudy beef-and-rice soup. Mr. Ly cooks his congee with some chicken stock until it has the consistency of polenta, then spoons over it some sweet and savory braised oxtails in honey, fish sauce and brown butter. Everything about it is wonderful, even the scallion greens on top. The first of the seven beefs is typically boi tai chanh, a raw beef salad, and this is a high point, too. Lean eye of round cut into thin pink sheets is the canvas for an action-painting whirl of fried shallots, raw red onions, chopped peanuts and slivers of fresh mint. Pretty standard stuff so far, but then Mr. Ly bathes the salad in tangerine-lime vinaigrette, which has a positively buoyant effect, and splashes it with a bright-green, lemony pulp of fresh rau ram puréed in oil. In the middle of this $59 menu come the grilled meats, the courses for which the table salad and rice paper wrappers have been waiting. The finest of these might be the relatively straightforward five-spice tongue, although the betel-leaf-wrapped bundles of seasoned ground beef -- bo la lot -- are soothing and stimulating at once, and the New York strip with marrow butter is a clever way to acknowledge Manhattan's own beef-eating rituals, even if it would draw blank stares on the streets of Saigon. If you, like me, are naturally skeptical when servers persistently push a big-ticket item, you might be tempted to blaze your own path through Madame Vo BBQ's menu. But once you've tried the bo bay mon you have, by and large, seen the kitchen at its best. Yes, you could get the whole catfish, and if you are not into beef perhaps you should. Despite what the menu says, the catfish is not grilled, but fried and then baked. It was perfectly done the night I had it, and was filleted at the table by a server who knew his way around a fish skeleton. By that time, all that was left to do was to wrap a chunk of fish in lettuce and rice paper with a squeeze of grilled lemon and some of the sautéed shallots, lemongrass and bird chiles that the kitchen had ladled along the snaking curve of the spine. If you are thinking about a vegetable, the skewered and grilled okra pods in soy are crunchy and unslimy. The other appetizers, though, can be tricky. One night, the grilled scallop brushed with duck fat was transporting; on another, it tasted too much like the grill. Spring rolls filled with short rib and bone marrow seemed pointlessly indulgent, and so did their truffle hoisin dipping sauce in which I couldn't taste the truffles. A few dishes might have been improved if they'd arrived while hot, like the extra-large grilled oysters under caramelized sea urchin mayonnaise or the charred sea urchin, basted in its shell with butter, sake and fish sauce. Grilled prawns brushed with a lovely orange butter were slightly more mushy than two prawns sold for $38 should be. And while the 44-ounce tomahawk steak was more than a fair deal at $90, it would have been helped by a more aggressive sear and more salt. On certain nights, the whole operation had a slack, inattentive feeling that's rare in new restaurants. The catfish sat on the table, getting cold, while we waited for the table salad to show up. The thick stems of stir-fried morning glory would have been better cut into shorter lengths. Madame Vo BBQ may eventually run as smoothly as its older sibling. While it works out the mechanics, the surest route to happiness is to eat the bo bay mon while sipping cold coconut water through a metal straw out of a whole green coconut that you hold in one hand, like a cup of coffee.

{"id": 67, "data": " For an operation that essentially serves one dish, Maxi's Noodle has a dauntingly long menu. The dish is Hong Kong-style won-ton noodle soup, though, which requires Maxi Lau, the chef and proprietor, to keep a large number of items on hand to be added to or subtracted from the soup at the customer's whim: the broth of pork bones boiled with dried shrimp; the skinny yellow noodles with their firm, elastic snap; the stewed beef cooked with a sizable pinch of five-spice powder; the dense fish balls streaked with scallions; the weightless, grease-free chips of fried fish skin; and so on. But the one item that is absolutely essential is the won ton. Make that plural -- won tons, as many as Ms. Lau will put into your bowl ($8). This turns out to be four if you also want noodles, and six if you don't. Years ago Ms. Lau's mother dreamed of opening a won-ton shop, and had gone to Toronto to learn the art of won-ton wrapping from a family friend. Those plans changed when she learned she had cancer. After she died, two years ago, Maxi Lau decided to rebuild her own life. Leaving her job in corporate management, she retraced her mother's steps, learning to make won tons with the same family friend. Three months ago, she started Maxi's as a pop-up every evening but Thursdays, taking over a Hong Kong-style breakfast and lunch cafe owned by an aunt in Flushing, Queens. Ms. Lau plans to set up a noodle soup shop of her own in another part of Flushing later this year. Until then, she is making more won tons than she expected, because customers keep coming back to buy them by the dozen, frozen. Ms. Lau's won tons are filled with a mixture of shrimp and pork, with the emphasis very much on the shrimp. Each bite -- it takes at least two to finish off a Maxi's Noodle won ton -- confirms that the shrimp are of very high quality and are cooked in a way that keeps them unusually crisp and juicy. You can see their bodies glowing pink through the thin skins of the wrappers, whose loose ends trail behind the plump, round won tons like comets' tails.

{"id": 68, "data": " Part of the fun of eating at a pop-up is the thrill of invading a space after hours, like being locked in the museum at night with the whale and the diamonds. Another part is the sense of being in on a secret, eating at some place that doesn't have a Yelp entry and may not even have a name, while your friends are waiting in line at Roberta's . The mismatch between the borrowed space and the borrowers can send off sparks, too. Three years ago, when the Danish chef Bo Bech staged a one-night pop-up in the kitchen at Cosme in Manhattan, using ingredients he'd bought from farmers and shellfishers in Virginia the day before, his Mid-Atlantic-Nordic cooking stood out against the aromas of griddled masa and roasted chiles. When a pop-up settles down into a space of its own, it loses those things. In their place, it takes on the extra weight of proprietorship. The owners have to make decisions that were previously made for them, and those decisions will start to define them. It's their paint color on the wall, their scented candles in the bathroom, their name on the door. This is the position in which we find the former pop-up Oxalis and its chef, Nico Russell, a veteran of Daniel , in New York, and Mirazur , on the French Riviera. Beginning in 2016, Mr. Russell slalomed through a series of restaurants that would hand him the keys on off nights so he could cook tasting menus of 10 courses or so. First he inhabited Fitzcarraldo , an Italian restaurant whose combination of industrial, nautical, cinematic and Mediterranean elements has made it a frequent wedding site. Later he moved on to Egg , an austerely contemporary temple to breakfast which had begun its own life, more than a decade earlier, as a pop-up. He sold tickets to his Oxalis dinners, enough of them to get a few investors interested. With enough funding to take on a lease in Crown Heights, Oxalis opened in November in a former wine bar within sight of the Brooklyn Museum. Mr. Russell's vision for Oxalis is the one behind the bistronomie movement in France and its disciples abroad: carefully considered food served without the hoopla that drives up tabs. He slings a lot of vegetables in Oxalis's four- to six-course set menus, and it's one sign of his skill that this doesn't come across as a cost-cutting measure even though it must be, at least in part -- dinner is an extremely reasonable $60. Both the price and the understated cooking style reminded me of Contra , which opened with a five-course, $55 menu. The last time I went I ate a dish built around spaghetti-like strands of rutabaga under a warm snowdrift of whipped Alpine fontina. These two mild-tasting ingredients were set in motion by the force of a third, a dark and focused coffee-and-chicory cream sauce. This was a rutabaga that made me smile. Granted, I probably like rutabaga more than the average person, but I suspect that exposure to the rutabaga at Oxalis would make the average person realize that I'm right. Meals begin with a couple of bite-size snacks, one of which tends to be a crisp potato cake dusted with bay-leaf powder and topped with a chip of nori. It looks harmless enough, but can produce powerful emotions, which are easier to understand once you know that the potatoes are stewed in duck fat and then deep-fried. The other snack might be some lightly dehydrated beets brushed with marjoram-infused cream, or tiny grilled carrots that you dip in chamomile sabayon. (This is one of the dishes that suggests the long shadow of Noma , which in its early days famously matched aged carrots with chamomile.) The price seems meant to encourage frequent visits, but if you return often you may experience déjà vu. At meals in December, January and February, I was always served some variation on raw sea scallops with daikon and apple and some version of duck breast, sweet potato and yogurt. The portions in both cases were restrained but the flavors were outsize. The scallops were cured in miso and refrigerated for a few days and came out of it with something like the concentration of flavor that beef gets from dry-aging, but none of the funk. The duck's flavor was less surprising, but there was some energy in its collision with sweet potato purée and fig-leaf yogurt tart enough to cause double-takes. Like the rest of the menu, desserts are unshowy but can be highly impressive. One worked goat milk up into a thing of beauty: Some of it was made into a simple frozen custard, the rest cooked down into cajeta. The cooking makes it clear why people chased Oxalis around Brooklyn in its various borrowed spaces, but other aspects of the restaurant suggest that it hasn't quite figured out how to live in a space of its own. A meal there can be a somewhat solemn experience, which doesn't seem to be what Mr. Russell and his partners are aiming for. The layout seems to work against it. The kitchen is right up front, and the bar is all the way in the back, separated from the dining room by a glass door in a glass wall. I can't imagine what the wall is for, unless Oxalis is planning to bring back the smoking section. Instead of serving as a street-side welcome and a source of energy for the dining room, the bar feels like a waiting room. And while it takes reservations, the tasting menu isn't served there. The bar menu is à la carte. The dining room could use a little lift. It's as plain as a Shaker church, with clamshell-colored wainscoting below white walls unbroken by pictures or anything else. (All the art is in the restroom.) The way the servers have been coached on their lines so far underlines the decorative stiffness. They say stuff like \"Moving now into more sweet things \" rather than \"Here's your dessert,\" and my neighbor one night was instructed to \"sit back and relax,\" something that tends to go without saying in most restaurants. Things have loosened up since the liquor license came through. In the first few weeks, the servers were always trying to push a nonalcoholic beverage pairing for $20, and while the bar was mixing sodas that were more interesting than many cocktails around town, I'm not sure they were different enough from one another to justify drinking the whole slate. Now there are also wine pairings, starting at $35. Sometimes I wondered whether it would get the air circulating if the bar popped up in the dining room, or vice versa. There's probably some simple fix, or a series of them, that would give Oxalis some of its old sense of adventure. You can sense it lying there, waiting, when you taste that cajeta, those scallops, the fantastic little potato cakes.

{"id": 69, "data": " The great Midtown shrines to French cuisine were mourned one by one as they went, often at length and in print. At the same time, another style of French restaurant was dying off, but generally without benefit of a full obituary. This was the small, discreet bistro with forehead-height curtains in the windows, Piaf on the speakers, snails on the menu, chips on the china. They could be found uptown or downtown, almost always on a side street. Unlike Le Pavillon, La Côte Basque and their ilk, and unlike Keith McNally's immersive brasserie sets , which came later, these bistros were rarely fashionable. They were filled with professors and psychotherapists, Paris Review readers and Film Society of Lincoln Center members. Occasionally a passer-by out walking the dog would stand on tiptoe to peer over the curtain, but paparazzi did not stake out the doors of these establishments. Individually, few were landmarks. Collectively, their quiet continental self-assurance, their indifference to the passage of time, not to mention their crèmes brûlées and blood sausages and Fleuries, helped form the backdrop of the city. You always thought you'd have one within walking distance. Then, one day, you didn't. Bistro Pierre Lapin , which the chef and restaurateur Harold Moore opened last May in the West Village, is either a very late entry into the genre, or else a homage of impressive intensity. The dining room has the forehead-height curtains -- green gingham. It has Piaf on the playlist, and also Pink Martini's \"Sympathique,\" which has become the \"Vie en Rose\" of the Spotify era, for better or worse. Pierre Lapin also throws in some frills that go beyond the basic formula. White tapers burn on every table, wall sconces throw off Cognac-colored light from behind lampshades the size of teacups, a collection of thin flowery china dishes supplements the chunky white bistro ware. Most of all, Pierre Lapin has that rich, creamy, antique cooking -- all the stuff nouvelle cuisine tried to kill. As soon as you order, you get a preview of what you're in for: A length of chewy, substantial baguette arrives with a small mound of cultured butter, a pile of truffled cheese spread and a pink hunk of rustic pork pâté. On a quiet night at home, this could serve as a light dinner. At Pierre Lapin, it is a little snack to stave off hunger before the appetizers. Going back at least as far as his days at Commerce , Mr. Moore has seemed at home with profuse helpings and sauces that settled over them like a goose-down duvet over a sleeping Saint Bernard. After closing that restaurant, he opened an ode to Southern immoderation called Harold's Meat & Three, now just Harold's ; the most memorable thing I've eaten there was a Kentucky hot brown sandwich on which the Mornay sauce flowed freely. He also briefly ran a less focused study of Americana called the Greenwich Grille, where I ate a chicken potpie that I thought had potential. About a week later, I learned that the place had closed. None of Mr. Moore's previous kitchens went for the gut quite as gleefully as Pierre Lapin's. Your first course there could well be, and almost certainly will be if you leave the choice to me, an avalanche of mushrooms in cream cascading over the edge of a tall slab of buttered and griddled pain de mie. But it would be a mistake to overlook the Brie au four, roughly half a pound of baked Brie melting among dried figs and walnuts, all served with toasted baguette. I ended up ordering the Brie for the table, which freed somebody else to get the very meaty frogs' legs in a small lake of parsley, garlic, butter and lemon juice, while another guest tried the \"balle de matzo en consommé.\" In English, that means a nice bowl of chicken soup with a single matzo ball so densely packed that if you tossed it out of a second-story window it would probably put a dent in a car hood. This is not a bad trait in a matzo ball unless you happen to own the car. The lusty tune begun by the appetizers is picked up by the main courses. There is a fairly classic coq au vin, not too winy-tasting; some hefty sea scallops under toasted almonds, sensibly outfitted with endive and citrus sections; and a grouping of gnocchi, foie gras, sautéed sweetbreads and mushrooms, black truffle shavings and puffy chicken dumplings, all milling around in a Cognac-flamed cream sauce. It sounds insanely overcrowded, but is very rewarding to unpack. We have only scratched the surface of the menu. It goes on, perhaps longer than it should, because some dishes are more appealing than others. A black sea bass \"bonne femme\" was simply dull instead of simple. The soupy, thin cassoulet could have used more meat and a thicker crust of bread crumbs. The garlic sauce Mr. Moore made for snails tasted less garlicky than run-of-the-mill snail butter; the snails and I never figured out what we were supposed to do with the sunny-side-up egg planted in the middle of the plate. The menu could be trimmed by about a third. The same is most likely true for a few individual dishes, although Mr. Moore's shambolic, celebratory cooking style is one of the reasons Pierre Lapin works as well as it does. If he tidied everything up he'd be going head-to-head with Le Coucou , a contest that would not play to his strengths. The excess, the untucked shirttails on the dishes, the incomplete thoughts on the menu are part of the restaurant's charm. That charm does not quite extend to the wine list, which looks like one from four decades ago. It's almost entirely drawn from Bordeaux, Burgundy and the Rhone, with very few bottles under $75. This seems to be taking the joke a little too far -- in 1971, you could still get cheap Bordeaux. I drank well, but I always spent more on it than I meant to, which is the kind of thing that can keep diners from coming back. For dessert there is a coconut cake that has little to do with France. Dense and rich in a homespun American style that some people will love and others will find too leaden, it followed Mr. Moore here from Commerce, where it was a big hit. Other members of the lineup you already know. The chocolate mousse is deliciously dark, though not as airy as it could be. The sugar crust on the crème brûlée is burned to order. Both are overshadowed, though, by a peculiarly likable Pavlova. It is conceived as a tart, with a meringue crust and a whipped-cream topping; once it is sliced into a white wedge, bright yellow passion-fruit curd runs down its sides.

{"id": 70, "data": " Cherry Point sits on Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint, a few steps from the corner where Bedford Avenue, having flowed all the way across Brooklyn from the shores of Sheepshead Bay, suddenly comes to an end. The area is marked by a cluster of restaurants. Some have a washed-up feeling, as if they'd all been drifting along in Bedford's currents and had been stranded there. A few stand out in the landscape. In the fall, Cherry Point took a decisive turn into the second category when a new chef took over, but not everyone in the neighborhood seems to realize it yet. People still tumble in for happy hour, when servers whose hairstyles take a minute to adjust to will pour three-gulp martinis, manhattans and Rob Roys (due for a revival) in little Nick & Nora glasses for $8 each, and then after happy hour ends at 7 p.m. most of the crowd generally drifts out to find somewhere else for dinner. The space, with its old-timey wainscoting and its central bar, is easy to mistake for a tavern. Let's say you were among those who stayed put. Contemporaneously with your cocktail, you worked on a few smoked olives, green and warm; swirled a few of the golden, bite-size pig's head croquettes in a pale-pinkish ketchup made from pears; and became curious about what else this kitchen was up to. At one point you noticed that the dining room suddenly smelled like an herb garden in August, and a minute later Belon oysters on a nest of smoking rosemary branches sailed out of the kitchen opening that lights up the back of the restaurant. You ordered a plate of your own because you wanted to know how the warm oysters would taste under their yellow blankets of smoked rosemary hollandaise. From a short list of charcuterie you chose the squab and pork terrine, with a few prunes embedded into the pink and pleasingly coarse-grained slab. You spread this on toast with creamy whole-grain mustard, apricot-ginger mostarda or some of the pear ketchup, all of them made on the premises, like the pearl onions pickled in beer and the terrine itself. And you might have thought: If these are just the snacks, what is the food going to be like when this kitchen gets down to business? Whatever happens, odds are there will be meat on the table. Cherry Point opened in 2016, taking over what had been a Polish restaurant called Cinamoon. The charcuterie was made on site from the start, but the menu swerved in a more meat-focused and English-leaning direction last fall when Ed Szymanski was hired as the chef. This might have been predicted, if not from Mr. Szymanski's English upbringing and British citizenship, then from his work history. He has cooked at the Beatrice Inn , where various beasts of air and land are posed on silver platters for their roles in a fall-of-Rome spectacle; the Spotted Pig , in the days when it was still known for burgers basted in Roquefort and toasts buried under chopped chicken livers; and Pitt Cue , a London outpost of the modern, urbanized barbecue genre. For a panoramic tour of Mr. Szymanski's accumulated meat wisdom, you could call two days ahead and reserve a game-and-beef dinner, $65 for at least four courses along the lines of grilled tongue on watercress. The everyday menu, though, is not exactly made up of grain bowls. On any given night, you can drop in and marvel at the fried lamb ribs, their apple glaze augmented by broken coriander and fennel seeds and raw curls of shallot. The quail will be butterflied, grilled over charcoal and served on toast, with pickled prunes above it and a reduction swirled with port below. The duck breast will be seared down until the skin is a thin brown sheet next to pink and juicy meat. This is served with roasted, puréed celery root and brûléed pears. The plates are marked by a refinement and moderation that is not always achieved by other chefs in the guts-and-fat school of cookery. A creamy pheasant, leek and bacon pie is sealed inside a cast-iron pot by a beauty of a suet crust -- lacquered, scored in a starburst and very tender. Care is even lavished on the grilled rib-eye for two, which comes to the table with neatly sawed lengths of bone marrow under a tidy crust of parsley, chives, pickle shallots and buttered bread crumbs. Mr. Szymanski does not gesture toward fish and vegetables very often, but when he does he generally musters some conviction. True, the roasted pumpkin mash with toasted hazelnuts and fresh cheese has an obligatory air, as does the grilled bread with labneh and honey. But the smoked whitefish salad, with caramelized shallots and crème fraîche and a side of saltines, is more energetic than you might guess. Grilled flatbread looks out of place on this menu, but it is a fine canvas for roasted hens-of-the-woods and other wild mushrooms that are fleshy and flavorful enough to get noticed on their own. Skate, a main course, comes with smoked German butterball potatoes and a soaring, fino sherry-laced beurre blanc. The salad of radicchio and other bitter lettuces is as crisp and refreshing as any plate of leaves can be in February. It is also a very good thing to eat with steak, as it happens. Anyone who has not caught on to the English theme so far will get a last chance with the dessert menu, which offers treacle tart, sticky toffee pudding, a posset and three cheeses, all from England. The treacle tart was dry when I had it. The sticky toffee pudding was surprisingly but not unpleasantly cakelike. The posset, though, is a small miracle, an eggless custard of sugar, lemon juice and cream scented with Earl Grey tea, dressed up with Cara Cara orange wedges and a few Earl Grey meringues. There should be more possets around town. There should be possets galore. And by the way, there should be more wine lists like Cherry Point's. Assembled by Garret Smith, who owns the restaurant with Vincent Mazeau, it consistently favors obscure and surprising over familiar and dull. By the bottle, there are oddities such as apple wine and mead, but also a few things you might have heard of: a cremant d'Alsace from Dirler Cadé, a Sybille Kuntz riesling, an Olga Raffault chinon and a lean, exact pinot noir from Enderle & Moll. Only two bottles, both sparkling wines, are over $100, and most of the others are closer to $50. At these prices, you could just close your eyes and pick something, which is lucky because the servers, though charming and truly unpretentious, haven't fully internalized the list's ins and outs. It's one of the ways in which Cherry Point seems not to have caught up yet with how good it has become. If you treat it like a bar, you might not notice. But if you eat the way I did, ordering half the menu at a time, you could be putting more stress on the infrastructure than it can handle. You might be in for a very slow meal. But it will also be a very good meal. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 71, "data": " It is a safe guess that the Eastern European Jews who brought the bialy from Bialystok to New York City, piecing back together the recipe for this plain but beguiling dimpled roll in their new world after fleeing their old one, did not do it so that one day it could be sliced open and stuffed with a New Jersey pork sausage that comes in a cloth sack. To be fair, this was not the original plan at Shelsky's Brooklyn Bagels , either. The idea was to serve pork roll, egg and cheese sandwiches on a kaiser roll or one of the bakery's palm-size, hand-rolled bagels. Peter Shelsky, the bakery's owner, grew up in Manhattan, but he knew that some good things come from New Jersey, particularly pork roll, which he wanted to sell in the mornings. Also known as Taylor ham, pork roll is a cured, smoked and cooked meat product that has the tightly pebbled appearance of engineered stone, like a Corian countertop made of flesh. Pressing sliced pork roll on a hot griddle intensifies its saltiness while giving it a hint of a crust that contrasts attractively with the slightly spongy interior. Griddled pork roll, combined with a cooked egg and a slice of American cheese, is eaten across New Jersey as a breakfast sandwich. Usually it is found on a kaiser roll. Sometimes it is seen on a bagel. But some Shelsky's customers requested it on a freshly baked bialy, and others followed, and now pork roll sandwiches made on bialys are nearly as popular as the ones made on rolls, with bagels a distant third. The bialy might have been custom-made for the job, particularly the ones at Shelsky's, which are baked to a darker brown, their thumbprint divots filled with a more robustly caramelized onion confit, than garden-variety bialys. Both traits are intensified if you have the bialy thoroughly toasted, as the person behind the counter will almost certainly recommend.

{"id": 72, "data": " Need opinions on where to eat? They're easy to find these days, as consumers from around the globe fire off countless raves and pans about every known restaurant, cafe, chili counter, falafel cart and crêperie, not to mention post offices and jails. These mash notes and spitballs rain down endlessly not just from traditional review sites like TripAdvisor and Yelp (171 million reviews at last count) and retailers like Amazon, but also from Facebook and Google, those all-purpose giants. Everybody's a critic, right? I happen to get paid for criticism, and I would like to criticize that old platitude right out the window: No, everybody is not a critic. What most of you are doing out there, online and in three dimensions, is complaining. When we complain, we experience something that we don't like and we say something about it. A critic doesn't write about his own dissatisfaction, or doesn't just do that. A critic has to poke his head out of his turtle shell, look around and gesture, with stubby legs, toward the sources of dissatisfaction. Done perceptively, with analytic thinking and an effort to connect the dots between this experience and others, this can be the beginning of a value system that readers might share, or reject, or at least attempt to understand. Complaining is as easy as breathing. Writing criticism is a real pain. That was a complaint, by the way. But criticism and complaint are closely related enough for me to know that there's a lot of complaining going on, and that most of the complaints aren't having any effect at all. This may not be the point. People who study complaints divide them into two categories, instrumental and expressive. An instrumental complaint is \"directed toward a specific target and intended to bring about a specific outcome,\" according to Robin Kowalski, a professor of psychology at Clemson University who has studied the social functions of complaining. Calling a restaurant's owner the next day to say that you waited an hour for dessert and don't intend to come back is an instrumental complaint. Texting a friend to say the polar vortex is making your skin peel off is an expressive complaint. We call expressive complaints venting, kvetching, griping or a number of other names. It's important to know which of the two types of complaint is right for you before opening the first can of invective. Venting has its uses. In one study, Dr. Kowalski and some colleagues showed that when we are asked to put our feelings of dissatisfaction with somebody into writing, our \"positive affect\" -- good feelings, basically -- will rise about 15 minutes later, after an initial downswing. In the same way, if a meal lets you down, taking a pair of pliers and a blowtorch to the restaurant on Yelp might give you a brief lift. But once the rush of having gotten it off your chest is gone, you'd realize nothing has changed. You're still out the price of dinner, and you won't find out whether your grievance has reached the right ears unless somebody at the restaurant responds. Some owners make a point of scouring review sites so they can do just that. Others use the review's date and details to identify and get in touch with the kvetcher. But there are more direct ways to get your gripe acknowledged than scrawling it on the walls of the internet. \"If there's something that's really bothering you, the ultimate benefits are going to come from targeted complaining ,\" Dr. Kowalski said. \"Telling the person or restaurant.\" I know, I know. This is the part I avoid, too, by saving all my criticisms for my reviews. I hate confrontations, I run from them, I'd rather pay the check, even with my own money, and walk out never to return. But let's say you want something out of your complaint. Maybe you just want a rib-eye that's still rare instead of the overdone paving stone you were served. Or you have a reason for wanting an item taken off your bill. Or (and I think this is what most people are looking for when they complain) you just want somebody to look you in the eye and say: \"So sorry about that. Is there anything we can do to make it right?\" Whatever you want, you're more likely to get it if you have a word with a manager either before you leave or later on. As a side benefit, you'll be helping the restaurant, too; when somebody is un happy at the end of a meal, almost any manager or restaurateur wants to know. \"We actually really welcome complaints,\" said Melinda Shopsin, a film producer who cooks and waits tables at Shopsin's, her family's restaurant on the Lower East Side. This may come as a surprise to anyone who has heard the numerous accounts of customers' being tossed out of Shopsin's for any number of arcane infractions. And yet, Ms. Shopsin says that when her mother was still alive, she would ask what was wrong when she saw an unfinished plate, and then take a bite to see for herself. At other restaurants, this exploratory bite may happen backstage, in the kitchen. If you're going to make an instrumental complaint, though, you still need to figure out whether the reasons you're unhappy are subjective or objective. Did Medieval Times undercook the chicken, or do you just not like eating with your hands? Even if you're pretty sure the problem is objective, it can be useful to pretend it's subjective, for the sake of diplomacy. The chef John Tesar recalls a night, soon after he'd opened his Knife steakhouse in Dallas, when he got into an argument with a customer about the weight of a steak -- an objective complaint if ever there was one. \"We had a 33-ounce rib-eye for two,\" Mr. Tesar said. One customer who ordered it wasn't convinced and began \"screaming,\" according to Mr. Tesar: \"This steak is too small! This isn't enough to feed all of us!'\" He went to the table, and the hostilities quickly escalated, he said, until \"I went into the kitchen, got a scale, grabbed the steak, weighed it in front of her, and said, It's 36 ounces!'\" The story ends happily, with the two combatants meeting again at a dinner party some time later and getting along swimmingly. \"We both realized how absurd and insecure we were being,\" he said. All this might have been avoided if the complaint had been cast subjectively: \"That steak looks smaller than we expected. Are you sure it's the one we ordered?\" Subjective complaints are still important data for restaurants. If one person doesn't like the new hot-dog lasagna, it's an aberration. If 15 people don't like it, the recipe probably needs to go back to the workshop. The chef or owner needs to know this, but also needs to hear it in terms that won't lead to a screaming match in the dining room . Perhaps you have seen Gordon Ramsay critique another chef's cooking on television? Don't do it like that. In general, the more specific your complaint, the more likely it is to be understood. The worst, most useless and potentially dangerous complaints are broad, sweeping condemnations. \"There is complaining that makes you think about what you're doing, and there is complaining where everybody thinks they're entitled to say anything,\" said Rita Sodi, the chef and owner of the Tuscan restaurant I Sodi in Manhattan. \"Saying, This is terrible' is not complaining. That is being rude. It's like, You're ugly.' It's telling me that I'm ugly. It's personal. It's my food.\" Even when the person you're grousing to did not cook your pasta personally, you should proceed gently, in nonconfrontational terms. It may be helpful to imagine that you are speaking with an air traffic controller trying to land 20 jets during a snowstorm; you would try very hard not to add to the overall stress level in the tower, even if your child was on one of those jets. \"If you can be patient, open and polite, that's really helpful,\" Ms. Shopsin said. \"The more collaborative and open you can be -- Excuse me, I'm sorry' -- even though it's not your fault that it got messed up. People have to understand that sometimes to fix a mistake is not easy.\" And sometimes, a restaurant can make customers happy by changing something that isn't a mistake at all. Occasionally, diners at Shopsin's who had ordered migas complained about finding cilantro in the dish. Initially, the response would be that migas are supposed to have cilantro. Which may be true, but perhaps wasn't the point. Now, Ms. Shopsin asks customers whether they like cilantro. If the answer is no, there won't be any in their food, even if, strictly speaking, it belongs there. \"Complaints do help change things,\" she said.

{"id": 73, "data": " For most of its time on earth, the New York slice has not been seen as a product that needed tinkering. Yes, pizza in the city has been accessorized with toppings from crayfish (not bad) to Buffalo chicken (hmm) to Caesar salad (no, no, no, no, no). But the foldable, portable triangles of cheese, sauce and dough themselves were generally held to be a natural resource that was perfect as is, much like the soft, unfiltered city tap water claimed to be the source of their excellence. Some pizzerias try to make a better slice. Very few try to make a different slice. Mama's Too makes a different slice.

It is as if Frank Tuttolomondo, the owner and pie architect of this informal but very serious pizzeria on the Upper West Side, has learned how to genetically modify pizza. The bulge of crust at the edge of what Mama's Too calls the \"house slice\" is brown, more rough than smooth and baked to a ferocious crackle. You could tear it off and enjoy it on its own, or maybe with butter or olive oil, just as you can with the best Neapolitans. Yet the flat layer of crust on the bottom is firm, without the soupy center of the Neapolitan style. True to New York form, you can hold it in the air by the curved rim and it will stay flat and parallel to the floor. As they do at Totonno's and some other brick-oven pizzerias, Mr. Tuttolomondo lays the cheese down before the sauce. Rather than drippy, milky discs of fresh mozzarella, though, he covers the raw dough (after priming it with olive oil) in shreds of a slice-friendly variety that is known in the trade as low-moisture mozzarella and that the rest of us call pizza cheese. Over this, he ladles a few blots of tomato pulp. This helps the crust to bake through without getting soggy, keeps the cheese from sliding off the crust, and most of all lets you taste the tomatoes, which are very good. You could, I suppose, think of the house slice as a white pizza with tomato-sauce topping. After the pie comes out of the oven, Mr. Tuttolomondo sprinkles it with grated two-year-old Parmigiano-Reggiano. Basil leaves are the last to go on. At this point, you can pay, walk out the door and amble toward Broadway and 106th Street cradling your slice in a paper plate and taking bites as you go. In other words, you can have the traditional sidewalk pizza experience, but you will be tasting flavors you normally find only in high-minded sit-down pizzerias like Sorbillo , Ops or Una Pizza Napoletana . Those bloodhounds who follow the city's melted-mozzarella trail will recognize that Mama's Too is part of a great reawakening of slice culture. Unlike brick-oven pizza, which came from Europe and relied on preindustrial technology, the New York slice is a lowly American hybrid. It is baked in gas ovens, and the sheer number of places selling it suggests that it requires no special skill. When it is praised, we don't talk about its artisanal roots; we call it the humble slice, the street-corner slice, the slice of the common man and woman. The ordinary slice and its heftier cousin, the Sicilian-style square, were probably first rehabilitated with superior ingredients and a sophisticated understanding of baking by Best Pizza in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 2010. Today, serious pizza hobbyists talk about their favorite slices by reeling off the dough's rising time and hydration levels. North Brooklyn is still the center of the neoclassical slice movement, with L'Industrie and Williamsburg Pizza and, most recently, Paulie Gee's Slice Shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, but the forward-thinking slice is found in Manhattan, too, at Scarr's on the Lower East Side and Corner Slice in the Gotham West Market. The goal of the neoclassicists is, essentially, to return to the golden age of New York takeout pizza, which survives at places like Di Fara in Midwood, Brooklyn, one of the holy sites of the neoclassical church. Paulie Gee's Slice Shop, Scarr's and other neoclassicist joints cultivate a self-consciously vintage atmosphere, styling their logos and signs and interiors so they look like a place where Johnny Boy and Charlie in \"Mean Streets\" might have gone for a pepperoni slice and a Coke. Mr. Tuttolomondo does not fetishize the past. Perhaps this is because he lived it. For almost 60 years his family has owned a series of old-school slice joints in the neighborhood. The current incarnation is literally on a street corner, at the intersection of 106th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. It is called Mama's Pizza . He didn't open Mama's Too a block away to outdo his parents; he's bringing their product into a new era. If the neoclassicists are like the folk revivalists who collected old acoustic 78s, he is Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. When Mama's Too opened in December, it also served housemade pasta. It's still on the menu board that hangs on one wall, but Mr. Tuttolomondo has stopped serving it to concentrate on pizza. Besides the house slice, he also makes squares that he sees as a marriage of rectangular Sicilian pizza with Roman pizza al taglio. The crust is much taller than the Roman style, and taller than some Sicilians, too, but it is airy and chewy. On the bottom it has the bronze color, the cratered surface and the pan-fried crunch of the bread on a grilled cheese sandwich. The edges, where the dough meets the pan, have a gold fringe of browned cheese, known among students of pizza styles as a \"frico crust.\" This fringe is, of course, crunchy and delicious. The most impressive square is, I think, the pepperoni. Unlike most of the others, it incorporates tomato sauce. The mozzarella is baked until it begins to brown. The pepperoni slices are small and concave, like contact lenses made of meat. Crunchy around the rims, these little cups are half-filled with spicy red oil. It may sound as if I approached this slice with cool, analytical detachment. The truth is I ripped into it like a pack of hyenas. The other squares tend to be white pies with toppings. Again, tomato sauce is one of the toppings. In one case it's a thick and creamy layer of vodka sauce, one of the ideas that separates Mama's Too from the neoclassicists. Mr. Tuttolomondo also makes a cacio e pepe Sicilian pie, essentially a four-cheese pizza in which one of the cheeses is pecorino; the whole slice hums with black pepper. The square topped with Gorgonzola dolce and pears works in a way that combination often doesn't, although half a slice was enough for me. The shop is small, and if you sit at one of the handful of red counter stools you will share the small tiled floor up front with neighbors waiting for takeout and delivery guys. There are no vintage soda refrigerators or letterboard signs, but there is a small photograph of Robert De Niro eating pizza and a much bigger one of John Travolta in \"Saturday Night Fever,\" biting into his double-decker slice. The picture is in black and white except for the pizza. Tinted orange and red, it glows like a beacon.

{"id": 74, "data": " Earlier this year Henry, a new restaurant in the lobby of the Life Hotel on West 31st Street, quietly died. You wouldn't know it to look around the place on any recent night at 8, when a seamless playlist of hip-hop and R&B unspools as servers carry stacked beef ribs to what seems like every third table. What changed? In August, the chef Joseph Johnson , better known as JJ, was made a partner and assumed control of the kitchen. What he has done is less a makeover than a takeover; his imprint radiates out from his Afrocentric menu to animate the whole enterprise. The playlist, which can run from noon until 8 the next morning without repeating a track, is his. Mr. Johnson's initials now hang in the front window, flooding the nearby tables with pink neon. The initials have migrated to the restaurant's website as well, where its name is now given as Henry at Life Hotel by JJ . These are not subtle gestures, but subtlety has rarely saved a restaurant on the brink of failure. Mr. Johnson has been busy hiring new employees for the front and back of the house, and the racial mix he has already achieved is as impressive as it is rare. Diversifying a restaurant's service staff is one of the surest ways to diversify the audience, and on many nights brown faces and white faces, topknots and braids, headscarves and headbands, sit side by side, giving Henry more the appearance of a restaurant in Harlem than of one just off Herald Square. It was in Harlem, as chef de cuisine at a slinky neighborhood hangout called the Cecil and the history-drenched jazz supper club Minton's , that Mr. Johnson made his name. Fleshing out a notion suggested by Alexander Smalls, the consulting chef in both places, Mr. Johnson explored the African diaspora, the imprint that Africans have put on cooking around the world. He does something similar at Henry, although his view has grown to embrace flavors from, say, India and Southeast Asia that turn up in Africa and in diasporic countries like Jamaica and Barbados. He calls the menu at Henry \"Pan-African.\" [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] This is a big story -- too big to be told in full by one restaurant, or two for that matter. But it's an important story, and it certainly beats Henry's original idea of tying the restaurant to the history of Life magazine, which was once published in the same building, and to Henry Luce , who bought it in 1936, then radically remade it and moved it to other quarters. This concept was so wispy that Henry's first chef, Michael Vignola, resorted to an all-things-to-all-people menu of foie gras sliders and meatball pizza. Just how vast Mr. Johnson's scope has become will be clear by the end of the appetizer course. (Here I am assuming that you have chosen a traditional two- or three-course meal rather than eating all 15 items on the menu, in full and in order; this route costs $390 and is called \"It Was All a Dream,\" after a Notorious B.I.G. lyric.) There are littleneck clams, battered with rice flour and crunchy with shaved fennel and Asian pear. All of this is dotted with a tangerine-colored fluff of piri-piri sauce that is less ferociously spicy than the scalding piri-piris of Angola, Mozambique or South Africa. You are welcome to get a half-dozen, but at my table a full dozen went quickly. Benne seeds, the heirloom variety of sesame brought to North America on slave ships, add a flavor that is something like toasted almonds mixed with coffee beans to tuna tartare. The tuna is topped with a chip of curried peanut brittle and spooned over shiso leaves; you pinch the leaf and pop it in your mouth, where good things start to happen. And as you're adjusting to this cross-pollination of Africa and Japan, Indo-Caribbean cuisine appears on the horizon: a plate of folded roti with dips. The spinach chutney is a little joyless, but the inky purée of eggplant sweetened with dates is a terrific idea. Why Mr. Johnson puts a fried egg on the roti is unclear. When your meal at Henry is over, you may wish you had been sent home with a world map showing the history of forced African migration and spice-trade routes. While it's going on, though, you generally flow with the inner logic the way you can get into a hip-hop track without being able to name every last sample. Generally, but not always. I believe I understood some of the reasoning behind chopped collard greens and cashews tossed with a coconut dressing, but I still find raw collards somewhat rough going after the first few mouthfuls. Is the seared salmon with rice noodles, edamame and bok choy a reference to the Vietnamese community in Senegal? To me it tasted, not unpleasantly, like something one of the better Asian fusion restaurants in Manhattan would have served 20 years ago. Henry's shrimp and pork dumplings, on the other hand, are nondescript little blobs; they sit in an aromatic \"Harlem curry,\" informed by Bengali cooking, that deserves a better dance partner. You could say the same about the intensely herb-scented seafood broth in a seafood boil that Mr. Johnson calls the Afropot; the clams and king crab legs were very good, but the prawns were unappealingly soft and the mussels not quite fleshy enough. The cooking, though, has been getting tighter over the past month, picking up from a first and somewhat droopy meal on a night when Mr. Johnson was not in the kitchen. Tamarind jerk chicken had no spice to speak of. A parcel of rice supposedly inspired by Dominican concón had as much crunch as if it had been left out on the counter overnight, and the eggplant curry ladled over it tasted more like a halfheartedly seasoned tomato sauce. The second time I tried it, the rice had a golden crackle and the curry was worth paying attention to. Apart from the seared scallops in a remarkably good hominy broth with cilantro pistou, those bone-in ribs are the most rewarding main course. The rewards are not so much the short ribs themselves, though they are flavorful and tender; the thrill of the dish is in the battery of little sides like stir-fried millet, spiced black beans and a hoisin sauce I wanted to take home to keep on hand for Chinese-food emergencies. I also thought about pocketing a Foie Crispy Treat, and I would have gotten away with it because everybody else at the table thought they were too weird. Weird they are, but interesting, too. Maybe you'd be happier with the sweet potato pie in a crisp butter crust, very old school apart from the purple yam in the filling. True, at some point in your meal a hotel guest may decide to march through the dining room with a full set of luggage. But under Mr. Johnson, Henry is under no risk of being capsized by that kind of distraction. He has pulled the restaurant back from the edge of failure, and that's a rare trick.

{"id": 75, "data": " The rise of Sichuan food in New York has made the past decade or two a glorious era for prowlers of Chinese restaurants. Chongqing chicken and mung-bean jelly proliferated as skilled chefs flocked to the city. But while the miles of dan dan noodles and mountains of Sichuan peppercorns have been exhilarating, they have tended to overshadow the cuisine of another great chile-haunted region, Hunan. Part of the problem is nomenclature. The word Hunan on a restaurant's front window tends to say as much about the actual cooking inside as pandas and bamboo on the sign. At first glance it can be hard to distinguish Hunan Garden, say, from Hunan House until you see the menus and learn that the former name signifies egg rolls while the latter promises the red-braised pork that Mao used to dote on. Fake Hunans outnumber real ones, which is one reason to celebrate the appearance of Hunan Slurp . Operating in the East Village since May, Hunan Slurp lives up to both halves of its name. When people in Hunan get hungry for a bowl of noodles, what they have in mind are mifen: long, white strands made from pounded rice, so smooth they may slither right out of the chopsticks of inexperienced slurpers. Chances for New Yorkers to practice their antiskid chopstick techniques have been limited, generally speaking, to the rice noodles of other parts of Asia. When you could find Hunanese noodles around town, they tended to be tucked away on larger menus with so many other Hunanese opportunities that they were rarely given a chance to slither. Hunan Slurp offers some of those opportunities, too. The chef and proprietor, Chao Wang, comes from Hunan's second-largest city, Hengyang, and fills the menu with both traditional Hunanese dishes and his own innovations. But noodles are the heart of the restaurant. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] They peek out from underneath slices of beef, tofu and barbecued pork, all fanned out like a hand of poker, in a soup-less wonder called Hometown Lu Fen. The sauce is in the bottom of the bowl, and should absolutely be augmented with some of the chopped pickled red chiles in oil served in a small dish on the side. In the string bean mifen, the noodles weave around a fried egg and a scattering of ground Berkshire pork, stir-fried to a crackle with little rounds of sliced, pickled green beans. There is no slick of chile oil on top, and the pale broth looks harmless enough, but once the soup is stirred together it will take the crease out of a pair of newly pressed trousers. A little red sheaf of dried chile threads bobbing in the wild pepper and beef soup gives you an idea what you are in for, if the name hasn't already given away the game. But with Hunan Slurp's noodles, as with Hunanese food generally, heat is part of the message; it's never the medium. Stock is to the cook what pitch is to the opera singer, goes a Chinese proverb. Hunan Slurp's soup stocks are rounded and cloudy from long-boiled bones and meat, and they tend to get better the longer they linger with their toppings. (So do the noodles.) A master class in the art of broth subtlety is provided by the two-part soup that goes by the under-promising name fish fillet mifen. Part One is an oversize ceramic bowl of milky white pork-and-fish stock strewn with flower petals, pea shoots, purple basil and other fresh herbs. It arrives on a wooden tray next to Part Two, the noodles, which get their own bowl. The broth's flavor was elusive at first, more a texture than a taste. Within minutes the steamed fish in the broth, together with the herbs, had transformed it into something splendid. Like many of the new Chinese restaurants that have sprouted in the East Village, Hunan Slurp pays attention to appearances. Under a backlighted logo that spells out SLURP in elongated, noodly letters, a sheet of glass on First Avenue frames the long, tunneled dining room, designed by New Practice Studio . The interior is sheathed in wooden slats that run up one wall, arch their way across the ceiling and fall down the opposite wall. Depending on your frame of mind, eating at Hunan Slurp can feel like sitting under a rack of drying noodles or finding yourself inside the belly of a particularly tidy whale. A glassed-in kitchen lies in the back, its shelves stacked with colorfully glazed modern Chinese plates and bowls that you won't find in the restaurant-supply shops on the Bowery. Once you leave the noodle section of the menu behind, it is possible to find cooking that doesn't necessarily live up to the standard set by the crockery. I'm told that the bands of cumin-seasoned beef speared with toothpicks can be crisp and well-browned, but the ones I got were gray and floppy. And the sweet-and-sour spareribs, an appetizer, were far more sweet than sour, and tough, too. On the best available evidence, Mr. Wang's palate skews a bit sweet. This is unusual in a Hunanese kitchen, but only those spareribs were off-puttingly sugary. A multicolored salad of chilled cherry tomatoes was bright and refreshing despite a fruity marination in plum juice. (A similar dish sometimes turns up at Hao Noodle and Tea by Madam Zhu's Kitchen , where it is sweeter, and still very enjoyable.) And the hint of sugar in stir-fried chicken did not soften the toothy bite of young ginger, or hide the ginger's natural sweetness, either. You may not notice the bias toward sweetness anyway, given the kitchen's open embrace of chiles. An electrical current of heat crackles through the dim-sum-style chicken feet, cooked until they are falling-off-the-toe tender. Bright green chiles animate a stir-fry of julienne potatoes, cooked so fast they're still stiff. They also bring not just spice but crunch to a classic Hunanese sauté of pork and garlic topped with an egg fried to a ruffled, golden crisp. The chiles knocked around in a very hot wok with sweet, juicy cabbage are small, red, sun-dried and noticeably fruity under their mouth-zapping heat. The spice level is more subdued in the excellent stir-fry of pork and smoked tofu, and it's almost undetectable in a very likable preparation of skinny eggplant sections topped with discs of bell pepper; the skins are left on the eggplants, which gives the appetizer something of the appearance of tuna maki wrapped with purple seaweed. Meals tend to move quickly. For this you may be thankful on busy nights when those wood slats go from attractive design elements to unnervingly effective sounding boards. As in other Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood, the crowd tends to be young, bright, quick and eager to get on with the rest of the evening. As the dinner rush ends, the howl subsides. Maybe ice cream is on the agenda, or a classic dessert soup of mung beans and barley in syrup. Or maybe a pot of tea, loose-leaf, brewed at the table while you think about chiles and rice and pork and wonder how many more Hunanese chefs can be persuaded to settle down in New York.

{"id": 76, "data": " A card is set down in front of you before each new course arrives at Atomix , the tasting-menu restaurant in Murray Hill run by Junghyun Park and his wife, Jeungeun. Each is printed with a boldface transliteration of a Korean word under an abstract design of geometric shapes and lines. They look like flashcards from a school run by progressive graphic designers. \"Your first course is guk, which means soup,\" a server will say. \"This card is for hwe, Korean for raw.\" \"Jorim is next. Jorim means it's been braised.\" This sounds as if it would get old, but it doesn't. Very early on, you learn that on the other side of these vocabulary exercises lie dishes of wonderful intricacy, sophistication and beauty. One after another, each of the 10 courses in the $175 meal opens up new ideas about Korean cuisine and culture. In the Atomix pedagogical method, instruction is followed closely by reward. (While we are working on vocabulary: The restaurant's name is pronounced, somewhat counterintuitively, a-toe-mix.) [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] Many of the rewards are the kind you eat, of course. Guk-which-means-soup is a shimmering broth that Mr. Park, the chef, makes from fermented tomatoes and kelp; chilled and poured over scallop slices layered between slivers of green tomato that have been marinated in Korean fig vinegar, the broth has an electrifying sweet-sour balance. The dish may not scream \"Korean cuisine,\" but the next one does. This is hwe -- Korean for raw, you'll recall, and also the term for Korean-style sashimi. The fish is striped jack, brushed with plum vinegar sauce. Slices of it are folded around a mild fermented chile, a few drops of sesame oil and bits of kimchi made from cabbage and ramps. Sitting over each slice of jack is a crisp square of gim, which the Japanese call nori. Pinch some fish inside the gim and eat it, and the flavors that unspool are some of those that are brought to the table with Korean sashimi, but they're put together with a harmony that's hard to achieve when you swab them yourself under the influence of a few glasses of soju. Inspired by a poem from the Choson era, Mr. Park summoned an entirely different set of flavors for the hwe on Atomix's opening menu, which ran from late May to early September. Then, the fish was sea bream, firm and chewy, marinated overnight with ginger in a magnificently good tangerine vinegar from the island of Jeju. Eaten with sea urchin, plain spinach, sparkling shards of jelly made from pale young soy sauce, and Chinese-mustard leaves fermented in some wonderful way, it was so deeply harmonic I wouldn't have minded if Mr. Park had served it over and over for the rest of the meal. Centuries before it became the fashion among American chefs, fermentation was a pillar of Korean cuisine. Atomix exploits it in all kinds of ways. Fermentation bends a mix of juices from Korean pears, green apples and pineapple toward a cidery direction that makes it a thrilling marinade, braising liquid and sauce for exquisitely rich Wagyu strip loin. It's the foundation for an array of vinegars you won't find on the average table in Koreatown: cherry blossom, persimmon, mugwort, birch. And, of course, fermentation is behind the restaurant's arsenal of pickled vegetables, the most interesting of which may be the tart brussels sprouts that Mr. Park serves in banchan format alongside roast duck with a mole sauce that could pass muster in Mexico if Mr. Park did not up the funk level with gochujang. Some of these ingredients were fermented or otherwise preserved in South Korea. Many more were put up for storage at Atoboy , the Parks' other restaurant, over the past year or more as the Parks prepared to open Atomix. Atoboy's food is woven around traditional banchan dishes, and while Mr. Park gives himself room to play, the cooking there stays true to the fairly simple origins of banchan. His tasting menus at Atomix make a quantum leap in complexity. It's like seeing the guy who strums the 12-string guitar on the L platform pick up a conductor's baton and lead an orchestra through a Mahler symphony. On the back of Atomix's flashcards he lists the components of each dish, and each of their ingredients -- around 20 on average, very few of them ordinary and none of them out of place. Nothing at Atomix tastes confused or overburdened. The dishes are even more elaborate than those at Jungsik , the rarefied Korean-inspired restaurant downtown where Mr. Park was the chef de cuisine before he and his wife struck out on their own. And while Jungsik seems determined to stuff Korean flavors into an outdated French formality, Atomix is warm, contemporary and Korean at just about every turn. The Parks, who were raised in South Korea, hired a Seoul architecture firm, Studio Writers, to remake two floors of a secretive-looking townhouse on East 30th Street. Upstairs is a small bar where you can slither into a pale-leather booth to idle over smartly conceived snacks like soy-marinated scallop jerky; beef tartare, mixed with red and black pepper, and under a snowfall of pecorino; or fried wings stuffed with fried rice and dusted with ground Sichuan peppercorns. Stairs descend to a bright, skylit lounge of upholstered benches where the tasting menu kicks off with a couple of hors d'oeuvres and drinks. The idea must be for you to leave the shuffle of Manhattan behind in stages, but I always spent my few minutes in this way station eyeing the comfortable, dark, wood-clad den a few steps away where the rest of the meal is served at a 14-seat counter. The natural materials and simple lines in the tasting room seem to bow toward Korea's long Zen tradition, and a kind of purposeful calm reigns there. Servers and cooks all wear flowing, boat-neck shirts in a shimmering pewter color that gives them a slight science-fiction look; they are the work of a Korean-born New York designer, Sungho Ahn. Ms. Park, who goes by Ellia, glides behind the counter, smiling and holding out a cloth case to offer a pair of the Korean-made chopsticks she collects. They're beautiful objects, and so are the handmade plates and bowls that begin to file out of the kitchen, each made by a potter or glass worker or wood carver in South Korea. These artisans are identified on the menu cards, whose abstract designs are the work of a South Korean artist. Tasting menus can be arid and sterile when a chef doesn't have much to say. The format comes to life when a restaurant is overflowing with ideas, like Atomix. The way the Parks put Korean culture in the foreground recalls the early days of the Four Seasons, which moved beyond European models of formal dining by hiring an American architect and American industrial designers to go along with the American ingredients and even American wines. The Four Seasons had a Swiss chef, though. Atomix is more thorough: It has the Parks. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 77, "data": " During the five years Village Cafe has been open, I must have driven the length of Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn a dozen times without noticing it. At best I might have spotted the tiny parking lot in Midwood, with tattered red, blue and silver streamers flapping over its 10 or so spaces, giving it the appearance of the world's smallest used-car dealership. In the back is a wide, single-story structure that looks like the trailer office where you would sit down to discuss loan options with Marty from financing. But that building is an Azerbaijani restaurant that stands out among the dining outposts of former Soviet republics that stretch north from Brighton Beach, and each time I've gone inside I was given not a credit check, but a test of my appetite's limits. This is not just because almost every platter of food that leaves the kitchen at Village Cafe seems intended to feed an actual village. I run into trouble because there are so many things I want to order and so few things I am willing to leave on the table as the meal winds down. There will never be a time when I go to Village Cafe and decide not to have at least one qutab, if not all three. The menu gives the name of this delicate Azerbaijani flatbread, the diameter of a pita but thinner, as kutaby. Either way, it is very good when stuffed with minced, quietly spiced chicken or lamb. It is exceptional when filled with greens: spinach, scallions, and dill and cilantro, two fresh herbs that turn up again and again in Azerbaijani cooking. I will always want the crimped dumplings, the size and shape of chicken drumettes, that the English menu calls ravioli and the servers call pelmeni. Filled with chicken or lamb, these dumplings can be boiled, but the urge to ask for them fried is overwhelming, and the fried ones are better dunked in the tomato-pepper sauce that I would call salsa if I were not in an Azerbaijani restaurant. There will be liver on my table, too. Maybe it will be Turkish style, little fried cubes under a tart purple dusting of ground sumac. Or the liver may be added to bits of lamb hearts, kidney and testicles, and cooked with onions and potato cubes in a fantastically oily hash called djiz biz. Whether I will eat guru hingal will depend on how far in advance I've planned my meal, because it generally has to be ordered a day ahead. It is a noodle dish: very thin, wide sheets of pasta under a sauce of onions and ground lamb fried in its own fat until it is magnificently crunchy. If you poured chile oil over guru hingal, it would taste Sichuanese; stew the lamb with tomatoes and you could mistake the sauce for Bolognese. But it's from Azerbaijan, and it's good with yogurt. And I will have soup, even if nobody else does, because Village Cafe's kitchen understands how to make it. The kufta-bozbash is a strong, well-skimmed lamb broth with chickpeas and a single, tender lamb-rice meatball, as big as an apple. The broth for dushbara soup is similar, but the ballast is provided by miniature lamb dumplings about the size of M&Ms. Cilantro and dried mint are added to both soups at the last minute, and the mint is especially helpful. Village Cafe's hot borscht, strong and decidedly unvegetarian, outperforms some I've had in Brighton Beach. Instead of sour cream, it comes with a spoonful of yogurt. The cuisine of Azerbaijan often echoes those of its neighbors Georgia, Armenia and Iran, but other dishes, like borscht, were hauled down from Eastern Europe in the strong arms of Mother Russia. We can also thank Russia for the insane music videos that play on Village Cafe's two televisions, typically with the volume off while American pop of the '80s plays on the sound system. You sit at what appear to be varnished picnic tables with chairs instead of benches. The rest of the décor looks like a Brighton Beach yard sale: a mushroom cookie jar, an embroidered peasant smock, a camouflage cap, a samovar or two, a collection of beaded handbags, several ceramic cows, three statues of fat chefs with toques and mustaches, and two giant forks mounted on the wall. For atmosphere, Village Cafe is roundly beaten by my second-favorite Azerbaijani restaurant in Brooklyn, Old Baku in Kensington. Walk past the awning that says \"private club,\" past the curtained booths in the front dining room, past the open kitchen where chefs scoop burning coals to keep the fire under the kebabs going strong, and you enter a courtyard from another country. Almost everybody at Old Baku is smoking under the arbor of grape vines that weave around strings of white lights. If you go in the fall, you might be brought a plate of purple grapes, newly picked a few feet away. But Village Cafe gains its edge on Old Baku in the kitchen. The stewed fruit ladled over saffron rice in its plov, for instance, is a richer and more varied compilation of dried plums, apricots, chestnuts and deeply browned lamb. The salads are brighter, too, if you can get over some of the names. The menu was evidently written by someone with a weakness for poetry, so the salads are called things like \"Journey to Baku,\" \"Winter Fun\" and \"Unexpected Guests.\" The Journey to Baku is worth taking; it's a sharply seasoned, smoky eggplant mash with peppers and tomatoes. The kidney beans in a traditional lobio salad are creamy, salty and well-oiled under their topping of chopped walnuts and cilantro. Main course names incline toward the allusive as well, with one chicken cutlet called \"Miracle of Village\" and another -- buried under a white pillow of cheese and cream sauce -- that goes by \"Mother In Laws Chicken.\" But really, the best place to go once all the amenities have been polished off is the kebabs. The quail may be a bit wizened. The grilled testicles with a hint of lemon in their lightly browned surfaces will always be a niche proposition. But the lamb ribs, the marinated lamb chops known as chalahac and the flatbread-wrapped Azerbaijani version of kofte called lulya kebabs (made from chicken or lamb) are extremely good. The vegetable skewer choices begin and end with blistered tomatoes and softly collapsing eggplant. Both are worthwhile. So is the side dish called \"homemade potatoes,\" if there is any room left on the table. Sliced and fried with onions, they narrowly beat out the pretty good fries. A cup or two of strong dark tea will speed your recovery from this onslaught. Dessert may not.

{"id": 78, "data": " Shrinking modesty is not the normal attitude for restaurants with a view. The Rainbow Room had Art Deco razzmatazz and its revolving dance floor; Windows on the World, before terrorists destroyed it, served cocktails in a room named the Greatest Bar on Earth. Manhatta , which recently opened on the 60th floor of an International Style tower downtown, doesn't follow their lead. It is the least show-offy skyscraper restaurant you've ever seen. The whole operation is very orderly and well behaved, apart from its refusal to spell its own name correctly. (The reference is to the Lenni Lenape name Manahatta, or Mannahatta, meaning \"island of many hills,\" but without the second \"a\" the name just looks incomplete. It's like a child named Henr.) A dedicated door around the corner from the building's main entrance brings you into a foyer that, with its sleek chairs and coffee tables, looks like the lobby of one of those 1960s white-brick apartment buildings in the East 40s and 50s. When you get out of the elevator -- it goes to just one floor, the top -- a short walk leads to another sparsely furnished sitting area, this one looking out the windows toward the harbor and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. When the lounge hasn't been rented out for parties and sealed off, it's busier than the foyer downstairs, but it still appears to have been designed for people who are waiting for their dates to get back from the restroom. In the other direction are Manhatta's bar, a longish counter whose seats face uptown, and its dining room, which looks both north and east toward Brooklyn. The color scheme, navy-blue leather and dark wood, might strike the Knickerbocker Club 's board as a little too conservative. An open kitchen has been dropped down into the middle of all this, but the overall design strategy is to sit back and let the windows do the work. Danny Meyer, whose Union Square Hospitality Group runs Manhatta through a management contract with the building's owner, told The New York Times last year that Manhatta would not be as flamboyant as a typical top-floor restaurant. \"Those kinds of places often do not live up to expectations; they try too hard to live up to the view,\" he said. \"I expect to conceive of it like a ground-floor restaurant, as a place people might want to visit regularly.\" You can't blame Mr. Meyer for not wanting to open a mediocre splashy restaurant, but Manhatta flirts dangerously with being a mediocre unsplashy restaurant. The chef, Jason Pfeifer, doesn't quite let that happen. His French menu, grounded in seasonal flavors, is fairly priced at $78, including tip, for a three-course prix fixe. A good amount of it is very likable, but there are more spongy patches than there probably should be. At their best, Manhatta's better appetizers and main courses are fleshed out with fruits and vegetables so ripe and pristine they seem to come from a Greenmarket stall that only Mr. Pfeifer can see. A melon and cucumber salad with fluffy curds of feta was an exploration of melonic potential; each section of fruit was a bit different, some infused with citrus, others dripping with unfiltered garden-patch sweetness, all of them tangy with white balsamic vinegar. An admirably cooked brick of halibut was paired with bittersweet fennel bulbs and a mustard sauce with a gentle but effective bite. Raw nectarine crescents, braised lettuces and tender thin wheels of immature corn on the cob augmenting a main course of chicken were their charming selves, and all the better for their slinky dressing of chicken jus. Sweet black figs stood in for apples in a memorable little tarte Tatin garnished with raw pale-green figs. (Jennifer Bretania and Vanesa Beltran share the pastry duties.) Gently marinated hen-of-the-woods mushrooms made an exquisitely woodsy counterpoint to ruffles of shaved La Marotte sheep cheese. But generous applications of produce don't always save the food from seeming a bit safe, conservative and slightly dated. Mr. Pfeifer, who spent eight years in the kitchen at Maialino , Mr. Meyer's Roman-inspired restaurant, is now cooking French food in the post-nouvelle mode that Daniel Boulud has been artfully fomenting for years. Mr. Boulud has earned the right to keep working in that groove as long as he likes, but it's strange to find a young chef at a new, high-profile destination doing it when others around the city are pushing ahead with contemporary interpretations of French cuisine. And when Manhatta turns to the classics, its use of French idioms seems skin-deep compared with Laetitia Rouabah's light touch and sophisticated technique at Benoit , or Marie-Aude Rose's painstaking elevations of cafe cooking at La Mercerie , or Daniel Rose's intelligent, neoclassical excavations of silver-cloche cuisine at Le Coucou . Where Le Coucou brought back quenelles as helium-light pike dumplings in dizzyingly rich lobster-brandy sauce, Manhatta turns them into quivering balls of pudding distantly scented with seafood. Of all the ways a modern chef might grapple with cassoulet, the sublimely burly Languedocian assault on the digestive system, upending it over a crisp and golden chicken paillard has to be one of the strangest. Manhatta isn't the first restaurant to update veal blanquette with meat that's roasted rather than stewed, but the sauce is so blandly milky that it's hardly there. And while modern desserts can stray into savory territory more than they did in Escoffier's day, a vanilla soufflé with butterscotch sauce probably shouldn't taste salty. Some of this was dispiriting, but I never got up from the table in a bad mood. There are grace notes throughout the restaurant, like the dark, shiny little canelés that show up with dessert. This being a Union Square Hospitality production, the servers seem to be trained mind readers. A pair of the mismatched binoculars scattered around the restaurant materialized just when I was trying to locate the clock tower in the Consolidated Edison Building; before I'd had a chance to point out a fruit fly in my wine (did it ride up with me in the elevator?) a sommelier spirited the glass away and brought a fresh one. Mr. Meyer was probably right to take a dialed-down approach to the top-floor restaurant genre. It dates from a more innocent age, when people could look at the financial district's unblinking grids of lighted windows as the bland face of high-stakes cheating that we've come to recognize from \"Margin Call\" and \"Billions.\" At the time of the financial crisis, Manhatta's building was the headquarters of JPMorgan Chase -- a relatively minor player in the three-card-monte game of mortgage-backed securities, but a player nonetheless. Ten years have gone by, but it's still too soon for revolving dance floors. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 79, "data": " Sometimes when I am waiting, and waiting, for a barista to steam milk for my cortado, I like to pass the time by imagining what life would be like if Howard Schultz had boarded the wrong plane in 1981 and flown to Penang instead of Milan. Starbucks, the company he joined after that trip and would eventually lead , might teach its employees the fine arts of Malaysian kopi, brewed by pouring hot water over grounds in the bottom of a sock, rather than show them how to operate an espresso machine. Instead of white-chocolate mocha lattes, we would drink bek-kopi, white coffee, brewed from beans that are lightly roasted in palm oil margarine. Venti would just be Italian for a number, while kopi-C kosong, or strong black coffee with unsweetened condensed milk, would have entered the American lexicon, along with kopi tarik, the same drink made with sweetened condensed milk. There would be no competitions where baristas drew swans and elephants in milk froth, and in their place we would have exhibitions of coffee and tea pulling , the art of cooling the beverage while coaxing the milk in it to form a foamy head by pouring it from one pot to another in long, swooping, steamy cataracts. In other words, the places where we get our caffeine fix might look a lot like Kopitiam , on East Broadway in Chinatown. Kyo Pang founded Kopitiam three years ago as a homage to the coffee and tea parlors of Malaysia, where she grew up. A typical Malaysian kopitiam is a ramshackle hangout where people drop in to read the morning paper, grab breakfast, catch up on neighborhood gossip and do all the other things that classically accompany a cup of tea or coffee. Something of that spirit pervades Kopitiam, too. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] The original Kopitiam, reviewed by Ligaya Mishan in a 2015 Hungry City column, was situated around the corner on Canal Street and had just four seats at a single counter. In June, Ms. Pang and her new business partner, Moonlynn Tsai, relocated to a larger, if still fairly intimate, space a few steps above the sidewalk. You order at the counter and receive a number on a metal stand, a kind of promissory note for the food and beverages. If you show up on a weekday in the morning or afternoon, when seats are not hard to come by and the room has a languid, unhurried air, you could get just a cup of bek-kopi and linger over it with a newspaper. You will probably want more than that, though. From 9 a.m., when the doors open, until 10 p.m., when they close, you can get nasi lemak, Malaysia's national dish and a particular favorite at breakfast. I don't know another kitchen in the city where the fragrances of coconut and pandan leaf infuse the rice as elegantly, or where the tiny dried fish, which Kopitiam fries with peanuts, form a caramelized crust that erases the distinction between sweet and savory. Or your breakfast could be a bowl of two eggs boiled just long enough to turn the whites opaque while leaving the yolks free to billow into mushroom-soy broth underneath. Or it might be fish ball soup, grape-size globes of ground fish in a cloudy white broth; if the grains of white pepper on the surface aren't intense enough for you, you can stir in a little fish sauce spiced with bird's eye chiles. Rice vermicelli can be added, too, but the soup is easier to appreciate in pure liquid form. For mornings when nothing but a cannonball dive into sugar will do, Kopitiam is ready with a sculptural pile of thick-cut French toast battered with Milo malt-chocolate powder, a Malaysian passion, with streams of sweetened condensed milk playing the part that in this country is normally taken by maple syrup. Eat the whole stack and you will know the answer to the musical question posed by the Cramps: How far can too far go? At 10:30 a.m. Ms. Pang, the chef, adds a gang of new dishes to the breakfast crew, and all of them stick around until closing time. There are fresh little oysters embedded in a thin browned omelet, rice noodles in a chilled sesame-oil broth with a growl of chile heat and spicy skate steamed in banana leaves, the classic acoustic version of the dish that Max Ng plays with amplifiers and wah-wah pedals at Momofuku Ssam Bar . Any of these could make a small meal. But one of the most inviting aspects of Kopitiam is Ms. Pang's fidelity to the Malaysian love of snacks. Pandan leaves wrapped around a kind of chicken sausage; ground five-spice pork rolled inside bean-curd skins and fried; fried strips of mackerel sausage with a curry-leaf sauce -- any of them makes a fine appetizer, but each could just as easily be the entire goal of a between-meals stop at Kopitiam. For that matter, so could the small sweets like pulut: triangular, pandan-wrapped bundles of sticky rice tinted with blue morning glory flowers and spread with toasted coconut sugar or house-made coconut jam. Ms. Pang is devoted to cakes as well. You get the sense that if it were physically possible, she'd bake every cake she knows every day, but she settles for one or two in an unpredictable rotation. You may find the caramel-brown honeycomb cake, with its intriguing structure of hollow vertical columns at the bottom, or you may find her coconut cake, or there may be some fresh surprise. Snacks and sweets tend to get edged out of the spotlight in New York restaurants, where there's always pressure to order something big. This is, after all, a city that turned the casual tapas bar into the peculiar genre known as the tapas restaurant. There is no such pressure inside Kopitiam, at least on weekdays. Weekend brunch is another story, as it often is. The menu is the same, but the crowds thicken. A sign-in sheet is kept outside the door, next to the pink pay phone (25 cents; it works), and hopeful customers sit on ceramic garden stools at the top of the stoop listening for their names. When you're finally called, you may feel silly getting nothing more than tannic milky tea and a bundle of blue sticky rice. And when demand peaks, chaos can creep in, suggesting that Kopitiam is still figuring out the mechanics of its larger space. Servers may pop by anxiously to ask, \"Did you get all your food?\" and the answer may be no. Drink orders may stack up. Once the white coffee was off the menu; another time, no coffee at all was being poured; and for a short time one day, both coffee and tea were unavailable, an awkward state of affairs for a coffee and tea parlor. Even with a backlog of tickets, though, the food trickling out of the kitchen is almost unfailingly terrific. Maybe the stir-fried duck tongues I ate last time could have slid from their cartilaginous framework more easily. Then again, maybe I wasn't in the right mood for duck tongues.

{"id": 80, "data": " \"People always say summer is not a good time for sushi,\" Derek Wilcox said. \"I have no idea what they're talking about.\" Early evening, the end of August, and the granite TriBeCa sidewalks outside Shoji at 69 Leonard Street were deserted. The restaurant was empty, too. I sat alone on one side of the counter, and on the other stood Mr. Wilcox, alone, as he usually is even when customers occupy all 12 chairs. Although assistants work in the wings, the restaurant is essentially a one-man show. In the broad view, having the place to myself was unjust. In the year since Mr. Wilcox took over the restaurant -- at first his work there was termed a residency or pop-up, but in June the owner, Idan Elkon, announced that he'd put a ring on it and made the arrangement permanent -- he has firmly placed it in the top tier of the city's Japanese restaurants. On the basis of sushi alone, Shoji has few plausible rivals, and for sushi embedded within a longer, kaiseki-derived menu, it has no parallel. There should be no empty seats, no matter how many New Yorkers are off lolling at the beach. Taking a selfish view, though, I wasn't particularly unhappy to be the only customer. Mr. Wilcox, who grew up in Virginia, cooked at a kaiseki restaurant in Kyoto called Kikunoi for seven years and then spent three more at a traditionalist sushi parlor in the Ginza district of Tokyo. You might think of this as the equivalent of earning a master's degree followed by a Ph.D. in Japanese cuisine, and one side benefit of a meal across the counter from Mr. Wilcox is the chance to hear what he learned studying abroad. Show some curiosity and you could get a short education in the mineral-rich clay used by potters in the town of Shigaraki, or the various aliases and false names under which a particularly delicious, pink-fleshed fish known as akamutsu in Japan travels under when it is away from home. On this August night, I was about to get a two-hour schooling on the pleasures of summer sushi. Mr. Wilcox's opening move was a squiggle of what looked like short, thick noodles and turned out to be lengths of chilled eggplant; Mr. Wilcox had given them a cool bath in the light sauce in which icy coils of somen noodles are dipped in summer. Laid over the top were two tongues of bafun sea urchin, a species with the color of a nearly ripe persimmon. With one dish, he had shooed away the heat outside, shown off the uncanny harmony of urchin and eggplant, and introduced a minor theme of the night, the summer urchin harvest in Japan. This overture out of the way, Mr. Wilcox lifted what appeared to be a machete. This was a hamo knife, a heavy swath of sharp steel that can reduce the daggertooth pike conger's dozens of tiny bones to edible smithereens; before the first one was forged in the 19th century, he explained, the eel had to be fully cooked and separated from its skeleton. This hamo would be quickly scorched on one side and served with a lick of wasabi and puréed salt-cured plums thinned with dashi. Sashimi came next in the form of shioko, or kanpachi caught when it is young and its flavor is leaner and softer than it will get later in the year. This was followed by a local fish that in the spring Mr. Wilcox had told me he didn't like, striped bass. He had been working with it, though, salting it overnight and then grilling it until the skin crackled. Now I don't want striped bass cooked any other way. After this was Mr. Wilcox's nod to the kaiseki tradition known as takiawase, a plate of simmered vegetables and, in this case, seafood: a small potato, some Japanese eggplant, a crisp pink ginger shoot and the most flavorful piece of octopus I have ever put in my mouth. After my first meal at Shoji I learned to hope that chawan mushi, a bowl of steaming-hot tofu custard, was on the menu. In spring Mr. Wilcox made it with spot prawns, but tonight, in homage to clambake season, he was serving lobster chawan mushi. To this point, the menu had faithfully followed kaiseki's ritualized sequence of courses and its stopwatch-precise attention to seasonality. It was about to veer in a different direction, but it was enough to suggest that Mr. Wilcox could open a kaiseki restaurant that would set a new standard in the city. I'm not sure the city would support it, but it would be spectacular while it lasted. The different direction, of course, was sushi. Accounting for just about half the Shoji menu, the sushi portion is briefer and offers less variety than the full monty at, say, Sushi Amane or Ginza Sushi Onodera . But I'm not sure any competitor outflanks Shoji on the quality of the seafood it does serve, or in the timeliness with which it serves up exactly the specimens most worth tracking down at any given moment. In spring, when bioluminescent firefly squid are spawning in Japanese bays, Mr. Wilcox gets them. In August, when cuttlefish are thumbnail size, unbelievably smooth and as meltingly soft as the thinnest sheet of nova at Russ & Daughters , he will lay three of those over a single finger of rice. He tracks bluefin that has been caught from healthy stocks, like the o-toro from Ireland that he served last spring and that was so seductive it could have been captioned \"the guy she told you not to worry about.\" While in Japan, Mr. Wilcox learned to make fresh ikura from sacs of salmon roe, a slow process that requires massaging the eggs apart by hand in many changes of water. Normally the roe is then heavily cured with sugar and salt, but the roe he was serving last month was very lightly seasoned before being spooned into a shot glass and served as is -- sticky, fatty, sweet and fresh. After the last piece of fish, the kaiseki format kicks in again with a soup, which may be as simple as a classic bowl of miso or may break with tradition, like the extraordinary corn soup I ate in August. There will be something cold and refreshing, maybe a granita made from ginger or matcha, and finally a more substantial dessert. Sometimes this is a sort of tart with seasonal fruit -- candied kumquats, maybe, or white peaches and blueberries -- arranged in a mochi wafer called monaka. For all this the charge is $252, service included. A shorter menu is available at $190, or a longer one at $295, again with service included. That service is somewhat minimal; lately it has meant a single employee assiduously refilling water glasses and taking orders from a drinks list whose cheapest item is a $12 bottle of beer. Could my server have been more adept at deciphering the wines, sakes, shochus and Haitian rums Mr. Elkon and Mr. Wilcox have put together? Perhaps, but I wouldn't necessarily want the scene cluttered by a sommelier in full pocket-square-and-cuff-links regalia. More employees hovering at the counter might take away from the bond Mr. Wilcox builds with the people he feeds. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 81, "data": " Considering the history, the influence, the depth and the sophistication of Iranian food, it has always seemed unfair that New York City has so few places to eat it. Unfair to the cuisine and unfair to would-be eaters. If you want a symbol for the state of the cuisine in New York City, Taste of Persia NYC will fit the bill. Until recently I might have called it the city's most promising Iranian kitchen, if the word kitchen weren't such a stretch. Taste of Persia is a takeout operation squeezed into the front window of a Chelsea pizzeria, except during the two months when fire damage forced it to take up temporary residence in a holiday market. It does show off some of the pleasures of the Iranian table, but not the table itself. So a new Brooklyn restaurant called Sofreh , which joined the Iranian ranks in June, would have caused a stir even if the cooking weren't quite as good as it is. The dining room is spare and modern, with exposed rafters, molded plywood chairs and shades of soft white. You have to look carefully to see the breaks with garden-variety minimalism, like the echoes of medieval arches behind the bar and the Persian calligraphy carved into the plaster in the back, where a small deck hangs above a garden. Minimalism surrenders entirely in the bathroom, papered in a pulpy collage of posters from pre-revolutionary Iranian cinema. All summer, Iranian expats and hopeful fans of Iranian cuisine have been filing in, armed with questions: Does the saffron rice stand high in voluminous heaps of discrete grains? Are nigella seeds embedded in the dimpled, golden crusts of the oval loaves of barbari? Do the cold shards of sorbet frozen around threads of noodles in Sofreh's faloodeh contain just enough rose water to soften the bite of lime syrup? Check, check and check. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] The main dining room is on the street level of a Prospect Heights brownstone just off Flatbush Avenue, and the food is largely in a domestic mode. Nasim Alikhani , who owns the restaurant with her husband, Theodore Petroulas, is responsible for the menu. Ms. Alikhani has never worked in a restaurant before. Rather than following the plating fashions of more trend-conscious chefs, she models the cooking after the things she might make when company comes over. Platoons of kebabs dominate the menus of other Iranian restaurants around town, but home kitchens are rarely built with vast indoor grills; Sofreh's cooking, entrusted to two chefs named Ali Saboor and Soroosh Golbabae, revolves around the oven and stovetop. A loaf of barbari, its crust baked to a Roman-pizza crackle in a revolving oven, is served with many of the appetizers, and it is always gone so soon that I end up ordering one or two more. This flatbread is of course ideal for tearing and swishing into the thick yogurt dips, one mixed with golden raisins and shredded cucumber, another with minced shallots and chives. It is indispensable with the eggplant mash enriched with walnuts, strained yogurt and sweet fried onions. A loaf of barbari is also spread with herbs and feta that is more creamy than briny. Earlier in the summer Sofreh offered an appetizer of dry, underseasoned beef meatballs with sour cherries. One of the only things on the menu that was hard to warm up to, it has been replaced lately by beef kofte, made light and tender by rice and stewed split peas. The kofte sit in a gentle saffron-tomato sauce that is another natural partner for Sofreh's bread. Ms. Alikhani, 59, grew up in the sprawling desert city Isfahan, and moved to the United States in her early 20s. For years she cooked Iranian dishes from memory, and it would be decades before she traveled back to Iran to learn more about its food in preparation for opening Sofreh. Her version of ash, the herb and whole-wheat noodle stew, stands out on the menu because it stays so close to tradition. Other dishes show the acclimatizing effect of New York. It's an article of faith for chefs in the city that any dish can be improved by putting a poached egg on it. I'm not so sure that Sofreh's smoked eggplant halves with their sweet, garlic-drenched tomato sauce need one, though. Is the watermelon feta salad familiar from restaurants that have nothing to do with Iran? Maybe just a bit, but Sofreh's version stands out for its intriguing sauce of nigella seeds crushed into mint oil. And while the Shiraz salad isn't chopped to fine bits in the traditional way that makes it something like Iran's answer to pico de gallo, its sour purple flecks of sumac distinguish it from the herd of tomato-cucumber assemblages. The menu is fairly concise, and occasionally I wished that it plunged into tradition with less restraint. For a dish called \"catch of the day,\" Ms. Alikhani has adapted ghalieh mahi, a tamarind-soured stew of fish and fresh herbs from southern Iran. In her version, a pan-seared hunk of whitefish -- halibut and cod have taken turns in the role -- is set over a long-cooked sauce. Dark with caramelized onions and fried cilantro and fresh fenugreek leaves, the sauce is hypnotically complex. Still, a sauce sitting under fish is not the same as one that has been cooked with fish so the flavors can get acquainted. A simple flattened and griddled half chicken, though, is a wonderful foil for a topping of tart barberries and a captivating sauce of dried Persian plums and saffron. And there's lovely simplicity to the braised lamb shank with roasted garlic and sizzled onions; the turmeric- and cinnamon-scented sauce might have been put on this earth to be spooned over fluffy rice. There is no shame in ending the meal with a goblet of thick yogurt parfait with jam and pistachios. But there are harder-to-find sweets, too, like the rose-water custard, grainy with rice flour, transformed into a sort of tart by a crust of chopped nuts. Saffron and rose-water ice cream is luxuriously rich despite a few stray ice crystals. And the faloodeh, one of the world's oldest frozen desserts, will put to rest all doubts about the wisdom of embedding sorbet in a nest of vermicelli, if there were any doubts to begin with.

{"id": 82, "data": " There was a time when there was only one Nobu, on Hudson Street in TriBeCa. When it opened in 1994, it was the first restaurant outside Los Angeles to offer Nobuyuki Matsuhisa 's startling new liaison of sushi and other Japanese food with Peruvian flavors. The herds of imitators were still to come. If you wanted to try raw yellowtail in ponzu under a green jalapeño wheel, or fried rock shrimp shimmering with spiced mayonnaise, or broiled black cod in miso so sweet it might have been maple syrup -- and for a few years it seemed as if that was all anybody wanted -- you either went to Matsuhisa in Beverly Hills, Calif., or you went to Hudson Street. Now you can eat Nobu ceviche in Dubai, Budapest and Cape Town. If you want Nobu sashimi salad for dinner followed by a night in a Nobu hotel, you can do that in Marbella, Manila, Miami or Palo Alto. When the United States Space Force establishes its first lunar base, the generals and majors will no doubt find a Nobu there, with tuna tataki on the menu and a line three-deep at the bar. This is because after the success of Nobu in TriBeCa, Mr. Matsuhisa and his partners made a strategic decision. The food would stay roughly the same -- more on this in a minute -- but the surroundings would grow bigger, boozier, louder, more theatrical. If Nobu did not exactly invent the Asian Party Temple restaurant genre, it certainly drew the blueprints. At these new Nobus, Mr. Matsuhisa's food was still a major event, but not necessarily the main event. And the question was not just whether you felt like eating at Nobu but whether you felt like being at Nobu. The Malibu location in particular has a reputation for intense good-time vibes that can drive away customers who merely want to eat. All this was encapsulated for me in two brief scenes from my recent meals at Nobu Downtown and Nobu Fifty Seven . The first episode took place while I was sitting at the sushi bar of Nobu Downtown. This location, inside the old AT&T tower on Lower Broadway, is theoretically the successor to the first Nobu; it opened last year a few weeks after the original closed. The sushi bar was the heart of the TriBeCa restaurant. The chefs behind it prepared or touched at least half the food, and seats there were so coveted that during the 1990s, when even celebrities complained about how hard it was to get in, a mostly sushi restaurant called Next Door Nobu was opened simply to contain the overflow. (It closed last year, too, and won't be replaced.) At Nobu Downtown, the upstairs sushi counter is on the far side of the cocktail bar that the design firm Rockwell Group slipped in among the enormous fluted limestone columns that fill the building's ground floor like a petrified forest. I had just eaten a piece of Japanese scallop sushi with a dangerous streak of wasabi when an animated group of four new arrivals appeared next to me. The sushi chefs eyed them warily, because they appeared to intend to cluster around a single stool, the way people do at a bar. Soon it became apparent that they thought they were at the bar. But the people they mistook for bartenders were all busy slicing raw fish, so eventually the group moved on to look for somebody to make them a drink. Moments like this didn't tend to happen at the original Nobu, but they do bring Nobu Downtown in line with Nobu Fifty Seven. In business on 57th Street since 2005, Nobu Fifty Seven is another two-story proposition. Between 5 and 7 p.m. its ground-floor lounge acts on young Midtown professionals like the fishing nets evoked by Rockwell Group's design. At the time the second scene took place, the bartenders looked as if they were struggling not to get caught. My cocktail, a Negroni-esque thing with sake in it that was ferried to my upstairs table from the downstairs bar, was neither shaken nor stirred; it was, in fact, almost hot. While I was waiting for the cocktail to be cooled by its single ice cube, a server was struggling to open a bottle of Champagne for a table of at least 10 men next to me. When the cork came out, he managed to spray the room in a manner usually seen in the Super Bowl champions' locker room. Everybody nearby got a little wet, including me and my guests, but nobody seemed to notice. Servers at both addresses have the brisk, well-drilled, impersonal and slightly numbed quality that comes of waiting on hundreds of people a day. At Nobu Fifty-Seven, one told me, \"Our menu is kaiseki style, so it's like tapas. Everything is meant for sharing.\" I must have looked confused because he added, \"Some dishes are going to be bigger than others.\" Nobu Fifty-Seven was given three stars in its last New York Times review , by Frank Bruni in 2005. That's what Ruth Reichl gave the original in 1995. After three recent visits to each location, I decided that, apart from minor menu variations, any qualitative difference in the food between the two branches is too subtle for me to make out. The chefs uptown are Taku Sato and Matt Hoyle. Downtown was led by Ricky Estrellado and Ryo Hasegawa until June, when Mr. Estrellado died suddenly. His successor has not been named. Both kitchens are models of superior ingredient shopping and consistent performance. When those classic Nobu dishes appear, they will be exactly like the last time you had them. In the case of the mayo-bathed fried shrimp, that may not be an entirely good thing. And I still think the flavor of the caviar that crowns tuna, or salmon, or yellowtail tartare gets elbowed out of the way by the wasabi-soy sauce. But the tiradito, slices of yellowtail squirted with lemon and yuzu juice, then dotted with puréed rocoto pepper, is always wonderfully bracing. The candylike black cod is as hard to deny as ever, even if the extra sweetening Mr. Matsuhisa gives this traditional Japanese dish strikes me as somewhat shameless. The sashimi salad and the lobster shiitake salads are both better than any salad from a global chain has the right to be. I don't know who orders the dishes marked Nobu Now, but I tried a few. Umami Chilean sea bass: not worth it, even for the slightly exotic return of a fish that hasn't been seen much since the '90s. Kumamoto shooters: a thrilling series of flavors that will recall the way you felt the first time you ate at Nobu. Michele Goldsmith's desserts, served both uptown and downtown, are modern and playful and don't try too hard to follow the theme, whatever that is. Over the years, the Hudson Street Nobu became something unusual, a restaurant that could serve tourists and families from around the corner with equal aplomb. But a meal at Nobu is still among the best, although not the cheapest, ways to introduce children to raw fish. And sitting at the sushi bar can still provide the intimacy that the rest of the place lacks. The chefs behind the counter may not draw the kinmedai cultists who flock to Sushi Zo or Sushi Ginza Onodera , but they know what they're doing, and they light up when they get a customer who can tell.

{"id": 83, "data": " The rustic little shop held out longer than many other Ukrainian outposts in the East Village. With its shelves of records, tapes, books, newspapers, dyed Easter eggs, the beeswax styluses used to give those eggs their symmetrical patterns, white smocks and blouses with red and black embroidery, and local honey, Surma Book & Music Company had operated on East Seventh Street since 1943. At other addresses, it went back to 1918. Two summers ago, it closed , going the way of Ukrainian butcher shops selling wrinkled sticks of hunter's sausage, Ukrainian restaurants offering starchy knobs of halusky, and Ukrainian bars where the customers were downing shots of vodka before that was cool, and kept going after it wasn't. The East Village is a less interesting place without Surma. But the chain-store monoculture that might have seemed inevitable as the Ukrainian community fell away hasn't been the neighborhood's fate. Not yet. New Chinese restaurants have sprung up in the area over the past few years faster than the old Eastern European business have died off. In January, one of them moved into Surma's old address. It's called Le Sia, and it's thriving. Walk in any weekend night between 6 and 9, and a small throng will be waiting for seats by the entrance, below the kayaks that are stowed up by the ceiling as if this were the garage of somebody's summer house. During the week, Le Sia takes reservations, but that doesn't ease the demand by much. On some nights, the crowd is almost exclusively Chinese people of college age or slightly older, many of them lured out of their nearby New York University dorm rooms for steaming pans of shellfish, especially Le Sia's specialty, crayfish. Although a server there described the restaurant to me as \"Cajun seafood,\" Le Sia is not serving Acadiana-style crayfish. Nor is it seasoning crayfish with the magical, butter-drenched combinations of Southeast Asian and Louisiana flavors like Thai basil-tamarind and lemongrass-ginger that were spawned in Vietnamese kitchens along Bellaire Boulevard in Houston. Yang Liu and Tianye Chen, who own the restaurant along with its chef, Zac Zhang, are following a separate, unbuttered Chinese tradition that they enjoyed before moving to the United States. It's a fairly young one, as Chinese food traditions go. Crayfish, or xiaolongxia, arrived in China sometime in the middle of the 20th century. After regarding the novel ingredient warily for a few decades, cooks built a cuisine around it. Eaters took to it so enthusiastically that by 2016 the Chinese crayfish industry employed five million people and was worth $27 billion. One major farming center is Hubei province, which recently unveiled a 59-foot-long crayfish sculpture that is said to be the world's largest. Its bright-red pincers are raised victoriously . Le Sia cooks crayfish and other shellfish -- lobster, shrimp, and Dungeness and snow crabs -- by boiling them first and then clacking them around in a hot wok with one of seven sauces. Each sauce can be further customized to one of four chile-heat levels, from mild to \"fire.\" Whatever combination of sea animal and seasoning you ask for, it will arrive at the table almost before the words have left your mouth. For many customers the go-to order seems to be \"crayfish hot and spicy, spicy.\" Hot and spicy sauce, as far as I can make out, is based on soy, miso and garlic; the firepower comes from sliced pickled chiles, but the soy and miso give it a muscular heft. It may be my favorite Le Sia sauce, although it's a close call between that and its near relative, \"numbing and spicy,\" which is propelled into tingling ma la territory by Sichuan peppercorns. I'm fascinated by the kimchi-lime sauce, which conforms to no seafood-boil tradition I know of; its flavor is angular, hybridized, invigorating and not as fiery as you might expect. The garlic sauce hits just one note, and there will be no prizes for guessing which one. There is also a sauce called \"thirteen special-flavor herbal spices.\" I tried it twice, with wildly divergent outcomes. The first time it was a wonderful, nuanced aromatic blend of expected and unexpected Chinese spices. On a second try, it tasted like spiced seawater. The star ingredient can vary, too. Honesty compels me to note that the California crayfish Le Sia has been serving lately have a sweeter, finer flavor than the ones it was getting from Louisiana in the late spring. This will no doubt cost me some friends in New Orleans. On the other hand, those friendships are already on the rocks over my newspaper's insistence on calling the crustacean in question crayfish, rather than crawfish. Le Sia's shrimp, in my encounters with it, was bland and powdery. Dungeness crab arrived overcooked, the meat desperately stuck to the shell. Snow crab was much better: sweet and flaky in the legs, although the white bits at the joints were slightly broken down. But every time I ordered lobster it was juicy and sweet. It may be the safest choice, although I haven't completely given up on the crayfish entirely. At $15 for what looks like a very generous pound, it's worth taking a chance. As for the risks of eating without a pair of plastic gloves, kept in plentiful supply in sealed pouches on the table, or one of the synthetic-fabric black bibs with their swirling red claw-and-antenna designs, that is up to you. A vast stretch of the menu is taken up by northern-Chinese skewers of vegetables and animal parts of many kinds. These tend to arrive even faster than the other dishes, if that's possible. They are not bad as quick, casual snacks, particularly the \"King of Kings\" hot dog, carved into pink lobes that stick out like cat tongues. But other skewers suggest an assembly-line approach that you don't find among the better street-corner grills in Flushing, Queens. The application of the cumin and red pepper seasoning is often just as heavy on delicate ingredients as full-flavored ones, and the grilling times don't seem to be monitored closely. Tiny squid legs, lamb kidneys and enoki mushrooms were all dry and overdone. So was a main course of quail, purportedly smoked over lemongrass and pine cones. Wok-fried clams in garlic sauce were delicious, though, as were many of the cold appetizers, like a rose formation of pickled radish slices; smashed cucumbers in garlic sauce; and Harbin sausage. A specialty of northern China, Harbin sausage immigrated there from Eastern Europe. Pink and dense with smoked pork and fat, it is deeply reminiscent of kielbasa. It's right at home in the East Village.

{"id": 84, "data": " Flynn McGarry arrived in New York three years ago as the chef of a pop-up restaurant, Eureka. He was 16 at the time, but he'd been charging money for tasting menus since he was 13, running an early version of Eureka in his mother's house in the San Fernando Valley in California. Earlier this year he opened a restaurant on the Lower East Side that is meant to be permanent, or as permanent as any business venture in Manhattan can be. This one is called Gem, which if nothing else proves he's better at choosing names now that he's 19. I haven't yet seen the new documentary about him, \"Chef Flynn,\" but over the past six years my media diet has not been lacking in news about Mr. McGarry's productive adolescent years. I first learned about him from a brief New Yorker piece written when he was 13, by which time he had made many of the recipes in \"The French Laundry Cookbook\" and cooked for a week at Eleven Madison Park. He was working several days a week in a Los Angeles restaurant and had apprenticed at Next and Alinea by 15, when he was the subject of a Times Magazine article . When he moved himself and his pop-up to New York at 16, I read that his cooking was influenced by his time in the kitchens of Maaemo in Norway and Geranium in Denmark. Still, as I walked into Gem the first time I was wondering, at some level, whether everyone had been too polite to tell him that his brownies needed more time in the oven. Of course, it would be nice to have the answer to that before you buy advance tickets for the eight- to 12-course meal at $155 a person, the only way to reserve a seat. But it doesn't take more than a few minutes at Gem to see that the adults weren't just humoring Mr. McGarry. His cooking is nuanced, his plating is often lyrical and the flavors, at least this spring and summer, have been delicate, subtle and very fresh. The vegetables and fruits he uses in profusion look and taste as if they had dropped off the vine right on to the hand-spun, earth-toned ceramic dishes. My favorite Gem dish so far, delicate and self-assured, was a morsel or two of grilled king crab legs lightly glazed with rose petal miso and set beside soft chamomile-scented potatoes for ballast, red currants for zing and some fluttering rose petals on top for the heck of it. A close rival was the chilled bowl of barely vinegared mackerel interwoven with grilled cucumbers, sliced plums and salty red dabs of mashed fermented plums. The harmonies were right on key, with a Japanese mood that didn't cross the line into outright imitation. White asparagus, an ingredient that seems to flummox some American kitchens, was subjected to a wonderful treatment, patiently browned and basted in butter, then finished with a reduced chicken jus that had a glimmer of vadouvan in it somewhere. Strewing the plate with tender, pale-green pine needles seemed like an affectation at first, but their flavor lifted and brightened the whole package. Mr. McGarry does fine work with deeper flavors, too. Each menu crescendos in a complicated, multicomponent spread, and the best of these featured lamb: barbecue ribs rubbed with cracked coriander seeds and XO sauce, plus a skewered grilled lamb kebab and a tomato salad. Another night built up to an exhibition of squab. A leg, perfectly cooked and sweetened by a maple jus, was very good, but the high point was a very thin and hearty rye cracker spread with squab liver, cherries and pickled ramps; the fruit's bright notes were played off against earthier ones so skillfully they almost shimmered. Back in the family home, and at the Eureka pop-up, Mr. McGarry used to make everything himself. Now he works alongside two cooks, bringing the kitchen team at Gem to the same size as that of my neighborhood slice joint. Some small defeats could be attributed to Mr. McGarry's lack of experience with weather patterns in the Northeast. A warm beet, languorously braised in smoked beet juice until it is soft and sticky like salt water taffy and then basted with a beet-based bordelaise sauce, was impressive in June. In July's heat wave it was as welcome as a space heater. And maybe he wouldn't have served starchy grilled peas if he'd known how quickly the summer sun can make them tough. By the way, Mr. McGarry doesn't make brownies, at least not at Gem. Dessert after each of my three meals was more or less the same thing: bowls of ripe berries, served one night with whipped cream infused with chamomile and rose hips and another time with bay leaf and bee-pollen ice creams. You couldn't ask for a more refreshing course on a hot summer night, but at the same time it's clear that he has room to grow as a pastry chef. Dessert is served on low coffee tables in a loungey space called the Living Room, which by day doubles as a cafe selling pastries and sandwiches on housemade bread. Rousting diners from their tables in the dining room (called, aptly enough, the Dining Room), probably seemed like a good idea on paper, but in reality it's a bit silly. It's one of several hiccups that keep a meal at Gem from gliding smoothly along. Servers may shoot their cuffs before fiddling with some small detail of the table setting, a fussiness that is not in keeping with the graceful, relaxed tone of the cooking. Wine glasses could sit empty for long stretches and the wines themselves, both whites and reds, were almost always too warm. That Mr. Flynn is more polished as a chef than a restaurateur is understandable. He may need a more experienced partner to straighten out the dining room, and to help him edit the menus, too. With each meal, I had the sense there were at least two superfluous courses, and occasionally Mr. McGarry seems to be straining as he reaches for the sort of razzle-dazzle you'd get at Alinea or Eleven Madison Park. An elaborate lobster course one night looked amazing, but wasn't. An attempt at eggplant carnitas, with an underseasoned salsa of green strawberries and a charred, papery tortilla, was enough to make you wish Mr. McGarry had eaten more tacos before he left California. At times Mr. McGarry seems like a creative-writing student who fills his pages with footnotes because David Foster Wallace did it. It's too bad that he came of age in an era when many people believe that tasting menus are the highest form of kitchen artistry. Like the style of \"Infinite Jest,\" those menus have to be the result of ideas that can't be contained any other way; they're not a blank space to be filled in. Mr. McGarry obviously learned a lot from his mentors, but he can cook in his own voice now, and it may be time to leave his idols behind.

{"id": 85, "data": " Coco Pazzo is back. Those of you who did not eat out in Manhattan in the 1990s have no idea what I'm talking about. Those who did may now be having flashbacks to a rustic-chic Tuscan-esque restaurant, Coco Pazzo, which got a three-star Times review from Marian Burros in 1991 , and to its three New York siblings, all long gone. A restaurateur's name may be emerging from the mists of time -- the name is Pino Luongo -- and linked to it, the names of other vanished restaurants, Le Madri , Mad. 61 , Amarcord and Tuscan Square. For readers of tabloid gossip columns, images of pasta-twirling models and executives in Armani suits may be coming into focus, along with bold-face-laden squibs about the social scenes at Mr. Luongo's establishments in Wainscott, N.Y., and on St. Barts. If you have trouble believing that spaghetti and fettuccine once attracted what The Times critic Bryan Miller, reviewing Le Madri in 1989 , called \"the hugs-and-kisses-I-love-your-hat-Ciao-baby crowd,\" it may be useful to remember that this was an era when pasta was commonly thought to be a health food. Nobody has seen the Ciao-baby crowd in a while. (We'll have to send out a search party if it's not back in 10 more years.) So far that is not who goes to Coco Pazzo Trattoria , which is shaping up to be a reliable and fairly priced neighborhood canteen on the SoHo corner that used to house a deliberately unstylish bar called Milady's . On balance, Mr. Luongo's version of Tuscan food retrofitted for American appetites may be easier to see for what it is now that it has lost its fashionable gloss. (He is the executive chef; Pedro Cruz is his chef de cuisine.) When you order pappa al pomodoro and taste the juicy olive oil that slicks the warm, basil-flecked, bread-thickened tomato pulp, you're not earning bragging rights. You're eating soup, and a very good one. Nobody will think you're a culinary trailblazer if you get the cacciucco, either, but you can console yourself with the tender shrimp, scallops, cod and clams in the faintly spicy and fennel-scented broth. There are two ways to approach dinner at Coco Pazzo Trattoria. (By day the place is a casual outfit called Coco Pazzo Kitchen.) One is to order what Mr. Luongo calls a piatto unico, a helping of pasta next to a related something-extra on one rectangular plate. Baked littlenecks wobble next to a twirl of linguine and, nice surprise here, ribbons of zucchini soaking in a fine white clam sauce that is made with just the firm, sweet bits. Soft chicken-and-ricotta polpettine sit next to rigatoni in sugo, not on top, so you can have pasta first and meatballs second and tell yourself you're eating like a real Italian. Alternatively, you might go with the main courses marked \"Per La Tavola.\" For once these plates really are meant for sharing: a substantial stack of spiced and roasted baby-back ribs under a warm slaw of cucumbers and tomatoes, or a spread of grilled rib-eye slices served with a separate plate of \"Tuscan fries,\" distinguishable from the regular kind by their fried rosemary needles. Those fries may be awesomely browned one week but ghostly and uncrisp the next. The tagliolini cooked in the cacciucco broth as a second course after all the seafood has been eaten might be 60 seconds away from being al dente. I am not enthusiastic about the slightly tough squid in moist bread crumbs, baked rather than fried, although the dish has a following at Mr. Luongo's other restaurant, Morso, next to the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge. The soufflés that the servers try to sell halfway through the meal can be a little soupy. But the blueberry crostata is a genuine pleasure, its crust likably sweet and tender. And you'll appreciate the clean, bright flavors of a shot of Aperol dumped over grapefruit granita if, like me, you veer off-script and follow your piatto unico with a couple of main courses. SPEAKING OF laid-back restaurants where you can enjoy a pleasant and unpretentious summer meal, have you been to Yves? It opened without much of a splash about two years ago, despite occupying a handsome, spare dining room whose white interior makes the most of the afternoon sunlight that hits its TriBeCa corner, opposite the restaurant Locanda Verde. I missed the original chef's tenure, but lately I've been intrigued by the cooking of Alex Baker, who took over in February. She is Paris-trained, having gone to culinary school and worked at Spring and Le Chateaubriand there, before coming to New York to help open Rebelle in 2015. At Yves, she interprets French food with an appealingly relaxed, seasonal attitude. In early June she brought little bright-green favas and sticks of asparagus together with fresh-herb pappardelle, and if you're wondering what makes that French, the answer is a pistou loaded with tarragon and chervil. There was also a reassuringly gentle navarin of lamb, with a small spring garden in addition to the customary carrots and potatoes: grilled baby leeks and asparagus stalks, and tender chard stems. Pan-fried steelhead trout is on the menu now, with a smooth, pale-green sauce of cucumbers, melons and avocados pooling beneath a jumble of warm young cucumbers. So is a side dish of recently picked pole beans and string beans charred on the grill and dressed with toasted-almond vinaigrette. As interpreted by Ms. Baker, mussels Provençal are not the usual mound of black shells in thin pink liquid with a few slices of baguette; the shells are gone, the mussels are good fat ones and their sauce is more concentrated, augmented with tomato paste and roasted cherry tomatoes and garnished with thick-crusted cubes of toasted bread. The snails are more traditional, parsley-garlic butter sloshing around in their shells. If these land snails wondered what they were doing on a bed of seaweed, they didn't show it. There is some unevenness in the kitchen to be worked out. The fluke meunière may be sautéed to a textbook golden crackle, or it could arrive looking as pale as a fish belly. The country ham sandwich could use bread that's easier to chew than the crust-armored baguettes from Bien Cuit. The restaurant is large, and service tends to arrive in rapid bursts separated by long pauses. The wine list is very lopsided in favor of three-figure bottles, an irritating move for a fairly casual spot. But Ms. Baker seems to be making the best of it. It's hard to be cross with a restaurant that makes its own boursin and brings it out in a dish so big I could never manage to finish it, even with a stack of toasted baguette to smear it on.

{"id": 86, "data": " First he cracked the code. Then he rewrote it. French chefs who covet Michelin stars study the restaurants that get them, and the ones that don't, before deciding where to devote their money and attention. If there is a formula behind the rating system, which for many chefs is an article of faith, almost no one figured it out the first time. Joël Robucho n, who died on Monday at 73 , came closer than anyone . Mr. Robuchon's first restaurant, Jamin, was given one Michelin star in its first year. It got another in its second, and the next year it climbed to the top step, a three-star ranking. Mr. Robuchon was still in his late 30s. What could he do for his next trick? There were new dishes to invent, new honors to win, new employees to terrify. The chef Eric Ripert, who was one of them , has said that he still has nightmares about covering plates with the precisely sized and spaced dots of sauce that were a Jamin signature. Playing the kitchen tyrant, regularly berating young cooks for mistakes nobody else would notice, Mr. Robuchon embodied the old order. At the time, this boot-camp style of running a kitchen was state of the art. But it had already come to seem counterproductive, disrespectful and unprofessional long before his death. In retrospect, the internal forces that he gave vent to when he screamed at his cooks must have also tormented Mr. Robuchon. For most of his career he was restless, unsatisfied. At 51, he tried to retire; of course, it didn't last. In 2003 he returned, and this time he seemed determined not to give the Michelin inspectors what they wanted. L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon , his comeback, was staged in a former sushi bar in Paris. He retained the basic setup. Diners sat at a counter, and rather than nigiri and maki, they ate his spoonable pommes purées and langoustines fried inside a single leaf of paper-thin pastry. There were no tablecloths, no chandeliers, no elaborately carved and upholstered chairs that might have come from a garage sale at Versailles. Food was cooked behind the counter by chefs dressed in the same black tunics the servers wore. Sometimes the chefs even placed the dish in front of the diner. The French daily Le Figaro summed up the general reaction when it proclaimed, \"C'est une revolution!\" If you think the Figaro was overreacting, it's because the revolution succeeded. Today, expensive dining is more likely to mean stools and a counter than dining tables on a sea of carpeting. The trappings that Mr. Robuchon stripped away -- the linens, the large dining rooms, the kitchens kept out of sight -- were not just costly to maintain but, by that point, increasingly off-putting, especially to younger diners. Today we don't expect -- or even want -- carpeted, hushed spaces when we go out for meticulously prepared food. Mr. Robuchon was not the only chef of that era hoping to add to the restaurant experience by means of subtraction. In the same year, Paul Kahan and Donnie Madia opened Avec in Chicago, a long skinny restaurant dominated by its counter. Sitting on a bar stool was synonymous with eating at the chef David Chang's Momofuku restaurants in the first few years of his career, from Noodle Bar in 2004, to Ssam bar in 2006, to Ko in 2008. The project of burying the old-fashioned signifiers of luxury and replacing them with new ones has been, in fact, one of the major themes pursued by chefs over the past 15 years. But nobody made a splash doing it like Mr. Robuchon. And in the second stage of his career, he planted Ateliers around Asia, Europe and North America, accumulating 31 Michelin stars . No other chef has as many. This time, he had set the formula. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

{"id": 87, "data": " There isn't another bar in the city like the one that opened in February as part of the redesign of David Chang's Momofuku Ko. One thing that sets it apart is that it doesn't have a name. Credit-card receipts call it \"Momofuku Ko,\" even though it operates in its own little room with its own entrance. The door, a few steps past Ko's along the East Village alley known as Extra Place, is marked \"Ko.\" The menus don't give a name at all. They don't look much like menus, either. They're notebooks in which the items available, presented in a short à la carte list (in contrast to the hourslong tastings offered for $255 at Ko), are handwritten on a fresh page each day, by different employees using different pens. The date is at the top over a list of dishes that you will not find together anywhere else. Lately there has been a lucid, refreshing plate of raw sea scallops, sliced cold and mixed with fresh green shiso and folds of pineapple, red with ground chiles. Lightly cured fillets of sardine made a thrilling appearance last month in a brick-red oil flavored with paprika, cayenne, and other components of tandoori paste. Both were solidly in the tradition of Momofuku small plates that the world has known since Mr. Chang's Ssam Bar began remixing various Asian ideas after-hours. Both were wonderful. The savory pie stuffed with fresh-made pork sausage patties comes from another place entirely. You could tour the city's proudest French restaurants without coming across a more skillfully done puff pastry crust, notched like a pinwheel and baked to a deep mahogany. The pie costs $45 and typically serves two, sliced into half-moons. It is plated with a reduction sauce, as classical and French as it gets but with an insistent vein of acidity that somehow makes it modern. Even if you're used to the signature Momofuku move of white-knuckle bungee jumping from the high end to the low, certain juxtapositions may call for Dramamine. Alongside the masterly pork pie, you can find a $5 sandwich of pickled daikon and cucumber sticks inside a grilled and buttered Martin's hot dog roll. The pickle sandwich is just the thing to eat with the cold fried chicken that is battered three times, fried four times, brushed with a spicy mirin-yuzu glaze and served nearly at refrigerator temperature. I don't believe I've used that phrase approvingly in a review before, but then I don't think a restaurant has served me cold fried chicken as good as this before. By flipping through the menu pages you can pinpoint the dates when dishes were first served, and see others that came and went. The idea is for Ko's executive chef, Sean Gray, to use the bar as a \"field for research and development for our culinary team,\" according to the website. Ideas are auditioned or refined before they graduate to Ko, which I gave three stars in a 2015 review . Most menus, at least the ones that change over time, are works in progress, but few make that explicit the way the one at Ko's bar does. The cynical way to look at this is that bar customers are paying to serve as lab rats. This will not be everyone's idea of a fun night out. One recent evening, the menu was as meat-heavy as at Ssam Bar in the era when its menus still proclaimed, \"We do not serve vegetarian-friendly items.\" Among the more substantial dishes that night was a mixed-meat sausage stuffed into a chicken neck and grilled. One end of the neck was open. The other was still attached to the chicken's head. It was a sensational sausage, but it did nothing to make Ko's bar the kind of place that you'd take your new pescatarian friend. The bar, run collaboratively by Mr. Gray and Su Wong Ruiz, the general manager, works best for diners who don't need a multitude of choices to be happy. To the extent that it resembles other places, it's probably most similar to a wine bar, with its tight menu, its casual drop-in-and-stay-awhile air and its carefully considered list of wines by the glass, which it shares with Ko. Anyone who wants a whole bottle can order one from the full Ko list, a virtual who's who of cult winemakers in certain specialties such as grower Champagne, chenin blanc from the Loire Valley and Burgundy of all stripes. On the notebook page facing the handwritten menu are two more wines that Ambrose Chiang, the beverage director, is pouring by the glass for one day only. Recently I've lucked into a precisely shaped Côte-Rôtie from Domaine Jasmin and a Saumur from Romain Guiberteau whose self-assurance I envied. These specials can cost twice as much as the regular by-the-glass pours, which tend to fall between $15 and $25. I can't figure out why the wine-geek crowd doesn't bring tents and sleeping bags to camp out at Ko's bar. And I don't understand why the place is almost never crowded, despite getting a fair amount of press after it opened. The experimental nature of the menu can't be keeping people away; people expect that from Momofuku restaurants . The only dish that I thought wasn't totally successful was the fried zucchini made in the style of the fried chicken, and I was still glad I tried it. The prices are all over the place, but a meal here doesn't need to be expensive. While you are welcome to spend $100 on a sourdough crepe with 50 grams of white-sturgeon caviar, you can just get the crepe alone for $8. It is excellent: shiny with tangy cave-age butter, speckled with oregano cinders and crunchy from a pass over hot Japanese charcoal. The chicken, meanwhile, is $7 a piece. The only reason I can think of for the empty seats is that the place is so hard to sum up. Try this description, then: Imagine an eccentric, highly polished David Chang restaurant that the world hasn't heard about yet.

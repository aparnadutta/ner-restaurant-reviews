Of O O N/A
course, O O N/A
good O O N/A

fail O O N/A
everywhere, O O N/A

it's O O N/A

Considered O O N/A
and O O N/A
rejected, O O N/A
maybe. O O N/A
But O O N/A
overlooked? O O N/A
Not O O N/A
likely. O O N/A
I'm O O N/A
not O O N/A
sure O O N/A
that O O N/A
any O O N/A

could O O N/A

cuddle O O N/A
up O O N/A
to O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A

who O O N/A
isn't O O N/A

cuddly. O O N/A
But O O N/A
I O O N/A
wish O O N/A
I'd O O N/A
found O O N/A
ways O O N/A
to O O N/A
remind O O N/A
New O O N/A

that O O N/A
his O O N/A
breathtakingly O O N/A
pure O O N/A

was O O N/A

that O O N/A
was O O N/A

Which O O N/A
brings O O N/A
us, O O N/A

Mr. O O N/A

what O O N/A
is O O N/A
unmistakably O O N/A
the O O N/A
finest O O N/A
sit-down O O N/A
pizza O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
five O O N/A

(I O O N/A

any O O N/A

game.) O O N/A
Two O O N/A
years O O N/A
ago, O O N/A
I O O N/A
posited O O N/A
that O O N/A
Razza, O O N/A
a O O N/A
pizzeria O O N/A
in O O N/A
Jersey O O N/A
City, O O N/A
made O O N/A
"the O O N/A
best O O N/A
pizza O O N/A
in O O N/A
New O O N/A
York." O O N/A
I O O N/A
don't O O N/A
regret O O N/A
writing O O N/A
that, O O N/A
but O O N/A
I O O N/A
would O O N/A
like O O N/A
to O O N/A
point O O N/A
out O O N/A
that O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Mangieri O O N/A
was O O N/A
not O O N/A
cooking O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
city O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A
time O O N/A
and O O N/A
that O O N/A
Razza's O O N/A
chef, O O N/A
Dan O O N/A
Richer, O O N/A
has O O N/A
said O O N/A
that O O N/A
he O O N/A
began O O N/A
taking O O N/A
pizza O O N/A
seriously O O N/A
only O O N/A
after O O N/A
he O O N/A
met O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Mangieri. O O N/A
Una O O N/A
Pizza O O N/A
Napoletana O O N/A
saw O O N/A
a O O N/A
rush O O N/A
of O O N/A
curious O O N/A
pie-eaters O O N/A
after O O N/A
it O O N/A
opened O O N/A
on O O N/A
Orchard O O N/A
Street O O N/A
a O O N/A
little O O N/A
more O O N/A
than O O N/A
a O O N/A
year O O N/A
ago. O O N/A
But O O N/A
the O O N/A
last O O N/A
few O O N/A
times O O N/A
I've O O N/A
gone, O O N/A
there O O N/A
were O O N/A
too O O N/A
many O O N/A
unclaimed O O N/A
chairs O O N/A
and O O N/A
bar O O N/A
stools. O O N/A
When O O N/A
Anthony O O N/A
Mangieri O O N/A
is O O N/A
making O O N/A
pizza, O O N/A
the O O N/A
right O O N/A
number O O N/A
of O O N/A
empty O O N/A
seats O O N/A
is O O N/A
zero, O O N/A
as O O N/A
any O O N/A
New O O N/A
Yorker O O N/A
who O O N/A
waited O O N/A
in O O N/A
line O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A
old O O N/A
Una O O N/A
Pizza O O N/A
Napoletana, O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
East O O N/A
Village O O N/A
from O O N/A
2004 O O N/A
to O O N/A
2009, O O N/A
could O O N/A
tell O O N/A
you. O O N/A
Press O O N/A
interest O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
new O O N/A
place O O N/A
has O O N/A
died O O N/A
down, O O N/A
too. O O N/A
So O O N/A
when O O N/A
I O O N/A
heard O O N/A
a O O N/A
rumor O O N/A
that O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Mangieri O O N/A
was O O N/A
thinking O O N/A
of O O N/A
leaving O O N/A
the O O N/A
city O O N/A
and O O N/A
taking O O N/A
his O O N/A
pizza O O N/A
with O O N/A
him, O O N/A
I O O N/A
was O O N/A
unnerved, O O N/A
to O O N/A
put O O N/A
it O O N/A
mildly. O O N/A
Asked O O N/A
about O O N/A
it, O O N/A
he O O N/A
told O O N/A
me O O N/A
he O O N/A
was O O N/A
considering O O N/A
it O O N/A
but O O N/A
hadn't O O N/A
made O O N/A
up O O N/A
his O O N/A
mind. O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Mangieri O O N/A
has O O N/A
left O O N/A
New O O N/A
York O O N/A
before, O O N/A
and O O N/A
I O O N/A
didn't O O N/A
like O O N/A
it O O N/A
then, O O N/A
either. O O N/A
This O O N/A
time, O O N/A
I O O N/A
wasn't O O N/A
going O O N/A
to O O N/A
let O O N/A
him O O N/A
get O O N/A
away O O N/A
without O O N/A
a O O N/A
fight. O O N/A
It O O N/A
is O O N/A
true O O N/A
that O O N/A
my O O N/A
review O O N/A
of O O N/A
Una O O N/A
Pizza O O N/A
Napoletana O O N/A
last O O N/A
year O O N/A
was O O N/A
decidedly O O N/A
mixed. O O N/A
It O O N/A
is O O N/A
also O O N/A
true, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
that O O N/A
almost O O N/A
every O O N/A
criticism O O N/A
I O O N/A
made O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
addressed. O O N/A
It O O N/A
has O O N/A
gone O O N/A
from O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
most O O N/A
confounding O O N/A
pizzerias O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
city O O N/A
to O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
most O O N/A
enjoyable. O O N/A
The O O N/A
problem O O N/A
with O O N/A
Una O O N/A
Pizza O O N/A
a O O N/A
year O O N/A
ago O O N/A
was O O N/A
that O O N/A
it O O N/A
was O O N/A
trying O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
two O O N/A
things O O N/A
at O O N/A
once. O O N/A
It O O N/A
was, O O N/A
of O O N/A
course, O O N/A
a O O N/A
Neapolitan O O N/A
pizzeria, O O N/A
serving O O N/A
classic, O O N/A
unadorned O O N/A
pies O O N/A
baked O O N/A
for O O N/A
about O O N/A
two O O N/A
minutes O O N/A
inside O O N/A
a O O N/A
wood-burning O O N/A
oven O O N/A
shaped O O N/A
like O O N/A
an O O N/A
igloo. O O N/A
But O O N/A
it O O N/A
was O O N/A
also O O N/A
a O O N/A
cutting-edge O O N/A
Lower O O N/A
East O O N/A
Side O O N/A
experiment. O O N/A
At O O N/A
the O O N/A
instigation O O N/A
of O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Mangieri's O O N/A
partners, O O N/A
the O O N/A
chefs O O N/A
Fabian O O N/A
von O O N/A
Hauske O O N/A
Valtierra O O N/A
and O O N/A
Jeremiah O O N/A
Stone, O O N/A
the O O N/A
kitchen O O N/A
brought O O N/A
forth O O N/A
appetizers O O N/A
that O O N/A
had O O N/A
rarely O O N/A
if O O N/A
ever O O N/A
been O O N/A
asked O O N/A
to O O N/A
live O O N/A
under O O N/A
one O O N/A
roof O O N/A
with O O N/A
a O O N/A
pizza. O O N/A
There O O N/A
was O O N/A
a O O N/A
jellylike O O N/A
mass O O N/A
of O O N/A
raw O O N/A
lobster O O N/A
inside O O N/A
a O O N/A
ring O O N/A
of O O N/A
chickpeas, O O N/A
and O O N/A
a O O N/A
rust-colored O O N/A
puddle O O N/A
of O O N/A
'nduja O O N/A
under O O N/A
raw O O N/A
turnips O O N/A
and O O N/A
nasturtium O O N/A
leaves. O O N/A
The O O N/A
wine O O N/A
list O O N/A
was O O N/A
virtually O O N/A
a O O N/A
treatise O O N/A
on O O N/A
natural O O N/A
wines, O O N/A
a O O N/A
long O O N/A
document O O N/A
full O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
names O O N/A
of O O N/A
eccentric O O N/A
producers O O N/A
and O O N/A
obscure O O N/A
European O O N/A
villages. O O N/A
In O O N/A
another O O N/A
restaurant, O O N/A
all O O N/A
this O O N/A
would O O N/A
have O O N/A
been O O N/A
the O O N/A
departure O O N/A
point O O N/A
for O O N/A
some O O N/A
adventurous O O N/A
evenings. O O N/A
But O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
pizzeria O O N/A
it O O N/A
led O O N/A
to O O N/A
some O O N/A
peculiar O O N/A
pairings, O O N/A
made O O N/A
the O O N/A
check O O N/A
a O O N/A
bit O O N/A
higher O O N/A
than O O N/A
you O O N/A
wanted O O N/A
and O O N/A
resulted O O N/A
in O O N/A
long O O N/A
waits O O N/A
before O O N/A
you O O N/A
were O O N/A
finally O O N/A
allowed O O N/A
to O O N/A
eat O O N/A
the O O N/A
delicious O O N/A
pizza O O N/A
you'd O O N/A
come O O N/A
for. O O N/A
Over O O N/A
the O O N/A
past O O N/A
year, O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
von O O N/A
Hauske O O N/A
and O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Stone O O N/A
have O O N/A
stepped O O N/A
aside, O O N/A
letting O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Mangieri O O N/A
call O O N/A
the O O N/A
shots. O O N/A
The O O N/A
wines O O N/A
on O O N/A
offer O O N/A
now O O N/A
number O O N/A
about O O N/A
15. O O N/A
They O O N/A
are O O N/A
still O O N/A
a O O N/A
likably O O N/A
eccentric O O N/A
lot, O O N/A
but O O N/A
picking O O N/A
one O O N/A
doesn't O O N/A
feel O O N/A
like O O N/A
studying O O N/A
for O O N/A
a O O N/A
master O O N/A
sommelier O O N/A
exam. O O N/A
The O O N/A
appetizers O O N/A
are O O N/A
simpler O O N/A
and O O N/A
less O O N/A
expensive: O O N/A
a O O N/A
plate O O N/A
of O O N/A
marinated O O N/A
white O O N/A
anchovies, O O N/A
a O O N/A
dish O O N/A
of O O N/A
warm O O N/A
Italian O O N/A
olives O O N/A
or O O N/A
a O O N/A
bowl O O N/A
of O O N/A
Little O O N/A
Gem O O N/A
lettuce O O N/A
with O O N/A
sunflower O O N/A
seeds O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
Caesarish O O N/A
dressing. O O N/A
I O O N/A
do O O N/A
miss O O N/A
the O O N/A
tiramisù O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A
opening O O N/A
menu, O O N/A
but O O N/A
the O O N/A
new O O N/A
cannoli O O N/A
filled O O N/A
with O O N/A
ricotta O O N/A
-- O O N/A
a O O N/A
blend O O N/A
of O O N/A
domestic O O N/A
cow's O O N/A

and O O N/A
Italian O O N/A
sheep's O O N/A
milk O O N/A
-- O O N/A
are O O N/A
nearly O O N/A
as O O N/A
good. O O N/A
It's O O N/A
common O O N/A
for O O N/A
a O O N/A
new O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
to O O N/A
trim O O N/A
its O O N/A
sails, O O N/A
but O O N/A
this O O N/A
one O O N/A
has O O N/A
trimmed O O N/A
its O O N/A
prices, O O N/A
too. O O N/A
In O O N/A
the O O N/A
beginning O O N/A
the O O N/A
five O O N/A
regular O O N/A

were O O N/A
all O O N/A
$25; O O N/A
now O O N/A
they O O N/A
range O O N/A
from O O N/A
$19 O O N/A
to O O N/A
$25, O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
two O O N/A
extra-complicated O O N/A
Friday O O N/A

Saturday O O N/A

I O O N/A
liked O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Mangieri's O O N/A
pies O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
East O O N/A
Village, O O N/A
I O O N/A
liked O O N/A
them O O N/A
more O O N/A
when O O N/A
he O O N/A
came O O N/A
back O O N/A
to O O N/A
town, O O N/A
and O O N/A
it's O O N/A
possible, O O N/A
just O O N/A
possible, O O N/A
that O O N/A
they've O O N/A
improved O O N/A
over O O N/A
the O O N/A
past O O N/A
year. O O N/A
He O O N/A
is, O O N/A
like O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Seeger, O O N/A
a O O N/A
minimalist. O O N/A
He O O N/A
lets O O N/A
you O O N/A
notice O O N/A
each O O N/A
ingredient: O O N/A
the O O N/A
little O O N/A
ping O O N/A
of O O N/A
sourness O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
Campanian O O N/A
buffalo O O N/A
mozzarella, O O N/A
for O O N/A
instance. O O N/A
Or O O N/A
the O O N/A
unruly, O O N/A
windswept-hillside O O N/A
aroma O O N/A
of O O N/A
dried O O N/A
Sicilian O O N/A
oregano. O O N/A
The O O N/A
precise O O N/A
crunch O O N/A
of O O N/A
each O O N/A
unrefined O O N/A
Trapani O O N/A
sea-salt O O N/A
crystal O O N/A
waiting O O N/A
to O O N/A
dissolve. O O N/A
The O O N/A
crust O O N/A
is O O N/A
so O O N/A
tender O O N/A
it O O N/A
barely O O N/A
fights O O N/A
fork, O O N/A
knife O O N/A
or O O N/A
teeth. O O N/A
Some O O N/A
diners O O N/A
will O O N/A
wish O O N/A
it O O N/A
put O O N/A
up O O N/A
more O O N/A
crackly O O N/A
resistance. O O N/A
You O O N/A
inhale O O N/A
it O O N/A
at O O N/A
least O O N/A
as O O N/A
much O O N/A
as O O N/A
you O O N/A
eat O O N/A
it. O O N/A
When O O N/A
you O O N/A
have O O N/A
finished, O O N/A
some O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
most O O N/A
popular O O N/A
pizzas O O N/A
in O O N/A
town O O N/A
will O O N/A
seem O O N/A
tough, O O N/A
leathery, O O N/A
overworked. O O N/A
Even O O N/A
if O O N/A
this O O N/A
is O O N/A
not O O N/A
the O O N/A
style O O N/A
you O O N/A

to O O N/A
bring O O N/A
out O O N/A
regional O O N/A
differences O O N/A
in O O N/A
Vietnamese O O N/A

by O O N/A
devoting O O N/A
sections O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A

to O O N/A
Saigon O O N/A
and O O N/A
Hanoi, O O N/A
hundreds O O N/A
of O O N/A
miles O O N/A
apart, O O N/A
as O O N/A
well O O N/A
as O O N/A
Hue, O O N/A
somewhere O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
middle. O O N/A
She O O N/A
doesn't O O N/A
have O O N/A
quite O O N/A
enough O O N/A
dishes O O N/A
from O O N/A
any O O N/A
one O O N/A
place O O N/A
to O O N/A
paint O O N/A
a O O N/A
full O O N/A
picture, O O N/A
but O O N/A
the O O N/A
project O O N/A
is O O N/A
intriguing. O O N/A
Like O O N/A
other O O N/A
New O O N/A
York O O N/A
chefs, O O N/A
she O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
caught O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
tractor O O N/A
beam O O N/A
of O O N/A
cha O O N/A
ca O O N/A
la O O N/A
Vong O O N/A
, O O N/A
the O O N/A
turmeric-and O O N/A
dill-scented O O N/A
fish O O N/A
dish O O N/A
that O O N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
specialty O O N/A
of O O N/A
a O O N/A
100-year-old O O N/A
Hanoi O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
same O O N/A
name. O O N/A
Her O O N/A
version, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
supplies O O N/A
less O O N/A
dill, O O N/A
less O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
and O O N/A
less O O N/A
satisfaction O O N/A
than O O N/A
some O O N/A
others. O O N/A
Her O O N/A
two O O N/A
improvisations O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
theme O O N/A
of O O N/A
Hanoi's O O N/A
best-known O O N/A
contribution O O N/A
to O O N/A
gastronomy, O O N/A
pho, O O N/A
are O O N/A
more O O N/A
effective. O O N/A
One O O N/A
gives O O N/A
you O O N/A
the O O N/A
soup O O N/A
without O O N/A
the O O N/A
noodles; O O N/A
floating O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
rich O O N/A
and O O N/A
cloudy O O N/A
broth O O N/A
are O O N/A
ghostly O O N/A
white, O O N/A
billowing O O N/A
won O O N/A
tons O O N/A
that O O N/A
contain O O N/A
chopped O O N/A
beef O O N/A
fillet O O N/A
freely O O N/A
seasoned O O N/A
with O O N/A
black O O N/A
pepper. O O N/A
The O O N/A
other O O N/A
dish O O N/A
is, O O N/A
humbly O O N/A
enough, O O N/A
a O O N/A
plate O O N/A
of O O N/A
soupless O O N/A
pho O O N/A
noodles O O N/A
stir-fried O O N/A
with O O N/A
springy O O N/A
mushrooms, O O N/A
bitter O O N/A
greens O O N/A
and O O N/A
chopped O O N/A
scallions. O O N/A
Its O O N/A
simplicity O O N/A
makes O O N/A
the O O N/A
impact O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
dish O O N/A
hard O O N/A
to O O N/A
explain O O N/A
until O O N/A
you O O N/A
learn O O N/A
that O O N/A
it O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
showered O O N/A
with O O N/A
Maggi O O N/A
Seasoning O O N/A
, O O N/A
a O O N/A
soylike O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
that O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
invisible O O N/A
secret O O N/A
of O O N/A
many O O N/A
Vietnamese O O N/A
dishes. O O N/A
Nodding O O N/A
toward O O N/A
Saigon, O O N/A
Ms. O O N/A
Wong O O N/A
makes O O N/A
a O O N/A
rendition O O N/A
of O O N/A
shaking O O N/A
beef O O N/A
by O O N/A
stir-frying O O N/A
tender O O N/A
and O O N/A
chewy O O N/A
marinated O O N/A
hanger O O N/A
steak O O N/A
with O O N/A
potatoes O O N/A
and O O N/A
then O O N/A
throwing O O N/A
a O O N/A
fistful O O N/A
of O O N/A
watercress O O N/A
at O O N/A
it. O O N/A
If O O N/A
you O O N/A
think O O N/A
that O O N/A
sounds O O N/A
like O O N/A
a O O N/A
French O O N/A
bistro O O N/A
plate, O O N/A
then O O N/A
you O O N/A
are O O N/A
starting O O N/A
to O O N/A
understand O O N/A
how O O N/A
her O O N/A
mind O O N/A
works. O O N/A
Ms. O O N/A
Wong O O N/A
cooks O O N/A
skillfully, O O N/A
with O O N/A
an O O N/A
appreciation O O N/A
for O O N/A
nuance, O O N/A
and O O N/A
she O O N/A
doesn't O O N/A
abuse O O N/A
her O O N/A
freedom O O N/A
by O O N/A
innovating O O N/A
pointlessly. O O N/A
It's O O N/A
possible, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
that O O N/A
she O O N/A
could O O N/A
stand O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
less O O N/A
shy O O N/A
with O O N/A
chiles O O N/A
and O O N/A
herbs. O O N/A
The O O N/A
table O O N/A
salad O O N/A
of O O N/A
greenery O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
wrapped O O N/A
around O O N/A
grilled O O N/A
shrimp O O N/A
offers O O N/A
no O O N/A
herbs O O N/A
other O O N/A
than O O N/A
mint O O N/A
and O O N/A
basil, O O N/A
and O O N/A
you'll O O N/A
run O O N/A
out O O N/A
of O O N/A
lettuce O O N/A
before O O N/A
the O O N/A
fourth O O N/A
shrimp O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
dressed. O O N/A
The O O N/A
green O O N/A
papaya O O N/A
salad O O N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
little O O N/A
too O O N/A
innocuous, O O N/A
and O O N/A
while O O N/A
her O O N/A
version O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
street O O N/A
snack O O N/A
of O O N/A
grilled O O N/A
corn O O N/A
in O O N/A
fish O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
real O O N/A
success, O O N/A
fresh O O N/A
chiles O O N/A
would O O N/A
have O O N/A
more O O N/A
impact O O N/A
than O O N/A
the O O N/A
chile O O N/A
threads O O N/A
Ms. O O N/A
Wong O O N/A
balances O O N/A
on O O N/A
top. O O N/A
(Incidentally, O O N/A
the O O N/A
kitchen O O N/A
at O O N/A
Van O O N/A
Da O O N/A
makes O O N/A
a O O N/A
fine O O N/A
hot O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
that O O N/A
is O O N/A
like O O N/A
a O O N/A
milder O O N/A
and O O N/A
less O O N/A
acidic O O N/A
Sriracha, O O N/A
but O O N/A
servers O O N/A
never O O N/A
seem O O N/A
to O O N/A
remember O O N/A
to O O N/A
mention O O N/A
it O O N/A
until O O N/A
the O O N/A
end O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
meal.) O O N/A
There O O N/A
are O O N/A
just O O N/A
three O O N/A
desserts. O O N/A
By O O N/A
the O O N/A
time O O N/A
you O O N/A
order, O O N/A
one O O N/A
or O O N/A
two O O N/A
may O O N/A
have O O N/A
been O O N/A
86ed. O O N/A
With O O N/A
luck, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
the O O N/A
che O O N/A
will O O N/A
have O O N/A
survived. O O N/A
In O O N/A
Vietnam, O O N/A
che O O N/A
is O O N/A
thought O O N/A
of O O N/A
as O O N/A
a O O N/A
drink O O N/A
even O O N/A
though O O N/A
it O O N/A
can O O N/A
take O O N/A
the O O N/A
form O O N/A
of O O N/A
a O O N/A
pudding, O O N/A
as O O N/A
it O O N/A
does O O N/A
here, O O N/A
where O O N/A
warm O O N/A
pearls O O N/A
and O O N/A
threads O O N/A
of O O N/A

are O O N/A
cooked O O N/A
in O O N/A
coconut O O N/A
milk O O N/A
with O O N/A
cubes O O N/A
of O O N/A
soft O O N/A
taro. O O N/A
It O O N/A
is O O N/A
just O O N/A
sweet O O N/A
enough O O N/A
to O O N/A
qualify O O N/A
as O O N/A
a O O N/A
dessert. O O N/A
A O O N/A
black O O N/A

darkens O O N/A
the O O N/A
surface: O O N/A
black-sesame O O N/A

ground O O N/A
to O O N/A
powder. O O N/A
Even O O N/A
a O O N/A
single O O N/A
dessert O O N/A
qualifies O O N/A
as O O N/A
an O O N/A
impressive O O N/A
feat O O N/A
inside O O N/A
Van O O N/A
Da's O O N/A
tight O O N/A
quarters. O O N/A
Through O O N/A
the O O N/A
miracle O O N/A
of O O N/A
careful O O N/A
design, O O N/A
the O O N/A
space O O N/A
almost O O N/A
never O O N/A
feels O O N/A
cramped, O O N/A
but O O N/A
this O O N/A
is O O N/A
still O O N/A
an O O N/A
intimate O O N/A
restaurant. O O N/A
In O O N/A
the O O N/A

a O O N/A
small O O N/A
seating O O N/A
area O O N/A
laid O O N/A

is O O N/A
a O O N/A

The O O N/A
meat O O N/A

not O O N/A
gushy, O O N/A
the O O N/A

full O O N/A

not O O N/A
salty, O O N/A
the O O N/A

dark O O N/A

not O O N/A
over-reduced. O O N/A
After O O N/A

it?" O O N/A
I O O N/A
asked O O N/A
my O O N/A
server. O O N/A
Realizing O O N/A
that O O N/A
this O O N/A
was O O N/A
somewhat O O N/A
ambiguous, O O N/A
especially O O N/A
applied O O N/A
to O O N/A
a O O N/A
dish O O N/A
as O O N/A
laden O O N/A
with O O N/A
stuff O O N/A
as O O N/A
the O O N/A

of O O N/A

known O O N/A

as O O N/A
kelle B-DISH B-FOOD N/A
paca, I-DISH I-FOOD N/A
I O O N/A
tried O O N/A
again. O O N/A
"Is O O N/A
it O O N/A
very O O N/A
filling, O O N/A
I O O N/A
mean?" O O N/A
My O O N/A
concern O O N/A
was O O N/A
a O O N/A
familiar O O N/A
one, O O N/A
to O O N/A
me O O N/A
at O O N/A
least. O O N/A
I O O N/A
was O O N/A
in O O N/A
Queens, B-LOC B-DISH N/A
at O O N/A
a O O N/A
new O O N/A
Turkish B-CUISINE B-CUISINE N/A
restaurant O O N/A
in O O N/A
Astoria B-LOC B-LOC N/A
called O O N/A
Lokanta B-EST B-EST N/A
, O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu O O N/A
was O O N/A
so O O N/A
appealing O O N/A
that O O N/A
I O O N/A
wanted O O N/A
to O O N/A
try O O N/A
it O O N/A
all. O O N/A
Already O O N/A
I O O N/A
was O O N/A
set O O N/A
on O O N/A
a O O N/A
few O O N/A
bourekas, B-DISH B-DISH N/A
some O O N/A
labneh, B-DISH B-DISH N/A
the O O N/A

some O O N/A

of O O N/A
braised B-FOOD B-DISH N/A
lamb I-FOOD I-DISH N/A
over O I-DISH N/A

I'd O O N/A
spotted O O N/A
another O O N/A
three O O N/A
or O O N/A
four O O N/A
dishes O O N/A
that O O N/A
I O O N/A
was O O N/A
probably O O N/A
going O O N/A
to O O N/A
tack O O N/A
on O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A
end O O N/A
of O O N/A
my O O N/A
order, O O N/A
as O O N/A
if O O N/A
by O O N/A
afterthought. O O N/A
I O O N/A
suspected O O N/A
that O O N/A
I O O N/A
could O O N/A
add O O N/A
a O O N/A
small O O N/A
bowl O O N/A
of O O N/A
kelle B-DISH B-DISH N/A
paca I-DISH I-DISH N/A
and O O N/A
still O O N/A
eat O O N/A
everything O O N/A
else. O O N/A
But O O N/A
a O O N/A
big O O N/A
bowl, O O N/A
one O O N/A
so O O N/A
thick O O N/A
with O O N/A
bits O O N/A
formerly O O N/A
affixed O O N/A
to O O N/A
a O O N/A
sheep's O O N/A
skull O O N/A
that O O N/A
a O O N/A
spoon O O N/A
would O O N/A
stand O O N/A
up O O N/A
in O O N/A
it, O O N/A
might O O N/A
tip O O N/A
the O O N/A
scale. O O N/A
The O O N/A
server O O N/A
pondered O O N/A
this O O N/A
for O O N/A
a O O N/A
while O O N/A
until O O N/A
a O O N/A
wiry O O N/A
man O O N/A
got O O N/A
up O O N/A
from O O N/A
his O O N/A
marble-topped O O N/A
table O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
corner O O N/A
and O O N/A
conferred O O N/A
with O O N/A
her. O O N/A
Wearing O O N/A
baggy O O N/A
jeans, O O N/A
a O O N/A
white O O N/A
T-shirt O O N/A
and O O N/A
a O O N/A
baseball O O N/A
cap O O N/A
that O O N/A
kept O O N/A
his O O N/A
zinc-colored O O N/A
ponytail O O N/A
in O O N/A
place, O O N/A
he O O N/A
looked O O N/A
like O O N/A
a O O N/A
contractor, O O N/A
maybe O O N/A
a O O N/A
painter O O N/A
who'd O O N/A
come O O N/A
by O O N/A
to O O N/A
touch O O N/A
up O O N/A
the O O N/A
moldings O O N/A
and O O N/A
had O O N/A
been O O N/A
invited O O N/A
to O O N/A
stay O O N/A
for O O N/A
a O O N/A
Turkish B-FOOD B-CUISINE N/A
coffee. I-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
Then O O N/A
he O O N/A
spoke O O N/A
to O O N/A
us O O N/A
about O O N/A
the O O N/A
sheep's B-DISH B-DISH N/A
head I-DISH I-DISH N/A
soup. I-DISH I-DISH N/A
"I O O N/A
am O O N/A
a O O N/A
genius," O O N/A
he O O N/A
began. O O N/A
"And O O N/A
even O O N/A
I O O N/A
don't O O N/A
know O O N/A
how O O N/A
to O O N/A
answer O O N/A
this O O N/A
question. O O N/A
I O O N/A
think O O N/A
that O O N/A
the O O N/A
question O O N/A
must O O N/A
be O O N/A
wrong." O O N/A
As O O N/A
those O O N/A
who O O N/A
chase O O N/A
the O O N/A

of O O N/A

around O O N/A

have O O N/A
probably O O N/A
guessed, O O N/A
this O O N/A
was O O N/A
no O O N/A

meat O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
seasoned O O N/A
just O O N/A
forcefully O O N/A
enough O O N/A
that O O N/A
it O O N/A
will O O N/A
announce O O N/A
itself, O O N/A
politely O O N/A
but O O N/A
clearly, O O N/A
as O O N/A
it O O N/A
breaks O O N/A
through O O N/A
the O O N/A
dough. O O N/A
It O O N/A
would O O N/A
be O O N/A
possible O O N/A
to O O N/A
sit O O N/A
down O O N/A
in O O N/A
front O O N/A
of O O N/A
a O O N/A
bowl O O N/A
of O O N/A
these, O O N/A
spooning O O N/A
them O O N/A
up O O N/A
with O O N/A
their O O N/A
warm O O N/A
yogurt O O N/A
and O O N/A
chile O O N/A
oil O O N/A
and O O N/A
dried O O N/A
mint, O O N/A
and O O N/A
call O O N/A
for O O N/A
another O O N/A
bowl O O N/A
a O O N/A
minute O O N/A
later. O O N/A
Of O O N/A
course, O O N/A
the O O N/A
meal O O N/A
should O O N/A
begin O O N/A
with O O N/A
strips O O N/A
of O O N/A
nigella-dotted O O N/A
Turkish O O N/A
bread O O N/A
and O O N/A
a O O N/A
spread O O N/A
or O O N/A
two O O N/A
-- O O N/A
maybe O O N/A
memorably O O N/A
creamy O O N/A
purée O O N/A
of O O N/A
dried O O N/A
favas; O O N/A
or O O N/A
the O O N/A
roughly O O N/A
mashed O O N/A
eggplant, O O N/A
smoky O O N/A
without O O N/A
a O O N/A
trace O O N/A
of O O N/A
bitterness; O O N/A
and O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
strained-yogurt O O N/A
dips, O O N/A
either O O N/A
the O O N/A
tangy O O N/A
cacik, O O N/A
laced O O N/A
with O O N/A
minced O O N/A
cucumbers, O O N/A
or O O N/A
the O O N/A
labneh, O O N/A
as O O N/A
firm O O N/A
as O O N/A
a O O N/A
new O O N/A
mattress. O O N/A
Either O O N/A
will O O N/A
prove O O N/A
useful O O N/A
as O O N/A
the O O N/A
meal O O N/A
goes O O N/A
on. O O N/A
So O O N/A
will O O N/A
a O O N/A
simple O O N/A
salad, O O N/A
especially O O N/A
the O O N/A
one O O N/A
with O O N/A
white O O N/A
beans O O N/A
and O O N/A
purple O O N/A
onions. O O N/A
The O O N/A
tightly O O N/A
rolled, O O N/A
golden O O N/A
bourekas O O N/A
are O O N/A
like O O N/A
skinny O O N/A
Turkish O O N/A
spring O O N/A
rolls O O N/A
filled O O N/A
with O O N/A
dill O O N/A
and O O N/A
melting O O N/A
feta. O O N/A
Cold O O N/A
poached O O N/A
leeks, O O N/A
a O O N/A
frequent O O N/A
special, O O N/A
are O O N/A
more O O N/A
appealing O O N/A
than O O N/A
the O O N/A
cold O O N/A
poached O O N/A
artichokes O O N/A
that O O N/A
have O O N/A
a O O N/A
permanent O O N/A
spot O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu. O O N/A
If O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Yegen O O N/A
tells O O N/A
you O O N/A
that O O N/A
the O O N/A
grilled O O N/A
octopus O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
best O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
city, O O N/A
keep O O N/A
in O O N/A
mind O O N/A
that O O N/A
he O O N/A
rarely O O N/A
seems O O N/A
to O O N/A
leave O O N/A
his O O N/A
own O O N/A
restaurant. O O N/A
It's O O N/A
quite O O N/A
good, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
with O O N/A
a O O N/A
fugitive O O N/A
sweetness O O N/A
that O O N/A
may O O N/A
be O O N/A
supplied O O N/A
by O O N/A
the O O N/A
tomatoes O O N/A
and O O N/A
purple O O N/A
onions. O O N/A
Desserts O O N/A
run O O N/A
toward O O N/A
milky O O N/A
white O O N/A
puddings, O O N/A
nice O O N/A
if O O N/A
you O O N/A
are O O N/A
looking O O N/A
for O O N/A
a O O N/A
mild O O N/A
sedative. O O N/A
The O O N/A
baklava, O O N/A
imported O O N/A
from O O N/A
Turkey, O O N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
treat O O N/A
for O O N/A
those O O N/A
of O O N/A
us O O N/A
who O O N/A
like O O N/A
pistachios O O N/A
and O O N/A
think O O N/A
sugar O O N/A
syrup O O N/A
makes O O N/A
a O O N/A
better O O N/A
baklava O O N/A
sweetener O O N/A
than O O N/A
honey. O O N/A
The O O N/A
unlikely O O N/A
champion, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
butternut O O N/A
squash O O N/A
that O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
languorously O O N/A
baked O O N/A
in O O N/A
its O O N/A
own O O N/A
juices O O N/A
with O O N/A
nothing O O N/A
but O O N/A
sugar. O O N/A
The O O N/A
technique O O N/A
is O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
those O O N/A
small O O N/A
tricks O O N/A
that O O N/A
helps O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Yegen's O O N/A
cooking O O N/A
stand O O N/A
out, O O N/A
like O O N/A
the O O N/A
perfume O O N/A
of O O N/A
lemon O O N/A
peel O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
Turkish O O N/A
lemonade. O O N/A
Lokanta O O N/A
has O O N/A
no O O N/A
liquor O O N/A
license O O N/A
yet. O O N/A
Some O O N/A
customers O O N/A
smuggle O O N/A
wine O O N/A
through O O N/A
the O O N/A
door O O N/A
and O O N/A
keep O O N/A
the O O N/A
bottles O O N/A
on O O N/A
their O O N/A
tables, O O N/A
which O O N/A
are O O N/A
topped O O N/A
with O O N/A
radiant O O N/A
white O O N/A

and O O N/A
surrounded O O N/A
by O O N/A
classic O O N/A

But O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
hard O O N/A
not O O N/A
to O O N/A
want O O N/A
the O O N/A
lemonade, O O N/A
which O O N/A
is O O N/A
cold O O N/A
and O O N/A
just O O N/A

To O O N/A

must O O N/A
first O O N/A
pass O O N/A
between O O N/A
two O O N/A

Champagne O O N/A

Before O O N/A

literally O O N/A

that O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
more O O N/A

to O O N/A
come O O N/A
from O O N/A
classic, O O N/A
mannerly O O N/A
European O O N/A

still O O N/A
using O O N/A
amphoras O O N/A
that O O N/A

that O O N/A
the O O N/A
ideal O O N/A

is O O N/A
not O O N/A
likely O O N/A
to O O N/A
get O O N/A
up O O N/A

out O O N/A
upon O O N/A
being O O N/A

a O O N/A

that O O N/A
the O O N/A

many O O N/A

so O O N/A
far O O N/A
I've O O N/A
found O O N/A
the O O N/A

more O O N/A
original O O N/A

Mr. O O N/A
Fraser O O N/A
has O O N/A
a O O N/A
playful, O O N/A
imaginative O O N/A
streak. O O N/A
He O O N/A
needs O O N/A
it O O N/A
at O O N/A
701West, B-EST B-EST N/A
where O O N/A
there O O N/A
is O O N/A
no O O N/A
real O O N/A
theme O O N/A
beyond O O N/A
wine B-FOOD B-FOOD N/A
and O O N/A
style. O O N/A
But O O N/A
there O O N/A
is O O N/A
enough O O N/A
creativity O O N/A
across O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu, O O N/A
on O O N/A
which O O N/A
he O O N/A
collaborates O O N/A
with O O N/A
the O O N/A
chef O O N/A

the O O N/A

it O O N/A

to O O N/A

Before O O N/A
the O O N/A

for O O N/A
example, O O N/A
there O O N/A
may O O N/A
be O O N/A
a O O N/A

It's O O N/A
enticingly O O N/A

and O O N/A
another O O N/A
frequent O O N/A
amuse O O N/A
manages O O N/A
to O O N/A
outdo O O N/A
it: O O N/A
a O O N/A

This O O N/A
is O O N/A
luxury O O N/A
dining O O N/A
in O O N/A
its O O N/A
way, O O N/A
which O O N/A
is O O N/A
not O O N/A
the O O N/A
predictable O O N/A
way. O O N/A
The O O N/A
menu O O N/A
proposes O O N/A
three O O N/A
courses O O N/A
for O O N/A
$98, O O N/A
but O O N/A
a O O N/A
server O O N/A
informed O O N/A
me O O N/A
that O O N/A
"we O O N/A
also O O N/A
have O O N/A

if O O N/A
that's O O N/A
more O O N/A
your O O N/A
rhythm O O N/A
for O O N/A
the O O N/A
evening." O O N/A
Frequently O O N/A
the O O N/A
surprises O O N/A
come O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
form O O N/A
of O O N/A
an O O N/A
unexpected O O N/A
tweak O O N/A

the O O N/A

the O O N/A

don't O O N/A
overreach, O O N/A
for O O N/A
all O O N/A
the O O N/A

on O O N/A

Asparagus O O N/A
dipped O O N/A
in O O N/A
aioli O O N/A
is O O N/A
a O O N/A
good O O N/A
idea, O O N/A
of O O N/A
course, O O N/A
but O O N/A
what O O N/A
if O O N/A
the O O N/A
asparagus O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
steamed O O N/A
inside O O N/A
a O O N/A
wrapper O O N/A
of O O N/A
thinly O O N/A
shaved O O N/A
cedar O O N/A
until O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
nearly O O N/A
as O O N/A
smoky O O N/A
as O O N/A
country O O N/A
bacon? O O N/A
And O O N/A
what O O N/A
if O O N/A
the O O N/A
aioli O O N/A
is O O N/A
enhanced O O N/A
by O O N/A
truffles? O O N/A
It O O N/A
may O O N/A
sound O O N/A
overworked, O O N/A
but O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
such O O N/A
a O O N/A
thrill O O N/A
that O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
my O O N/A
guests O O N/A
asked O O N/A
for O O N/A
another O O N/A
plate O O N/A
before O O N/A
we O O N/A
could O O N/A
move O O N/A
on O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
main O O N/A
courses, O O N/A
throwing O O N/A
the O O N/A
rhythm O O N/A
for O O N/A
the O O N/A
evening O O N/A
right O O N/A
out O O N/A
the O O N/A
window. O O N/A
The O O N/A
night O O N/A
will O O N/A
pause O O N/A
again O O N/A
if O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
main O O N/A
courses O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
sweet O O N/A
potato, O O N/A
as O O N/A
everyone O O N/A
tries O O N/A
to O O N/A
figure O O N/A
out O O N/A
where O O N/A
it O O N/A
got O O N/A
its O O N/A
creaminess O O N/A
and O O N/A
savory O O N/A
depth. O O N/A
Even O O N/A
once O O N/A
you O O N/A
know O O N/A
it's O O N/A
been O O N/A
sealed O O N/A
up O O N/A
and O O N/A
baked O O N/A
inside O O N/A
a O O N/A
little O O N/A
coffin O O N/A
of O O N/A
sourdough O O N/A
that O O N/A
is O O N/A
streaked O O N/A
with O O N/A
green O O N/A
threads O O N/A
of O O N/A
wakame O O N/A
seaweed, O O N/A
you O O N/A
still O O N/A
can't O O N/A
quite O O N/A
believe O O N/A
that O O N/A
all O O N/A
this O O N/A
flavor O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
achieved O O N/A
with O O N/A
an O O N/A
ordinary O O N/A
sweet O O N/A
potato. O O N/A
Some O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
large O O N/A
pieces O O N/A
of O O N/A
fish O O N/A
and O O N/A
meat O O N/A
are O O N/A
showstoppers O O N/A
on O O N/A
their O O N/A
own, O O N/A
like O O N/A
the O O N/A
lobster O O N/A
that O O N/A
rests O O N/A
for O O N/A
four O O N/A
days O O N/A
in O O N/A
aged-beef O O N/A
fat O O N/A
before O O N/A
being O O N/A
broiled O O N/A
and O O N/A
set O O N/A
over O O N/A
some O O N/A
jammy O O N/A
ratatouille. O O N/A
When O O N/A
they O O N/A
are O O N/A
not, O O N/A
something O O N/A
else O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
plate O O N/A
usually O O N/A
is. O O N/A

even O O N/A

a O O N/A
curiously O O N/A
likable O O N/A
risotto O O N/A
made O O N/A
from O O N/A

nuts. O O N/A
In O O N/A
the O O N/A
case O O N/A
of O O N/A

the O O N/A

Mr. O O N/A

recently O O N/A
of O O N/A

It's O O N/A
earthy O O N/A
and O O N/A
ethereal O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A
same O O N/A
time. O O N/A
He O O N/A
even O O N/A

All O O N/A
seven O O N/A

by O O N/A
back O O N/A

who O O N/A
are O O N/A
sommeliers O O N/A
in O O N/A

This O O N/A
is O O N/A
one O O N/A
of O O N/A
those O O N/A
innovations O O N/A
in O O N/A
service O O N/A
that O O N/A
seems O O N/A
obvious O O N/A
now O O N/A
that O O N/A
somebody's O O N/A
actually O O N/A
doing O O N/A
it. O O N/A
The O O N/A
meal O O N/A
can O O N/A
become O O N/A
an O O N/A
evening-long O O N/A
conversation O O N/A
about O O N/A
wine; O O N/A
the O O N/A
sommeliers O O N/A
even O O N/A
invite O O N/A
you O O N/A
to O O N/A
play O O N/A
the O O N/A

It O O N/A
is O O N/A
slightly O O N/A
incredible O O N/A
that O O N/A
a O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
that O O N/A
tries O O N/A
so O O N/A
hard O O N/A
to O O N/A

to O O N/A

very O O N/A
good O O N/A
and O O N/A
fairly O O N/A

Besides O O N/A

Mr. O O N/A

of O O N/A

in O O N/A
the O O N/A

circa O O N/A
2019, O O N/A
is O O N/A
that O O N/A
the O O N/A
more O O N/A
high-functioning O O N/A
a O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
is, O O N/A
the O O N/A
less O O N/A
likely O O N/A
you O O N/A
are O O N/A
to O O N/A

a O O N/A
proprietor. O O N/A
There O O N/A
are O O N/A
exceptions, O O N/A
of O O N/A

but O O N/A
often O O N/A
the O O N/A
most O O N/A
successful O O N/A
restaurateurs O O N/A
are O O N/A
very O O N/A
busy O O N/A
people, O O N/A

aren't O O N/A
always O O N/A
as O O N/A
smooth O O N/A
as O O N/A
professionals, O O N/A

they O O N/A
are O O N/A

what O O N/A
goes O O N/A
on O O N/A

the O O N/A
menu O O N/A
is O O N/A
even O O N/A
more O O N/A

any O O N/A
dishes O O N/A

I O O N/A
was O O N/A
never O O N/A
curious O O N/A
enough O O N/A

it, O O N/A

to O O N/A
unveil O O N/A
it, O O N/A

many O O N/A

Still, O O N/A
I O O N/A
suspect O O N/A
the O O N/A

opens O O N/A
at O O N/A
5:30 O O N/A
each O O N/A

for O O N/A

Not O O N/A
much O O N/A
about O O N/A

of O O N/A

Pastis O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
blogs O O N/A
but O O N/A
haven't O O N/A
yet O O N/A
figured O O N/A
out O O N/A
what O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
for. O O N/A
For O O N/A
much O O N/A
of O O N/A
his O O N/A
life, O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
McNally O O N/A
has O O N/A
been O O N/A
chipping, O O N/A
cracking, O O N/A
distressing O O N/A
and O O N/A
weathering O O N/A
interiors O O N/A
that O O N/A
are O O N/A
the O O N/A
architectural O O N/A
equivalent O O N/A
of O O N/A
rumpled O O N/A
sweaters O O N/A
two O O N/A
sizes O O N/A
too O O N/A
large. O O N/A
Perhaps O O N/A
the O O N/A
largest O O N/A
and O O N/A
certainly O O N/A
the O O N/A
most O O N/A
rumpled O O N/A
of O O N/A
all O O N/A
is O O N/A
Pastis. O O N/A
It O O N/A
doesn't O O N/A
have O O N/A
the O O N/A
corner O O N/A
entrance O O N/A
it O O N/A
had O O N/A
at O O N/A
its O O N/A
former O O N/A
address, O O N/A
or O O N/A
the O O N/A
long O O N/A
communal O O N/A
table O O N/A
that O O N/A
sliced O O N/A
through O O N/A
the O O N/A
front O O N/A
room O O N/A
like O O N/A
a O O N/A
surfboard. O O N/A
And O O N/A
the O O N/A
shelves O O N/A
of O O N/A
cigarette O O N/A
packs O O N/A
are O O N/A
definitely O O N/A
gone. O O N/A
( O O N/A
You O O N/A
could O O N/A
still O O N/A
smoke O O N/A
in O O N/A
restaurants O O N/A
in O O N/A
1999, O O N/A
when O O N/A
Pastis O O N/A
opened.) O O N/A
But O O N/A
the O O N/A
magazine O O N/A
racks O O N/A
are O O N/A
back, O O N/A
along O O N/A
with O O N/A
the O O N/A
overhead O O N/A
fans O O N/A
turning O O N/A
steadily O O N/A
below O O N/A
a O O N/A
stamped O O N/A
tin O O N/A
ceiling. O O N/A
Once O O N/A
again O O N/A
the O O N/A
walls O O N/A
are O O N/A
covered O O N/A
with O O N/A
chipped O O N/A
subway O O N/A
tiles, O O N/A
white, O O N/A
framed O O N/A
by O O N/A
black O O N/A
grout. O O N/A
The O O N/A
chairs O O N/A
still O O N/A
don't O O N/A
match. O O N/A
The O O N/A
ambient O O N/A
light O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
color O O N/A
of O O N/A
a O O N/A
Scotch O O N/A
and O O N/A
soda O O N/A
and O O N/A
makes O O N/A
everybody O O N/A
look O O N/A
the O O N/A
way O O N/A
they O O N/A
do O O N/A
after O O N/A
you've O O N/A
drunk O O N/A
one. O O N/A
On O O N/A
an O O N/A
antique O O N/A
mirror, O O N/A
or O O N/A
one O O N/A
that O O N/A
looks O O N/A
like O O N/A
an O O N/A
antique, O O N/A
someone O O N/A
has O O N/A
scrawled O O N/A
a O O N/A
menu O O N/A
of O O N/A
desserts, O O N/A
almost O O N/A
none O O N/A
of O O N/A
which O O N/A
Pastis O O N/A
actually O O N/A
serves. O O N/A
You O O N/A
can, O O N/A
however, O O N/A
get O O N/A
an O O N/A
energetically O O N/A
whisked O O N/A
dark-chocolate O O N/A
mousse O O N/A
under O O N/A
shaved O O N/A
curls O O N/A
of O O N/A
chocolate, O O N/A
or O O N/A
a O O N/A
baba O O N/A
au O O N/A
rhum O O N/A
so O O N/A
drenched O O N/A
in O O N/A
booze O O N/A
that O O N/A
it O O N/A
might O O N/A
spontaneously O O N/A
combust O O N/A
if O O N/A
it O O N/A
weren't O O N/A
being O O N/A
restrained O O N/A
by O O N/A
a O O N/A
white O O N/A
dune O O N/A
of O O N/A
whipped O O N/A
Chantilly O O N/A
cream. O O N/A
The O O N/A
most O O N/A
significant O O N/A
change O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A
first O O N/A
Pastis O O N/A
to O O N/A
the O O N/A
second O O N/A
happened O O N/A
offstage. O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
McNally, O O N/A
who O O N/A
had O O N/A
a O O N/A
stroke O O N/A
two O O N/A
years O O N/A
ago, O O N/A
has O O N/A
brought O O N/A
on O O N/A
the O O N/A
restaurateur O O N/A
Stephen O O N/A
Starr O O N/A
as O O N/A
a O O N/A
partner O O N/A
who, O O N/A
essentially, O O N/A
manages O O N/A
everything O O N/A
except O O N/A
the O O N/A
design. O O N/A
Familiar O O N/A
faces O O N/A
from O O N/A
La O O N/A
Mercerie O O N/A
and O O N/A
other O O N/A
Starr O O N/A
enterprises O O N/A
work O O N/A
alongside O O N/A
loyal O O N/A
retainers O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A
McNally O O N/A
empire. O O N/A
The O O N/A
McNally O O N/A
troops O O N/A
are O O N/A
exquisitely O O N/A
poised, O O N/A
self-assured, O O N/A
able O O N/A
to O O N/A
spot O O N/A
a O O N/A
misplaced O O N/A
butter O O N/A
knife O O N/A
from O O N/A
across O O N/A
the O O N/A
street. O O N/A
The O O N/A
Starr O O N/A
cadre O O N/A
is O O N/A
more O O N/A
casual, O O N/A
and O O N/A
occasionally O O N/A
a O O N/A
server O O N/A
will O O N/A
ask O O N/A
your O O N/A
opinion O O N/A
of O O N/A
"the O O N/A
flavors O O N/A
so O O N/A
far," O O N/A
a O O N/A
question O O N/A
that O O N/A
has O O N/A
surely O O N/A
never O O N/A
been O O N/A
uttered O O N/A
at O O N/A
Minetta O O N/A
Tavern O O N/A
. O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Starr O O N/A
has O O N/A
oversight O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
wine O O N/A
list, O O N/A
which O O N/A
is O O N/A
less O O N/A
conservative O O N/A
than O O N/A
a O O N/A
typical O O N/A
McNally O O N/A
lineup, O O N/A
and O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
food, O O N/A
which O O N/A
has O O N/A
not O O N/A
been O O N/A
a O O N/A
strong O O N/A
suit O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
McNally O O N/A
organization O O N/A
since O O N/A
the O O N/A
chefs O O N/A
Lee O O N/A
Hanson O O N/A
and O O N/A
Riad O O N/A
Nasr O O N/A
went O O N/A
out O O N/A
on O O N/A
their O O N/A
own. O O N/A
Pastis's O O N/A
chef, O O N/A
Michael O O N/A
Abt, O O N/A
was O O N/A
until O O N/A
recently O O N/A
in O O N/A
charge O O N/A
of O O N/A
the O O N/A
kitchen O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A
Washington O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
Le O O N/A
Diplomate O O N/A
, O O N/A
which O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Starr O O N/A
owns. O O N/A
Better O O N/A
qualifications O O N/A
would O O N/A
be O O N/A
hard O O N/A
to O O N/A
conjure, O O N/A
given O O N/A
that O O N/A
Le O O N/A
Diplomate O O N/A
is O O N/A
essentially O O N/A
an O O N/A
imitation O O N/A
McNally O O N/A
restaurant. O O N/A
Taking O O N/A
his O O N/A
cues O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A
old O O N/A
days, O O N/A
Mr. O O N/A
Abt O O N/A
is O O N/A
putting O O N/A
out O O N/A
simple, O O N/A
unadorned, O O N/A
hunger-obliterating O O N/A
French O O N/A
cuisine O O N/A
drawn O O N/A
from O O N/A
the O O N/A
era O O N/A
before O O N/A
supermarkets O O N/A
and O O N/A
fast O O N/A
food. O O N/A
The O O N/A
salad O O N/A
of O O N/A
pickled O O N/A
herring O O N/A
and O O N/A
carrots O O N/A
with O O N/A
boiled O O N/A
potatoes O O N/A
might O O N/A
come O O N/A
straight O O N/A
from O O N/A
Brasserie O O N/A
Lipp O O N/A
. O O N/A
The O O N/A
country O O N/A
pâté O O N/A
is O O N/A
laden O O N/A
with O O N/A
chicken O O N/A
livers O O N/A
and O O N/A
riddled O O N/A
with O O N/A
soft O O N/A
white O O N/A
pork O O N/A
fat O O N/A
in O O N/A
gobs O O N/A
the O O N/A
size O O N/A
of O O N/A
gumdrops, O O N/A
although O O N/A
it O O N/A
could O O N/A
stand O O N/A
more O O N/A
salt, O O N/A
and O O N/A
I'd O O N/A
be O O N/A
happy O O N/A
to O O N/A
trade O O N/A
the O O N/A
slab O O N/A
of O O N/A
butter O O N/A
that O O N/A
comes O O N/A
with O O N/A
it O O N/A
for O O N/A
a O O N/A
pot O O N/A
of O O N/A
mustard. O O N/A
The O O N/A
pâté O O N/A
is O O N/A
made O O N/A
in O O N/A
house, O O N/A
as O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
gorgeously O O N/A
smooth O O N/A
boudin O O N/A
blanc. O O N/A
With O O N/A
the O O N/A
boudin, O O N/A
you O O N/A
want O O N/A
puréed O O N/A
potatoes O O N/A
that O O N/A
are O O N/A
almost O O N/A
liquid. O O N/A
That O O N/A
is O O N/A
what O O N/A
you O O N/A
get. O O N/A
You O O N/A
might O O N/A
argue O O N/A
that, O O N/A
when O O N/A
it O O N/A
offers O O N/A
chilled O O N/A
king O O N/A
crab O O N/A
legs O O N/A
to O O N/A
be O O N/A
dipped O O N/A
in O O N/A
aioli, O O N/A
this O O N/A
unextravagant O O N/A
cafe O O N/A
breaks O O N/A
character. O O N/A
Does O O N/A
the O O N/A
same O O N/A
apply O O N/A
to O O N/A
garnishing O O N/A
sardines O O N/A
served O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
can O O N/A
with O O N/A
an O O N/A
ingot O O N/A
of O O N/A
prized, O O N/A
costly O O N/A
butter O O N/A
made O O N/A
by O O N/A
Jean-Yves O O N/A
Bordier? O O N/A
Maybe. O O N/A
I O O N/A
thought, O O N/A
in O O N/A
any O O N/A
case, O O N/A
that O O N/A
the O O N/A
sardines O O N/A
and O O N/A
the O O N/A
olive O O N/A
oil O O N/A
they O O N/A
are O O N/A
packed O O N/A
in O O N/A
tended O O N/A
to O O N/A
talk O O N/A
over O O N/A
the O O N/A
butter. O O N/A
The O O N/A
half O O N/A
roast O O N/A
chicken O O N/A
is O O N/A
not O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
same O O N/A
class O O N/A
as O O N/A
the O O N/A
birds O O N/A
that O O N/A
Antoine O O N/A
Westermann O O N/A
cooked O O N/A
when O O N/A
he O O N/A
was O O N/A
still O O N/A
at O O N/A
Le O O N/A
Coq O O N/A
Rico O O N/A
, O O N/A
but O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
probably O O N/A
as O O N/A
good O O N/A
a O O N/A
roast O O N/A
chicken O O N/A
as O O N/A
any O O N/A
normal O O N/A
restaurant O O N/A
can O O N/A
produce. O O N/A
The O O N/A
duck O O N/A
in O O N/A
olives, O O N/A
though, O O N/A
is O O N/A
misconceived; O O N/A
the O O N/A
sauce O O N/A
is O O N/A
thin, O O N/A
acrid O O N/A
and O O N/A
one-dimensional O O N/A
instead O O N/A
of O O N/A
head-spinningly O O N/A
rich, O O N/A
the O O N/A
way O O N/A
it O O N/A
is O O N/A
at O O N/A
Allard O O N/A
in O O N/A
Paris O O N/A
. O O N/A
The O O N/A
seafood O O N/A
-- O O N/A
the O O N/A
trout O O N/A
amandine O O N/A
with O O N/A
its O O N/A
sautéed O O N/A
skin O O N/A
taut O O N/A
beneath O O N/A
its O O N/A
armor O O N/A
of O O N/A
toasted O O N/A
almonds; O O N/A
steamed O O N/A
mussels O O N/A
in O O N/A
a O O N/A
lemon O O N/A
broth O O N/A
that's O O N/A
satiny O O N/A
with O O N/A
melted O O N/A
butter; O O N/A
an O O N/A
entire O O N/A
steamed O O N/A
branzino O O N/A
with O O N/A
enough O O N/A
crisp O O N/A
summer O O N/A
vegetables O O N/A
to O O N/A
make O O N/A
a O O N/A
salad O O N/A
-- O O N/A
is O O N/A
very O O N/A
appealing, O O N/A
though O O N/A
that O O N/A
won't O O N/A
stop O O N/A
the O O N/A
people O O N/A
who O O N/A
are O O N/A
going O O N/A
to O O N/A
get O O N/A
steak O O N/A
frites O O N/A
without O O N/A
even O O N/A
a O O N/A
glance O O N/A
at O O N/A
the O O N/A
menu. O O N/A
Those O O N/A
people O O N/A
may O O N/A
get O O N/A
fries O O N/A
that O O N/A
are O O N/A
crunchy O O N/A
and O O N/A
golden, O O N/A
or O O N/A
they O O N/A
might O O N/A
end O O N/A
up O O N/A
with O O N/A
a O O N/A
limp, O O N/A
oily O O N/A
batch, O O N/A
or O O N/A
they O O N/A
may O O N/A
get O O N/A
both O O N/A
in O O N/A
the O O N/A
same O O N/A
night, O O N/A
as O O N/A
I O O N/A
did. O O N/A
At O O N/A
the O O N/A
length O O N/A
of O O N/A
20 O O N/A
years, O O N/A
memories O O N/A
are O O N/A
untrustworthy, O O N/A
but O O N/A
I'm O O N/A
reasonably O O N/A
sure O O N/A
the O O N/A
food O O N/A
at O O N/A
Pastis O O N/A
is O O N/A
better O O N/A
than O O N/A
it O O N/A
used O O N/A
to O O N/A
be. O O N/A
The O O N/A
wine O O N/A
is O O N/A
certainly O O N/A
more O O N/A
interesting. O O N/A
What's O O N/A
gone, O O N/A
and O O N/A
won't O O N/A
be O O N/A
back O O N/A
now O O N/A
that O O N/A
the O O N/A
surrounding O O N/A
addresses O O N/A
have O O N/A
been O O N/A
taken O O N/A
over O O N/A
by O O N/A
shops O O N/A
like O O N/A
Loro O O N/A
Piana, O O N/A
Sephora, O O N/A
Hermès O O N/A
and O O N/A
RH, O O N/A
is O O N/A
the O O N/A
pure O O N/A
downtown O O N/A

coolest O O N/A

The O O N/A

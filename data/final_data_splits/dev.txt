One O
of O
the O
ways O
people O
pretend O
to O
be O
sophisticated O
about O
restaurants O
these O
days O
is O
by O
claiming O
that O
the O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
dining O
scene O
has O
lost O
its O
edge. O
The O
sheer O
number O
of O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
-- O
about O
27,000, O
according O
to O
the O
health O
inspectors O
-- O
makes O
the O
argument O
absurd. O
How O
many O
of O
them O
are O
slipping? O
All O
of O
them? O
Just O
the O
first O
20,000 O
or O
so? O
In O
reality, O
people O
who O
gripe O
about O
the O
state O
of O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
restaurants O
are O
usually O
talking O
about O
a O
sliver O
of O
a O
slice O
of O
a O
fraction, O
probably O
around O
50 O
places O
whose O
names O
are O
in O
steady O
circulation, O
with O
the O
newest O
weighing O
most O
heavily O
in O
the O
results. O
The O
number O
of O
really O
good O
ones O
is O
higher O
than O
anyone O
can O
count. O
Places O
that O
other O
cities O
would O
brag O
about O
get O
lost O
in O
the O
crowd O
here. O
The O
chef O
Günther O
Seeger, O
for O
instance, O
was O
a O
national O
star O
when O
he O
cooked O
in O
Atlanta. B-LOC
The O
tasting-menu O
restaurant O
he O
opened O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
Village I-LOC
three O
years O
ago O
should O
have O
been O
a O
major O
destination, O
especially O
after O
he O
dropped O
the O
prices. O
Mr. O
Seeger O
can O
make O
ingredients O
bend O
to O
his O
will O
almost O
without O
touching O
them. O
His O
cooking O
outshone O
that O
of O
some O
of O
the O
city's O
more O
famous O
chefs, O
who O
whip O
their O
ingredients O
harder O
with O
far O
less O
payoff. O
Yet O
he O
struggled O
to O
put O
Günther B-EST
Seeger I-EST
NY I-EST
on O
the O
map. O
I O
reviewed O
it, O
but O
some O
other O
critics O
didn't, O
and O
by O
the O
time O
it O
closed, O
last O
month, O
Chris O
Crowley O
of O
Grub O
Street O
wrote O
, O
"it O
wasn't O
a O
restaurant O
you O
heard O
a O
lot O
of O
food O
geeks O
talk O
about." O
Mr. O
Seeger O
complained O
to O
one O
acquaintance O
that O
he O
couldn't O
even O
get O
on O
a O
list O
of O
New B-LOC
York's I-LOC
100 O
best O
restaurants. O
Of O
course, O
good O
restaurants O
fail O
everywhere, O
but O
it's O
hard O
to O
imagine O
Mr. O
Seeger O
vanishing O
into O
the O
crowd B-LOC
in I-LOC
San I-LOC
Francisco, I-LOC
Chicago B-LOC
or O
Los B-LOC
Angeles. I-LOC
Considered O
and O
rejected, O
maybe. O
But O
overlooked? O
Not O
likely. O
I'm O
not O
sure O
that O
any O
words O
of O
mine O
could O
have O
persuaded O
the O
city O
to O
cuddle O
up O
to O
Mr. O
Seeger, O
who O
isn't O
particularly O
cuddly. O
But O
I O
wish O
I'd O
found O
ways O
to O
remind O
New O
Yorkers O
that O
his O
breathtakingly O
pure O
cooking O
was O
there O
to O
be O
enjoyed O
while O
that O
was O
still O
true. O
Which O
brings O
us, O
by O
a O
circuitous O
and O
not O
particularly O
well-paved O
route, O
to O
Anthony O
Mangieri O
of O
Una B-EST
Pizza I-EST
Napoletana I-EST
. O
Using O
naturally O
leavened B-FOOD
dough I-FOOD
and O
a O
short O
shopping O
list O
of O
ingredients, O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
makes O
what O
is O
unmistakably O
the O
finest O
sit-down O
pizza O
in O
the O
five O
boroughs. O
(I O
doubt O
he O
has O
any O
rivals O
in O
the O
stand-up O
joints, O
either, O
but O
slice O
pizza O
is O
a O
different O
game.) O
Two O
years O
ago, O
I O
posited O
that O
Razza, O
a O
pizzeria O
in O
Jersey O
City, O
made O
"the O
best O
pizza O
in O
New O
York." O
I O
don't O
regret O
writing O
that, O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
was O
not O
cooking O
in O
the O
city O
at O
the O
time O
and O
that O
Razza's O
chef, O
Dan O
Richer, O
has O
said O
that O
he O
began O
taking O
pizza O
seriously O
only O
after O
he O
met O
Mr. O
Mangieri. O
Una O
Pizza O
Napoletana O
saw O
a O
rush O
of O
curious O
pie-eaters O
after O
it O
opened O
on O
Orchard O
Street O
a O
little O
more O
than O
a O
year O
ago. O
But O
the O
last O
few O
times O
I've O
gone, O
there O
were O
too O
many O
unclaimed O
chairs O
and O
bar O
stools. O
When O
Anthony O
Mangieri O
is O
making O
pizza, O
the O
right O
number O
of O
empty O
seats O
is O
zero, O
as O
any O
New O
Yorker O
who O
waited O
in O
line O
at O
the O
old O
Una O
Pizza O
Napoletana, O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
from O
2004 O
to O
2009, O
could O
tell O
you. O
Press O
interest O
in O
the O
new O
place O
has O
died O
down, O
too. O
So O
when O
I O
heard O
a O
rumor O
that O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
was O
thinking O
of O
leaving O
the O
city O
and O
taking O
his O
pizza O
with O
him, O
I O
was O
unnerved, O
to O
put O
it O
mildly. O
Asked O
about O
it, O
he O
told O
me O
he O
was O
considering O
it O
but O
hadn't O
made O
up O
his O
mind. O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
has O
left O
New O
York O
before, O
and O
I O
didn't O
like O
it O
then, O
either. O
This O
time, O
I O
wasn't O
going O
to O
let O
him O
get O
away O
without O
a O
fight. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
my O
review O
of O
Una O
Pizza O
Napoletana O
last O
year O
was O
decidedly O
mixed. O
It O
is O
also O
true, O
though, O
that O
almost O
every O
criticism O
I O
made O
has O
been O
addressed. O
It O
has O
gone O
from O
one O
of O
the O
most O
confounding O
pizzerias O
in O
the O
city O
to O
one O
of O
the O
most O
enjoyable. O
The O
problem O
with O
Una O
Pizza O
a O
year O
ago O
was O
that O
it O
was O
trying O
to O
be O
two O
things O
at O
once. O
It O
was, O
of O
course, O
a O
Neapolitan O
pizzeria, O
serving O
classic, O
unadorned O
pies O
baked O
for O
about O
two O
minutes O
inside O
a O
wood-burning O
oven O
shaped O
like O
an O
igloo. O
But O
it O
was O
also O
a O
cutting-edge O
Lower O
East O
Side O
experiment. O
At O
the O
instigation O
of O
Mr. O
Mangieri's O
partners, O
the O
chefs O
Fabian O
von O
Hauske O
Valtierra O
and O
Jeremiah O
Stone, O
the O
kitchen O
brought O
forth O
appetizers O
that O
had O
rarely O
if O
ever O
been O
asked O
to O
live O
under O
one O
roof O
with O
a O
pizza. O
There O
was O
a O
jellylike O
mass O
of O
raw O
lobster O
inside O
a O
ring O
of O
chickpeas, O
and O
a O
rust-colored O
puddle O
of O
'nduja O
under O
raw O
turnips O
and O
nasturtium O
leaves. O
The O
wine O
list O
was O
virtually O
a O
treatise O
on O
natural O
wines, O
a O
long O
document O
full O
of O
the O
names O
of O
eccentric O
producers O
and O
obscure O
European O
villages. O
In O
another O
restaurant, O
all O
this O
would O
have O
been O
the O
departure O
point O
for O
some O
adventurous O
evenings. O
But O
in O
a O
pizzeria O
it O
led O
to O
some O
peculiar O
pairings, O
made O
the O
check O
a O
bit O
higher O
than O
you O
wanted O
and O
resulted O
in O
long O
waits O
before O
you O
were O
finally O
allowed O
to O
eat O
the O
delicious O
pizza O
you'd O
come O
for. O
Over O
the O
past O
year, O
Mr. O
von O
Hauske O
and O
Mr. O
Stone O
have O
stepped O
aside, O
letting O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
call O
the O
shots. O
The O
wines O
on O
offer O
now O
number O
about O
15. O
They O
are O
still O
a O
likably O
eccentric O
lot, O
but O
picking O
one O
doesn't O
feel O
like O
studying O
for O
a O
master O
sommelier O
exam. O
The O
appetizers O
are O
simpler O
and O
less O
expensive: O
a O
plate O
of O
marinated O
white O
anchovies, O
a O
dish O
of O
warm O
Italian O
olives O
or O
a O
bowl O
of O
Little O
Gem O
lettuce O
with O
sunflower O
seeds O
in O
a O
Caesarish O
dressing. O
I O
do O
miss O
the O
tiramisù O
from O
the O
opening O
menu, O
but O
the O
new O
cannoli O
filled O
with O
ricotta O
-- O
a O
blend O
of O
domestic O
cow's O
milk O
and O
Italian O
sheep's O
milk O
-- O
are O
nearly O
as O
good. O
It's O
common O
for O
a O
new O
restaurant O
to O
trim O
its O
sails, O
but O
this O
one O
has O
trimmed O
its O
prices, O
too. O
In O
the O
beginning O
the O
five O
regular O
pizzas O
were O
all O
$25; O
now O
they O
range O
from O
$19 O
to O
$25, O
and O
the O
two O
extra-complicated O
Friday O
and O
Saturday O
pizzas O
are O
priced O
at O
$26. O
I O
liked O
Mr. O
Mangieri's O
pies O
in O
the O
East O
Village, O
I O
liked O
them O
more O
when O
he O
came O
back O
to O
town, O
and O
it's O
possible, O
just O
possible, O
that O
they've O
improved O
over O
the O
past O
year. O
He O
is, O
like O
Mr. O
Seeger, O
a O
minimalist. O
He O
lets O
you O
notice O
each O
ingredient: O
the O
little O
ping O
of O
sourness O
in O
the O
Campanian O
buffalo O
mozzarella, O
for O
instance. O
Or O
the O
unruly, O
windswept-hillside O
aroma O
of O
dried O
Sicilian O
oregano. O
The O
precise O
crunch O
of O
each O
unrefined O
Trapani O
sea-salt O
crystal O
waiting O
to O
dissolve. O
The O
crust O
is O
so O
tender O
it O
barely O
fights O
fork, O
knife O
or O
teeth. O
Some O
diners O
will O
wish O
it O
put O
up O
more O
crackly O
resistance. O
You O
inhale O
it O
at O
least O
as O
much O
as O
you O
eat O
it. O
When O
you O
have O
finished, O
some O
of O
the O
most O
popular O
pizzas O
in O
town O
will O
seem O
tough, O
leathery, O
overworked. O
Even O
if O
this O
is O
not O
the O
style O
you O
crave, O
you'll O
know O
that O
it's O
the O
work O
of O
a O
baker O
who O
has O
spent O
years O
listening O
to O
the O
dough. O
There O
is O
a O
place O
for O
people O
who O
are O
as O
obsessed O
with O
pizza O
as O
Mr. O
Mangieri, O
and O
the O
place O
is O
New O
York O
City. O

Good O
restaurants O
don't O
rain O
down O
from O
nowhere, O
but O
Crown B-EST
Shy I-EST
came O
close. O
No O
doubt O
it O
went O
through O
the O
same O
birth O
pangs O
as O
all O
the O
others. O
As O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell, O
though, O
it O
simply O
materialized O
one O
morning O
this O
March O
at O
70 B-LOC
Pine I-LOC
Street, I-LOC
and O
was O
open O
for O
business O
that O
afternoon O
by O
the O
time O
the O
financial O
district's O
elevators O
began O
disgorging O
traders, O
bankers O
and O
analysts O
in O
search O
of O
5-o'clock O
refreshment. O
One O
reason O
it O
seems O
to O
have O
crept O
up O
on O
the O
city O
is O
that O
it's O
a O
large, O
well-capitalized, O
big-time O
restaurant O
of O
the O
kind O
that O
only O
established O
groups O
seem O
able O
to O
get O
off O
the O
ground O
these O
days. O
Yet O
Crown B-EST
Shy I-EST
doesn't O
come O
from O
Danny O
Meyer, O
Andrew O
Carmellini O
or O
any O
of O
the O
other O
usual O
suspects. O
Its O
two O
main O
players O
were O
recruited O
after O
talks O
among O
April O
Bloomfield, O
Ken O
Friedman O
and O
the O
building's O
developer O
fell O
apart O
in O
2016, O
before O
accusations O
of O
sexual O
harassment O
engulfed O
Mr. O
Friedman. O
Crown B-EST
Shy's I-EST
chef, O
James O
Kent, O
used O
to O
run O
the O
kitchen O
at O
the O
NoMad B-EST

and O
his O

Jeff O

Neither O
exactly O
fell O
off O
the O

last O

As O
a O
team, O
though, O
they're O
unproven, O
and O
as O
they O
went O
through O
construction O
and O
hiring, O
the O
drumbeat O
of O
publicity O
was O
more O
muted O
than O
it O
might O
have O
been O
if O
marquee O
names O
had O
led O
the O
project. O
Then O
there O
is O
Crown B-EST
Shy's I-EST
location, O
a O
sprawling, O
soaring, O
street-level O
space O
that, O
as O
far O
as O
anyone O
recalls, O
has O
never O
held O
a O
restaurant O
before. O
Many O
New O
Yorkers O
have O
seen O
the O
1932 O
building's O
distinctive, O
hulking, O
pyramidal O
silhouette O
on O
the O
skyline, O
but O
until O
recently, O
when O
the O
offices O
on O
its O
67 O
stories O
were O
repurposed O
as O
expensive O
apartments O
and O
hotel O
rooms, O
not O
many O
had O
encountered O
the O
frenzied O
exuberance O
of O
the O
lobby, O
which O
makes O
use O
of O
polished O
marble O
in O
at O
least O
five O
contrasting O
colors. O
It O
looks O
like O
something O
Bernini O
would O
have O
designed O
if O
he'd O
lived O
to O
see O
the O
Jazz O
Age. O
Depending O
on O
which O
entrance O
you O
use O
-- O
the O
revolving O
doors O
are O
crowned O
with O
aluminum O
reliefs O
of O
Art O

flowers O
being O
pollinated O
by O
elongated O

butterflies O
-- O
you O
may O
want O
to O
allow O
an O
extra O
five O
or O
10 O
minutes O
to O
take O
it O
all O
in O
before O
you O
eat. O
Above O
all, O
it's O
the O
extent O
to O
which O
Crown B-EST
Shy I-EST
already O
has O
its O
act O
together O
that O
makes O
you O
ask: O
Where O
did O
this O

The O
whole O

radiates O
confidence O

side. O
The O
effect O
is O
witty O
and O
delicious, O
progressing O
from O
purely O
sweet O
to O
bittersweet O
to O
tart O
and O
bittersweet. O
Mr. O
Kent's O
savory O
dishes O
pursue O
the O
same O
strategy. O
This O
is O
to O
say, O
they O
regularly O
over-deliver, O
starting O
with O
the O
iced B-DISH
Wellfleet I-DISH
oysters I-DISH
dressed O

cucumber B-FOOD

diced O
cucumbers, B-FOOD

white B-FOOD
bean I-FOOD
hummus I-FOOD
under O
a O
fiery O
red O
slick O

melted B-FOOD
'nduja I-FOOD
is O
probably O
meant O
to O
be O
shared, O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
I'd O
tasted O
it O
I O
came O
up O
with O
other O
ideas, O
as O
my O
dinner O
guests O
will O
testify. O
Two O
tartares B-FOOD
show O
Mr. O
Kent's O
talent O
for O
carrying O
bright O
new O
ideas O
with O
him O
into O
well-traveled O
territory. O
In O
the O
first, O
he O
laces O
hand-chopped O
raw B-FOOD
beef I-FOOD
with O
toasted B-FOOD
walnuts I-FOOD
and O
earthy O
rye B-FOOD
croutons; I-FOOD
in O
the O
other, O
chopped O
raw B-FOOD
snapper I-FOOD
is O
sprinkled O
with O
individual O
juice-filled O
vesicles O
of O
grapefruit, B-FOOD
lime, B-FOOD
lemon B-FOOD
and O
orange B-FOOD
that O
pop O
between O
your O
teeth, O
a O
kind O
of O
instant, O
interactive O
ceviche. B-FOOD
Maybe O
one O
or O
two O
ideas O
should O
have O
been O
left O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
road. O
The O
chicken B-DISH
liver I-DISH
ragù I-DISH
tossed I-DISH
with O
housemade O
cavatelli B-FOOD
doesn't O
need O
to O
be O
so O
sweet O
with O
sherry; B-FOOD
a O
rough O
pesto B-FOOD
is O
a O
fine O
use O
for O
fresh O
chickpeas, B-FOOD
but O
isn't O
there O
a O
better O
partner O
for O
it O
than O
shaved O
jicama? B-FOOD
All O
is O
forgiven O
when O
Mr. O
Kent O
turns O
a O
mainstay O
like O
grilled B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
into O
a O
main O
course O
as O
exciting O
as O
the O
one O
at O
Crown B-EST
Shy, I-EST
which O
keeps O
the O
sunshine O
brightness O
of O
its O
citrus B-FOOD
marinade, I-FOOD
and O
is O
served O
with O
a O
purée-slash-hot B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
of I-FOOD
fermented I-FOOD
hot I-FOOD
and I-FOOD
sweet I-FOOD
peppers. I-FOOD
The O
vivid O
orange O
of O
that O
hot B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
almost O
matches O
the O
marble O
in O
the O
lobby. O
But O
Crown B-EST
Shy's I-EST
two O
big O
dining O
rooms O
and O
extended O
bar O
are O
a O
little O
more O
restrained, O
dominated O
by O
cream O
tones, O
blond O
wood O
tables, O
and O
chairs O
with O
saddle-brown O
leather O
seats O
and O
backs. O
The O
only O
echoes O
of O
grandeur O
are O
the O
enormous O
windows O
and O
the O
ceiling O
high O
up O
overhead. O
The O
wine O
list O
is O
one O
to O
get O
lost O
in. O
Finance O
wizards O
with O
bonuses O
to O
expunge O
can O
certainly O
do O
that, O
but O
it's O
great O
to O
see O
lots O
of O
bottles O
under O
$100 O
on O
almost O
every O
page. O
Anyone O
who O
knows O
what O
some O
of O
these O
wines B-FOOD
cost O
wholesale O
will O
be O
able O
to O
locate O
any O
number O
of O
good O
deals, O
but O
even O
the O
unschooled O
will O
notice O
the O
value O
regions. O
They O
jump O
off O
the O
page: O
Portugal, B-LOC
Greece B-LOC
and O
New B-LOC
Zealand, I-LOC
for O
instance, O
along O
with O
vast O
stretches O
of O
Germany B-LOC
and O
pockets O
of O
Spain, B-LOC
France B-LOC
and O
Italy. B-LOC
With O
so O
many O
strengths, O
Crown B-EST
Shy I-EST
must O
have O
at O
least O
one O
thing O
wrong O
with O
it. O
And O
yes, O
it O
does. O
Obviously O
that O
name O
is O
ridiculous. O
Knowing O
that O
it O
refers O
to O
a O
tendency O
of O
very O
tall O
trees O
not O
to O
let O
their O
upper O
stories O
grow O
into O
their O
neighbors' O
branches O
doesn't O
help, O
either. O
But O
we O
should O
probably O
get O
used O
to O
it, O
because O
we're O
going O
to O
be O

afternoon O

Each O
one O
is O
steamed O

you O
realize O
fairly O
quickly O
that O
you O
have O
essentially O
two O
choices: O
You O
can O
use O
a O
spoon, O

hold O
the O

to O
your O

and O
tip O
it O
up O
while O
throwing O
your O
head O
back, O
as O
if O
doing O
a O
Jell-O B-FOOD
shot. I-FOOD
If O
you O
go O
the O
Jell-O B-FOOD

route, O
it O
may O
help O
to O
bring O
a O
pair O
of O
chopsticks O

a O
fingertip O
into O
play O
at O
the O
last O
minute O
to O
encourage O
the O
banh B-FOOD
beo I-FOOD
to O
leave O
the O
nest. O
You O
have O
now O
transferred O
to O
your O
mouth O
a O
warm O
divot O
of O
steamed B-FOOD
rice I-FOOD
and O
tapioca B-FOOD
flours I-FOOD
that O
has O
a O
consistency O
like O
panna B-FOOD
cotta's I-FOOD
and O
a O
negligible O
flavor O
on O
its O
own. O
All O
the O
action O
is O
in O
the O
toppings. O
At O
Van B-EST

these O
include O
a O
spoonful O
of O
chopped O
scallions B-FOOD
and O
the O

they O
were O
sizzled, O

Van B-EST

joined O
the O
East B-LOC
Village's I-LOC
growing O
hub O
of O
interesting O
Vietnamese B-CUISINE
restaurants O
three O
months O
ago. O
Like O
Hanoi B-EST
House I-EST
, O
Madame B-EST
Vo I-EST
and O
Madame B-EST
Vo I-EST
BBQ I-EST
, O
it O
is O
semitraditional O
and O
semimodern. O
Those O
two O
strains O
are O
embodied O
at O
Van B-EST
Da I-EST
by, O
respectively, O
Yen O
Ngo O
and O
Hannah O
Wong. O
Ms. O
Ngo, O
who O
owns O
the O
place, O
was O
raised O
in O
Dalat, B-LOC
Vietnam, I-LOC
and O
while O
she O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
catering O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
for O
years, O
she O
has O
never O
had O
a O
chance O
before O
to O
show O
off O
the O
food O
of O
her O
childhood, O
like O
the O
banh B-FOOD
beo I-FOOD
steamed O
by O
her O
mother, O
who O
had O
grown O
up O
in O
Hue. B-LOC
Ms. O
Wong O
is O
the O
chef. O
Though O
she O
has O
cooked O
at O
Gramercy B-EST
Tavern I-EST
and O
Battersby B-EST
, O
her O
background O
in O
the O
food O
of O
Vietnam B-LOC
before O
Van B-EST
Da I-EST
was O
more O
or O
less O
confined O
to O
the O
roughly O
two O
weeks O
she O
spent O
traveling O
there O
while O
living O
in O
Hong B-LOC
Kong I-LOC
on O
a O
Fulbright O
grant O
a O
decade O
ago. O
Nevertheless, O
she O
has O
put O
together O
a O
trenchant, O
concise O
and O
pleasure-focused O
menu O
of O
Vietnamese B-CUISINE
dishes. O
Some O
she O
learned O
directly O
from O
her O
boss, O
and O
on O
those O
recipes O
she O
was O
apparently O
discouraged O
from O
drawing O
outside O
the O
lines. O
Others O
are O
more O
freely O
interpreted. O
It's O
a O
credit O
to O
Ms. O
Wong's O
sensitivity O
that O
if O
you O
don't O
already O
know O
the O
original O
templates, O
it O
can O
be O
hard O
to O
tell O
where O
they O
end O
and O
her O
imagination O
begins. O
Banh B-DISH
beo I-DISH
and O
the O
other O
snacks O
from O
Hue B-EST
that O
Ms. O
Ngo O
taught O
Ms. O
Wong O
get O
their O
own O
berth O
on O
the O
menu. O
As O
you'd O
imagine, O
they O
tend O
to O
be O
very O
good. O
Banh B-DISH
it I-DISH
ram I-DISH
are O
chewy, O
fried O
balls O
of O
mochi, B-FOOD
filled O
with O
a O
coconut-soaked B-FOOD
mash I-FOOD
of I-FOOD
mung I-FOOD
beans I-FOOD
and I-FOOD
shallots. I-FOOD
Banh B-DISH
khot I-DISH
are I-DISH
little O
rice-flour B-FOOD
pancakes I-FOOD
molded O
into O
edible O
cups O
about O
the O
size O
of O
a O
Ritz B-FOOD
cracker. I-FOOD
In O
Vietnam, B-LOC
the O
cups O
would O
be O
filled O
with O
shrimp. B-FOOD
Ms. O
Wong O
instead O
spoons O
sautéed B-FOOD
mushrooms I-FOOD
into O
hers, O
along O
with O
a O
crisscrossing O
of O
fresh O
herbs B-FOOD
and O
a O
spill O
of O
coconut O
cream. O
Ms. O
Wong O
makes O
an O
effort O
to O
bring O
out O
regional O
differences O
in O
Vietnamese O
cuisine O
by O
devoting O
sections O
of O
the O
menu O
to O
Saigon O
and O
Hanoi, O
hundreds O
of O
miles O
apart, O
as O
well O
as O
Hue, O
somewhere O
in O
the O
middle. O
She O
doesn't O
have O
quite O
enough O
dishes O
from O
any O
one O
place O
to O
paint O
a O
full O
picture, O
but O
the O
project O
is O
intriguing. O
Like O
other O
New O
York O
chefs, O
she O
has O
been O
caught O
in O
the O
tractor O
beam O
of O
cha O
ca O
la O
Vong O
, O
the O
turmeric-and O
dill-scented O
fish O
dish O
that O
is O
a O
specialty O
of O
a O
100-year-old O
Hanoi O
restaurant O
of O
the O
same O
name. O
Her O
version, O
though, O
supplies O
less O
dill, O
less O
sauce O
and O
less O
satisfaction O
than O
some O
others. O
Her O
two O
improvisations O
on O
the O
theme O
of O
Hanoi's O
best-known O
contribution O
to O
gastronomy, O
pho, O
are O
more O
effective. O
One O
gives O
you O
the O
soup O
without O
the O
noodles; O
floating O
in O
a O
rich O
and O
cloudy O
broth O
are O
ghostly O
white, O
billowing O
won O
tons O
that O
contain O
chopped O
beef O
fillet O
freely O
seasoned O
with O
black O
pepper. O
The O
other O
dish O
is, O
humbly O
enough, O
a O
plate O
of O
soupless O
pho O
noodles O
stir-fried O
with O
springy O
mushrooms, O
bitter O
greens O
and O
chopped O
scallions. O
Its O
simplicity O
makes O
the O
impact O
of O
the O
dish O
hard O
to O
explain O
until O
you O
learn O
that O
it O
has O
been O
showered O
with O
Maggi O
Seasoning O
, O
a O
soylike O
sauce O
that O
is O
the O
invisible O
secret O
of O
many O
Vietnamese O
dishes. O
Nodding O
toward O
Saigon, O
Ms. O
Wong O
makes O
a O
rendition O
of O
shaking O
beef O
by O
stir-frying O
tender O
and O
chewy O
marinated O
hanger O
steak O
with O
potatoes O
and O
then O
throwing O
a O
fistful O
of O
watercress O
at O
it. O
If O
you O
think O
that O
sounds O
like O
a O
French O
bistro O
plate, O
then O
you O
are O
starting O
to O
understand O
how O
her O
mind O
works. O
Ms. O
Wong O
cooks O
skillfully, O
with O
an O
appreciation O
for O
nuance, O
and O
she O
doesn't O
abuse O
her O
freedom O
by O
innovating O
pointlessly. O
It's O
possible, O
though, O
that O
she O
could O
stand O
to O
be O
less O
shy O
with O
chiles O
and O
herbs. O
The O
table O
salad O
of O
greenery O
to O
be O
wrapped O
around O
grilled O
shrimp O
offers O
no O
herbs O
other O
than O
mint O
and O
basil, O
and O
you'll O
run O
out O
of O
lettuce O
before O
the O
fourth O
shrimp O
has O
been O
dressed. O
The O
green O
papaya O
salad O
is O
a O
little O
too O
innocuous, O
and O
while O
her O
version O
of O
the O
street O
snack O
of O
grilled O
corn O
in O
fish O
sauce O
is O
a O
real O
success, O
fresh O
chiles O
would O
have O
more O
impact O
than O
the O
chile O
threads O
Ms. O
Wong O
balances O
on O
top. O
(Incidentally, O
the O
kitchen O
at O
Van O
Da O
makes O
a O
fine O
hot O
sauce O
that O
is O
like O
a O
milder O
and O
less O
acidic O
Sriracha, O
but O
servers O
never O
seem O
to O
remember O
to O
mention O
it O
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal.) O
There O
are O
just O
three O
desserts. O
By O
the O
time O
you O
order, O
one O
or O
two O
may O
have O
been O
86ed. O
With O
luck, O
though, O
the O
che O
will O
have O
survived. O
In O
Vietnam, O
che O
is O
thought O
of O
as O
a O
drink O
even O
though O
it O
can O
take O
the O
form O
of O
a O
pudding, O
as O
it O
does O
here, O
where O
warm O
pearls O
and O
threads O
of O
tapioca O
are O
cooked O
in O
coconut O
milk O
with O
cubes O
of O
soft O
taro. O
It O
is O
just O
sweet O
enough O
to O
qualify O
as O
a O
dessert. O
A O
black O
dust O
darkens O
the O
surface: O
black-sesame O
brittle, O
ground O
to O
powder. O
Even O
a O
single O
dessert O
qualifies O
as O
an O
impressive O
feat O
inside O
Van O
Da's O
tight O
quarters. O
Through O
the O
miracle O
of O
careful O
design, O
the O
space O
almost O
never O
feels O
cramped, O
but O
this O
is O
still O
an O
intimate O
restaurant. O
In O
the O
basement O
is O
a O
small O
seating O
area O
laid O
out O
as O
efficiently O
as O
the O
cockpit O
of O
a O
fighter O
jet; O
above O
it, O
at O
the O
top O
of O
a O
staircase, O
is O
an O
even O
smaller O
seating O
area O
sharing O
a O
room O
with O
a O
window-facing O
dining O
counter, O
the O
kitchen O
and O
a O
bar. O
The O
cocktails O
that O
roll O
off O
that O
bar, O
like O
the O
gin-and-celery O
duet O
called O
the O
White O
Tiger, O
are O
much O
more O
sharply O
drawn O
than O
the O
drinks O
at O
restaurants O
with O
twice O
the O
space O
and O
four O
times O
the O
budget. O

Talking O

to O
ask, O
What's O
in O

for O
us? O
Mr. O
Keller's O
answer O
is O
a O
restaurant O
that O
looks O
and O
acts O
like O
a O
millionaire's O
hangout O
in O
an O
old O
New O

cartoon. O
It O
charges O
like O
one, O
too, O
with O
adjustments O
for O
inflation. O
An O

is O
the O
least O
expensive O

at O

followed O
by O

for O
$42. O
After O
that, O
please O
turn O
off O
all O

and O
place O
your O
tray O
tables O
in O
the O
upright, O
locked O
position, O
because O
we O
are O
going O
up O
to O
$66 O
and O
$75 O
before O
reaching O
a O
cruising O
altitude O
of O
$85. O
Look O
down O
there O
-- O
don't O
the O
people O
look O

ants? O

Hudson B-LOC
Yards I-LOC
has O
stirred O
up O
New O
Yorkers' O
latent O
resentment O
of O
chain O
stores O
from O
beyond O
the O
Hudson, B-LOC
and O
what O
does O
Mr. O
Keller O
offer O
them O
but O
a O
clone O
of O
his O
restaurant O
in O
Florida, B-LOC
the O
Surf B-EST
Club I-EST
? O
The O
name O
has O
been O
changed, O
but O
the O
menus O
are O
nearly O
identical; O
they O
glorify O
the O
strait-laced, O
spice-free O
food O
that O
rich O
white O
Americans O
used O
to O
feed O
on O
when O
nobody O
was O
shaming O
them O
into O
being O
adventurous. O
It O
is O
the O
food O
of O
"21," O
of O
three-martini O
lunches, O
steakhouses B-TYPE
and O
country B-TYPE
clubs: I-TYPE
prime B-DISH
rib I-DISH
and O
Dover B-DISH
sole, I-DISH
iceberg B-FOOD

and O
oysters B-DISH
Rockefeller. I-DISH
Of O
course, O
being O
a O
Thomas O
Keller O
production, O
TAK B-EST
Room I-EST
serves O
the O
most O
refined, O
meticulous O
country B-TYPE
club I-TYPE
food O
you've O
ever O
seen. O
Most O
of O
it O
is O
very O
good, O
and O
a O
few O
things O
are O
so O
inexplicably O
delicious O
that O
you O
have O
the O
sensation O
of O
slipping O
the O
knots O
of O
gravity O
and O
floating O
an O
inch O
or O
so O
above O
your O
seat. O
The O
entrance O
is O
on O
the O
fifth O
floor, O
just O
past O
Neiman O
Marcus. O
But O
the O
action O
is O
on O
the O
sixth O
floor, O
up O
a O
Deco-cubist O
staircase O
so O
grand O
that O
you O
may O
feel O
a O
little O
underdressed O
unless O
you O
have O
Carole O
Lombard O
on O
one O
arm. O
(There O
is O
no O
dress O
code.) O
At O
the O
top, O
you O
find O
yourself O
in O
a O
lounge O
where O
a O
pianist O
and O
upright O
bassist O
glide O
through O
satiny O
jazz O
standards. O
Bartenders O
whip O
up O
streamlined, O
uncomplicated O
drinks O
that O
are O
either O
genuine O
classics, O
like O
the O
Pendennis B-DISH
Club, I-DISH
or O
modern O
drinks O
built O
along O
classic O
proportions, O
like O
the O
Tritter B-DISH
rickey, I-DISH
a O
tall, O
fizzy O
gin O
number O
that O
shimmies O
with O
absinthe. O
Around O
sunset, O
when O
pink O
light O
trickles O
through O
the O
western O
windows, O
it O
has O
to O
be O
the O
most O
pleasant O
room O
within O
a O
mile O
for O
fighting O
vainly O
the O
old O
ennui O
. O
They O
let O
people O
eat O
in O
this O
room, O
too, O
and O
it O
is O
tempting. O
But O
there O
is O
more O
to O
see, O
room O
after O
room, O
all O
laid O
out O
by O
the O
London O
interior-design O
firm O
David O
Collins O
Studio. O
There O
are O
leather O
banquettes O
deep O
enough O
to O
lose O
a O
small O
child O
in. O
Facing O
them O
are O
mohair-velvet O
chairs O
that O
swivel O
so O
you O
can O
quietly O
surveil O
the O
room O
without O
craning O
your O
neck. O
Each O
table O
gets O
a O
white O
linen O
cloth O
and O
a O
flickering O
oil O
lamp O
behind O
a O
white O
porcelain O
shade. O
The O
other O
colors O
are O
black O
walnut, O
midnight O
blue O
and O
law-firm O
green. O
At O
some O
point O
a O
captain O
in O
a O
crisply O
tailored O
suit O
will O
deposit O
the O
wine O
list. O
It O
mostly O
avoids O
the O
latest O
fashions, O
like O
a O
croquet O
party O
on O
Nantucket. O
Later O
there O
will O
be O
a O
preamble O
to O
the O
menu. O
Under O
the O
day-to-day O
care O
of O
Jarrod O
Huth, O
TAK O
Room's O
chef O
de O
cuisine, O
it O
has O
a O
continental O
theme O
and O
an O
à O
la O
carte O
format. O
Highlights O
will O
be O
pointed O
out, O
and O
the O
prime O
rib O
will O
certainly O
be O
mentioned, O
as O
will O
the O
restored O
1930s O
silver O
trolley O
on O
which O
it O
is O
ferried O
from O
table O
to O
table. O
Here O
comes O
a O
French O
onion O
dip O
surrounded O
by O
newly O
fried O
potato O
chips O
that O
are O
dark O
without O
a O
hint O
of O
charring. O
This O
is O
TAK O
Room O
in O
one O
extremely O
crunchy, O
lusciously O
creamy O
bite: O
an O
hors O
d'oeuvre O
from O
the O
age O
of O
Naugahyde O
and O
polyester, O
transformed O
into O
something O
so O
good O
and O
pure O
it's O
beyond O
reproach. O
The O
Parker O
House O
rolls O
are O
gravity-defying O
orbs O
served O
with O
soft O
cultured O
butter O
that, O
in O
the O
evening's O
best O
magic O
trick, O
rises O
from O
a O
custom-made O
dish O
in O
six O
identical O
ridged O
curls O
, O
like O
shrimp O
performing O
a O
Busby O
Berkeley O
routine. O
Bespoke O
flourishes O
like O
that O
are O
a O
TAK O
Room O
hallmark; O
see O
also O
the O
oyster O
crackers, O
like O
down O
pillows O
shrunk O
to O
the O
size O
of O
Chiclets, O
served O
with O
the O
silk-smooth O
New O
England O
clam O
chowder O
that O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
likable O
appetizers O
and, O
at O
$16, O
the O
best O
value. O
Another O
hallmark, O
though, O
is O
unevenness. O
Avocado O
Louie O
with O
a O
small O
bouquet O
of O
other O
vegetables O
is O
thrillingly O
right, O
thanks O
to O
a O
Thousand O
Island O
dressing O
that O
crackles O
with O
energy; O
the O
Caesar O
salad, O
made O
while O
you O
watch, O
has O
almost O
no O
personality. O
Grated O
Parmesan O
and O
anchovies O
vanish O
into O
it O
without O
a O
trace, O
along O
with O
dull O
croutons O
that O
could O
take O
some O
pointers O
from O
the O
oyster O
crackers. O
Something O
called O
"warm O
soft O
boiled O
egg" O
is O
a O
quietly O
joyous O
celebration O
of O
luxurious O
flavors O
and O
textures, O
the O
yolk O
running O
like O
lava O
over O
a O
buckwheat O
blin O
and O
a O
heap O
of O
warm O
osetra O
caviar O
in O
crème O
fraîche. O
(Yes, O
warm. O
It's O
wonderful.) O
And O
the O
chilled O
prawn O
cocktail O
is O
going O
to O
be O
my O
platonic O
ideal O
of O
the O
dish O
from O
now O
on. O
But O
the O
crab O
cake O
had O
very O
little O
crab O
flavor, O
on O
two O
different O
nights, O
although O
it O
contained O
almost O
nothing O
else. O
Lobster O
thermidor O
(now O
there's O
a O
name O
I've O
not O
heard O
in O
a O
long, O
long O
time) O
is O
so O
tender, O
its O
sauce O
so O
fluffy O
and O
rich, O
that O
eating O
it O
becomes O
an O
intimate O
act. O
Dover O
sole O
meunière, O
though, O
has O
neither O
the O
crisped O
skin O
nor O
the O
juicy O
flesh O
that O
can O
make O
this O
fish O
so O
alluring. O
Yes, O
life O
cannot O
be O
one O
giant O
plate O
of O
dancing O
butter-shrimp. O
Still, O
the O
gap O
between O
great O
and O
non-great O
items O
-- O
nothing O
comes O
close O
to O
bad O
-- O
is O
a O
bit O
too O
wide O
and O
comes O
into O
view O
a O
bit O
too O
often. O
Regulars O
will O
learn O
to O
work O
the O
menu O
the O
way O
golfers O
learn O
their O
way O
around O
the O
eighth O
hole O
at O
Pebble O
Beach. O
Some O
will O
love O
the O
prime O
rib, O
which O
could O
not O
be O
any O
more O
moist O
without O
breaking O
several O
laws O
of O
chemistry. O
Others O
will O
wish O
that O
it O
had O
more O
concentrated O
beef O
flavor O
and O
that O
the O
flaps O
and O
handles O
had O
not O
been O
trimmed O
off, O
perhaps O
in O
pursuit O
of O
some O
Kellerian O
quest O
for O
bovine O
symmetry. O
A O
large O
number O
will O
settle O
on O
the O
roast O
chicken O
for O
two. O
The O
meat O
is O
juicy O
but O
not O
gushy, O
the O
flavor O
full O
but O
not O
salty, O
the O
jus O
dark O
but O
not O
over-reduced. O
After O
the O
chicken, O
the O
pastry O
chef, O
Alex O
McClenaghan, O
can O
offer O
a O
highly O
refined O
coconut O
cake O
or O
an O
urbane O
lemon O
meringue O
tart, O
but O
you'd O
almost O
have O
to O
be O
insane O
not O
to O
get O
the O
chocolate O
cake. O
Certainly O
a O
close O
relative O
of O
devil's O
food O
cake, O
his O
version O
weaves O
dark-chocolate O
cremeux O
between O
its O
many, O
many O
layers, O
all O
of O
them O
wrapped O
in O
a O
dark-chocolate O
frosting. O
And O
there O
will O
be O
regulars, O
because O
the O
rewards O
of O
TAK O
Room, O
if O
you O
can O
find O
them O
and O
pay O
for O
them, O
are O
as O
intense O
as O
the O
chocolate O
in O
that O
cake. O
The O
core O
audience O
may O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
travelers O
on O
loan O
from O
the O
Surf O
Club O
and O
Mr. O
Keller's O
California O
strongholds, O
or O
they O
may O
just O
be O
people O
who O
like O
the O
feeling O
of O
crashing O
the O
country O
club. O
Anti-plutocrat O
fevers O
come O
and O
go, O
but O
the O
trappings O
of O
American O
aristocracy O
are O
always O
in O
style O
somewhere. O

"Does O
the O
sheep's B-DISH
head I-DISH
soup I-DISH
have O
a O
lot O
of O
stuff O
in O
it?" O
I O
asked O
my O
server. O
Realizing O
that O
this O
was O
somewhat O
ambiguous, O
especially O
applied O
to O
a O
dish O
as O
laden O
with O
stuff O
as O
the O
brew O
of O
lambs' B-FOOD
snouts, I-FOOD
ears, B-FOOD
tongues, B-FOOD
cheeks B-FOOD
and O
eyeballs B-FOOD
known O
in O
Turkey B-LOC
as O
kelle B-FOOD
paca, I-FOOD
I O
tried O
again. O
"Is O
it O
very O
filling, O
I O
mean?" O
My O
concern O
was O
a O
familiar O
one, O
to O
me O
at O
least. O
I O
was O
in O
Queens, B-DISH
at O
a O
new O
Turkish B-CUISINE
restaurant O
in O
Astoria B-LOC
called O
Lokanta B-EST
, O
and O
the O
menu O
was O
so O
appealing O
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
try O
it O
all. O
Already O
I O
was O
set O
on O
a O
few O
bourekas, B-DISH
some O
labneh, B-DISH
the O
fava B-DISH
dip I-DISH
and O
some O
form O
of O
braised B-DISH
lamb I-DISH
over I-DISH
eggplant. I-DISH
I'd O
spotted O
another O
three O
or O
four O
dishes O
that O
I O
was O
probably O
going O
to O
tack O
on O
at O
the O
end O
of O
my O
order, O
as O
if O
by O
afterthought. O
I O
suspected O
that O
I O
could O
add O
a O
small O
bowl O
of O
kelle B-DISH
paca I-DISH
and O
still O
eat O
everything O
else. O
But O
a O
big O
bowl, O
one O
so O
thick O
with O
bits O
formerly O
affixed O
to O
a O
sheep's O
skull O
that O
a O
spoon O
would O
stand O
up O
in O
it, O
might O
tip O
the O
scale. O
The O
server O
pondered O
this O
for O
a O
while O
until O
a O
wiry O
man O
got O
up O
from O
his O
marble-topped O
table O
in O
the O
corner O
and O
conferred O
with O
her. O
Wearing O
baggy O
jeans, O
a O
white O
T-shirt O
and O
a O
baseball O
cap O
that O
kept O
his O
zinc-colored O
ponytail O
in O
place, O
he O
looked O
like O
a O
contractor, O
maybe O
a O
painter O
who'd O
come O
by O
to O
touch O
up O
the O
moldings O
and O
had O
been O
invited O
to O
stay O
for O
a O
Turkish B-CUISINE
coffee. B-FOOD
Then O
he O
spoke O
to O
us O
about O
the O
sheep's B-DISH
head I-DISH
soup. I-DISH
"I O
am O
a O
genius," O
he O
began. O
"And O
even O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
to O
answer O
this O
question. O
I O
think O
that O
the O
question O
must O
be O
wrong." O
As O
those O
who O
chase O
the O
scent O
of O
lamb B-FOOD
and O
charred B-FOOD
eggplant I-FOOD
around O
the O
city O
have O
probably O
guessed, O
this O
was O
no O
contractor. O
This O
was O
Orhan O
Yegen, O
the O
Turkish-born O
chef O
and O
restaurateur O
who O
has O
opened O
close O
to O
20 O
Turkish B-CUISINE
restaurants O
over O
the O
past O
two O
decades O
or O
so O
while O
keeping O
up O
a O
running O
monologue O
that O
made O
him O
a O
favorite O
of O
food O
writers O
. O
In O
2004, O
Mr. O
Yegen O
opened O
Sip B-EST
Sak I-EST
in O
Turtle B-LOC
Bay, I-LOC
then O
proceeded O
to O
surprise O
those O
who O
had O
charted O
his O
career O
by O
embarking O
on O
a O
long, O
stable O
period O
. O
All O
was O
quiet, O
relatively O
speaking, O
until O
April, O
when O
Lokanta B-EST
arrived O
in O
Astoria B-LOC
to O
supplement O
the O
Greek B-CUISINE
and O
Cypriot B-CUISINE
menus O
along O
its O
stretch O
of O
Broadway, B-LOC
and O
Mr. O
Yegen O
arrived O
to O
tell O
customers O
that O
their O
questions O
were O
wrong. O
The O
kelle B-DISH
paca I-DISH
colloquy O
ended O
when O
I O
agreed O
to O
order O
it. O
After O
hours O
on O
the O
stove, O
the O
meat B-FOOD
on O
the O
head O
had O
fallen O
away O
into O
about O
eight O
different O
textures, O
from O
frilly O
to O
ropy O
to O
collagenously O
chewy O
to O
tender O
and O
lean. O
All O
of O
this O
suspended O
in O
a O
slippery, O
almost O
sticky O
broth B-FOOD
the O
color O
of O
cappuccino. B-FOOD
And O
no, O
it O
was O
not O
too O
filling. O
Soups, B-FOOD
braises, B-FOOD
stews B-FOOD
and O
other O
recipes O
requiring O
plenty O
of O
time O
and O
even O
more O
olive B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
are O
the O
basis O
of O
Mr. O
Yegen's O
reputation. O
They O
set O
his O
menus O
apart O
from O
those O
at O
other O
Turkish B-CUISINE
restaurants O
around O
town, O
which O
tend O
to O
revolve O
around O
the O
grill. O
Lokanta B-EST
makes O
very O
fine O
kofte, B-DISH
but O
for O
a O
full O
medley O
of O
minced B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
skewered I-FOOD
meats, I-FOOD
you O
are O
better O
off O
under O
the O
swaying O
chandeliers O
of O
Taci's B-EST
Beyti I-EST
on O
Coney B-LOC
Island I-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
in O
Brooklyn. B-LOC
Lokanta B-EST
will O
grill O
or O
roast O
a O
whole O
fish, B-FOOD
but O
it O
will O
not O
be O
all O
that O
different O
from O
what O
might O
be O
served O
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
at O
Liman B-EST
, O
where O
your O
bass B-FOOD
will O
be O
filleted O
within O
view O
of O
the O
fishing O
boats O
and O
swans O
of O
Sheepshead B-LOC
Bay. I-LOC
Diners O
in O
Lokanta's B-EST
custody O
have O
signed O
on O
for O
a O
more O
nuanced O
view O
of O
the O
Turkish B-CUISINE
kitchen. O
Take, O
for O
instance, O
the O
shadings O
that O
lamb B-FOOD
takes O
on. O
In O

of O
it O

stewed O
in O

an O
eggplant B-FOOD
mash I-FOOD
beaten O
to O
a O
memorable O
richness O
with O
cheese B-FOOD
and O
milk. B-FOOD
Ali B-EST
nazik I-EST
is, O
in O
schematic O
form, O
the O
same O
thing, O
built O
on O
the O
same O
foundation O
of O
milky O
eggplant, B-FOOD
but O
in O
Lokanta's B-EST
version O
the O
lamb B-FOOD
is O
ground O
and O
simmered O
with O
onions B-FOOD
and O
red B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
green I-FOOD
peppers; I-FOOD
somehow O
it O
achieves O
a O
rich, O
unctuous O
consistency O
that O
is O
amplified O
by O
the O
eggplant B-FOOD
and O
the O
scoop O
of O
strained O
yogurt O
dropped O
on O
top. O
Lokanta's O
"roasted O
lamb O
and O
rice" O
is O
in O
the O
pilaf O
family, O
which O
means O
that O
the O
rice O
is O
not O
just O
a O
side O
dish O
but O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
recipe, O
baked O
until O
alluringly O
sweet O
with O
currants, O
allspice O
and O
cinnamon, O
then O
sprinkled O
with O
fresh O
dill O
at O
the O
last O
minute. O
The O
lamb's O
job O
is O
to O
be O
obligingly O
tender, O
and O
it O
succeeds, O
one O
reason O
the O
dish O
is O
requested O
by O
so O
many O
tables. O
To O
fend O
off O
boredom, O
I O
imagine, O
Mr. O
Yegen O
fills O
his O
manti O
with O
both O
lamb O
and O
beef. O
Each O
little O
dumpling O
is O
rolled O
by O
fingertip O
and O
is O
roughly O
the O
size O
of O
one. O
The O
meat O
has O
been O
seasoned O
just O
forcefully O
enough O
that O
it O
will O
announce O
itself, O
politely O
but O
clearly, O
as O
it O
breaks O
through O
the O
dough. O
It O
would O
be O
possible O
to O
sit O
down O
in O
front O
of O
a O
bowl O
of O
these, O
spooning O
them O
up O
with O
their O
warm O
yogurt O
and O
chile O
oil O
and O
dried O
mint, O
and O
call O
for O
another O
bowl O
a O
minute O
later. O
Of O
course, O
the O
meal O
should O
begin O
with O
strips O
of O
nigella-dotted O
Turkish O
bread O
and O
a O
spread O
or O
two O
-- O
maybe O
memorably O
creamy O
purée O
of O
dried O
favas; O
or O
the O
roughly O
mashed O
eggplant, O
smoky O
without O
a O
trace O
of O
bitterness; O
and O
one O
of O
the O
strained-yogurt O
dips, O
either O
the O
tangy O
cacik, O
laced O
with O
minced O
cucumbers, O
or O
the O
labneh, O
as O
firm O
as O
a O
new O
mattress. O
Either O
will O
prove O
useful O
as O
the O
meal O
goes O
on. O
So O
will O
a O
simple O
salad, O
especially O
the O
one O
with O
white O
beans O
and O
purple O
onions. O
The O
tightly O
rolled, O
golden O
bourekas O
are O
like O
skinny O
Turkish O
spring O
rolls O
filled O
with O
dill O
and O
melting O
feta. O
Cold O
poached O
leeks, O
a O
frequent O
special, O
are O
more O
appealing O
than O
the O
cold O
poached O
artichokes O
that O
have O
a O
permanent O
spot O
on O
the O
menu. O
If O
Mr. O
Yegen O
tells O
you O
that O
the O
grilled O
octopus O
is O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city, O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
he O
rarely O
seems O
to O
leave O
his O
own O
restaurant. O
It's O
quite O
good, O
though, O
with O
a O
fugitive O
sweetness O
that O
may O
be O
supplied O
by O
the O
tomatoes O
and O
purple O
onions. O
Desserts O
run O
toward O
milky O
white O
puddings, O
nice O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
mild O
sedative. O
The O
baklava, O
imported O
from O
Turkey, O
is O
a O
treat O
for O
those O
of O
us O
who O
like O
pistachios O
and O
think O
sugar O
syrup O
makes O
a O
better O
baklava O
sweetener O
than O
honey. O
The O
unlikely O
champion, O
though, O
is O
the O
butternut O
squash O
that O
has O
been O
languorously O
baked O
in O
its O
own O
juices O
with O
nothing O
but O
sugar. O
The O
technique O
is O
one O
of O
those O
small O
tricks O
that O
helps O
Mr. O
Yegen's O
cooking O
stand O
out, O
like O
the O
perfume O
of O
lemon O
peel O
in O
the O
Turkish O
lemonade. O
Lokanta O
has O
no O
liquor O
license O
yet. O
Some O
customers O
smuggle O
wine O
through O
the O
door O
and O
keep O
the O
bottles O
on O
their O
tables, O
which O
are O
topped O
with O
radiant O
white O
marble O
from O
Turkey O
and O
surrounded O
by O
classic O
bentwood O
cafe O
chairs. O
But O
it O
is O
hard O
not O
to O
want O
the O
lemonade, O
which O
is O
cold O
and O
just O
tart O
enough O
and O
not O
very O
filling O
at O
all. O

The O
chef O
John O
Fraser's O
new O
restaurant O
has O
a O
blandly O
corporate O
name, O
701West B-EST
, O
that O
tells O
you O
less O
about O
the O
place O
than O
simply O
walking O
into O
the O
dining O
room. O
One O
of O
several O
operations O
he O
is O
running O
in O
the O
new O
Times B-LOC
Square I-LOC
Edition I-LOC
hotel, I-LOC
it O
is O
clad O
in O
paneling O
on O
the O
walls O
and O
ceilings. O
Velvet O
curtains O
and O
banquettes O
are O
the O
slightly O
alarming O
color O
of O
a O
blue O
macaw's O
tail O
feathers. O
Wooden O
blinds O
are O
usually O
snapped O
shut O
against O
the O
strobes O
of O
47th B-LOC
Street I-LOC
and O
Seventh B-LOC
Avenue. I-LOC
To O
get O
to O
your O
table, O
you O
must O
first O
pass O
between O
two O
identical O
Champagne O
trolleys. O
An O
iced O
reservoir O
in O
the O
center O
of O
each O
is O
loaded O
with O
about O
half O
a O
dozen O
bottles O
that O
range O
in O
price O
from O
a O
Blanquette B-DISH
de I-DISH
Limoux I-DISH
for O
$26 O
a O
glass O
to O
a O
2006 B-DISH
brut I-DISH
from O
Dom B-EST
Pérignon I-EST
for O
$66 O
a O
glass. O
Before O
you O
sit O
down, O
you've O
already O
learned O
that O
wine B-FOOD
is O
front O
and O
center, O
literally O
and O
figuratively; O
that O
it O
is O
more O
likely O
to O
come O
from O
classic, O
mannerly O
European O
estates O
than, O
say, O
Macedonian O
villages O
still O
using O
amphoras O
that O
Odysseus O
drank O
from; O
that O
the O
ideal O
customer O
is O
not O
likely O
to O
get O
up O
and O
walk O
out O
upon O
being O
offered O
a O
$66 O
aperitif; B-FOOD
and O
that O
the O
restaurant O
expects O
to O
attract O
so O
many O
of O
these O
customers O
that O
a O
single O
Champagne O
trolley O
is O
not O
enough. O
Which O
is O
to O
say O
that O
Marriott B-LOC
International I-LOC
and O
the O
hotelier O
Ian O
Schrager O
installed O
701West B-EST
on O
the O
11th O
floor O
of O
the O
Edition B-DIET
for O
people O
who O
still O
think O
a O
leisurely, O
three-course O
dinner O
with O
a O
few O
interesting O
bottles O
and O
some O
of O
the O
customary O
niceties O
is O
worth O
spending O
money O
on. O
It O
belongs O
to O
a O
species O
of O
restaurant O
that O
is O
no O
longer O
in O
great O
supply O
in O
Manhattan, B-LOC
let O
alone O
on O
the O
intersection O
where O
the O
green O
neon O
of O
the O
Olive B-EST
Garden I-EST
faces O
off O
across O
Seventh B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
against O
the O
giant O
candy O
bars O
of O
Hershey's O
Chocolate O
World. O
It O
also O
marks O
Mr. O
Fraser's O
first O
arabesques O
on O
the O
stage O
of O
formal O
dining O
since O
Dovetail B-EST
closed O
last O
year. O
These O
are O
early O
days O
for O
701West, B-EST
but O
so O
far O
I've O
found O
the O
cooking O
more O
original O
and O
appealing O
than O
Dovetail's B-EST
in O
its O
final O
phase. O
As O
you O
know O
if O
you've O
tried O
the O
fried-cauliflower B-DISH
buns I-DISH
at O
Nix, B-EST
or O
the O
ramen-style B-DISH
boiled I-DISH
eggs I-DISH
at O
the O
Loyal B-EST
whose O
yolks B-FOOD
are O
red O
with O
a O
film O
of O
jellied B-FOOD
chile I-FOOD
oil, I-FOOD
Mr. O
Fraser O
has O
a O
playful, O
imaginative O
streak. O
He O
needs O
it O
at O
701West, B-EST
where O
there O
is O
no O
real O
theme O
beyond O
wine B-FOOD
and O
style. O
But O
there O
is O
enough O
creativity O
across O
the O
menu, O
on O
which O
he O
collaborates O
with O
the O
chef O
de O
cuisine, O
Rob O
Lawson, O
and O
the O
pastry O
chef, O
Sébastien O
Rouxel, O
to O
make O
dinner O
the O
engaging, O
somewhat O
eccentric O
experience O
it O
is O
clearly O
meant O
to O
be. O
Before O
the O
first O
courses O
appear, O
for O
example, O
there O
may O
be O
a O
"cauliflower B-DISH
mille-feuille," I-DISH
the O
raw O
vegetable B-FOOD
shaved O
into O
white O
sheets O
that O
are O
softened O
by O
chilled B-FOOD
mezcal I-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
and O
then O
topped O
with O
sturgeon B-FOOD
caviar. I-FOOD
It's O
enticingly O
off-kilter, O
and O
another O
frequent O
amuse O
manages O
to O
outdo O
it: O
a O
spoonful O
or O
so O
of O
white-asparagus B-FOOD
foam I-FOOD
above O
a O
warm O
custard B-FOOD
of I-FOOD
sunflower-seed I-FOOD
butter, I-FOOD
dense O
and O
nutty O
and O
sweet O
with O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
honey. B-FOOD
This O
is O
luxury O
dining O
in O
its O
way, O
which O
is O
not O
the O
predictable O
way. O
The O
menu O
proposes O
three O
courses O
for O
$98, O
but O
a O
server O
informed O
me O
that O
"we O
also O
have O
à O
la O
carte, O
if O
that's O
more O
your O
rhythm O
for O
the O
evening." O
Frequently O
the O
surprises O
come O
in O
the O
form O
of O
an O
unexpected O
tweak O
dealt O
to O
a O
vegetable. B-FOOD
Slowly O
cooked O
in O
beet B-FOOD
juice, I-FOOD
a O
whole O
beet B-FOOD
takes O
on O
the O
glistening O
ruby O
intensity O
of O
raw B-FOOD
bluefin I-FOOD
tuna. I-FOOD
There O
is O
an O
appetizer O
of O
actual O
bluefin B-FOOD
as O
well, O
and O
it O
has O
the O
precise, O
Japanese-informed O
minimalism O
of O
a O
dish O
you'd O
get O
at O
Jean-Georges, B-EST
with O
tiny O
spring B-FOOD
peas I-FOOD
and O
young O
turnip B-FOOD
greens I-FOOD
and O
an O
electrifying O
white O
cloud O
of O
grated B-FOOD
horseradish. I-FOOD
In O
a O
dish O
of O
fava B-DISH
agnolotti, I-DISH
the O
X O
factor O
is O
the O
bright, O
almost O
effervescent O
sparkle O
of O
vinegar-marinated O
tomatoes O
and O
their O
juices O
stirred O
into O
a O
Parmesan-rind O
broth. O
There O
is O
one O
mystifying O
appetizer O
in O
which O
the O
dueling O
tidal O
flavors O
of O
sea O
urchin O
and O
squid-ink O
risotto O
are O
allowed O
to O
cancel O
each O
other O
out. O
For O
the O
most O
part, O
though, O
the O
plates O
don't O
overreach, O
for O
all O
the O
inventiveness O
on O
display. O
Asparagus O
dipped O
in O
aioli O
is O
a O
good O
idea, O
of O
course, O
but O
what O
if O
the O
asparagus O
has O
been O
steamed O
inside O
a O
wrapper O
of O
thinly O
shaved O
cedar O
until O
it O
is O
nearly O
as O
smoky O
as O
country O
bacon? O
And O
what O
if O
the O
aioli O
is O
enhanced O
by O
truffles? O
It O
may O
sound O
overworked, O
but O
it O
is O
such O
a O
thrill O
that O
one O
of O
my O
guests O
asked O
for O
another O
plate O
before O
we O
could O
move O
on O
to O
the O
main O
courses, O
throwing O
the O
rhythm O
for O
the O
evening O
right O
out O
the O
window. O
The O
night O
will O
pause O
again O
if O
one O
of O
the O
main O
courses O
is O
the O
sweet O
potato, O
as O
everyone O
tries O
to O
figure O
out O
where O
it O
got O
its O
creaminess O
and O
savory O
depth. O
Even O
once O
you O
know O
it's O
been O
sealed O
up O
and O
baked O
inside O
a O
little O
coffin O
of O
sourdough O
that O
is O
streaked O
with O
green O
threads O
of O
wakame O
seaweed, O
you O
still O
can't O
quite O
believe O
that O
all O
this O
flavor O
has O
been O
achieved O
with O
an O
ordinary O
sweet O
potato. O
Some O
of O
the O
large O
pieces O
of O
fish O
and O
meat O
are O
showstoppers O
on O
their O
own, O
like O
the O
lobster O
that O
rests O
for O
four O
days O
in O
aged-beef O
fat O
before O
being O
broiled O
and O
set O
over O
some O
jammy O
ratatouille. O
When O
they O
are O
not, O
something O
else O
on O
the O
plate O
usually O
is. O
The O
long O
slab O
of O
roasted O
duck O
breast O
dredged O
in O
powdered O
herbes O
de O
Provence O
would O
keep O
my O
attention O
even O
without O
its O
sidekick, O
a O
curiously O
likable O
risotto O
made O
from O
pine O
nuts. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
lamb, O
the O
firecracker O
is O
a O
cocotte O
of O
fresh, O
creamy O
cranberry O
beans. O
Mr. O
Rouxel, O
recently O
of O
Upland O
and O
the O
Clocktower, O
brings O
a O
lighter-than-air O
quality O
to O
the O
desserts. O
Hovering O
over O
a O
crunchy O
buckwheat O
pastry O
crust O
is O
a O
wavy O
sea O
of O
pastry O
cream O
infused O
with O
parsnips. O
It's O
earthy O
and O
ethereal O
at O
the O
same O
time. O
He O
even O
knows O
what O
to O
do O
with O
white O
chocolate, O
aerating O
it O
into O
a O
mousse O
to O
frost O
an O
English-pea O
sponge O
cake, O
and O
giving O
it O
a O
piercing O
sour-cherry O
sorbet O
as O
a O
foil. O
All O
seven O
captains O
working O
at O
701West O
are O
sommeliers, O
listed O
by O
name O
on O
the O
menu; O
they O
are O
assisted O
by O
back O
servers O
who O
are O
sommeliers O
in O
training. O
This O
is O
one O
of O
those O
innovations O
in O
service O
that O
seems O
obvious O
now O
that O
somebody's O
actually O
doing O
it. O
The O
meal O
can O
become O
an O
evening-long O
conversation O
about O
wine; O
the O
sommeliers O
even O
invite O
you O
to O
play O
the O
wine-insiders' O
game O
of O
guessing O
the O
identity O
of O
a O
mystery O
pour O
in O
a O
black O
glass. O
It O
is O
slightly O
incredible O
that O
a O
restaurant O
that O
tries O
so O
hard O
to O
give O
wine O
equal O
status O
with O
the O
cooking O
does O
not O
have O
more O
bottles O
for O
under O
$80. O
That O
said, O
the O
ones O
it O
does O
have O
tend O
to O
be O
very O
good O
and O
fairly O
priced. O
Besides O
701West, O
Mr. O
Fraser O
is O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
deep-dish O
focaccia, O
carrot O
Bolognese O
and O
"billboard O
burger" O
at O
the O
Terrace O
and O
Outdoor O
Gardens, O
which O
is O
open O
all O
day O
on O
the O
ninth O
floor. O
He O
also O
oversees O
the O
dinner-theater O
menus O
at O
the O
Paradise O
Club O
on O
the O
seventh O
floor, O
which O
is O
currently O

"The O

a O
neo-Burlesque O
extravaganza O
(juggling, O
sword O
swallowing, O
aerial O
acrobatics) O
purportedly O
inspired O
by O
William O
Blake. O
This O
was O
no O
doubt O
the O
destination O
of O
the O
stilt O
walker O
I O
nearly O
ran O
into O
in O
the O

one O
night. O
Dressed O
in O
scarlet O
from O

she O
got O
along O
faster O
on O
her O
stilts O
than O
I O
do O
on O
my O
own O
legs. O
She O
was O
the O
first O
thing O
I've O
seen O
in O

that O
gave O
me O
hope O
for O
the O
future O
of O

bigger O
than O
275 O
square O
feet O
for O
their O
restaurant, O
Belle B-EST
Harlem I-EST
, O
Mr. O
Burnette O
might O
do O
the O
cooking O
behind O
a O
wall O
instead O
of O
behind O
a O
counter. O
Ms. O
Burnette, O
his O
wife O
and O
business O
partner, O
might O
spend O
all O
night O
going O
in O
and O
out O
a O
swinging O
kitchen O
door O
instead O
of O
paying O
attention O
to O
the O
customers O
sitting O
at O
the O
12 O
seats O
in O
the O
restaurant's O
single O
room. O
At O
this O
point, O
after O
three O
years O
in O
business, O
Belle B-EST
Harlem I-EST
might O
be O
run O
by O
employees, O
and O
the O
Burnettes O
might O
come O
in O
a O
few O
times O
a O
week O
to O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
things. O
Instead O
they O
have O
a O
paid O
staff O
of O
one. O
His O
name O
is O
Alex O
Geudelekian. O
He O
was O
eating O
dinner O
there O
one O
night, O
noticed O
that O
the O
weeds O
were O
growing O
up O
around O
Mr. O
Burnette's O
ankles, O
asked O
if O
he O
needed O
help, O
and O
has O
been O
the O
sous-chef O
ever O
since. O
The O
smell O
of O
foie B-FOOD

gravy I-FOOD
with O
duck B-FOOD
breast I-FOOD
being O
seared O
on O
one O
of O
the O
three O
induction O
burners O
might O
not O
rush O
up O
to O
meet O
you O
when O
you O
step O
through O
the O
door, O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
Adam B-LOC
Clayton I-LOC
Powell I-LOC
Jr. I-LOC
Boulevard I-LOC
from O
Striver's B-LOC
Row. I-LOC
You O
might O
not O
hear O
the O
hiss O
of O
chicken B-FOOD
being O
fried O
inside O
buttermilk B-FOOD
batter I-FOOD
before O
it O
is O
arranged O
between O
standing O
partitions O
of O
pizzelle B-FOOD
and O
tied O
together O
by O
an O
amber O
river O
of O
truffled B-FOOD
maple I-FOOD
syrup I-FOOD
warmed O
with O
jalapeños B-FOOD
and O
bananas. B-FOOD
If O
you O
didn't O
hear O
the O
low O
roar O
of O
a O
Searzall O
torch O
as O
it O
warms O
a O
plate O
and O
then O
melts O
and O
browns O
a O
patch O
of O
Cheddar, B-FOOD
you O
might O
not O
know O
that O
you're O
about O
to O
be O
served O
Mr. O
Burnette's O
cheese-steak B-DISH
crostini. I-DISH
(These O
are O
small O
toasts B-FOOD
stacked O
with O
seared B-FOOD
filet I-FOOD
and O
melted B-FOOD
cheese, I-FOOD
and O
in O
between O
are O
onions B-FOOD
that O
have O
been O
caramelized O
until O
they're O
sweet O
enough O
to O
be O
a O
dessert O
topping. O
The O
Cheddar B-FOOD
would O
cause O
every O
Philadelphian O
who O
lives O
within O
10 O
blocks O
of O
East B-LOC
Passyunk I-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
to O
pick O
up O
the O
nearest O
blunt O
object, O
but O
it O
makes O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
sense O
when O
you O
taste O
it.) O
Some O
of O
Belle B-EST
Harlem's I-EST
space O
limitations O
are, O
in O
fact, O
a O
little O
constricting. O
When O
the O
place O
is O
full, O
some O
customers O
have O
to O
ride O
sidesaddle, O
their O
knees O
angled O
away O
from O
the O
counter, O
because O
if O
they O
faced O
it O
head-on O
they'd O
cut O
off O
the O
narrow O
path O
to O
the O
restroom O
in O
the O
back. O
But O
275 O
square O
feet O
are O
what O
the O
Burnettes O
have O
to O
work O
with, O
and O
they O
have O
made O
this O
shallow O
sliver O
into O
something O
rare O
not O
just O
in O
Harlem B-LOC
but O
in O
all O
Manhattan. B-LOC
One O
of O
the O
peculiarities O
of O
dining O
in O
the O
city, O
circa O
2019, O
is O
that O
the O
more O
high-functioning O
a O
restaurant O
is, O
the O
less O
likely O
you O
are O
to O
encounter O
a O
proprietor. O
There O
are O
exceptions, O
of O
course, O
but O
often O
the O
most O
successful O
restaurateurs O
are O
very O
busy O
people, O
so O
they O
leave O
their O
dining O
rooms O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
professional O
managers. O
Proprietors O
aren't O
always O
as O
smooth O
as O
professionals, O
but O
they O
are O
as O
attuned O
to O
what O
goes O
on O
in O
their O
dining O
rooms O
as O
new O
parents O
are O
to O
the O
noises O
coming O
from O
a O
bassinet. O
I O
never O
quite O
felt O
as O
if O
I O
were O
attending O
a O
dinner O
party O
in O
the O
Burnettes' O
apartment, O
which O
is O
the O
feeling O
they O
say O
they're O
going O
for, O
but O
I O
always O
knew O
I O
was O
in O
a O
place O
that O
somebody O
cared O
about. O
Their O
original O
plan O
was O
to O
feed O
everyone O
the O
same O
meal O
-- O
a O
tasting O
menu. O
"We O
found O
out O
pretty O
quickly O
Harlem O
wasn't O
ready," O
Mr. O
Burnette O
said O
in O
an O
interview. O
How O
quickly? O
"We O
tried O
one O
night." O
Belle O
Harlem O
rolled O
out O
an O
à O
la O
carte O
menu O
the O
next O
day. O
It O
stuck. O
The O
first O
half O
is O
given O
to O
smaller O
plates, O
although O
one O
of O
the O
hallmarks O
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
that O
the O
Burnettes O
don't O
serve O
anything O
truly O
small. O
They O
want O
you O
to O
eat. O
Two O
people O
could O
get O
away O
with O
ordering O
one O
main O
course O
and O
two O
appetizers, O
though O
I'd O
urge O
anyone O
going O
to O
Belle B-EST
Harlem I-EST
not O
to O
overlook O
dessert. O
These O
introductory O
dishes O
are O
where O
Mr. O
Burnette O
takes O
casual B-CUISINE
American I-CUISINE
vernacular I-CUISINE
food O
like O
chicken B-DISH
and I-DISH
waffles I-DISH
out O
for O
a O
stroll. O
His O
fried B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
has O
a O
convoluted, O
frilly O
crust, O
with O
plenty O
of O
golden O
surface O
area O
for O
the O
jalapeño-banana B-FOOD
syrup I-FOOD
to O
get O
lost O
in. O
The O
pizzelles B-FOOD
are O
a O
new O
idea O
of O
his, O
replacing O
the O
regular O
waffles B-FOOD
he O
used O
to O
make, O
and O
they O
work O
best O
when O
he O
cooks O
them O
to O
a O
dark O
crisp. O
This O
is O
also O
where O
you'll O
find O
the O
cheese-steak B-DISH
crostini, I-DISH
as O
well O
as O
spring B-FOOD
rolls I-FOOD
stuffed O
with O
macaroni B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
-- O
kid O
food O
in O
a O
fried O
shell, O
yes, O
but O
a O
bacon B-FOOD
marmalade I-FOOD
with O
fresh O
dill B-FOOD
makes O
it O
unexpectedly O
complex, O
a O
chef's O
dish. O
The O
bottom O
of O
the O
menu O
is O
more O
substantial: O
The O
pan-seared, B-DISH
smoked I-DISH
pork I-DISH
tenderloin, I-DISH
for O
instance, O
is O
bigger O
than O
what O
usually O
crosses O
a O
12-seat O
tasting O
counter. O
This O
month, O
Mr. O
Burnette O
is O
laying O
the O
barrels O
of O
pork B-FOOD
over O
a O
cherry B-FOOD
compote I-FOOD
with O
basil B-FOOD
leaves, I-FOOD
with O
a O
few O
snap O
peas O
for O
added O
sweetness. O
He O
brings O
a O
keen O
sense O
of O
what O
to O
do O
with O
ingredients O
as O
they O
come O
into O
season O
to O
the O
vegetables O
he O
grows O
on O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
Burnettes' O
apartment O
building, O
a O
block O
away. O
The O
tiny O
yields O
of O
an O
urban O
garden O
wouldn't O
satisfy O
a O
larger O
restaurant, O
but O
they O
can O
shuffle O
right O
onto O
the O
menu O
at O
Belle O
Harlem, O
and O
shuffle O
off O
again O
when O
they're O
all O
gone. O
This O
month, O
there O
are O
thin O
bands O
of O
zucchini O
under O
the O
beef O
tenderloin, O
and O
young, O
soft O
favas O
around O
the O
lobster O
salad. O
There O
are O
more O
favas O
over O
pan-seared O
dorade O
and O
garden O
chives, O
with O
the O
almost O
transparently O
thin O
noodles O
tossed O
with O
butter O
and O
cream O
and O
tucked O
under O
the O
fish O
fillet. O
Mr. O
Burnette, O
who O
is O
black O
and O
who O
grew O
up O
in O
rural O
southwestern O
Virginia, O
has O
said O
he O
worked O
up O
the O
nerve O
to O
move O
north O
for O
culinary O
school O
after O
seeing O
the O
chef O
Marcus O
Samuelsson O
on O
television O
. O
("I O
thought, O
hell, O
if O
he O
could O
do O
it, O
I O
could O
do O
it, O
too.") O
Sometimes O
today, O
in O
his O
restaurant O
less O
than O
a O
mile O
away O
from O
Mr. O
Samuelsson's O
Red O
Rooster O
Harlem O
, O
he O
reaches O
back O
to O
his O
childhood O
for O
ideas. O
A O
dessert O
in O
a O
glass O
called O
the O
Triflin' O
Ho-Ho O
is O
an O
acknowledged O
homage O
to O
Hostess O
cakes, O
although O
there O
is O
an O
English O
trifle O
in O
the O
mix, O
too, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
trace O
of O
Spice O
Market O
, O
where O
Mr. O
Burnette O
once O
worked. O
The O
chocolate O
in O
the O
broken O
shards O
of O
cake O
pulses, O
intriguingly, O
with O
Urfa O
pepper; O
its O
heat O
rubs O
up O
against O
the O
passion-fruit O
cream, O
brandied O
cherries O
and O
whipped O
cream O
that O
fill O
the O
glass. O
A O
year O
ago, O
Belle O
Harlem O
eliminated O
tips O
and O
raised O
prices. O
If O
you O
take O
that O
into O
account, O
check O
totals O
can O
still O
seem O
high, O
especially O
if O
you O
happen O
to O
be O
served O
pale, O
limp O
housemade O
potato O
chips O
or O
a O
$42 O
duck O
breast O
with O
a O
bitter O
arugula O
sauce O
and O
a O
poached O
pear O
that O
tastes O
like O
alcohol. O
The O
margins O
must O
be O
tight. O
At O
times O
you O
almost O
hear O
them O
squeak, O
as O
when O
Ms. O
Burnette O
anxiously O
reminds O
you O
that O
you O
were O
a O
few O
minutes O
late O
and O
suggests O
you O
order O
quickly O
so O
she O
can O
turn O
the O
seat O
in O
time O
for O
the O
next O
reservation. O
A O
professional O
manager O
might O
have O
brought O
a O
more O
soothing O
manner O
to O
the O
exchange. O
But O
a O
manager O
might O
not O
be O
as O
genuinely O
happy O
to O
see O
a O
party O
of O
three O
walk O
in O
without O
a O
reservation O
just O
when O
three O
seats O
had O
opened O
up, O
and O
might O
not O
smile O
as O
widely O
when O
told O
that O
the O
sparkling O
rosé O
is O
fantastic O
with O
the O
lobster O
salad, O
and O
would O
she O
mind O
pouring O
another O
glass? O
No, O
she O
doesn't O
mind O
at O
all. O

Sooner O

later, O
those O
of O
us O
who O
follow O
the O
career O
of O
Jean-Georges O
Vongerichten O
reach O
a O
point O
where O
our O
memories O
can't O
keep O
up. O
The O
tuna B-FOOD
tartares I-FOOD
start O
to O
run O
together; O
we O
can't O
recall O
whether O

cups O
with O
threads O
of O
shiso B-FOOD
at O
Perry B-EST
St. I-EST
or O
at O
JoJo B-EST

At O
some O
point O
it's O
hard O
to O
recall O
what O
makes O
the O
chicken B-FOOD
breast I-FOOD
inside O
a O
resoundingly O
crunchy O
Parmesan B-FOOD
crust I-FOOD
at O
Nougatine B-EST
different O
from O
the O
Parmesan-crusted B-DISH
chicken I-DISH
at O
the O
Mark. B-EST
With O
his O
partner, O
Phil O
Suarez, O
Mr. O
Vongerichten O
has O
founded O
scores O
of O
new O
restaurants O
around O
the O
world. O
Nearly O
40 O
of O
them O
are O
still O
up O
and O
running, O
15 O
in O
New B-LOC
York. I-LOC
Devising O
menus O
for O
each O
new O
place, O
he O
repeats O
himself O
occasionally, O
but O
more O
often O
he O
rearranges O
old O
patterns. O
Lime B-FOOD
juice I-FOOD
is O
traded O
for O
yuzu, B-FOOD
cherry B-FOOD
vinegar I-FOOD
comes O
in O
for O
balsamic. B-FOOD
Almost O
always, O
the O
result O
is O
a O
dish O
that O
is O
similar O
enough O
to O
his O
past O
work O
to O
be O
recognizably O
Vongerichtenesque O
but O
different O
enough O
to O
seem O
fresh. O
Maybe O
he O
can O
keep O
track O
of O
it O
in O
his O
head, O
but O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
it O
would O
be O
really O
useful O
to O
have O
a O
family O
tree O
of O
every O
dish O
he O
ever O
invented, O
with O
its O
parentage O
and O
offspring. O

23andV. O
This O
service O
would O
come O
in O
handy O
in O
times O
like O
the O
present, O
when O
critics O
and O
superfans O
are O
trying O
to O
metabolize O
the O
two O
restaurants O
Mr. O
Vongerichten O
opened O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
during O
a O
single O
week O
in O
May. O
One O
is O
the O
Paris B-EST
Café I-EST
, O
a O
casual, B-TYPE
all-day I-TYPE
proposition I-TYPE
inside O
Eero O
Saarinen's O
T.W.A. B-LOC
terminal I-LOC
at O
Kennedy B-LOC
International I-LOC
Airport, I-LOC
now O
gloriously O
resurrected O
as O
the O
TWA B-LOC
Hotel. I-LOC
The O
second O
is O
a O
polished O
seafood B-TYPE
house I-TYPE
that I-TYPE
sits O
out O
in O
the O
East B-LOC
River I-LOC
on O
the O
end O
of O
Pier B-LOC
17, I-LOC
next O
to O
the O
wreck O
of O
the O
old O
Fulton B-LOC
Fish I-LOC
Market; I-LOC
it's O
called O
the O
Fulton B-EST
. O
Because O
I've O
been O
to O
both O
so O
recently, O
I O
can O
report O
confidently O
that O
the O
Fulton B-EST
slices O
deep-red O
strawberries B-FOOD
over O
strawberry B-FOOD
ice I-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
and O
a O
sorbet B-FOOD
made O
from O
strawberries B-FOOD
and O
red B-FOOD
wine I-FOOD
to O
make O
its O
strawberry B-DISH
sundae, I-DISH
while O
the O
one O
at O
the O
Paris B-EST
Café I-EST
substitutes O
dried B-FOOD
strawberries. I-FOOD
That O
version O
isn't O
bad, O
but O
there O
is O
an O
undeniable O
difference O
between O
fresh B-FOOD
summer I-FOOD
berries I-FOOD
and O
dehydrated O
ones, O
and O
that O
difference O
suggests O
the O
quality O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
restaurants. O
The O
best O
reasons O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Paris B-EST
Café I-EST
are O
Saarinen's O
glass O
walls, O
gliding O
curves O
and O
suspended O
catwalk, O
although O
the O
dining O
areas O
are O
swell, O
too, O
smartly O
evoking O
Raymond O
Loewy's O
original O
design O
for O
the O
space, O
which O
looked O
like O
a O
coffee B-TYPE
shop I-TYPE
on O
the O
moon. O
The O
place O
has O
some O
likable O
pizzas B-FOOD
and O
salads, B-FOOD
and O
it O
vaults O
clear O
over O
the O
other O
restaurants O
at O
the O
airport. O
But O
the O
recipes O
seem O
designed O
not O
to O
push O
the O
kitchen O
too O
hard, O
the O
menu O
is O
even O
more O
Vongerichtenesque O
than O
usual, O
and O
any O
dishes O
involving O
fruits B-FOOD
or O
vegetables B-FOOD
will O
make O
you O
wonder O
whether O
the O
produce O
truck O
drove O
to O
La B-LOC
Guardia I-LOC
instead. O
The O
Fulton, B-EST
though, O
is O
a O
grown-up O
production. O
Under O
the O
day-to-day O
command O
of O
Noah O
Poses, O
the O
executive O
chef, O
it O
is O
easily O
the O
best O
seafood B-TYPE
restaurant I-TYPE
to O
open O
in O
Manhattan B-LOC
since O
the O
Pool B-EST
, O
and O
easier O
to O
afford. O
Yes, O
a O
handful O
of O
items O
on O
the O
menu O
have O
that O
glassy-eyed O
stare, O
but O
almost O
everything O
else O
comes O
through. O
To O
get O
to O
the O
Fulton, B-EST
you O
have O
to O
walk O
almost O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
pier, O
where O
some O
tall O
planters O
cordon O
off O
the O
Fulton's B-EST
outdoor O
tables. O
All O
the O
tables, O
indoors O
and O
out, O
have O
a O
view O
of O
the O
Brooklyn B-LOC
Bridge, I-LOC
but O
the O
best O
backdrops O
are O
inside O
and O
upstairs, O
where O
you O
can O
see O
that O
you're O
surrounded O
by O
water. O
Mentioning O
the O
view O
as O
a O
selling O
point O
will O
make O
some O
New O
Yorkers O
cringe. O
But O
Pier B-LOC
17's I-LOC
developer, O
clearly O
hoping O
to O
erase O
the O
stigma, O
has O
recruited O
David O
Chang, O
Andrew O
Carmellini O
and O
Mr. O
Vongerichten. O
Day O
trippers O
and O
tourists O
will O
love O
the O
Fulton, B-EST
in O
any O
case, O
and O
they O
will O
be O
right. O
True, O
the O
outdoor O
patio O
feels O
like O
the O
beachside O
bar O
of O
some O
island O
resort, O
with O
soft-core O
club O
music O
playing O
and O
servers O
carrying O
too-small O
trays O
slinking O
around O
in O
long O
skirts. O
Once O
you O
get O
inside, O
though, O
the O
tension O
in O
the O
open O
kitchen O
lets O
you O
know O
this O
is, O
in O
fact, O
New B-LOC
York. I-LOC
Running O
a O
seafood B-TYPE
house I-TYPE
gives O
Mr. O
Vongerichten O
an O
opening O
to O
lead O
with O
one O
of O
his O
strong O
suits, O
raw B-FOOD
fish. I-FOOD
The O
sea B-DISH
trout I-DISH
tartare I-DISH
is O
stirred O
with O
raw O
oysters O
and O
horseradish, O
which O
creates O
the O
uncanny O
momentary O
illusion O
that O
you're O
eating O
beef. O
White O
ponzu, O
made O
from O
white O
soy O
sauce, O
is O
the O
centerpiece O
of O
a O
platter O
of O
iced O
sashimi. O
Local O
fluke, O
taking O
a O
bath O
in O
habanero O
vinaigrette, O
is O
topped O
with O
mint O
and O
Sichuan O
buttons; O
even O
if O
you O
know O
what's O
coming O
-- O
Sichuan O
buttons O
are O
the O
flower O
buds O
of O
the O
toothache O
plant, O
which O
when O
chewed, O
produce O
a O
numbing O
and O
cooling O
sensation O
-- O
the O
dish O
is O
a O
surprise. O
The O
Fulton's O
Manhattan O
clam O
chowder O
is O
spicy, O
thick O
with O
potatoes O
and O
a O
healthy O
portion O
of O
clams. O
It's O
the O
rare O
version O
that O
tastes O
as O
good O
as O
it O
sounds, O
although O
purists O
will O
deduct O
one O
point O
for O
the O
absence O
of O
oyster O
crackers. O
There's O
a O
very O
intriguing O
sesame-poppy O
crust O
on O
the O
soft-shell O
crabs; O
you O
have O
just O
enough O
time O
to O
register O
the O
seeds O
before O
a O
potent O
green O
salsa O
of O
coriander O
and O
jalapeño O
kicks O
in. O
Few O
chefs O
are O
as O
skilled O
at O
using O
acidity, O
heat O
and O
salt O
to O
bring O
definition O
to O
a O
dish. O
So O
it's O
a O
surprise O
to O
realize O
how O
generic O
the O
Fulton's O
fish O
stew O
is, O
or O
to O
wonder O
what O
the O
ingredient O
is O
that O
throws O
the O
red O
snapper O
ceviche O
in O
watermelon O
juice O
out O
of O
whack. O
A O
separate O
menu O
card O
lets O
you O
know O
that O
most O
of O
the O
seafood O
in O
the O
main O
courses O
can O
be O
ordered O
"simply O
cooked." O
I O
was O
never O
curious O
enough O
to O
try O
it, O
being O
too O
distracted O
by O
the O
salmon O
in O
a O
cumin-coriander O
seed O
crust O
so O
fragrant O
it O
turns O
heads; O
the O
sea O
bass O
and O
carrots O
in O
a O
life-affirming O
pool O
of O
lemon-turmeric O
sauce; O
and O
the O
detailed-oriented O
fish O
and O
crisps, O
a O
brick O
of O
flounder O
kept O
at O
scalding O
temperature O
by O
a O
leakproof O
and O
supernaturally O
crunchy O
buckwheat O
batter. O
Served O
with O
mashed O
fresh O
peas, O
it O
could O
almost O
pass O
for O
English O
if O
it O
didn't O
come O
with O
saffron O
aioli. O
Most O
distracting O
of O
all O
is O
the O
whole O
black O
bass O
baked O
inside O
a O
fish-shaped O
pastry O
lavishly O
decorated O
with O
golden O
scales, O
fins, O
gills O
and O
other O
parts O
the O
bass O
itself O
won't O
be O
needing O
anymore. O
It O
takes O
a O
good O
10 O
minutes O
to O
unveil O
it, O
fillet O
it O
and O
then O
plate O
it O
together O
with O
slices O
of O
crust, O
some O
tomato O
concassé O
and O
a O
sauce O
choron, O
and O
I O
doubt O
many O
movies O
playing O
in O
theaters O
now O
can O
rival O
it O
for O
entertainment. O
Wonderful O
as O
it O
is O
to O
see O
one O
of O
the O
showpieces O
of O
pre-nouvelle O
cuisine O
given O
so O
much O
attention, O
you O
could O
ask O
whether O
whole O
fish O
en O
croute O
really O
makes O
sense O
after, O
say, O
kale O
salad. O
Mr. O
Vongerichten's O
technical O
approach O
may O
let O
him O
generate O
a O
menu O
full O
of O
smart, O
reliably O
pleasurable O
food, O
but O
it O
doesn't O
guarantee O
that O
it O
will O
all O
hang O
together. O
The O
pastry O
menu O
does, O
though, O
by O
sneakily O
staying O
true O
to O
classic O
American O
desserts. O
What's O
sold O
as O
Meyer O
lemon O
pudding O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
more O
like O
a O
lemon O
meringue O
tart O
with O
a O
quick, O
pulsing O
acidity; O
the O
apricot O
pie O
is O
more O
like O
a O
crisp, O
with O
oatmeal O
streusel O
on O
top; O
and O
the O
highlight O
of O
the O
strawberry O
sundae O
isn't O
the O
fresh O
fruit O
but O
the O
strawberry O
ice O
cream, O
its O
flavor O
straight O
out O
of O
the O
summertime O
ice O
cream O
shacks O
in O
a O
thousand O
vacation O
towns. O

Some O
restaurants O
push O
their O
tasting O
menus. O
Rezdôra B-EST
doesn't. O
A O
few O
steps O
down O
from O
the O
sidewalk, O
on O
the O
same O
block O
of O
East B-LOC
20th I-LOC
Street I-LOC
as O
Gramercy B-EST
Tavern I-EST
and O
the O
brownstone O
where O
Teddy O
Roosevelt O
was O
born, O
Rezdôra B-EST
lists O
a O
"regional O
pasta B-FOOD
tasting" O
for O
$90 O
on O
its O
menu. O
The O
region O
in O
question O
is O
Emilia-Romagna, B-LOC
whose O
refinements O
in O
the O
art O
of O
rolling O
and O
saucing O
noodles B-FOOD
are O
admired O
even O
by O
Italians O
from O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
country. O
Chances O
are O
that O
most O
of O
the O
five O
pastas B-FOOD
in O
the O
tasting O
are O
exactly O
the O
ones O
you O
picture O
when O
you O
think O
about O
Emilia-Romagna, B-LOC
starting O
with O
tortellini B-FOOD
in I-FOOD
brodo. I-FOOD
This O
would O
seem O
to O
make O
it O
an O
easy O
sell, O
and O
yet O
servers O
at O
Rezdôra B-EST
never O
tried O
to O
sell O
me O
on O
the O
tasting. O
Until O
I O
asked O
about O
it O
one O
night, O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
the O
separate O
menu O
card O
that O
describes O
each O
course. O
With O
some O
hesitation, O
I O
ordered O
it. O
Every O
one O
of O
the O
pastas B-FOOD
was O
excellent, O
and O
one O
or O
two O
would O
be O
worth O
walking O
a O
long O
distance O
for. O
After O
the O
fifth O
course O
was O
gone, O
it O
slowly O
dawned O
on O
me O
that O
Stefano O
Secchi, O
Rezdôra's B-EST
chef O
and O
one O
of O
its O
owners, O
had O
just O
laid O
down O
a O
straight O
flush. O
The O
tortellini B-FOOD
were O
penny-size O
hoops O
rolled O
around O
minced B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
blended I-FOOD
pork I-FOOD
in O
a O
parcel O
just O
big O
enough O
to O
suggest O
the O
idea O
of O
meat. B-FOOD
"This O
is O
a O
special O
broth B-FOOD
made O
from O
older O
chickens," O
a O
server O
said O
as O
he O
poured O
a O
steaming O
liquid O
from O
a O
kettle O
over O
the O
tortellini. B-FOOD
It O
was O
the O
color O
of O
turkey B-FOOD
gravy. I-FOOD
The O
broth B-FOOD
spent O
about O
half O
a O
day O
on O
the O
burner; O
drew O
some O
of O
its O
power O
from O
melted B-FOOD
Parmigiano-Reggiano; I-FOOD
and O
was O
more O
intense O
than O
canned B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
broth I-FOOD
in O
roughly O
the O
same O
way O
that O
a O
dry-aged B-FOOD
rib-eye I-FOOD
is O
more O
intense O
than O
a O
McDonald's B-FOOD
all-beef I-FOOD
patty. I-FOOD
This O
was O
followed O
by O
a O
smooth, O
almost O
fluffy O
tomato-basil B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
over O
maccheroni B-FOOD
al I-FOOD
pettine, I-FOOD
delicate O
tubes O
with O
ridges O
they O
get O
from O
being O
rolled O
by O
hand O
along O
a O
comb O
made O
for O
the O
job. O
Three O
straw-colored O
blobs O
that O
looked O
like O
melted B-FOOD
Brie I-FOOD
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
glossy O
and O
wonderful O
fonduta B-FOOD
made O
from O
Parmigiano-Reggiano. B-FOOD
From O
there O
it O
was O
on O
to O
tortelloni, B-FOOD
each O
about O
three O
bites O
big, O
filled O
with O
plush O
fresh O
ricotta B-FOOD
and O
shiny O
with O
melted B-FOOD
brown I-FOOD
butter I-FOOD
in O
which O
a O
few O
sage B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
had O
been O
bubbled. O
If O
we O
are O
talking O
about O
Emilia-Romagna B-LOC
we O
have O
to O
talk O
about O
ragù, B-DISH
and O
that O
was O
the O
next O
course, O
tossed O
with O
slim O
ribbons O
of O
tagliolini. B-FOOD
Some O
people O
will O
find O
the O
ragù B-DISH
saltier O
than O
they O
like. O
Almost O
everyone O
will O
find O
it O
more O
tender O
and O
smooth O
than O
the O
last O
20 O
or O
30 O
ragús B-FOOD
they O
ate. O
The O
tour O
winds O
down O
with O
round, O
meat-filled B-DISH
anolini, I-DISH
a O
branch O
of O
the O
ravioli B-FOOD
family O
that O
resides O
in O
Parma. B-LOC
They O
are O
served O
in O
something O
called O
crema B-FOOD
di I-FOOD
Parmigiano; I-FOOD
you O
will O
not O
be O
far O
off O
if O
you O
imagine O
an O
Alfredo B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
cooked O
for O
one O
of O
the O
more O
sybaritic O
Roman O
emperors. O
This O
is O
not O
Rome, B-LOC
though, O
and O
the O
sauce B-FOOD
gets O
the O
tart O
counterpoint O
it O
needs O
from O
an O
inky, O
25-year-old B-FOOD
balsamic I-FOOD
vinegar I-FOOD
poured O
straight O
from O
the O
bottle. O
Mr. O
Secchi O
blew O
into O
town O
in O
May O
on O
a O
small O
gust O
of O
publicity O
whipped O
up O
over O
his O
time O
at O
Osteria B-EST
Francescana I-EST
, O
the O
Modena B-LOC
workshop O
where O
Massimo O
Bottura O
reconfigures O
the O
touchstone O
flavors O
of O
the O
region O
in O
dishes O
with O
names O
like O
"memories B-DISH
of I-DISH
a I-DISH
mortadella I-DISH
sandwich." I-DISH
Mr. O
Bottura's O
approach O
to O
menu O
writing O
seems O
to O
have O
rubbed O
off O
on O
Mr. O
Secchi O
more O
than O
his O
experimental O
urges O
did. O
At O
Rezdôra, B-EST
you O
are O
unlikely O
to O
catch O
the O
kitchen O
using O
any O
overtly O
modernist O
techniques, O
but O
you O
may O
well O
encounter O
"cherry B-DISH
season I-DISH
in I-DISH
Vignola," I-DISH
a O
pleasant O
if O
somewhat O
too O
soupy O
plate O
of O
stracciatella B-FOOD
with O
toasted B-FOOD
almonds, I-FOOD
almond B-FOOD
milk I-FOOD
and O
cherries B-FOOD
both O
sweet O
and O
sour; O
or O
"cow B-DISH
grazing I-DISH
in I-DISH
Emilia-Romagna," I-DISH
a O
sirloin B-FOOD
basted O
with O
butter B-FOOD
whose O
richness O
is O
modulated O
by O
a O
sauce B-FOOD
of I-FOOD
sweet I-FOOD
red I-FOOD
peppers; I-FOOD
or O
"Grandma B-DISH
walking I-DISH
through I-DISH
forest I-DISH
in I-DISH
Emilia," I-DISH
a O
transfixing O
plate O
of O
mushroom B-FOOD
purée, I-FOOD
slivered O
snap-pea B-FOOD
pods I-FOOD
and O
little O
hats O
of O
spinach B-FOOD
pasta I-FOOD
filled O
with O
braised B-FOOD
leeks. I-FOOD
If O
we O
are O
tracing O
influences, O
though, O
Mr. O
Secchi's O
cooking O
at O
Rezdôra B-EST
seems O
to O
have O
been O
molded O
at O
least O
as O
deeply O
by O
his O
time O
working O
at O
the O
pasta B-FOOD
station O
of O
another O
restaurant O
in O
Modena, B-LOC
Hosteria B-EST
Giusti I-EST
. I-EST
Laura O
Galli O
Morandi, O
Giusti's B-EST
chef, O
steadfastly O
defends O
the O
style O
of O
the O
local O
nonna O
tradition O
that O
Mr. O
Secchi O
channels O
in O
his O
pasta B-FOOD
tasting O
and O
other O
parts O
of O
his O
menu. O
Like O
a O
meal O
in O
Giusti's B-EST
four-table O
dining O
room, O
one O
at O
Rezdôra B-EST
can O
and O
probably O
should O
start O
with O
prosciutto B-FOOD
and O
other O
manifestations O
of O
salted B-FOOD
pork I-FOOD
draped O
over O
warm O
pillows O
of O
fried B-FOOD
dough I-FOOD
called O
gnocchi O
fritti. O
Before O
leaving O
Italy, O
Mr. O
Secchi O
also O
cooked O
at O
Antica O
Moka O
in O
Modena O
and O
All'Enoteca O
in O
the O
Piedmont; O
after O
coming O
back O
home O
to O
Dallas, O
where O
he O
grew O
up, O
he O
ran O
the O
kitchens O
of O
two O
restaurants O
his O
parents O
own O
there. O
Still, O
I O
suspect O
the O
Bottura O
connection O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
speed O
with O
which O
the O
bar O
stools O
fill O
up O
when O
the O
restaurant O
opens O
at O
5:30 O
each O
night, O
for O
the O
difficulty O
of O
reserving O
one O
of O
the O
other O
48 O
seats, O
and O
for O
the O
way O
would-be O
customers O
collect O
in O
eddies O
outside O
the O
door O
to O
strategize. O
Not O
much O
about O
the O
interior O
is O
likely O
to O
lure O
crowds; O
with O
its O
brick O
walls, O
timbered O
ceiling O
and O
bare O
wood O
tables, O
it O
looks O
like O
any O
number O
of O
Manhattan O
restaurants O
that O
emulate O
the O
trattorias, O
enotecas O
and O
osterias O
of O
Italy. O
And O
of O
course, O
people O
who O
eat O
at O
Rezdôra O
have O
a O
way O
of O
becoming O
repeat O
customers. O
They O
come O
back O
even O
though O
it O
is O
still O
a O
young O
restaurant O
and O
occasionally O
makes O
a O
young O
restaurant's O
mistakes. O
One O
night, O
the O
stewed O
cannellini O
beans O
placed O
alongside O
black O
sea O
bass O
and O
black O
garlic O
zabaglione O
were O
still O
crunchy; O
the O
rock O
shrimp O
served O
with O
strozzapreti O
could O
have O
been O
a O
little O
less O
tough O
and O
tasted O
a O
little O
shrimpier. O
And O
some O
of O
the O
original O
pastas O
aren't O
quite O
as O
stunning O
as O
the O
classics, O
but O
then O
every O
grandmother O
in O
Emilia-Romagna O
could O
have O
told O
you O
that. O
Mr. O
Secchi O
is O
still O
one O
of O
the O
most O
appealing O
new O
talents O
in O
years O
to O
enter O
the O
city's O
Italian O
restaurant O
scene, O
the O
kind O
of O
cook O
who O
can O
unite O
ordinary O
people O
who O
just O
like O
to O
eat O
pasta O
and O
the O
fanatics O
who O
collect O
menus O
from O
Osteria O
Francescana. O
(The O
date-stamped O
copy O
of O
the O
regional O
tasting O
menu O
that's O
given O
out O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
night, O
signed O
by O
Mr. O
Secchi O
and O
his O
kitchen O
crew, O
must O
be O
for O
this O
crowd.) O
He O
also O
has O
the O
good O
luck O
to O
come O
along O
when O
some O
of O
the O
figures O
who O
dominated O
New O
York's O
Italian O
landscape O
for O
the O
past O
two O
decades O
or O
so O
have O
either O
disappeared O
or O
gone O
into O
hibernation. O
There O
is O
one O
more O
workplace O
that O
I O
hope O
has O
left O
a O
mark O
on O
Mr. O
Secchi: O
his O
parents' O
restaurants O
in O
Texas, O
both O
of O
which O
are O
called O
Ferrari's O
Italian O
Villa O
& O
Chop O
House O
. O
The O
first O
has O
been O
in O
business O
since O
1983, O
a O
life O
span O
that O
any O
restaurateur O
would O
envy. O
The O
odds O
are O
against O
Rezdôra's O
being O
around O
36 O
years O
from O
now, O
but O
Mr. O
Secchi O
and O
his O
business O
partner O
have O
made O
one O
move O
that O
tends O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
longevity O
in O
New O
York O
restaurants. O
They O
bought O
the O
building. O

In O
the O
fall O
of O
1980, O
Patrick O
Clark, O
the O
first O
chef O
at O
Keith O
McNally's O
first O
restaurant, O
the O
Odeon B-EST
, O
helped O
introduce O
nouvelle B-CUISINE
cuisine O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
when O
it O
was O
all O
the O
rage O
in O
Europe. B-LOC
Nearly O
every O
place O
Mr. O
McNally O
has O
built O
since O
then O
has O
been O
a O
firm O
rejection O
of O
all O
that O
is O
fashionable O
in O
food, O
and O
each O
one O
has O
been, O
at O
least O
in O
its O
first O
few O
months, O
the O
most O
fashionable O
restaurant O
in O
town. O
The O
one O
he O
opened O
in O
early O
June O
in O
the O
meatpacking B-LOC
district, I-LOC
Pastis B-EST
, O
was O
assembled O
partly O
from O
the O
salvaged O
bones O
of O
a O
nearby O
restaurant O
he O
closed O
five O
years O
ago, O
Pastis. B-EST
(He O
salvaged O
the O
name, O
too.) O
The O
onion B-FOOD
soup, I-FOOD
the O
meaty O
snails B-FOOD
sloshing O
around O
in O
the O
divots O
of O
a O
black O
iron O
snail O
pan O
with O
what O
must O
be O
half O
a O
pint O
of O
garlic B-FOOD
butter, I-FOOD
and O
a O
few O
other O
old O
war O
horses O
from O
the O
original O
menu O
have O
been O
summoned O
for O
one O
more O
joust O
on O
the O
battlefield. O
In O
short, O
the O
new O
Pastis B-EST
takes O
almost O
everything O
straight O
from O
the O
old O
Pastis B-EST
, O
which O
in O
turn O
took O
almost O
everything O
from O
the O
stodgiest, O
least O
trend-conscious O
sort O
of O
French B-CUISINE
cafes B-TYPE
and O
brasseries. B-TYPE
Needless O
to O
say, O
reservations O
are O
harder O
to O
come O
by O
than O
at O
any O
other O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
restaurant O
that's O
opened O
this O
year. O
The O
paradox O
of O
this O
is O
that O
Pastis B-EST
is O
really O
meant O
for O
those O
nights O
when O
you O
decide O
to O
cancel O
your O
reservations O
at O
the O
little O
nine-seat O
tasting O
counter O
where O
the O
menu O
is O
inspired O
by O
Kieslowski's O
"Decalogue." O
It O
is O
for O
those O
times O
when O
you O
get O
an O
urge O
to O
eat O
a O
Gruyère B-DISH
omelet I-DISH
after O
10 O
p.m., O
cooked O
medium-rare, O
flecked O
with O
herbs, B-FOOD
skillfully O
rolled O
and O
staunchly O
backed O
up O
by O
a O
cold O
white O
from O
the O
Savoie. O
Urges O
like O
that O
do O
not O
typically O
announce O
themselves O
three O
weeks O
in O
advance, O
and O
they O
don't O
tend O
to O
survive O
exposure O
to O
rooms O
filled O
with O
people O
who O
have O
read O
about O
Pastis O
on O
the O
blogs O
but O
haven't O
yet O
figured O
out O
what O
it O
is O
for. O
For O
much O
of O
his O
life, O
Mr. O
McNally O
has O
been O
chipping, O
cracking, O
distressing O
and O
weathering O
interiors O
that O
are O
the O
architectural O
equivalent O
of O
rumpled O
sweaters O
two O
sizes O
too O
large. O
Perhaps O
the O
largest O
and O
certainly O
the O
most O
rumpled O
of O
all O
is O
Pastis. O
It O
doesn't O
have O
the O
corner O
entrance O
it O
had O
at O
its O
former O
address, O
or O
the O
long O
communal O
table O
that O
sliced O
through O
the O
front O
room O
like O
a O
surfboard. O
And O
the O
shelves O
of O
cigarette O
packs O
are O
definitely O
gone. O
( O
You O
could O
still O
smoke O
in O
restaurants O
in O
1999, O
when O
Pastis O
opened.) O
But O
the O
magazine O
racks O
are O
back, O
along O
with O
the O
overhead O
fans O
turning O
steadily O
below O
a O
stamped O
tin O
ceiling. O
Once O
again O
the O
walls O
are O
covered O
with O
chipped O
subway O
tiles, O
white, O
framed O
by O
black O
grout. O
The O
chairs O
still O
don't O
match. O
The O
ambient O
light O
is O
the O
color O
of O
a O
Scotch O
and O
soda O
and O
makes O
everybody O
look O
the O
way O
they O
do O
after O
you've O
drunk O
one. O
On O
an O
antique O
mirror, O
or O
one O
that O
looks O
like O
an O
antique, O
someone O
has O
scrawled O
a O
menu O
of O
desserts, O
almost O
none O
of O
which O
Pastis O
actually O
serves. O
You O
can, O
however, O
get O
an O
energetically O
whisked O
dark-chocolate O
mousse O
under O
shaved O
curls O
of O
chocolate, O
or O
a O
baba O
au O
rhum O
so O
drenched O
in O
booze O
that O
it O
might O
spontaneously O
combust O
if O
it O
weren't O
being O
restrained O
by O
a O
white O
dune O
of O
whipped O
Chantilly O
cream. O
The O
most O
significant O
change O
from O
the O
first O
Pastis O
to O
the O
second O
happened O
offstage. O
Mr. O
McNally, O
who O
had O
a O
stroke O
two O
years O
ago, O
has O
brought O
on O
the O
restaurateur O
Stephen O
Starr O
as O
a O
partner O
who, O
essentially, O
manages O
everything O
except O
the O
design. O
Familiar O
faces O
from O
La O
Mercerie O
and O
other O
Starr O
enterprises O
work O
alongside O
loyal O
retainers O
from O
the O
McNally O
empire. O
The O
McNally O
troops O
are O
exquisitely O
poised, O
self-assured, O
able O
to O
spot O
a O
misplaced O
butter O
knife O
from O
across O
the O
street. O
The O
Starr O
cadre O
is O
more O
casual, O
and O
occasionally O
a O
server O
will O
ask O
your O
opinion O
of O
"the O
flavors O
so O
far," O
a O
question O
that O
has O
surely O
never O
been O
uttered O
at O
Minetta O
Tavern O
. O
Mr. O
Starr O
has O
oversight O
of O
the O
wine O
list, O
which O
is O
less O
conservative O
than O
a O
typical O
McNally O
lineup, O
and O
of O
the O
food, O
which O
has O
not O
been O
a O
strong O
suit O
of O
the O
McNally O
organization O
since O
the O
chefs O
Lee O
Hanson O
and O
Riad O
Nasr O
went O
out O
on O
their O
own. O
Pastis's O
chef, O
Michael O
Abt, O
was O
until O
recently O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
kitchen O
at O
the O
Washington O
restaurant O
Le O
Diplomate O
, O
which O
Mr. O
Starr O
owns. O
Better O
qualifications O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
conjure, O
given O
that O
Le O
Diplomate O
is O
essentially O
an O
imitation O
McNally O
restaurant. O
Taking O
his O
cues O
from O
the O
old O
days, O
Mr. O
Abt O
is O
putting O
out O
simple, O
unadorned, O
hunger-obliterating O
French O
cuisine O
drawn O
from O
the O
era O
before O
supermarkets O
and O
fast O
food. O
The O
salad O
of O
pickled O
herring O
and O
carrots O
with O
boiled O
potatoes O
might O
come O
straight O
from O
Brasserie O
Lipp O
. O
The O
country O
pâté O
is O
laden O
with O
chicken O
livers O
and O
riddled O
with O
soft O
white O
pork O
fat O
in O
gobs O
the O
size O
of O
gumdrops, O
although O
it O
could O
stand O
more O
salt, O
and O
I'd O
be O
happy O
to O
trade O
the O
slab O
of O
butter O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
for O
a O
pot O
of O
mustard. O
The O
pâté O
is O
made O
in O
house, O
as O
is O
the O
gorgeously O
smooth O
boudin O
blanc. O
With O
the O
boudin, O
you O
want O
puréed O
potatoes O
that O
are O
almost O
liquid. O
That O
is O
what O
you O
get. O
You O
might O
argue O
that, O
when O
it O
offers O
chilled O
king O
crab O
legs O
to O
be O
dipped O
in O
aioli, O
this O
unextravagant O
cafe O
breaks O
character. O
Does O
the O
same O
apply O
to O
garnishing O
sardines O
served O
in O
the O
can O
with O
an O
ingot O
of O
prized, O
costly O
butter O
made O
by O
Jean-Yves O
Bordier? O
Maybe. O
I O
thought, O
in O
any O
case, O
that O
the O
sardines O
and O
the O
olive O
oil O
they O
are O
packed O
in O
tended O
to O
talk O
over O
the O
butter. O
The O
half O
roast O
chicken O
is O
not O
in O
the O
same O
class O
as O
the O
birds O
that O
Antoine O
Westermann O
cooked O
when O
he O
was O
still O
at O
Le O
Coq O
Rico O
, O
but O
it O
is O
probably O
as O
good O
a O
roast O
chicken O
as O
any O
normal O
restaurant O
can O
produce. O
The O
duck O
in O
olives, O
though, O
is O
misconceived; O
the O
sauce O
is O
thin, O
acrid O
and O
one-dimensional O
instead O
of O
head-spinningly O
rich, O
the O
way O
it O
is O
at O
Allard O
in O
Paris O
. O
The O
seafood O
-- O
the O
trout O
amandine O
with O
its O
sautéed O
skin O
taut O
beneath O
its O
armor O
of O
toasted O
almonds; O
steamed O
mussels O
in O
a O
lemon O
broth O
that's O
satiny O
with O
melted O
butter; O
an O
entire O
steamed O
branzino O
with O
enough O
crisp O
summer O
vegetables O
to O
make O
a O
salad O
-- O
is O
very O
appealing, O
though O
that O
won't O
stop O
the O
people O
who O
are O
going O
to O
get O
steak O
frites O
without O
even O
a O
glance O
at O
the O
menu. O
Those O
people O
may O
get O
fries O
that O
are O
crunchy O
and O
golden, O
or O
they O
might O
end O
up O
with O
a O
limp, O
oily O
batch, O
or O
they O
may O
get O
both O
in O
the O
same O
night, O
as O
I O
did. O
At O
the O
length O
of O
20 O
years, O
memories O
are O
untrustworthy, O
but O
I'm O
reasonably O
sure O
the O
food O
at O
Pastis O
is O
better O
than O
it O
used O
to O
be. O
The O
wine O
is O
certainly O
more O
interesting. O
What's O
gone, O
and O
won't O
be O
back O
now O
that O
the O
surrounding O
addresses O
have O
been O
taken O
over O
by O
shops O
like O
Loro O
Piana, O
Sephora, O
Hermès O
and O
RH, O
is O
the O
pure O
downtown O
electricity O
Pastis O
once O
generated. O
Sharing O
real O
estate O
with O
meat O
cutters O
in O
blood-smeared O
aprons O
and O
prostitutes O
in O
dresses O
as O
tight O
as O
the O
skins O
on O
a O
boudin O
blanc, O
Pastis O
did O
a O
drop-dead O
perfect O
imitation O
of O
the O
coolest O
restaurant O
in O
France. O
The O
French O
part O
was O
fake, O
but O
the O
cool O
was O
real. O

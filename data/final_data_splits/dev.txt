One O
of O
the O
ways O
people O
pretend O
to O
be O
sophisticated O
about O
restaurants O
these O
days O
is O
by O
claiming O
that O
the O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
dining O
scene O
has O
lost O
its O
edge O
. O

The O
sheer O
number O
of O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
-- O
about O
27,000 O
, O
according O
to O
the O
health O
inspectors O
-- O
makes O
the O
argument O
absurd O
. O

How O
many O
of O
them O
are O
slipping O
? O

All O
of O
them O
? O

Just O
the O
first O
20,000 O
or O
so O
? O

In O
reality O
, O
people O
who O
gripe O
about O
the O
state O
of O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
restaurants O
are O
usually O
talking O
about O
a O
sliver O
of O
a O
slice O
of O
a O
fraction O
, O
probably O
around O
50 O
places O
whose O
names O
are O
in O
steady O
circulation O
, O
with O
the O
newest O
weighing O
most O
heavily O
in O
the O
results O
. O

The O
number O
of O
really O
good O
ones O
is O
higher O
than O
anyone O
can O
count O
. O

Places O
that O
other O
cities O
would O
brag O
about O
get O
lost O
in O
the O
crowd O
here O
. O

The O
chef O
Gunther O
Seeger O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
was O
a O
national O
star O
when O
he O
cooked O
in O
Atlanta B-LOC
. O

The O
tasting O
- O
menu O
restaurant O
he O
opened O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
Village I-LOC
three O
years O
ago O
should O
have O
been O
a O
major O
destination O
, O
especially O
after O
he O
dropped O
the O
prices O
. O

Mr. O
Seeger O
can O
make O
ingredients O
bend O
to O
his O
will O
almost O
without O
touching O
them O
. O

His O
cooking O
outshone O
that O
of O
some O
of O
the O
city O
's O
more O
famous O
chefs O
, O
who O
whip O
their O
ingredients O
harder O
with O
far O
less O
payoff O
. O

Yet O
he O
struggled O
to O
put O
Gunther B-EST
Seeger I-EST
NY I-EST
on O
the O
map O
. O

I O
reviewed O
it O
, O
but O
some O
other O
critics O
did O
n't O
, O
and O
by O
the O
time O
it O
closed O
, O
last O
month O
, O
Chris O
Crowley O
of O
Grub O
Street O
wrote O
, O
" O
it O
was O
n't O
a O
restaurant O
you O
heard O
a O
lot O
of O
food O
geeks O
talk O
about O
. O
" O

Mr. O
Seeger O
complained O
to O
one O
acquaintance O
that O
he O
could O
n't O
even O
get O
on O
a O
list O
of O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
's O
100 O
best O
restaurants O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
good O
restaurants O
fail O
everywhere O
, O
but O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
imagine O
Mr. O
Seeger O
vanishing O
into O
the O
crowd O
in O
San O
Francisco O
, O
Chicago O
or O
Los O
Angeles O
. O

Considered O
and O
rejected O
, O
maybe O
. O

But O
overlooked O
? O

Not O
likely O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
that O
any O
words O
of O
mine O
could O
have O
persuaded O
the O
city O
to O
cuddle O
up O
to O
Mr. O
Seeger O
, O
who O
is O
n't O
particularly O
cuddly O
. O

But O
I O
wish O
I O
'd O
found O
ways O
to O
remind O
New O
Yorkers O
that O
his O
breathtakingly O
pure O
cooking O
was O
there O
to O
be O
enjoyed O
while O
that O
was O
still O
true O
. O

Which O
brings O
us O
, O
by O
a O
circuitous O
and O
not O
particularly O
well O
- O
paved O
route O
, O
to O
Anthony O
Mangieri O
of O
Una O
Pizza O
Napoletana O
. O

Using O
naturally O
leavened O
dough O
and O
a O
short O
shopping O
list O
of O
ingredients O
, O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
makes O
what O
is O
unmistakably O
the O
finest O
sit O
- O
down O
pizza O
in O
the O
five O
boroughs O
. O

( O
I O
doubt O
he O
has O
any O
rivals O
in O
the O
stand O
- O
up O
joints O
, O
either O
, O
but O
slice O
pizza O
is O
a O
different O
game O
. O
) O

Two O
years O
ago O
, O
I O
posited O
that O
Razza O
, O
a O
pizzeria O
in O
Jersey O
City O
, O
made O
" O
the O
best O
pizza O
in O
New O
York O
. O
" O

I O
do O
n't O
regret O
writing O
that O
, O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
was O
not O
cooking O
in O
the O
city O
at O
the O
time O
and O
that O
Razza O
's O
chef O
, O
Dan O
Richer O
, O
has O
said O
that O
he O
began O
taking O
pizza O
seriously O
only O
after O
he O
met O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
. O

Una O
Pizza O
Napoletana O
saw O
a O
rush O
of O
curious O
pie O
- O
eaters O
after O
it O
opened O
on O
Orchard O
Street O
a O
little O
more O
than O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

But O
the O
last O
few O
times O
I O
've O
gone O
, O
there O
were O
too O
many O
unclaimed O
chairs O
and O
bar O
stools O
. O

When O
Anthony O
Mangieri O
is O
making O
pizza O
, O
the O
right O
number O
of O
empty O
seats O
is O
zero O
, O
as O
any O
New O
Yorker O
who O
waited O
in O
line O
at O
the O
old O
Una O
Pizza O
Napoletana O
, O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
from O
2004 O
to O
2009 O
, O
could O
tell O
you O
. O

Press O
interest O
in O
the O
new O
place O
has O
died O
down O
, O
too O
. O

So O
when O
I O
heard O
a O
rumor O
that O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
was O
thinking O
of O
leaving O
the O
city O
and O
taking O
his O
pizza O
with O
him O
, O
I O
was O
unnerved O
, O
to O
put O
it O
mildly O
. O

Asked O
about O
it O
, O
he O
told O
me O
he O
was O
considering O
it O
but O
had O
n't O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
. O

Mr. O
Mangieri O
has O
left O
New O
York O
before O
, O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
it O
then O
, O
either O
. O

This O
time O
, O
I O
was O
n't O
going O
to O
let O
him O
get O
away O
without O
a O
fight O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
my O
review O
of O
Una O
Pizza O
Napoletana O
last O
year O
was O
decidedly O
mixed O
. O

It O
is O
also O
true O
, O
though O
, O
that O
almost O
every O
criticism O
I O
made O
has O
been O
addressed O
. O

It O
has O
gone O
from O
one O
of O
the O
most O
confounding O
pizzerias O
in O
the O
city O
to O
one O
of O
the O
most O
enjoyable O
. O

The O
problem O
with O
Una O
Pizza O
a O
year O
ago O
was O
that O
it O
was O
trying O
to O
be O
two O
things O
at O
once O
. O

It O
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
a O
Neapolitan O
pizzeria O
, O
serving O
classic O
, O
unadorned O
pies O
baked O
for O
about O
two O
minutes O
inside O
a O
wood O
- O
burning O
oven O
shaped O
like O
an O
igloo O
. O

But O
it O
was O
also O
a O
cutting O
- O
edge O
Lower O
East O
Side O
experiment O
. O

At O
the O
instigation O
of O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
's O
partners O
, O
the O
chefs O
Fabian O
von O
Hauske O
Valtierra O
and O
Jeremiah O
Stone O
, O
the O
kitchen O
brought O
forth O
appetizers O
that O
had O
rarely O
if O
ever O
been O
asked O
to O
live O
under O
one O
roof O
with O
a O
pizza O
. O

There O
was O
a O
jellylike O
mass O
of O
raw O
lobster O
inside O
a O
ring O
of O
chickpeas O
, O
and O
a O
rust O
- O
colored O
puddle O
of O
' O
nduja O
under O
raw O
turnips O
and O
nasturtium O
leaves O
. O

The O
wine O
list O
was O
virtually O
a O
treatise O
on O
natural O
wines O
, O
a O
long O
document O
full O
of O
the O
names O
of O
eccentric O
producers O
and O
obscure O
European O
villages O
. O

In O
another O
restaurant O
, O
all O
this O
would O
have O
been O
the O
departure O
point O
for O
some O
adventurous O
evenings O
. O

But O
in O
a O
pizzeria O
it O
led O
to O
some O
peculiar O
pairings O
, O
made O
the O
check O
a O
bit O
higher O
than O
you O
wanted O
and O
resulted O
in O
long O
waits O
before O
you O
were O
finally O
allowed O
to O
eat O
the O
delicious O
pizza O
you O
'd O
come O
for O
. O

Over O
the O
past O
year O
, O
Mr. O
von O
Hauske O
and O
Mr. O
Stone O
have O
stepped O
aside O
, O
letting O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
call O
the O
shots O
. O

The O
wines O
on O
offer O
now O
number O
about O
15 O
. O

They O
are O
still O
a O
likably O
eccentric O
lot O
, O
but O
picking O
one O
does O
n't O
feel O
like O
studying O
for O
a O
master O
sommelier O
exam O
. O

The O
appetizers O
are O
simpler O
and O
less O
expensive O
: O
a O
plate O
of O
marinated O
white O
anchovies O
, O
a O
dish O
of O
warm O
Italian O
olives O
or O
a O
bowl O
of O
Little O
Gem O
lettuce O
with O
sunflower O
seeds O
in O
a O
Caesarish O
dressing O
. O

I O
do O
miss O
the O
tiramisu O
from O
the O
opening O
menu O
, O
but O
the O
new O
cannoli O
filled O
with O
ricotta O
-- O
a O
blend O
of O
domestic O
cow O
's O
milk O
and O
Italian O
sheep O
's O
milk O
-- O
are O
nearly O
as O
good O
. O

It O
's O
common O
for O
a O
new O
restaurant O
to O
trim O
its O
sails O
, O
but O
this O
one O
has O
trimmed O
its O
prices O
, O
too O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
the O
five O
regular O
pizzas O
were O
all O
$ O
25 O
; O
now O
they O
range O
from O
$ O
19 O
to O
$ O
25 O
, O
and O
the O
two O
extra O
- O
complicated O
Friday O
and O
Saturday O
pizzas O
are O
priced O
at O
$ O
26 O
. O

I O
liked O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
's O
pies O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
, O
I O
liked O
them O
more O
when O
he O
came O
back O
to O
town O
, O
and O
it O
's O
possible O
, O
just O
possible O
, O
that O
they O
've O
improved O
over O
the O
past O
year O
. O

He O
is O
, O
like O
Mr. O
Seeger O
, O
a O
minimalist O
. O

He O
lets O
you O
notice O
each O
ingredient O
: O
the O
little O
ping O
of O
sourness O
in O
the O
Campanian O
buffalo O
mozzarella O
, O
for O
instance O
. O

Or O
the O
unruly O
, O
windswept O
- O
hillside O
aroma O
of O
dried O
Sicilian O
oregano O
. O

The O
precise O
crunch O
of O
each O
unrefined O
Trapani O
sea O
- O
salt O
crystal O
waiting O
to O
dissolve O
. O

The O
crust O
is O
so O
tender O
it O
barely O
fights O
fork O
, O
knife O
or O
teeth O
. O

Some O
diners O
will O
wish O
it O
put O
up O
more O
crackly O
resistance O
. O

You O
inhale O
it O
at O
least O
as O
much O
as O
you O
eat O
it O
. O

When O
you O
have O
finished O
, O
some O
of O
the O
most O
popular O
pizzas O
in O
town O
will O
seem O
tough O
, O
leathery O
, O
overworked O
. O

Even O
if O
this O
is O
not O
the O
style O
you O
crave O
, O
you O
'll O
know O
that O
it O
's O
the O
work O
of O
a O
baker O
who O
has O
spent O
years O
listening O
to O
the O
dough O
. O

There O
is O
a O
place O
for O
people O
who O
are O
as O
obsessed O
with O
pizza O
as O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
, O
and O
the O
place O
is O
New O

As O

as O
I O
can O

, O
it O
simply O
materialized O
one O
morning O
this O

at O

was O

One O
reason O
it O
seems O
to O
have O
crept O
up O

is O
that O
it O

a O

the O

when O

the O

something O

Also O

Mr. O

pursue O
the O

strategy O

This O
is O
to O
say O

probably O
meant O
to O
be O
shared O
, O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
'd O
tasted O
it O
I O
came O
up O
with O
other O
ideas O
, O
as O
my O
dinner O
guests O
will O
testify O
. O

Two O
tartares B-FOOD
show O
Mr. O
Kent O
's O
talent O
for O
carrying O
bright O
new O
ideas O
with O
him O
into O
well O
- O
traveled O
territory O
. O

In O
the O
first O
, O
he O
laces O
hand O
- O
chopped O
raw B-FOOD
beef I-FOOD

toasted B-FOOD
walnuts I-FOOD
and O
earthy O
rye B-FOOD

; O
in O
the O
other O
, O
chopped O
raw B-FOOD

is O
sprinkled O
with O
individual O
juice O

filled O
vesicles O
of O
grapefruit B-FOOD

lemon B-FOOD
and O
orange B-FOOD
that O
pop O
between O
your O
teeth O
, O
a O
kind O

Maybe O
one O
or O
two O
ideas O
should O
have O
been O
left O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
road O
. O

The O
chicken B-DISH
liver I-DISH
ragu I-DISH
tossed O
with O
housemade O
cavatelli B-FOOD
does O
n't O
need O
to O
be O
so O
sweet O
with O
sherry B-FOOD
; O
a O
rough O
pesto B-FOOD
is O
a O
fine O
use O
for O
fresh O
chickpeas B-FOOD
, O
but O
is O
n't O
there O
a O
better O
partner O
for O
it O
than O
shaved O
jicama B-FOOD
? O

All O
is O
forgiven O
when O
Mr. O
Kent O
turns O
a O
mainstay O
like O
grilled B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
into O
a O
main O
course O
as O
exciting O
as O
the O
one O
at O
Crown B-EST
Shy I-EST
, O
which O
keeps O
the O
sunshine O
brightness O
of O
its O
citrus B-FOOD
marinade I-FOOD
, O
and O
is O
served O
with O
a O
puree B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
slash I-FOOD
- I-FOOD
hot I-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
of I-FOOD
fermented I-FOOD
hot O
and O
sweet O
peppers O
. O

The O
vivid O
orange O
of O
that O
hot B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
almost O
matches O
the O
marble O
in O
the O
lobby O
. O

But O
Crown B-EST
Shy I-EST
's O
two O
big O
dining O
rooms O
and O
extended O
bar O
are O
a O
little O
more O
restrained O
, O
dominated O
by O
cream O
tones O
, O
blond O
wood O
tables O
, O
and O
chairs O
with O
saddle O
- O
brown O
leather O
seats O
and O
backs O
. O

The O
only O
echoes O
of O
grandeur O
are O
the O
enormous O
windows O
and O
the O
ceiling O
high O
up O
overhead O
. O

The O
wine O
list O
is O
one O
to O
get O
lost O
in O
. O

Finance O
wizards O
with O
bonuses O
to O
expunge O
can O
certainly O
do O
that O
, O
but O
it O
's O
great O
to O
see O
lots O
of O
bottles O
under O
$ O
100 O
on O
almost O
every O
page O
. O

Anyone O
who O
knows O
what O
some O
of O
these O
wines B-FOOD
cost O
wholesale O
will O
be O
able O
to O
locate O
any O
number O
of O
good O
deals O
, O
but O
even O
the O
unschooled O
will O
notice O
the O
value O
regions O
. O

They O
jump O
off O
the O

for O

with O
vast O
stretches O
of O
Germany B-LOC
and O
pockets O
of O
Spain B-LOC
, O
France B-LOC
and O
Italy B-LOC
. O

With O
so O
many O
strengths O
, O
Crown B-EST
Shy I-EST
must O
have O
at O
least O
one O
thing O
wrong O
with O
it O
. O

And O
yes O
, O
it O
does O
. O

Obviously O
that O
name O
is O
ridiculous O
. O

Knowing O
that O
it O
refers O
to O
a O
tendency O
of O
very O
tall O
trees O
not O
to O
let O
their O
upper O
stories O
grow O
into O
their O
neighbors O
' O
branches O
does O
n't O
help O
, O
either O
. O

But O
we O
should O
probably O
get O
used O

enough O

a O

Faced O

you O

that O
you O
have O

two O
choices O

up O

If O
you O
go O
the O

it O

help O
to O
bring O
a O
pair O

the O
last O
minute O

in O

Ms. O
Ngo O
, O
who O
owns O
the O

while O
she O

worked O
in O

catering O
in O
New B-LOC

City I-LOC
for O
years O

she O
has O
never O
had O
a O
chance O
before O
to O
show O
off O
the O
food O
of O
her O
childhood O
, O
like O
the O
banh B-FOOD
beo I-FOOD
steamed O
by O
her O
mother O
, O
who O
had O
grown O
up O
in O
Hue B-LOC
. O

Ms. O
Wong O
is O
the O
chef O
. O

Though O
she O
has O
cooked O
at O
Gramercy B-EST
Tavern I-EST
and O
Battersby B-EST
, O
her O
background O
in O
the O
food O
of O
Vietnam B-LOC
before O
Van B-EST
Da I-EST
was O
more O
or O
less O
confined O
to O
the O
roughly O
two O
weeks O

traveling O
there O
while O
living O
in O
Hong B-LOC
Kong I-LOC
on O
a O
Fulbright O
grant O
a O
decade O

. O

Nevertheless O
, O
she O
has O
put O
together O
a O
trenchant O
, O
concise O
and O
pleasure O
- O
focused O
menu O
of O
Vietnamese B-CUISINE
dishes O
. O

Some O
she O
learned O
directly O
from O
her O
boss O
, O
and O
on O
those O
recipes O
she O
was O
apparently O
discouraged O
from O
drawing O
outside O
the O
lines O
. O

Others O
are O
more O
freely O
interpreted O
. O

It O
's O
a O
credit O
to O
Ms. O
Wong O
's O
sensitivity O
that O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
already O
know O
the O
original O
templates O
, O
it O
can O
be O
hard O
to O
tell O
where O
they O
end O
and O
her O

begins O

Banh B-DISH

the O

Ms. O
Ngo O
taught O
Ms. O

get O
their O
own O
berth O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

As O
you O
'd O
imagine O
, O
they O
tend O
to O
be O
very O
good O
. O

Banh B-DISH

In O

, O
the O
cups O
would O
be O
filled O
with O

Ms. O
Wong O
instead O
spoons O
sauteed B-FOOD

along O
with O
a O
crisscrossing O
of O
fresh O
herbs B-FOOD
and O
a O
spill O
of O
coconut B-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
. O

Ms. O
Wong O
makes O
an O
effort O
to O
bring O
out O
regional O
differences O
in O
Vietnamese B-CUISINE
cuisine O
by O
devoting O
sections O
of O
the O
menu O
to O
Saigon B-LOC
and O
Hanoi B-LOC
, O
hundreds O
of O
miles O
apart O
, O
as O
well O
as O
Hue B-LOC
, O
somewhere O
in O
the O
middle O
. O

She O
does O
n't O
have O
quite O
enough O
dishes O
from O
any O
one O
place O
to O
paint O
a O
full O
picture O
, O
but O
the O
project O
is O
intriguing O
. O

Like O
other O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
chefs O
, O
she O
has O
been O
caught O
in O
the O
tractor O
beam O
of O
cha B-DISH
ca I-DISH
la I-DISH
Vong I-DISH
, O
the O
turmeric B-DISH
- I-DISH
and I-DISH
dill O
- O
scented O
fish O
dish O
that O
is O
a O
specialty O
of O
a O
100 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
Hanoi B-LOC
restaurant O
of O
the O
same O
name O
. O

Her O
version O
, O
though O
, O
supplies O
less O
dill B-FOOD
, O
less O
sauce B-FOOD
and O
less O
satisfaction O
than O
some O
others O
. O

Her O
two O
improvisations O
on O
the O
theme O
of O
Hanoi B-LOC
's O
best O
- O
known O
contribution O
to O
gastronomy O
, O
pho B-FOOD
, O
are O
more O
effective O
. O

One O
gives O
you O
the O
soup B-FOOD
without O
the O
noodles B-FOOD
; O
floating O
in O
a O
rich O
and O
cloudy O
broth B-FOOD
are O
ghostly O
white O
, O
billowing O
won B-FOOD
tons I-FOOD
that O
contain O
chopped O
beef B-FOOD
fillet I-FOOD
freely O
seasoned O
with O
black B-FOOD
pepper I-FOOD
. O

The O
other O
dish O
is O
, O
humbly O
enough O
, O
a O
plate O
of O
soupless B-DISH
pho I-DISH
noodles I-DISH
stir O
- O
fried O
with O
springy O
mushrooms B-FOOD
, O
bitter B-FOOD
greens I-FOOD
and O
chopped O
scallions B-FOOD
. O

Its O
simplicity O
makes O
the O
impact O
of O
the O
dish O
hard O
to O
explain O
until O
you O
learn O
that O
it O
has O
been O
showered O
with O
Maggi B-FOOD
Seasoning I-FOOD
, O
a O
soylike O
sauce O
that O
is O
the O
invisible O
secret O
of O
many O
Vietnamese B-CUISINE
dishes O
. O

Nodding O
toward O
Saigon B-LOC
, O
Ms. O
Wong O
makes O
a O
rendition O
of O
shaking O
beef B-FOOD
by O
stir O
- O
frying O
tender O
and O
chewy O
marinated B-FOOD
hanger I-FOOD
steak I-FOOD
with O
potatoes B-FOOD
and O
then O
throwing O
a O
fistful O
of O
watercress B-FOOD
at O
it O
. O

If O
you O
think O
that O
sounds O
like O
a O
French B-CUISINE
bistro O
plate O
, O
then O
you O
are O
starting O
to O
understand O
how O
her O
mind O
works O
. O

Ms. O
Wong O
cooks O
skillfully O
, O
with O
an O
appreciation O
for O
nuance O
, O
and O
she O
does O
n't O
abuse O
her O
freedom O
by O
innovating O
pointlessly O
. O

It O
's O
possible O
, O
though O
, O
that O
she O
could O
stand O
to O
be O
less O
shy O
with O
chiles B-FOOD
and O
herbs B-FOOD
. O

The O
table B-FOOD
salad I-FOOD
of O
greenery O

wrapped O
around O
grilled B-FOOD
shrimp I-FOOD
offers O
no O
herbs B-FOOD
other O
than O
mint B-FOOD

and O
you O
'll O
run O
out O
of O
lettuce B-FOOD
before O
the O
fourth O
shrimp B-FOOD
has O
been O
dressed O
. O

The O
green B-DISH
papaya I-DISH
salad I-DISH
is O
a O
little O
too O
innocuous O
, O
and O
while O
her O
version O
of O
the O
street O
snack O
of O
grilled B-DISH
corn I-DISH

is O
a O
real O

Talking O
about O
how O
good O
the O

Thomas O

would O
be O
easier O
if O
it O

out O

TAK B-EST
Room I-EST
is O
so O
determined O
to O
be O
" O
timeless O
, O
" O
as O
Mr. O

has O
often O
called O
it O
, O
that O
it O

enough O
has O

for O

What O

Mr. O

answer O
is O
a O

Facing O

are O

can O
quietly O
surveil O
the O

a O

a O
lot O
of O
stuff O
in O
it O
? O
" O

I O
asked O
my O
server O
. O

Realizing O
that O
this O
was O
somewhat O
ambiguous O
, O
especially O
applied O
to O
a O
dish O
as O
laden O
with O
stuff O
as O
the O
brew O
of O
lambs B-FOOD
' I-FOOD
snouts O
, O
ears B-FOOD
, O
tongues B-FOOD
, O
cheeks B-FOOD
and O
eyeballs B-FOOD
known O
in O
Turkey B-LOC
as O
kelle B-FOOD
paca I-FOOD
, O
I O
tried O
again O
. O

" O
Is O
it O
very O
filling O
, O
I O
mean O
? O
" O

My O
concern O
was O
a O
familiar O
one O
, O
to O
me O
at O
least O
. O

I O
was O
in O
Queens B-DISH
, O
at O
a O
new O
Turkish B-CUISINE
restaurant O
in O
Astoria B-LOC
called O
Lokanta B-EST
, O
and O
the O
menu O
was O
so O
appealing O
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
try O
it O
all O
. O

Already O
I O
was O
set O
on O
a O
few O
bourekas B-DISH
, O
some O
labneh B-DISH
, O
the O
fava B-DISH
dip I-DISH
and O
some O
form O
of O
braised B-DISH
lamb I-DISH
over I-DISH
eggplant I-DISH
. O

I O
'd O
spotted O
another O
three O
or O
four O
dishes O
that O
I O
was O
probably O
going O
to O
tack O
on O
at O
the O
end O
of O
my O
order O
, O
as O
if O
by O
afterthought O
. O

I O
suspected O
that O
I O
could O
add O
a O
small O
bowl O
of O
kelle B-DISH
paca I-DISH
and O
still O
eat O
everything O
else O
. O

But O
a O
big O
bowl O
, O
one O
so O
thick O
with O
bits O
formerly O
affixed O
to O
a O
sheep O
's O
skull O
that O
a O
spoon O
would O
stand O
up O
in O
it O
, O
might O
tip O
the O
scale O
. O

The O
server O
pondered O
this O
for O
a O
while O
until O
a O
wiry O
man O
got O
up O
from O
his O
marble O
- O
topped O
table O
in O
the O
corner O
and O
conferred O
with O
her O
. O

Wearing O
baggy O
jeans O
, O
a O
white O
T O
- O
shirt O
and O
a O
baseball O
cap O
that O
kept O
his O
zinc O
- O
colored O
ponytail O
in O
place O
, O
he O
looked O
like O
a O
contractor O
, O
maybe O
a O
painter O
who O
'd O
come O
by O
to O
touch O
up O
the O
moldings O
and O
had O
been O
invited O
to O
stay O
for O
a O
Turkish B-CUISINE
coffee B-FOOD
. O

Then O
he O
spoke O
to O
us O
about O
the O
sheep B-DISH
's I-DISH
head I-DISH
soup O
. O

" O
I O
am O
a O
genius O
, O
" O
he O
began O
. O

" O
And O
even O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
answer O
this O
question O
. O

I O
think O
that O
the O
question O
must O
be O
wrong O
. O
" O

As O
those O
who O
chase O
the O
scent O
of O
lamb B-FOOD
and O
charred B-FOOD
eggplant I-FOOD
around O
the O
city O
have O
probably O
guessed O
, O
this O
was O
no O
contractor O
. O

This O
was O
Orhan O
Yegen O
, O
the O
Turkish O
- O
born O
chef O
and O
restaurateur O
who O
has O
opened O
close O
to O
20 O
Turkish B-CUISINE
restaurants O
over O
the O
past O
two O
decades O
or O
so O
while O
keeping O
up O
a O
running O
monologue O
that O
made O
him O
a O
favorite O
of O
food O
writers O
. O

In O
2004 O
, O
Mr. O
Yegen O
opened O
Sip B-EST
Sak I-EST
in O
Turtle B-LOC
Bay I-LOC
, O
then O
proceeded O
to O
surprise O
those O
who O
had O
charted O
his O
career O
by O
embarking O
on O
a O
long O
, O
stable O
period O
. O

All O
was O
quiet O
, O
relatively O
speaking O
, O
until O
April O
, O
when O
Lokanta B-EST
arrived O
in O
Astoria B-LOC
to O
supplement O
the O
Greek B-CUISINE
and O
Cypriot B-CUISINE
menus O
along O
its O
stretch O
of O
Broadway B-LOC
, O
and O
Mr. O
Yegen O
arrived O
to O
tell O
customers O
that O
their O
questions O
were O
wrong O
. O

The O
kelle B-DISH
paca I-DISH
colloquy O
ended O
when O
I O
agreed O
to O
order O
it O
. O

After O
hours O
on O
the O
stove O
, O
the O
meat B-FOOD
on O
the O
head O
had O
fallen O
away O
into O
about O
eight O
different O
textures O
, O
from O
frilly O
to O
ropy O
to O
collagenously O
chewy O
to O
tender O
and O
lean O
. O

All O
of O
this O
suspended O
in O
a O
slippery O
, O
almost O
sticky O
broth B-FOOD
the O
color O
of O
cappuccino B-FOOD
. O

And O
no O
, O
it O
was O
not O
too O
filling O
. O

Soups B-FOOD
, O
braises B-FOOD
, O
stews B-FOOD
and O
other O
recipes O
requiring O
plenty O
of O
time O
and O
even O
more O
olive B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
are O
the O
basis O
of O
Mr. O
Yegen O
's O
reputation O
. O

They O
set O
his O
menus O
apart O
from O
those O
at O
other O
Turkish B-CUISINE
restaurants O
around O
town O
, O
which O
tend O
to O
revolve O
around O
the O
grill O
. O

Lokanta B-EST
makes O
very O
fine O
kofte B-DISH
, O
but O
for O
a O
full O
medley O
of O
minced B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
skewered I-FOOD
meats I-FOOD
, O
you O
are O
better O
off O
under O
the O
swaying O
chandeliers O
of O
Taci B-EST
's I-EST
Beyti O
on O
Coney B-LOC
Island I-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
. O

Lokanta B-EST
will O
grill O
or O
roast O
a O
whole O
fish B-FOOD
, O
but O
it O
will O
not O
be O
all O
that O
different O
from O
what O
might O
be O
served O
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
at O
Liman B-EST
, O
where O
your O
bass B-FOOD
will O
be O
filleted O
within O
view O
of O
the O
fishing O
boats O
and O
swans O
of O
Sheepshead B-LOC
Bay I-LOC
. O

Diners O
in O
Lokanta B-EST
's O
custody O
have O
signed O
on O
for O
a O
more O
nuanced O
view O
of O
the O
Turkish B-CUISINE
kitchen O
. O

Take O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
the O
shadings O
that O
lamb B-FOOD
takes O
on O
. O

In O
hunkar B-DISH
begendi I-DISH
, O
chunks O
of O
it O
are O
stewed O
in O
tomatoes B-FOOD
and O
peppers B-FOOD
and O
ladled O
over O
an O
eggplant B-FOOD
mash I-FOOD
beaten O
to O
a O
memorable O
richness O
with O
cheese B-FOOD
and O
milk B-FOOD
. O

Ali B-EST
nazik I-EST
is O
, O
in O
schematic O
form O
, O
the O
same O
thing O
, O
built O
on O
the O
same O
foundation O
of O
milky O
eggplant B-FOOD
, O
but O
in O
Lokanta B-EST
's O
version O
the O
lamb B-FOOD
is O
ground O
and O
simmered O
with O
onions B-FOOD
and O
red B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
green I-FOOD
peppers I-FOOD
; O
somehow O
it O
achieves O
a O
rich O
, O
unctuous O
consistency O
that O
is O
amplified O
by O
the O
eggplant B-FOOD
and O
the O
scoop O
of O
strained B-FOOD
yogurt I-FOOD
dropped O
on O
top O
. O

Lokanta B-EST
's O
" O
roasted B-DISH
lamb I-DISH
and I-DISH
rice I-DISH
" O
is O
in O
the O
pilaf B-FOOD
family O
, O
which O
means O
that O
the O
rice B-FOOD
is O
not O
just O
a O
side O
dish O
but O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
recipe O
, O
baked O
until O
alluringly O
sweet O
with O
currants B-FOOD
, O
allspice B-FOOD
and O
cinnamon B-FOOD
, O
then O
sprinkled O
with O
fresh O
dill B-FOOD
at O
the O
last O
minute O
. O

The O
lamb B-FOOD
's O
job O
is O
to O
be O
obligingly O
tender O
, O
and O
it O
succeeds O
, O
one O
reason O
the O
dish O
is O
requested O
by O
so O
many O
tables O
. O

To O
fend O
off O
boredom O
, O
I O
imagine O
, O
Mr. O
Yegen O
fills O
his O
manti B-FOOD
with O
both O
lamb B-FOOD
and O
beef B-FOOD
. O

Each O
little O
dumpling B-FOOD
is O
rolled O
by O
fingertip O
and O
is O
roughly O
the O
size O
of O
one O
. O

The O
meat B-FOOD
has O
been O
seasoned O
just O
forcefully O
enough O
that O
it O
will O
announce O
itself O
, O
politely O
but O
clearly O
, O
as O
it O
breaks O
through O
the O
dough B-FOOD
. O

It O
would O
be O
possible O
to O
sit O
down O
in O
front O
of O
a O
bowl O
of O
these O
, O
spooning O
them O
up O
with O
their O
warm O
yogurt B-FOOD
and O
chile B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
and O
dried B-FOOD
mint I-FOOD
, O
and O
call O
for O
another O
bowl O
a O
minute O
later O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
meal O
should O
begin O
with O
strips O
of O
nigella B-DISH
- I-DISH
dotted I-DISH
Turkish O
bread O
and O
a O
spread B-FOOD
or O
two O
-- O
maybe O
memorably O
creamy O
puree B-FOOD
of I-FOOD
dried I-FOOD
favas I-FOOD
; O
or O
the O
roughly O
mashed B-FOOD
eggplant I-FOOD
, O
smoky O
without O
a O
trace O
of O
bitterness O
; O
and O
one O
of O
the O
strained B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
yogurt O
dips O
, O
either O
the O
tangy O
cacik B-DISH
, O
laced O
with O
minced O
cucumbers B-FOOD
, O
or O
the O
labneh B-DISH
, O
as O
firm O
as O
a O
new O
mattress O
. O

Either O
will O
prove O
useful O
as O
the O
meal O
goes O
on O
. O

So O
will O
a O
simple O
salad B-FOOD
, O
especially O
the O
one O
with O
white B-FOOD
beans I-FOOD
and O
purple B-FOOD
onions I-FOOD
. O

The O
tightly O
rolled O
, O
golden O
bourekas B-FOOD
are O
like O
skinny O
Turkish B-CUISINE
spring B-FOOD
rolls I-FOOD
filled O
with O
dill B-FOOD
and O
melting O
feta B-FOOD
. O

Cold O
poached B-FOOD
leeks I-FOOD
, O
a O
frequent O
special O
, O
are O
more O
appealing O
than O
the O
cold O
poached B-FOOD
artichokes I-FOOD
that O
have O
a O
permanent O
spot O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

If O
Mr. O
Yegen O
tells O
you O
that O
the O
grilled B-FOOD
octopus I-FOOD
is O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O
, O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
he O
rarely O
seems O
to O
leave O
his O
own O
restaurant O
. O

It O
's O
quite O
good O
, O
though O
, O
with O
a O
fugitive O
sweetness O
that O
may O
be O
supplied O
by O
the O
tomatoes B-FOOD
and O
purple B-FOOD
onions I-FOOD
. O

Desserts O
run O
toward O
milky O
white O
puddings B-FOOD
, O
nice O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
mild O
sedative O
. O

The O
baklava B-DISH
, O
imported O
from O
Turkey B-LOC
, O
is O
a O
treat O
for O
those O
of O
us O
who O
like O
pistachios B-FOOD
and O
think O
sugar B-FOOD
syrup I-FOOD
makes O
a O
better O
baklava B-FOOD
sweetener O
than O
honey B-FOOD
. O

The O
unlikely O
champion O
, O
though O
, O
is O
the O
butternut B-FOOD
squash I-FOOD
that O
has O
been O
languorously O
baked O
in O
its O
own O
juices O
with O
nothing O
but O
sugar B-FOOD
. O

The O
technique O
is O
one O
of O
those O
small O
tricks O
that O
helps O
Mr. O
Yegen O
's O
cooking O
stand O
out O
, O
like O
the O
perfume O
of O
lemon B-FOOD
peel I-FOOD
in O
the O
Turkish B-DISH
lemonade I-DISH
. O

Lokanta B-EST
has O
no O
liquor B-FOOD
license O
yet O
. O

Some O
customers O
smuggle O
wine B-FOOD
through O
the O
door O
and O
keep O
the O
bottles O
on O
their O
tables O
, O
which O
are O
topped O
with O
radiant O
white O
marble O
from O
Turkey B-LOC
and O
surrounded O
by O
classic O
bentwood O
cafe O
chairs O
. O

But O
it O
is O
hard O
not O
to O
want O
the O
lemonade B-FOOD
, O
which O
is O
cold O
and O
just O
tart O
enough O
and O
not O
very O
filling O
at O
all O
. O

The O
chef O
John O
Fraser O
's O
new O
restaurant O
has O
a O
blandly O
corporate O
name O
, O
701West B-EST
, O
that O
tells O
you O
less O
about O
the O
place O
than O
simply O
walking O
into O
the O
dining O
room O
. O

One O
of O
several O
operations O
he O
is O
running O
in O
the O
new O
Times B-LOC
Square I-LOC
Edition I-LOC
hotel I-LOC
, O
it O
is O
clad O
in O
paneling O
on O
the O
walls O
and O
ceilings O
. O

Velvet O
curtains O
and O
banquettes O
are O
the O
slightly O
alarming O
color O
of O
a O
blue O
macaw O
's O
tail O
feathers O
. O

Wooden O
blinds O
are O
usually O
snapped O
shut O
against O
the O
strobes O
of O
47th B-LOC
Street I-LOC
and O
Seventh B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
. O

To O
get O
to O
your O
table O
, O
you O
must O
first O
pass O
between O
two O
identical O
Champagne O
trolleys O
. O

An O
iced O
reservoir O
in O
the O
center O
of O
each O
is O
loaded O
with O
about O
half O
a O
dozen O
bottles O
that O
range O
in O
price O
from O
a O
Blanquette B-DISH
de I-DISH
Limoux I-DISH
for O
$ O
26 O
a O
glass O
to O
a O
2006 B-DISH
brut I-DISH
from O
Dom B-EST
Perignon I-EST
for O
$ O
66 O
a O
glass O
. O

Before O
you O
sit O
down O
, O
you O
've O
already O
learned O
that O
wine B-FOOD
is O
front O
and O
center O
, O
literally O
and O
figuratively O
; O
that O
it O
is O
more O
likely O
to O
come O
from O
classic O
, O
mannerly O
European O
estates O
than O
, O
say O
, O
Macedonian O
villages O
still O
using O
amphoras O
that O
Odysseus O
drank O
from O
; O
that O
the O
ideal O
customer O
is O
not O
likely O
to O
get O
up O
and O
walk O
out O
upon O
being O
offered O
a O
$ O
66 O
aperitif B-FOOD
; O
and O
that O
the O
restaurant O
expects O
to O
attract O
so O
many O
of O
these O
customers O
that O
a O
single O
Champagne O
trolley O
is O
not O
enough O
. O

Which O
is O
to O
say O
that O
Marriott B-LOC
International I-LOC
and O
the O
hotelier O
Ian O
Schrager O
installed O
701West B-EST
on O
the O
11th O
floor O
of O
the O
Edition B-DIET
for O
people O
who O
still O
think O
a O
leisurely O
, O
three O
- O
course O
dinner O
with O
a O
few O
interesting O
bottles O
and O
some O
of O
the O
customary O
niceties O
is O
worth O
spending O
money O
on O
. O

It O
belongs O
to O
a O
species O
of O
restaurant O
that O
is O
no O
longer O
in O
great O
supply O
in O
Manhattan B-LOC
, O
let O
alone O
on O
the O
intersection O
where O
the O
green O
neon O
of O
the O
Olive B-EST
Garden I-EST
faces O
off O
across O
Seventh B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
against O
the O
giant O
candy O
bars O
of O
Hershey O
's O
Chocolate O
World O
. O

It O
also O
marks O
Mr. O
Fraser O
's O
first O
arabesques O
on O
the O
stage O
of O
formal O
dining O
since O
Dovetail B-EST
closed O
last O
year O
. O

These O
are O
early O
days O
for O
701West B-EST
, O
but O
so O
far O
I O
've O
found O
the O
cooking O
more O
original O
and O
appealing O
than O
Dovetail B-EST
's O
in O
its O
final O
phase O
. O

As O
you O
know O
if O
you O
've O
tried O
the O
fried B-DISH
- I-DISH
cauliflower O
buns O
at O
Nix B-EST
, O
or O
the O
ramen B-DISH
- I-DISH
style I-DISH
boiled O
eggs O
at O
the O
Loyal B-EST
whose O
yolks B-FOOD
are O
red O
with O
a O
film O
of O
jellied B-FOOD
chile I-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
, O
Mr. O
Fraser O
has O
a O
playful O
, O
imaginative O
streak O
. O

He O
needs O
it O
at O
701West B-EST
, O
where O
there O
is O
no O
real O
theme O
beyond O
wine B-FOOD
and O
style O
. O

But O
there O
is O
enough O
creativity O
across O
the O
menu O
, O
on O
which O
he O
collaborates O
with O
the O
chef O
de O
cuisine O
, O
Rob O
Lawson O
, O
and O
the O
pastry O
chef O
, O
Sebastien O
Rouxel O
, O
to O
make O
dinner O
the O
engaging O
, O
somewhat O
eccentric O
experience O
it O
is O
clearly O
meant O
to O
be O
. O

Before O
the O
first O
courses O
appear O
, O
for O
example O
, O
there O
may O
be O
a O
" O
cauliflower B-DISH
mille I-DISH

It O
's O
enticingly O
off O
- O
kilter O
, O
and O
another O
frequent O
amuse O
manages O
to O
outdo O
it O

, O
dense O

nutty O
and O
sweet O
with O
a O

drops O
of O
honey B-FOOD

This O
is O
luxury O
dining O
in O
its O
way O
, O
which O
is O
not O
the O
predictable O
way O
. O

The O
menu O
proposes O
three O
courses O
for O
$ O
98 O
, O
but O
a O
server O
informed O
me O
that O
" O
we O
also O
have O
a O
la O
carte O
, O
if O
that O
's O
more O
your O
rhythm O
for O
the O
evening O

" O

Frequently O
the O
surprises O
come O
in O
the O
form O
of O
an O
unexpected O
tweak O
dealt O
to O
a O
vegetable B-FOOD
. O

Slowly O
cooked O
in O
beet B-FOOD
juice I-FOOD
, O
a O
whole O
beet B-FOOD
takes O
on O
the O
glistening O
ruby O
intensity O
of O
raw B-FOOD
bluefin I-FOOD
tuna I-FOOD
. O

There O
is O
an O
appetizer O
of O
actual O
bluefin B-FOOD
as O
well O
, O
and O
it O
has O
the O
precise O
, O
Japanese O
- O
informed O
minimalism O
of O
a O
dish O
you O
'd O
get O
at O
Jean B-EST
- O
Georges O
, O
with O
tiny O
spring B-FOOD
peas I-FOOD
and O
young O
turnip B-FOOD
greens I-FOOD
and O
an O
electrifying O
white O
cloud O
of O
grated B-FOOD
horseradish I-FOOD
. O

In O
a O
dish O
of O
fava B-DISH
agnolotti I-DISH
, O
the O
X O
factor O
is O
the O
bright O
, O
almost O
effervescent O
sparkle O
of O
vinegar B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
marinated O
tomatoes O
and O
their O
juices O
stirred O
into O
a O
Parmesan B-FOOD

rind O

There O
is O
one O
mystifying O
appetizer O
in O
which O
the O
dueling O
tidal O
flavors O
of O
sea B-FOOD
urchin I-FOOD
and O
squid B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
ink O
risotto O
are O
allowed O
to O
cancel O
each O

out O

For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
though O
, O
the O
plates O
do O

overreach O

for O
all O
the O
inventiveness O
on O

Asparagus B-FOOD
dipped O
in O
aioli B-FOOD
is O
a O
good O
idea O
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
what O
if O
the O
asparagus B-FOOD
has O
been O
steamed O
inside O
a O
wrapper O
of O
thinly O
shaved B-FOOD
cedar I-FOOD
until O
it O
is O
nearly O
as O
smoky O
as O
country B-FOOD
bacon I-FOOD
? O

And O
what O
if O
the O
aioli B-FOOD
is O
enhanced O
by O
truffles B-FOOD
? O

It O
may O
sound O
overworked O
, O
but O
it O
is O
such O
a O
thrill O
that O
one O
of O
my O
guests O
asked O
for O
another O
plate O
before O
we O
could O
move O
on O
to O
the O
main O
courses O
, O
throwing O
the O
rhythm O
for O
the O
evening O
right O
out O
the O
window O
. O

The O
night O
will O
pause O
again O
if O
one O
of O
the O
main O
courses O
is O
the O
sweet B-DISH
potato I-DISH
, O
as O
everyone O
tries O
to O
figure O
out O
where O
it O
got O
its O
creaminess O
and O
savory O
depth O
. O

Even O
once O
you O
know O
it O
's O
been O
sealed O
up O
and O
baked O
inside O
a O
little O
coffin O
of O
sourdough B-FOOD
that O
is O
streaked O
with O
green O
threads O
of O
wakame B-FOOD
seaweed I-FOOD
, O
you O
still O
ca O
n't O
quite O
believe O
that O
all O
this O
flavor O
has O
been O
achieved O
with O
an O
ordinary O
sweet B-FOOD
potato I-FOOD
. O

Some O
of O
the O
large O
pieces O
of O
fish B-FOOD
and O
meat B-FOOD
are O
showstoppers O
on O
their O
own O
, O
like O
the O
lobster B-FOOD
that O
rests O
for O
four O
days O
in O
aged B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
beef O
fat O
before O
being O
broiled O
and O
set O
over O
some O
jammy O
ratatouille B-FOOD
. O

When O
they O
are O
not O
, O
something O
else O
on O
the O
plate O
usually O
is O

long O
slab O
of O
roasted B-FOOD
duck I-FOOD
breast I-FOOD
dredged O

attention O

they O
are O
assisted O

This O
is O
one O
of O
those O
innovations O
in O
service O
that O
seems O
obvious O
now O
that O
somebody O
's O
actually O
doing O
it O

The O
meal O
can O
become O
an O
evening O
- O
long O
conversation O
about O
wine B-FOOD
; O
the O
sommeliers O
even O
invite O
you O
to O
play O
the O

insiders O
' O
game O
of O
guessing O
the O
identity O
of O
a O
mystery O
pour O
in O
a O
black O
glass O
. O

It O
is O
slightly O
incredible O
that O
a O
restaurant O
that O
tries O
so O
hard O
to O
give O
wine B-FOOD
equal O
status O
with O
the O
cooking O
does O
not O
have O
more O
bottles O
for O
under O

That O

the O
ones O

to O
be O
very O
good O
and O
fairly O
priced O

The O
high O
cost O
of O

in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
takes O
a O
toll O
on O
many O
restaurants O
in O

it O
can O
also O
lead O
to O
compromises O

for O

You O
might O
not O
hear O
the O
hiss O
of O
chicken B-FOOD
being O
fried O
inside O
buttermilk B-FOOD
batter I-FOOD
before O
it O

you O
did O

hear O
the O
low O

it O
warms O
a O
plate O

then O
melts O

browns O
a O
patch O

you O
might O

you O

about O

cheese B-DISH

pick O

it O
makes O
a O
certain O
amount O

when O

taste O
it O

Some O
of O
Belle B-EST
Harlem I-EST
's O
space O
limitations O
are O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
little O
constricting O
. O

When O
the O
place O
is O
full O
, O
some O
customers O
have O
to O
ride O
sidesaddle O
, O
their O
knees O
angled O
away O
from O
the O
counter O
, O
because O
if O
they O
faced O
it O
head O

on O
they O
'd O
cut O
off O
the O
narrow O
path O
to O
the O
restroom O
in O
the O
back O

But O
275 O
square O
feet O
are O
what O
the O
Burnettes O
have O
to O
work O
with O
, O
and O
they O
have O
made O
this O
shallow O
sliver O
into O
something O
rare O
not O
just O
in O
Harlem B-LOC
but O
in O
all O
Manhattan B-LOC
. O

One O
of O
the O
peculiarities O
of O
dining O
in O
the O
city O
, O
circa O
2019 O
, O
is O
that O
the O
more O
high O
- O
functioning O
a O
restaurant O
is O
, O
the O
less O
likely O
you O
are O
to O
encounter O
a O
proprietor O
. O

There O
are O
exceptions O
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
often O
the O
most O
successful O
restaurateurs O
are O
very O
busy O
people O
, O
so O
they O
leave O
their O
dining O
rooms O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
professional O
managers O
. O

Proprietors O
are O
n't O
always O
as O
smooth O
as O
professionals O
, O
but O
they O
are O
as O
attuned O
to O
what O
goes O
on O
in O
their O
dining O
rooms O
as O
new O
parents O
are O
to O
the O
noises O
coming O
from O
a O
bassinet O
. O

I O
never O
quite O
felt O
as O
if O
I O
were O
attending O
a O
dinner O
party O
in O
the O
Burnettes O
' O
apartment O
, O
which O
is O
the O
feeling O
they O
say O
they O
're O
going O
for O
, O
but O
I O
always O
knew O
I O
was O
in O
a O
place O
that O
somebody O
cared O
about O
. O

Their O
original O
plan O
was O
to O
feed O
everyone O
the O
same O
meal O
-- O
a O
tasting O
menu O
. O

" O
We O
found O
out O
pretty O
quickly O
Harlem O
was O
n't O
ready O
, O
" O
Mr. O
Burnette O
said O
in O
an O
interview O
. O

How O
quickly O
? O

" O
We O
tried O
one O
night O
. O
" O

Belle O
Harlem O
rolled O
out O
an O
a O
la O
carte O
menu O
the O
next O
day O
. O

It O
stuck O
. O

The O
first O
half O
is O
given O
to O
smaller O
plates O
, O
although O
one O
of O
the O
hallmarks O
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
that O
the O
Burnettes O
do O
n't O
serve O
anything O
truly O
small O
. O

They O
want O
you O
to O
eat O
. O

Two O
people O
could O
get O
away O
with O
ordering O
one O
main O
course O
and O
two O
appetizers O
, O
though O
I O
'd O
urge O
anyone O
going O
to O
Belle B-EST
Harlem I-EST
not O
to O
overlook O
dessert O
. O

These O
introductory O
dishes O
are O
where O
Mr. O
Burnette O
takes O
casual B-CUISINE
American I-CUISINE
vernacular I-CUISINE
food O
like O
chicken B-DISH
and I-DISH
waffles I-DISH
out O
for O
a O
stroll O
. O

His O
fried B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
has O
a O
convoluted O
, O
frilly O
crust O
, O
with O
plenty O
of O
golden O
surface O
area O
for O
the O
jalapeno B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
banana O
syrup O
to O
get O
lost O
in O
. O

The O
pizzelles B-FOOD
are O
a O
new O
idea O
of O
his O
, O
replacing O
the O
regular O
waffles B-FOOD
he O
used O
to O
make O
, O
and O
they O
work O
best O
when O
he O
cooks O
them O
to O
a O
dark O
crisp O
. O

This O
is O
also O
where O
you O
'll O
find O
the O
cheese B-DISH
- I-DISH
steak O
crostini O
, O
as O
well O
as O
spring B-FOOD
rolls I-FOOD
stuffed O
with O
macaroni B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
-- O
kid O
food O
in O
a O
fried O
shell O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
a O
bacon B-FOOD
marmalade I-FOOD
with O
fresh O
dill B-FOOD
makes O
it O
unexpectedly O
complex O
, O
a O
chef O
's O
dish O
. O

The O
bottom O
of O
the O
menu O
is O
more O
substantial O
: O
The O
pan B-DISH
- I-DISH
seared I-DISH
, I-DISH
smoked O
pork O
tenderloin O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
is O
bigger O
than O
what O
usually O
crosses O
a O
12 O
- O
seat O
tasting O
counter O
. O

This O
month O
, O
Mr. O
Burnette O
is O
laying O
the O
barrels O
of O
pork B-FOOD
over O
a O
cherry B-FOOD
compote I-FOOD
with O
basil B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
, O
with O
a O
few O
snap B-FOOD
peas I-FOOD
for O
added O
sweetness O
. O

He O
brings O
a O
keen O
sense O
of O
what O

you O
take O

times O
you O
almost O

a O

might O
not O

as O

happy O
to O

a O
party O

three O

just O
when O

that O
the O

a O

that O
is O
similar O
enough O

for O

This O
service O
would O
come O
in O
handy O
in O
times O
like O
the O
present O
, O
when O
critics O
and O
superfans O
are O
trying O
to O
metabolize O
the O
two O
restaurants O
Mr. O
Vongerichten O
opened O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
during O
a O
single O
week O
in O
May. O

One O
is O
the O
Paris B-EST
Cafe I-EST
, O
a O
casual B-TYPE
, I-TYPE
all I-TYPE
- O
day O
proposition O
inside O
Eero O
Saarinen O
's O
T.W.A. B-LOC
terminal I-LOC
at O
Kennedy B-LOC
International I-LOC
Airport I-LOC
, O
now O
gloriously O
resurrected O
as O
the O
TWA B-LOC
Hotel I-LOC
. O

The O
second O
is O
a O
polished O
seafood B-TYPE
house I-TYPE
that O
sits O
out O
in O
the O
East B-LOC
River I-LOC
on O
the O
end O
of O
Pier B-LOC
17 I-LOC
, O
next O
to O
the O
wreck O
of O
the O
old O
Fulton B-LOC
Fish I-LOC
Market I-LOC
; O
it O
's O
called O
the O
Fulton B-EST
. O

Because O
I O
've O
been O
to O
both O
so O
recently O
, O
I O
can O
report O
confidently O
that O
the O
Fulton B-EST
slices O
deep O
- O
red O
strawberries B-FOOD
over O
strawberry B-FOOD
ice I-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
and O
a O
sorbet B-FOOD
made O
from O
strawberries B-FOOD
and O
red B-FOOD
wine I-FOOD
to O
make O
its O
strawberry B-DISH
sundae I-DISH
, O
while O
the O
one O
at O
the O
Paris B-EST
Cafe I-EST
substitutes O
dried B-FOOD
strawberries I-FOOD
. O

That O
version O
is O
n't O
bad O
, O
but O
there O
is O
an O
undeniable O
difference O
between O
fresh B-FOOD
summer I-FOOD
berries I-FOOD
and O
dehydrated O
ones O
, O
and O
that O
difference O
suggests O
the O
quality O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
restaurants O
. O

The O
best O
reasons O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Paris B-EST
Cafe I-EST
are O
Saarinen O
's O
glass O
walls O
, O
gliding O
curves O
and O
suspended O
catwalk O
, O
although O
the O
dining O
areas O
are O
swell O
, O
too O
, O
smartly O
evoking O
Raymond O
Loewy O
's O
original O
design O
for O
the O
space O
, O
which O
looked O
like O
a O
coffee B-TYPE
shop I-TYPE
on O
the O
moon O
. O

The O
place O
has O
some O
likable O
pizzas B-FOOD
and O
salads B-FOOD
, O
and O
it O
vaults O
clear O
over O
the O
other O
restaurants O
at O
the O
airport O
. O

But O
the O
recipes O
seem O
designed O
not O
to O
push O
the O
kitchen O
too O
hard O
, O
the O
menu O
is O
even O
more O
Vongerichtenesque O
than O
usual O
, O
and O
any O
dishes O
involving O
fruits B-FOOD
or O
vegetables B-FOOD
will O
make O
you O
wonder O
whether O
the O
produce O
truck O
drove O
to O
La B-LOC
Guardia I-LOC
instead O
. O

The O
Fulton B-EST
, O
though O
, O
is O
a O
grown O
- O
up O
production O
. O

Under O
the O
day O
- O
to O
- O
day O
command O
of O
Noah O
Poses O
, O
the O
executive O
chef O
, O
it O
is O
easily O
the O
best O
seafood B-TYPE
restaurant I-TYPE
to O
open O
in O
Manhattan B-LOC
since O
the O
Pool B-EST
, O
and O
easier O
to O
afford O
. O

Yes O
, O
a O
handful O
of O
items O
on O
the O
menu O
have O
that O
glassy O
- O
eyed O
stare O
, O
but O
almost O
everything O
else O
comes O
through O
. O

To O
get O
to O
the O
Fulton B-EST
, O
you O
have O
to O
walk O
almost O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
pier O
, O
where O
some O
tall O
planters O
cordon O
off O
the O
Fulton B-EST
's O
outdoor O
tables O
. O

All O
the O
tables O
, O
indoors O
and O
out O
, O
have O
a O
view O
of O
the O
Brooklyn B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
, O
but O
the O
best O
backdrops O
are O
inside O
and O
upstairs O
, O
where O
you O
can O
see O
that O
you O
're O
surrounded O
by O
water O
. O

Mentioning O
the O
view O
as O
a O
selling O
point O
will O
make O
some O
New O
Yorkers O
cringe O
. O

But O
Pier B-LOC
17 I-LOC
's O
developer O
, O
clearly O
hoping O
to O
erase O
the O
stigma O
, O
has O
recruited O
David O
Chang O
, O
Andrew O
Carmellini O
and O
Mr. O
Vongerichten O
. O

Day O
trippers O
and O
tourists O
will O
love O
the O
Fulton B-EST
, O
in O
any O
case O
, O
and O
they O
will O
be O
right O
. O

True O
, O
the O
outdoor O
patio O
feels O
like O
the O
beachside O
bar O
of O
some O
island O
resort O
, O
with O
soft O
- O
core O
club O
music O
playing O
and O
servers O
carrying O
too O
- O
small O
trays O
slinking O
around O
in O
long O
skirts O
. O

Once O
you O
get O
inside O
, O
though O
, O
the O
tension O
in O
the O
open O
kitchen O
lets O
you O
know O
this O
is O
, O
in O
fact O

Running O

gives O
Mr. O

an O
opening O
to O
lead O
with O
one O
of O
his O
strong O
suits O
, O
raw B-FOOD
fish I-FOOD
. O

The O
sea B-DISH
trout I-DISH
tartare I-DISH
is O
stirred O
with O
raw B-FOOD
oysters I-FOOD
and O
horseradish B-FOOD
, O
which O
creates O
the O
uncanny O
momentary O
illusion O
that O
you O
're O
eating O
beef B-FOOD
. O

White B-FOOD
ponzu I-FOOD
, O
made O
from O
white B-FOOD
soy I-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
, O
is O
the O
centerpiece O
of O
a O
platter O
of O
iced O
sashimi B-FOOD
. O

Local O
fluke B-FOOD
, O
taking O
a O
bath O
in O
habanero B-FOOD
vinaigrette I-FOOD
, O
is O
topped O
with O
mint B-FOOD
and O
Sichuan B-FOOD
buttons I-FOOD
; O
even O
if O
you O
know O
what O
's O
coming O
-- O
Sichuan B-FOOD
buttons I-FOOD
are O
the O
flower O
buds O
of O
the O
toothache O
plant O
, O
which O
when O
chewed O
, O
produce O
a O
numbing O
and O
cooling O
sensation O
-- O
the O
dish O
is O
a O
surprise O
. O

The O
Fulton B-EST
's O
Manhattan B-DISH
clam I-DISH
chowder I-DISH
is O
spicy O
, O
thick O
with O
potatoes B-FOOD
and O
a O
healthy O
portion O
of O
clams B-FOOD
. O

It O
's O
the O
rare O
version O
that O
tastes O
as O
good O
as O
it O
sounds O
, O
although O
purists O
will O
deduct O
one O
point O
for O
the O
absence O
of O
oyster B-FOOD
crackers I-FOOD
. O

There O
's O
a O
very O
intriguing O
sesame B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
poppy O
crust O
on O
the O
soft B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
shell O
crabs O
; O
you O
have O
just O
enough O
time O
to O
register O
the O
seeds B-FOOD
before O
a O
potent O
green O
salsa B-FOOD
of I-FOOD
coriander I-FOOD
and I-FOOD
jalapeno I-FOOD
kicks O
in O
. O

Few O
chefs O
are O
as O
skilled O
at O
using O
acidity O
, O
heat O
and O
salt O
to O
bring O
definition O
to O
a O
dish O
. O

So O
it O
's O
a O
surprise O
to O
realize O
how O
generic O
the O
Fulton B-EST
's O
fish B-DISH
stew I-DISH
is O
, O
or O
to O
wonder O
what O
the O
ingredient O
is O
that O
throws O
the O
red B-DISH
snapper I-DISH
ceviche I-DISH
in I-DISH
watermelon I-DISH
juice I-DISH
out O
of O
whack O
. O

A O
separate O
menu O
card O
lets O
you O
know O
that O
most O
of O
the O
seafood B-FOOD
in O
the O
main O
courses O
can O
be O
ordered O
" O
simply O
cooked O
. O
" O

I O
was O
never O
curious O
enough O
to O
try O
it O
, O
being O
too O
distracted O
by O
the O
salmon B-DISH
in I-DISH
a I-DISH
cumin I-DISH
- I-DISH
coriander I-DISH
seed O
crust O
so O
fragrant O
it O
turns O
heads O
; O
the O
sea B-DISH
bass I-DISH
and I-DISH
carrots I-DISH
in O
a O
life O
- O
affirming O
pool O
of O
lemon B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
turmeric O
sauce O
; O
and O
the O
detailed O
- O
oriented O
fish B-DISH
and I-DISH
crisps I-DISH
, O
a O
brick O
of O
flounder B-FOOD
kept O
at O
scalding O
temperature O
by O
a O
leakproof O
and O
supernaturally O
crunchy O
buckwheat B-FOOD
batter I-FOOD
. O

Served O
with O
mashed B-FOOD
fresh I-FOOD
peas I-FOOD
, O
it O
could O
almost O
pass O
for O
English B-CUISINE
if O
it O
did O
n't O
come O
with O
saffron B-FOOD
aioli I-FOOD
. O

Most O
distracting O
of O
all O
is O
the O
whole B-DISH
black I-DISH
bass I-DISH
baked O
inside O
a O
fish O
- O
shaped O
pastry B-FOOD
lavishly O
decorated O
with O
golden O
scales O
, O
fins O
, O
gills O
and O
other O
parts O
the O
bass O
itself O
wo O
n't O
be O
needing O
anymore O
. O

It O
takes O
a O
good O
10 O
minutes O
to O
unveil O
it O
, O
fillet O
it O
and O
then O
plate O
it O
together O
with O
slices O
of O
crust B-FOOD
, O
some O
tomato B-FOOD
concasse I-FOOD
and O
a O
sauce B-FOOD
choron I-FOOD
, O
and O
I O
doubt O
many O
movies O
playing O
in O
theaters O
now O
can O
rival O
it O
for O
entertainment O
. O

Wonderful O
as O
it O
is O
to O
see O
one O
of O
the O
showpieces O
of O
pre B-CUISINE
- O
nouvelle O
cuisine O
given O
so O
much O
attention O
, O
you O
could O
ask O
whether O
whole B-DISH
fish I-DISH
en I-DISH
croute I-DISH
really O
makes O
sense O
after O
, O
say O
, O
kale B-DISH
salad I-DISH
. O

Mr. O
Vongerichten O
's O
technical O
approach O
may O
let O
him O
generate O
a O
menu O
full O
of O
smart O
, O
reliably O
pleasurable O
food O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
guarantee O
that O
it O
will O
all O
hang O
together O
. O

The O
pastry O
menu O
does O
, O
though O
, O
by O
sneakily O
staying O
true O
to O
classic O
American B-CUISINE
desserts O
. O

What O

The O
region O
in O
question O
is O
Emilia B-LOC
- O
Romagna O
, O
whose O
refinements O
in O
the O
art O
of O
rolling O
and O
saucing O
noodles B-FOOD
are O
admired O
even O
by O
Italians O
from O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
country O
. O

Chances O
are O
that O
most O
of O
the O
five O
pastas B-FOOD
in O
the O
tasting O
are O
exactly O
the O
ones O
you O
picture O
when O
you O
think O
about O
Emilia B-LOC
- O
Romagna O
, O
starting O
with O
tortellini B-FOOD
in I-FOOD
brodo I-FOOD
. O

This O
would O
seem O
to O
make O
it O
an O
easy O
sell O
, O
and O
yet O
servers O
at O
Rezdora B-EST
never O
tried O
to O
sell O
me O
on O
the O
tasting O
. O

Until O
I O
asked O
about O
it O
one O
night O
, O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
the O
separate O
menu O
card O
that O
describes O
each O
course O
. O

With O
some O
hesitation O
, O
I O
ordered O
it O
. O

Every O
one O
of O
the O
pastas B-FOOD
was O
excellent O
, O
and O
one O
or O
two O
would O
be O
worth O
walking O
a O
long O
distance O
for O
. O

After O
the O
fifth O
course O
was O
gone O
, O
it O
slowly O
dawned O
on O
me O
that O
Stefano O
Secchi O
, O
Rezdora B-EST
's O
chef O
and O
one O
of O
its O
owners O
, O
had O
just O
laid O
down O
a O
straight O
flush O
. O

The O
tortellini B-FOOD
were O
penny O
- O
size O
hoops O
rolled O
around O
minced B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
blended I-FOOD
pork I-FOOD
in O
a O
parcel O
just O
big O
enough O
to O
suggest O
the O
idea O
of O
meat B-FOOD
. O

" O
This O
is O
a O
special O
broth B-FOOD
made O
from O
older O
chickens O
, O
" O
a O
server O
said O
as O
he O
poured O
a O
steaming O
liquid O
from O
a O
kettle O
over O
the O
tortellini B-FOOD
. O

It O
was O
the O
color O
of O
turkey B-FOOD
gravy I-FOOD
. O

The O
broth B-FOOD
spent O
about O
half O
a O
day O
on O
the O
burner O
; O
drew O
some O
of O
its O
power O
from O
melted B-FOOD
Parmigiano I-FOOD
- O
Reggiano O
; O
and O
was O
more O
intense O
than O
canned B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
broth I-FOOD
in O
roughly O
the O
same O
way O
that O
a O
dry B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
aged O
rib O
- O
eye O
is O
more O
intense O
than O
a O
McDonald B-FOOD
's I-FOOD
all I-FOOD
- O
beef O
patty O
. O

This O
was O
followed O
by O
a O
smooth O
, O
almost O
fluffy O
tomato B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
basil O
sauce O
over O
maccheroni B-FOOD
al I-FOOD
pettine I-FOOD
, O
delicate O
tubes O
with O
ridges O
they O
get O
from O
being O
rolled O
by O
hand O
along O
a O
comb O
made O
for O
the O
job O
. O

Three O
straw O
- O
colored O
blobs O
that O
looked O
like O
melted B-FOOD
Brie I-FOOD
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
glossy O
and O
wonderful O
fonduta B-FOOD
made O
from O
Parmigiano B-FOOD
- O
Reggiano O
. O

From O
there O
it O
was O
on O
to O
tortelloni B-FOOD
, O
each O
about O
three O
bites O
big O
, O
filled O
with O
plush O
fresh O
ricotta B-FOOD
and O
shiny O
with O
melted B-FOOD
brown I-FOOD
butter I-FOOD

which O
a O
few O

had O
been O
bubbled O

If O
we O
are O
talking O
about O
Emilia B-LOC
- O
Romagna O
we O
have O
to O
talk O
about O
ragu B-DISH
, O
and O
that O
was O
the O
next O
course O
, O
tossed O
with O
slim O
ribbons O
of O
tagliolini B-FOOD
. O

Some O
people O
will O
find O
the O
ragu B-DISH
saltier O
than O
they O
like O
. O

Almost O
everyone O
will O
find O
it O
more O
tender O
and O
smooth O
than O
the O
last O
20 O
or O
30 O
ragus B-FOOD
they O
ate O

They O
are O
served O
in O
something O
called O
crema B-FOOD
di I-FOOD
Parmigiano I-FOOD
; O
you O
will O
not O
be O
far O
off O
if O
you O
imagine O
an O
Alfredo B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
cooked O
for O
one O
of O
the O
more O
sybaritic O
Roman O
emperors O

This O
is O
not O
Rome B-LOC

the O

the O

Mr. O

to O
have O
rubbed O
off O

Mr. O

more O
than O
his O
experimental O
urges O

At O
Rezdora B-EST
, O
you O
are O
unlikely O
to O
catch O
the O

using O
any O

may O

If O
we O
are O
tracing O
influences O
, O
though O
, O
Mr. O
Secchi O
's O
cooking O
at O
Rezdora B-EST
seems O
to O
have O
been O
molded O
at O
least O
as O
deeply O
by O
his O
time O
working O
at O
the O
pasta B-FOOD
station O
of O
another O
restaurant O
in O
Modena B-LOC
, O
Hosteria B-EST
Giusti I-EST
. O

Laura O
Galli O
Morandi O
, O
Giusti B-EST
's O
chef O
, O
steadfastly O
defends O
the O
style O
of O
the O
local O
nonna O
tradition O
that O
Mr. O
Secchi O
channels O
in O
his O
pasta B-FOOD
tasting O
and O
other O
parts O
of O
his O
menu O
. O

Like O
a O
meal O
in O
Giusti B-EST

four O
- O
table O
dining O
room O
, O
one O
at O
Rezdora B-EST
can O
and O
probably O
should O
start O
with O

other O
manifestations O
of O
salted B-FOOD
pork I-FOOD
draped O
over O
warm O
pillows O
of O

dough I-FOOD
called O
gnocchi B-FOOD
fritti I-FOOD
. O

Before O
leaving O
Italy B-LOC
, O
Mr. O
Secchi O
also O
cooked O
at O
Antica B-EST
Moka I-EST
in O
Modena B-LOC
and O
All'Enoteca B-EST
in O
the O
Piedmont B-LOC
; O
after O
coming O
back O
home O
to O
Dallas B-LOC

where O
he O
grew O
up O
, O
he O
ran O
the O
kitchens O
of O
two O
restaurants O
his O
parents O
own O
there O
. O

Still O
, O
I O
suspect O
the O
Bottura O
connection O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
speed O
with O
which O
the O
bar O
stools O
fill O
up O
when O
the O
restaurant O
opens O
at O
5:30 O
each O
night O
, O
for O
the O
difficulty O
of O
reserving O
one O
of O
the O
other O
48 O
seats O
, O
and O
for O
the O
way O
would O
- O
be O
customers O
collect O
in O
eddies O
outside O
the O
door O
to O
strategize O
. O

Not O
much O
about O
the O
interior O
is O
likely O
to O
lure O
crowds O
; O
with O
its O
brick O
walls O
, O
timbered O
ceiling O
and O
bare O
wood O
tables O
, O
it O
looks O
like O
any O
number O
of O
Manhattan B-LOC
restaurants O
that O
emulate O
the O
trattorias B-TYPE
, O
enotecas B-TYPE
and O
osterias B-TYPE
of O
Italy B-LOC
. O

And O
of O
course O
, O
people O
who O
eat O
at O
Rezdora B-EST
have O
a O
way O
of O
becoming O
repeat O
customers O
. O

They O
come O
back O
even O
though O
it O
is O
still O
a O
young O
restaurant O
and O
occasionally O
makes O
a O
young O
restaurant O
's O
mistakes O
. O

One O
night O
, O
the O
stewed B-FOOD
cannellini I-FOOD
beans I-FOOD
placed O
alongside O
black B-FOOD
sea I-FOOD
bass I-FOOD
and O

garlic I-FOOD

the O
rock B-FOOD

could O
have O
been O
a O
little O
less O
tough O
and O
tasted O
a O
little O

. O

And O
some O
of O
the O
original O
pastas B-FOOD
are O
n't O
quite O
as O
stunning O
as O
the O
classics O
, O
but O
then O
every O
grandmother O

could O
have O
told O
you O
that O

Mr. O

still O
one O
of O
the O
most O
appealing O
new O
talents O
in O

to O
enter O

the O

In O
the O
fall O
of O
1980 O
, O
Patrick O
Clark O
, O
the O
first O
chef O
at O
Keith O
McNally O
's O
first O
restaurant O
, O
the O
Odeon B-EST
, O
helped O
introduce O
nouvelle B-CUISINE
cuisine O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
when O
it O
was O
all O
the O
rage O
in O
Europe B-LOC
. O

Nearly O
every O
place O
Mr. O
McNally O
has O
built O
since O
then O
has O
been O
a O
firm O
rejection O
of O
all O
that O
is O
fashionable O
in O

and O
each O
one O
has O
been O
, O
at O
least O
in O
its O
first O
few O
months O
, O
the O
most O
fashionable O
restaurant O
in O
town O

The O
one O
he O
opened O
in O
early O
June O
in O
the O
meatpacking B-LOC
district I-LOC
, O
Pastis B-EST
, O
was O
assembled O
partly O
from O
the O
salvaged O
bones O
of O
a O
nearby O

he O
closed O
five O
years O
ago O
, O
Pastis B-EST

( O

The O
onion B-FOOD
soup I-FOOD

the O
meaty O
snails B-FOOD
sloshing O
around O
in O
the O
divots O
of O

black O

with O
what O
must O

half O

and O
a O
few O
other O

horses O
from O
the O
original O
menu O
have O
been O
summoned O
for O
one O
more O
joust O
on O
the O
battlefield O
. O

In O
short O
, O
the O
new O
Pastis B-EST
takes O
almost O
everything O
straight O
from O
the O
old O
Pastis B-EST
, O
which O
in O
turn O
took O
almost O
everything O
from O
the O
stodgiest O
, O
least O
trend O
- O
conscious O
sort O
of O
French B-CUISINE
cafes B-TYPE
and O
brasseries B-TYPE
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
, O
reservations O
are O
harder O
to O
come O
by O
than O
at O
any O
other O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
restaurant O
that O
's O
opened O
this O
year O
. O

The O
paradox O
of O
this O
is O
that O
Pastis B-EST
is O
really O
meant O
for O
those O
nights O
when O
you O
decide O
to O
cancel O
your O
reservations O
at O
the O
little O
nine O

seat O
tasting O
counter O
where O
the O
menu O
is O
inspired O
by O
Kieslowski O
's O
" O
Decalogue O
. O
" O

It O
is O
for O
those O
times O
when O
you O
get O
an O
urge O
to O
eat O
a O
Gruyere B-DISH
omelet I-DISH
after O
10 O
p.m. O
, O
cooked O
medium O

rare O
, O
flecked O

skillfully O
rolled O
and O
staunchly O
backed O
up O
by O
a O
cold O
white O
from O
the O
Savoie B-LOC

Urges O
like O
that O
do O
not O
typically O
announce O
themselves O
three O
weeks O
in O
advance O
, O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
tend O
to O
survive O
exposure O
to O
rooms O
filled O
with O
people O
who O
have O
read O
about O
Pastis B-EST
on O
the O
blogs O
but O
have O
n't O
yet O
figured O
out O
what O
it O
is O
for O
. O

For O
much O
of O
his O
life O
, O
Mr. O
McNally O
has O
been O
chipping O
, O
cracking O
, O
distressing O
and O
weathering O
interiors O
that O
are O
the O
architectural O
equivalent O
of O
rumpled O

Perhaps O
the O
largest O
and O
certainly O
the O
most O
rumpled O
of O
all O
is O
Pastis B-EST
. O

It O
does O
n't O
have O
the O
corner O
entrance O
it O
had O
at O
its O
former O
address O
, O
or O
the O
long O
communal O
table O
that O
sliced O
through O
the O
front O
room O
like O
a O
surfboard O
. O

And O
the O
shelves O
of O
cigarette O
packs O
are O
definitely O
gone O
. O

( O
You O
could O
still O
smoke O
in O
restaurants O
in O
1999 O
, O
when O
Pastis B-EST
opened O
. O
) O

But O
the O
magazine O
racks O
are O
back O
, O
along O
with O
the O
overhead O
fans O
turning O
steadily O
below O
a O
stamped O
tin O
ceiling O
. O

Once O
again O
the O
walls O
are O
covered O
with O
chipped O
subway O
tiles O
, O
white O
, O
framed O
by O
black O
grout O
. O

The O
chairs O
still O
do O
n't O
match O
. O

The O
ambient O
light O
is O
the O
color O
of O
a O
Scotch B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
soda I-FOOD
and O
makes O
everybody O
look O
the O
way O
they O
do O
after O
you O
've O
drunk O
one O
. O

On O
an O
antique O
mirror O
, O
or O
one O
that O
looks O
like O
an O
antique O
, O
someone O
has O
scrawled O
a O
menu O
of O
desserts O
, O
almost O
none O
of O
which O
Pastis B-EST
actually O
serves O
. O

You O
can O
, O
however O
, O
get O
an O
energetically O
whisked O
dark B-DISH
- I-DISH
chocolate O
mousse O
under O
shaved O
curls O
of O
chocolate B-FOOD
, O
or O
a O
baba B-DISH
au I-DISH
rhum I-DISH
so O
drenched O
in O
booze B-FOOD
that O
it O
might O
spontaneously O
combust O
if O
it O
were O
n't O
being O
restrained O
by O
a O
white O
dune O
of O
whipped B-FOOD
Chantilly I-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
. O

The O
most O
significant O
change O
from O
the O
first O
Pastis B-EST
to O
the O
second O
happened O
offstage O
. O

Mr. O
McNally O
, O
who O
had O
a O
stroke O
two O
years O
ago O
, O
has O
brought O
on O
the O
restaurateur O
Stephen O
Starr O
as O
a O
partner O
who O
, O
essentially O
, O
manages O
everything O
except O
the O
design O
. O

Familiar O
faces O
from O
La B-EST
Mercerie I-EST
and O
other O
Starr O
enterprises O
work O
alongside O
loyal O
retainers O
from O
the O
McNally O
empire O
. O

The O
McNally O
troops O
are O
exquisitely O
poised O
, O
self O
- O
assured O
, O
able O
to O
spot O
a O
misplaced O
butter O
knife O
from O
across O
the O
street O
. O

The O
Starr O
cadre O
is O
more O
casual O
, O
and O
occasionally O
a O
server O
will O
ask O
your O
opinion O
of O
" O
the O
flavors O
so O
far O
, O
" O
a O
question O
that O
has O
surely O
never O
been O
uttered O
at O
Minetta B-EST
Tavern I-EST
. O

Mr. O
Starr O
has O
oversight O
of O
the O
wine O
list O
, O
which O
is O
less O
conservative O
than O
a O
typical O
McNally O
lineup O
, O
and O
of O
the O
food O
, O
which O
has O
not O
been O
a O
strong O
suit O
of O
the O
McNally O
organization O
since O
the O
chefs O
Lee O
Hanson O
and O
Riad O
Nasr O
went O
out O
on O
their O
own O
. O

Pastis B-EST
's O
chef O
, O
Michael O
Abt O
, O
was O
until O
recently O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
kitchen O
at O
the O
Washington B-LOC
restaurant O
Le B-EST
Diplomate I-EST
, O
which O
Mr. O
Starr O
owns O
. O

Better O
qualifications O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
conjure O
, O
given O
that O
Le B-EST
Diplomate I-EST
is O
essentially O
an O
imitation O
McNally O
restaurant O
. O

Taking O
his O
cues O
from O
the O
old O
days O
, O
Mr. O
Abt O
is O
putting O
out O
simple O
, O
unadorned O
, O
hunger O
- O
obliterating O
French B-CUISINE
cuisine O
drawn O
from O
the O
era O
before O
supermarkets O
and O
fast B-TYPE
food I-TYPE
. O

The O
salad B-DISH
of I-DISH
pickled I-DISH
herring I-DISH
and I-DISH
carrots I-DISH
with O
boiled B-FOOD
potatoes I-FOOD
might O
come O
straight O
from O
Brasserie B-EST
Lipp I-EST
. O

The O
country B-DISH
pate I-DISH
is O
laden O
with O
chicken B-FOOD
livers I-FOOD
and O
riddled O
with O
soft O
white O
pork B-FOOD
fat I-FOOD
in O
gobs O
the O
size O
of O
gumdrops B-FOOD
, O
although O
it O
could O
stand O
more O
salt B-FOOD
, O
and O
I O
'd O
be O
happy O
to O
trade O
the O
slab O
of O
butter B-FOOD
that O
comes O
with O
it O
for O
a O
pot O
of O
mustard B-FOOD
. O

The O
pate B-FOOD
is O
made O
in O
house O
, O
as O
is O
the O
gorgeously O
smooth O
boudin B-FOOD
blanc I-FOOD
. O

With O
the O
boudin B-FOOD
, O
you O
want O
pureed B-FOOD
potatoes I-FOOD
that O
are O
almost O
liquid O
. O

That O
is O
what O
you O
get O
. O

You O
might O
argue O
that O
, O
when O
it O
offers O
chilled B-FOOD
king I-FOOD
crab I-FOOD
legs I-FOOD
to O
be O
dipped O
in O
aioli B-FOOD
, O
this O
unextravagant O
cafe B-TYPE
breaks O
character O
. O

Does O
the O
same O
apply O
to O
garnishing O
sardines B-FOOD
served O
in O
the O
can O
with O
an O
ingot O
of O
prized O
, O
costly O
butter B-FOOD
made O
by O
Jean O
- O
Yves O
Bordier O
? O

Maybe O
. O

I O
thought O
, O
in O
any O
case O
, O
that O
the O
sardines B-FOOD
and O
the O
olive B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
they O
are O
packed O
in O
tended O
to O
talk O
over O
the O
butter B-FOOD
. O

The O
half B-FOOD
roast I-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
is O
not O
in O
the O
same O
class O
as O
the O
birds O
that O
Antoine O
Westermann O
cooked O
when O
he O
was O
still O
at O
Le B-EST
Coq I-EST
Rico I-EST
, O
but O
it O
is O
probably O
as O
good O
a O
roast B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
as O
any O
normal O
restaurant O
can O
produce O
. O

The O
duck B-DISH
in I-DISH
olives I-DISH
, O
though O
, O
is O
misconceived O
; O
the O
sauce B-FOOD
is O
thin O
, O
acrid O
and O
one O
- O
dimensional O
instead O
of O
head O
- O
spinningly O
rich O
, O
the O
way O
it O
is O
at O
Allard B-EST
in O
Paris B-LOC
. O

The O
seafood B-FOOD
-- O
the O
trout B-DISH
amandine I-DISH
with O
its O
sauteed O
skin O
taut O
beneath O
its O
armor O
of O
toasted B-FOOD
almonds I-FOOD
; O
steamed B-FOOD
mussels I-FOOD
in O
a O
lemon B-FOOD
broth I-FOOD
that O
's O
satiny O
with O
melted B-FOOD
butter I-FOOD
; O
an O
entire O
steamed B-FOOD
branzino I-FOOD
with O
enough O
crisp O
summer B-FOOD
vegetables I-FOOD
to O
make O
a O
salad B-FOOD
-- O
is O
very O
appealing O
, O
though O
that O
wo O
n't O
stop O
the O
people O
who O
are O
going O
to O
get O
steak B-DISH
frites I-DISH
without O
even O
a O
glance O
at O
the O
menu O
. O

Those O
people O
may O
get O
fries B-FOOD
that O
are O
crunchy O
and O
golden O
, O
or O
they O
might O
end O
up O
with O
a O
limp O
, O
oily O
batch O
, O
or O
they O
may O
get O
both O
in O
the O
same O
night O
, O
as O
I O
did O
. O

At O
the O
length O
of O
20 O
years O
, O
memories O
are O
untrustworthy O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
reasonably O
sure O
the O
food O
at O
Pastis B-EST
is O
better O
than O
it O
used O
to O
be O
. O

The O
wine B-FOOD
is O
certainly O
more O
interesting O
. O

What O
's O
gone O
, O
and O
wo O
n't O
be O
back O
now O
that O
the O
surrounding O
addresses O
have O
been O
taken O
over O
by O
shops O
like O
Loro O
Piana O
, O
Sephora O
, O
Hermes O
and O
RH O
, O
is O
the O
pure O
downtown O
electricity O
Pastis B-EST
once O
generated O
. O

Sharing O
real O
estate O
with O
meat O
cutters O
in O
blood O
- O
smeared O
aprons O
and O
prostitutes O
in O
dresses O
as O
tight O
as O
the O
skins O
on O
a O
boudin B-FOOD
blanc I-FOOD
, O
Pastis B-EST
did O
a O
drop O
- O
dead O
perfect O
imitation O
of O
the O
coolest O
restaurant O
in O
France B-LOC
. O

The O
French B-CUISINE
part O
was O
fake O
, O
but O
the O
cool O
was O
real O
. O

Lately O
I O
have O
fallen O
under O
the O
spell O
of O
an O
East B-LOC
Village I-LOC
restaurant O
called O
Foxface B-EST
. O

The O
cooking O
there O
is O
hard O
to O
pin O
down O
, O
geographically O
. O

Stopping O
in O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
, O
I O
ate O
Low B-DISH
Countryish I-DISH
wild I-DISH
red I-DISH
shrimp I-DISH
on I-DISH
grits I-DISH
, O
with O
sweet B-FOOD
corn I-FOOD
off I-FOOD
the I-FOOD
cob I-FOOD
and O
a O
potent O
saffron B-EST
- I-EST
lobster O
sauce O
. O

More O
recently O
, O
I O
had O
skinless O
pork B-FOOD
sausage I-FOOD
inspired O
by O
sai B-FOOD
ua I-FOOD
, O
the O
spicy O
and O
tangy O
specialty O
identified O
with O
the O
northern O
Thai O
city O
of O
Chiang B-LOC
Mai I-LOC
. O

The O
soft O
tripe B-FOOD
I O
enjoyed O
the O
other O
weekend O
had O
been O
simmered O
with O
' B-FOOD
nduja O
, O
the O
fiery O
and O
malleable O
Calabrian B-FOOD
sausage I-FOOD
, O
and O
then O
covered O
with O
a O
few O
thin O
shingles O
of O
shaved O
pecorino B-FOOD
. O

If O
I O
had O
started O
hanging O
around O
at O
Foxface B-EST
sooner O
, O
especially O
during O
the O
cold O
months O
after O
its O
opening O
, O
in O
February O
, O
I O
might O
have O
run O
into O
a O
wider O
variety O
of O
cuisines O
and O
main O
ingredients O
. O

I O
did O
manage O
to O
get O
some O
of O
the O
elk B-DISH
osso I-DISH
buco I-DISH
while O
that O
was O
still O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

I O
never O
got O
to O
try O
the O
wild B-FOOD
hare I-FOOD
, O
though O
, O
stewed O
in O
red B-FOOD
wine I-FOOD
with O
a O
bit O
of O
chocolate B-FOOD
and O
thickened O
with O
its O
own O
blood B-FOOD
, O
a O
formula O
that O
students O
of O
very O
old O
- O
guard O
French B-CUISINE
cooking O
will O
recognize O
as O
lievre B-FOOD
a I-FOOD
la I-FOOD
royale I-FOOD
. O

Nor O
did O
I O
make O
it O
in O
time O
for O
the O
venison B-FOOD
, O
left O
to O
bubble O
for O
hours O
in O
white B-FOOD
wine I-FOOD
with O
mushrooms B-FOOD
and O
dark O
juniper B-FOOD
berries I-FOOD
. O

The O
Foxface B-EST
dish O
I O
may O
never O
forgive O
myself O
for O
missing O
, O
though O
, O
is O
the O
kebabs B-DISH
served O
with O
preserved B-FOOD
lemons I-FOOD
and O
tahini B-FOOD
, O
because O
the O
kebabs B-DISH
were O
made O
from O
ground B-FOOD
lamb I-FOOD
and O
camel B-FOOD
. O

Although O
these O
foods O
may O
lack O
any O
unifying O
cultural O
background O
, O
they O
did O
have O
one O
thing O
in O
common O
: O
They O
were O
all O
served O
on O
rolls B-FOOD
. O

Apart O
from O
an O
occasional O
salad B-FOOD
or O
soup B-FOOD
, O
everything O
cooked O
at O
Foxface B-EST
arrives O
in O
sandwich B-FOOD
form O
. O

And O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
a O
muffuletta B-FOOD
that O
briefly O
manifested O
a O
few O
months O
back O
, O
every O
sandwich B-FOOD
at O
Foxface B-EST
is O
filled O
with O
hot O
, O
cooked O
meat B-FOOD
or O
seafood B-FOOD
or O
vegetables B-FOOD
. O

In O
Mexico B-LOC
, O
certain O
taco B-TYPE
stands I-TYPE
specialize O
in O
tacos B-DISH
de I-DISH
guisado I-DISH
, O
tortillas B-FOOD
filled O
with O
one O
kind O
of O
stew B-FOOD
or O
another O
. O

Most O
of O
Foxface B-EST
's O
offerings O
are O
, O
in O
effect O
, O
sandwiches B-DISH
de I-DISH
guisado I-DISH
. O

Which O
reminds O
me O
of O
another O
impressive O
Foxface B-EST
sandwich B-FOOD
, O
a O
magenta O
and O
green O
tangle O
of O
cilantro B-FOOD
stems I-FOOD
and O
pickled B-FOOD
onions I-FOOD
pressed O
into O
an O
engagingly O
tart O
pile O
of O
pork B-FOOD
, O
marinated O
in O
sour O
orange B-FOOD
juice I-FOOD
and O
roasted O
very O
slowly O
under O
a O
banana B-FOOD
leaf I-FOOD
in O
emulation O
of O
cochinita B-FOOD
pibil I-FOOD
from O
the O
Yucatan B-LOC
. O

There O
is O
no O
guarantee O
that O
any O
of O
these O
items O
will O
be O
available O
when O
you O
go O
to O
Foxface B-EST
. O

The O
menu O
is O
printed O
daily O
and O
taped O
up O
next O
to O
the O
window O
on O
St. B-LOC
Marks I-LOC
Place I-LOC
where O
most O
of O
the O
business O
is O
transacted O
. O

Sometimes O
a O
new O
sandwich B-FOOD
appears O
after O
the O
printed O
menu O
has O
already O
been O
posted O
, O
so O
it O
will O
be O
written O
out O
by O
hand O
on O
a O
card O
that O
has O
in O
its O
upper O
left O
corner O
the O

a O

elegant O

The O

The O
Smoking B-DISH

is O
sold O
every O
day O

It O
is O
filled O
with O
smoked B-FOOD
pork I-FOOD

Your O
mind O
, O
of O
course O
, O
goes O
either O
to O
Memphis B-LOC
or O
to O
the O
McRib B-DISH
, O
and O
neither O
is O
exactly O
wrong O
, O
but O
the O
meat B-FOOD
is O
of O
a O
superior O
grade O
and O
is O
smoked O
with O
the O
attention O
to O
timing O
and O
nuance O
that O
characterizes O
Foxface B-EST
's O
cooking O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
sandwich B-FOOD
. O

To O
place O
an O
order O
, O
you O
lean O
in O
to O
the O
window O
and O
speak O
with O
Sivan O
Lahat O
, O
who O
owns O
and O
runs O
Foxface B-EST
with O
Ori O
Kushnir O
, O
her O
partner O
in O
life O
and O
in O
sandwiches B-FOOD
. O

They O
immigrated O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
from O
Israel B-LOC
almost O
20 O
years O
ago O
and O
have O
lived O
here O
ever O
since O
, O
apart O
from O
a O
brief O
flirtation O
with O
the O
Midwest B-LOC
and O
a O
longer O
experimental O
period O
in O
Tokyo B-LOC
. O

While O
they O
were O
in O
Japan B-LOC
, O
they O
operated O
a O
pop B-TYPE
- I-TYPE
up O
restaurant O
, O
which O
is O
the O
closest O
either O
of O
them O
came O
to O
running O
a O
food O
business O
before O
opening O
Foxface B-EST
. O

Like O
the O
fox O
in O
the O
logo O
, O
Ms. O
Lahat O
has O
coppery O
hair O
and O
wears O
cat's O
- O
eye O
glasses O
. O

She O
prepares O
the O
orders O
in O
the O
room O
behind O
the O
window O
, O
which O
measures O
48 O
square O
feet O
. O

Inside O
the O
building O
, O
under O
the O
stairs O
, O
Foxface B-EST
has O
a O
second O
room O
. O

Mr. O
Kushnir O
thinks O
it O
could O
be O
as O
large O
as O
14 O
square O
feet O
. O

A O
variety O
of O
equipment O
is O
stowed O
in O
the O
two O
rooms O
, O
including O
three O
induction O
burners O
, O
a O
roaster O
, O
a O
smoker O
and O
a O
dishwasher O
. O

After O
business O
hours O
, O
some O
of O
it O
comes O
out O
as O
Mr. O
Kushnir O
supervises O
the O
more O
time O
- O
consuming O
roasts B-FOOD
and O
stews B-FOOD
. O

He O
describes O
the O
food O
that O
he O
and O
Ms. O
Lahat O
cook O
as O
" O
dishes O
we O
like O
to O
eat O
, O
reimagined O
as O
sandwiches B-FOOD
. O
" O

I O
like O
to O
eat O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
same O
dishes O
, O
as O
it O
happens O
, O
but O
they O
have O
been O
hard O
to O
come O
by O
lately O
, O
especially O
those O
shapeless O
brown O
stews B-FOOD
that O
are O
so O
out O
of O
style O
. O

Following O
some O
of O
the O
world O
's O
most O
influential O
chefs O
and O
shamed O
, O
perhaps O
, O
by O
the O
unflattering O
lenses O
of O
a O
million O
amateur O
photographers O
, O
restaurants O
have O
shifted O
away O
from O
plain O
and O
plain O
- O
looking O
cooking O
. O

The O
subtlety O
and O
the O
thrill O
of O
plain O
cooking O
comes O
from O
searing O
, O
simmering O
, O
reducing O
, O
skimming O
and O
so O
on O
. O

All O
the O
people O
who O
own O
Instant O
Pots O
know O
this O
, O
but O
the O
segment O
of O
the O
restaurant O
scene O
with O
artistic O
leanings O
has O
forgotten O
it O
, O
focusing O
instead O
on O
plating O
, O
arranging O
six O
or O
seven O
things O
in O
some O
photogenic O
design O
and O
hoping O
they O
will O
cohere O
. O

Slapping O
a O
roll B-FOOD
on O
it O
is O
one O
way O
to O
get O
a O
shapeless O
brown O
stew B-FOOD
ready O
for O
its O
close O
- O
up O
, O
although O
it O
has O
to O
be O
said O
that O
on O
the O

Because O
space O
is O
at O
a O
premium O
, O
there O
is O
no O
room O
to O
sit O
and O
eat O
your O
Smoking B-DISH

an O

The O

Most O
of O
the O

all O

The O
beer B-FOOD
is O
not O
expensive O

the O

Four O
summers O
ago O
, O
a O
young O
chef O
named O
Jose O
Luis O
Chavez O
began O
leveraging O
the O
poke B-FOOD
craze O
and O
the O
salad B-FOOD
- O
bowl O
trend O
into O
a O
string O
of O
fast B-TYPE
- O
casual O
ceviche B-FOOD
bars B-TYPE
. O

He O
began O
with O
a O
counter B-TYPE
in O
the O
Gansevoort B-LOC
Market I-LOC
food I-LOC
hall I-LOC
called O
Mission B-EST
Ceviche I-EST
; O
there O
is O
now O
another O
in O
Canal B-LOC
Street I-LOC
Market I-LOC
and O
a O
third O
is O
supposed O
to O
open O
in O
Norwalk B-LOC
, I-LOC
Conn. O
, O
later O
this O
year O
. O

At O
all O
locations O
, O
the O
stock O
- O
in O
- O
trade O
is O
citrus B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
marinated I-FOOD
raw O
fish O
with O
sweet B-FOOD
potatoes I-FOOD
and O
kernels O
of O
chubby O
Andean B-FOOD
corn I-FOOD
, O
in O
both O
its O
soft O
and O
crunchy O
forms O
. O

This O
is O
of O
course O
the O
standard O
Peruvian B-CUISINE
formula O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Chavez O
had O
the O
inspiration O
of O
serving O
his O
ceviche B-FOOD
in O
a O
clear O
plastic O
bowl O
over O
a O
base O
of O
salad B-FOOD
, O
rice B-FOOD
or O
, O
for O
a O
dollar O
more O
, O
quinoa B-FOOD
. O

The O
supplemental O
ingredients O
make O
a O
plausible O
desk O
lunch O
out O
of O
a O
dish O
that O
some O
New O
Yorkers O
still O
are O
n't O
quite O
sure O
what O
to O
do O
with O
. O

The O
surprising O
thing O
about O
Mission B-EST
Ceviche I-EST
's O
salad B-DISH
bowls I-DISH
is O
that O
they O
taste O
like O
real O
Peruvian B-CUISINE
food O
. O

The O
raw B-FOOD
fish I-FOOD
is O
firm O
and O
cold O
and O
neatly O
cut O
up O
into O
solid O
pieces O
that O
hold O
their O
shape O
. O

The O

tigre I-FOOD
marinade I-FOOD
in O
Mr. O
Chavez O
's O
" O
ceviche B-DISH
clasico I-DISH
" O
is O
a O
bright O
and O
precise O
cocktail O
of O
lime B-FOOD
and O
rocoto B-FOOD
chiles I-FOOD
, O
although O
you O
might O
wish O
that O
the O
rocotos B-FOOD
had O
been O
applied O
with O
a O
little O
less O
restraint O
. O

You O
get O
a O
higher O
- O
caliber O
shot O
of O
spice O
, O
this O
time O
from O
aji B-FOOD
amarillo I-FOOD
chiles I-FOOD
, O
in O
the O
ceviche B-DISH
mixto I-DISH
, O
a O
combination O
of O
octopus B-FOOD
, O

and O
fluke B-FOOD
enveloped O
in O
a O

, O
goldenrod O

The O
clasico B-DISH
is O
accessorized O
with O
sweet B-FOOD
potato I-FOOD
puree I-FOOD
; O
the O
mixto B-DISH
gets O
avocado B-FOOD
puree I-FOOD
, O
too O
. O

The O
purees B-FOOD
are O
piped O
out O
of O
pastry O
bags O
like O
buttercream B-FOOD
roses O
on O
a O
wedding B-FOOD
cake I-FOOD
, O
and O
they O
are O
delicious O
. O

When O
I O
wandered O
into O
the O
Gansevoort B-LOC
Market I-LOC
location O
in O
February O
, O
it O
seemed O
clear O
that O
Mr. O
Chavez O
could O
run O
an O
interesting O
restaurant O
if O
he O
ever O
decided O
to O
put O
his O
food O
into O
something O
other O
than O
recyclable O
salad O
bowls O
. O

Then O
, O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
summer O
, O
he O
did O
just O
that O
, O
opening O
a O
sit O
- O
down O
restaurant O
on O
the O
Upper B-LOC
East I-LOC
Side I-LOC
with O
real O
plates O
and O
bowls O
. O

The O
new O
space O
is O
not O
particularly O
large O
or O
lavish O
, O
but O
compared O
with O
the O
earlier O
efforts O
, O
Mission B-EST
Ceviche I-EST
Restaurant I-EST
& I-EST
Bar I-EST
is O
a O
palace O
. O

There O
is O
seating O
for O
65 O
or O
so O
people O
beneath O
a O
wall O
sculpture O
of O
a O
fish O
that O
glows O
from O
behind O
and O
a O
pink O
neon O
sign O
that O
reads O
" O
tiger O
milk O
effect O
, O
" O
probably O
a O
reference O
to O
the O
belief O
that O
drinking O
leftover O
leche B-FOOD
de I-FOOD
tigre I-FOOD
can O
put O
extra O
topspin O
on O
sexual O
performance O
. O

The O
menu O
now O
paints O
a O
slightly O
fuller O
picture O
of O
Peruvian B-CUISINE
cuisine O
, O
extending O
into O
new O
foods O
including O
the O
grilled B-FOOD
skewers I-FOOD
known O
as O
anticuchos B-DISH
. O

Mr. O
Chavez O
dresses O
up O
the O
country O

most O
popular O
anticucho B-DISH
, O
grilled B-DISH
beef I-DISH
heart I-DISH
, O
brushing O
it O
with O
a O
creamy O
rocoto B-FOOD

and O
serving O
it O
with O
newly O
fried B-FOOD
blue I-FOOD
potato I-FOOD
chips I-FOOD

kernels O
of O
choclo B-FOOD
corn I-FOOD
. O

The O
trio O
of O
rocoto B-FOOD
, O
blue B-FOOD
potatoes I-FOOD
and O
choclo B-FOOD
is O
so O
solidly O
Peruvian B-CUISINE
that O
it O
can O
withstand O
the O
chimichurri B-FOOD
that O
Mr. O
Chavez O
brings O
in O
, O
by O
way O
of O
Argentina B-LOC
, O
as O
a O
final O
touch O
. O

He O
clearly O
has O
a O
soft O
spot O
for O
chimichurri B-FOOD
because O
he O
deploys O
it O
again O
with O
the O
shrimp B-DISH
anticuchos I-DISH
( O
the O
shrimp B-FOOD
are O
very O
big O
and O
look O
even O
bigger O
because O
they O
're O
grilled O
with O
their O
heads O
on O
) O
, O
served O
with O
a O
squirt O
of O
huancaina B-FOOD
, O
the O
spicy B-FOOD
yellow I-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
that O
is O
something O
like O
Peru B-LOC
's O
version O
of O
queso B-FOOD
dip I-FOOD
. O

My O
favorite O
anticucho B-DISH
is O
a O
more O
straightforward O
situation O
, O
grilled B-FOOD
scallops I-FOOD
under O
arugula B-FOOD
, O
lime B-FOOD
zest I-FOOD
and O
a O
smooth O
Parmesan B-FOOD

. O

But O
Mr. O
Chavez O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
put O
several O
flavors O
in O
motion O
at O
once O
and O
keep O
his O
balance O
, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
the O
beef B-DISH
- I-DISH
heart O
skewer O
and O
his O
octopus B-DISH
causa I-DISH
. O

This O
is O
, O
reduced O
to O
bare O
bones O
, O
a O
tendril O
of O
octopus B-FOOD
curled O
around O
a O
disc O
of O
mashed B-FOOD
potatoes I-FOOD
. O

But O
the O
potatoes B-FOOD
, O
seasoned O
with O
lime B-FOOD
and O
yellow B-FOOD

, O
are O
coated O
in O
a O

the O

If O
you O
are O
being O
herded O
into O
getting O
the O
" O
Peruvian B-DISH
paella I-DISH
, O
" O
you O
should O
know O
that O
the O
other O
three O
main O
courses O
are O
also O
worth O
looking O
into O
, O
like O
the O
aji B-DISH

gallina I-DISH
, O
shredded B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
breast I-FOOD
in O
a O
creamy O
aji B-FOOD
amarillo I-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
that O
is O
both O
soothing O
and O
spicy O
; O
or O
the O
seco B-DISH
norteno I-DISH
, O
a O
slowly O
braised B-DISH
short I-DISH
rib I-DISH
in O
cilantro B-DISH
sauce I-DISH
. O

All O
are O
larger O
than O
average O
, O
too O
. O

Still O
, O
nothing O
on O
the O
menu O
quite O
rivals O
the O
ceviches B-FOOD
. O

They O
are O
served O
, O
yes O
, O
without O
lettuce B-FOOD
or O
rice B-FOOD
, O
and O
they O
are O
better O
for O
it O
. O

Mr. O
Chavez O
's O
creative O
engine O
seems O
to O
have O
a O
high O
idle O
, O
and O
he O
has O
come O
up O
with O
different O
ways O
to O
present O
dishes O
that O
are O
also O
on O
the O
menu O
at O
the O
fast B-TYPE
- I-TYPE
casual O
counters O
. O

The O
" B-DISH
Nikkei I-DISH
" O
ceviche O
, O
for O
instance O
-- O
tuna B-FOOD
in O
a O
kind O
of O
modified O
ponzu B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
seasoned O
with O
aji B-FOOD
amarilllo I-FOOD
and O
togarashi B-FOOD
-- O
now O
comes O
with O
watermelon B-FOOD
and O
a O
bloop O
of O
ginger B-FOOD
foam I-FOOD
that O
would O
never O
survive O
a O
trip O
from O
the O
food O
court O
back O
to O
the O
office O
. O

Neither O
would O
the O
odd O
but O
intriguing O
attempt O
at O
a O
vegetarian B-FOOD
ceviche I-FOOD
where O
the O
fish B-FOOD
is O
replaced O
by O
shiitakes B-FOOD
and O
the O
leche B-FOOD
de I-FOOD
tigre I-FOOD
takes O
the O
form O
of O
snow O
, O
frozen O
by O
liquid O
nitrogen O
. O

The O
art O
of O
ceviche B-FOOD
- O
making O
has O
at O
least O
as O
much O
in O
common O
with O
mixology O
as O
with O
cooking O
, O
so O
it O
is O
no O
surprise O
that O
the O
cocktails B-FOOD
are O
well O
calibrated O
and O
sing O
out O
with O
fresh O
lime B-FOOD
. O

There O
is O
a O
twist O
on O
the O
pisco B-DISH
sour I-DISH
made O
with O
passion B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
fruit O
juice O
and O
another O
with O
the O
purple B-DISH
- O
corn O
drink O
chicha B-DISH
morada I-DISH
, O
although O
neither O
quite O
achieves O
the O
bracing O
elegance O
of O
the O
original O
. O

And O
it O
's O
nice O
to O
see O
the O
less O
well O
- O
known O
chilcano B-DISH
, O
a O
pisco B-FOOD
highball O
made O
with O
lime B-FOOD
juice I-FOOD
and O
ginger B-FOOD
ale I-FOOD
. O

( O
Would O
ginger B-FOOD
beer I-FOOD
be O
better O
? O
) O

Chicha B-FOOD
morada I-FOOD
appears O
again O
in O
the O
raspadilla B-DISH
dessert O
. O

This O
time O
it O
is O
a O
syrup B-FOOD
poured O
over O
shaved B-FOOD
ice I-FOOD
and O
sprinkled O
with O
lucuma B-FOOD
foam I-FOOD
. O

When O
I O
had O
the O
raspadilla B-DISH
, O
it O
was O
sprinkled O
with O
candied B-FOOD
pecan I-FOOD
crumbs I-FOOD
but O
in O
a O
phone O
interview O
on O
Monday O
Mr. O
Chavez O
said O
he O
had O
replaced O
the O
nuts B-FOOD
with O
crumbled O
Oreos B-FOOD
. O

This O
, O
it O
hardly O
needs O
pointing O
out O
, O
was O
not O
exactly O
a O
staple O
in O
the O
diet O
of O
the O
Incas O
. O

" O
What O
can O
I O
say O
? O

he O
asked O

really O
like O

There O

In O
fact O

dim B-FOOD

the O

offers O
at O
Hutong B-EST

which O
opened O
in O
Midtown B-LOC

you O
would O
do O
well O
to O
make O
it O
a O
large O
portion O
of O
what O
you O
order O

because O
only O
one O

you O
find O

have O
the O

make O
Wagyu B-DISH

flaky O
layers O
of O

overlap O

by O
only O
a O
few O

like O
the O

Who O
can O
craft O

see O
it O
most O
clearly O
in O
the O
dim B-FOOD

much O
of O
the O

evinces O
the O
kind O

rarely O

hold O
their O
own O
against O

if O
you O
want O
to O
move O
beyond O

experience O
the O
complexity O

Chinese B-CUISINE

the O

" O
Ruth O

That O
is O
as O
true O
as O
it O
was O
21 O
years O

but O
what O
has O
changed O
is O
the O
rise O
of O

Chinese B-CUISINE

If O
Hutong B-EST
has O
another O
appetizer O
that O
equals O
it O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
found O
it O

I O
did O

however O
, O
have O
a O
cryptic O
encounter O
with O
a O
log O
- O
cabin O
stack O
of O
okra B-FOOD
doused O

wasabi I-FOOD

an O

rendezvous O

some O
steamed B-FOOD
asparagus I-FOOD
stalks I-FOOD
whose O
tips O
were O
enrobed O
in O
white B-FOOD
sesame I-FOOD

it O
was O
as O

had O
tried O
to O
replicate O
strawberries B-FOOD
dipped O
in O
white B-FOOD
chocolate I-FOOD
without O
access O
to O

white B-FOOD
chocolate I-FOOD

You O
could O
attempt O
to O
unknot O
these O
mysteries O

Then O
again O
, O
you O
could O
simply O
begin O
your O
meal O
with O
dim B-FOOD

And O
then O
, O
after O
picking O
your O
way O

the O

the O
soybeans B-FOOD
shortly O

for O
a O
place O
where O
we O
could O
be O
in O
the O
thick O
of O
it O
all O
. O

I O
thought O
of O
Bar B-EST
Pisellino I-EST
, O
that O
narrow O
glass O
sarcophagus O
run O
by O
Rita O
Sodi O
and O
Jody O
Williams O
, O
where O
you O
drink O
your O
sgroppino B-FOOD
standing O
up O
between O
the O
window O
along O
Grove B-LOC
Street I-LOC
and O
the O
one O
along O
Seventh B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
. O

People O
trickle O
in O
, O
eat O
some O
olives B-FOOD
and O
a O
tuna B-DISH
tramezzino I-DISH
, O
and O
head O
out O
again O
. O

Although O
it O
's O
about O
the O
size O
of O
a O
subway O
car O
, O
you O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
if O
you O
stayed O
long O
enough O
, O
you O
'd O
eventually O
see O
everybody O
you O
know O
. O

But O
a O
restaurant O
that O
truly O
speaks O
of O
the O
place O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
has O
become O
over O
the O
past O
decade O
or O
so O
would O
be O
nearly O
the O
opposite O
of O
Bar B-EST
Pisellino I-EST
. O

This O
restaurant O
would O
not O
be O
in O
the O
thick O
of O
it O
all O
. O

It O
would O
be O
hushed O
, O
sheltered O
, O
exclusive O
, O
admitting O
no O
more O
than O
a O
handful O
of O
people O
at O
a O
time O
. O

It O
would O
protect O
those O
people O
, O
once O
they O
were O
inside O
, O
from O
crowds O
spilling O
in O
from O
the O
street O
, O
even O
from O
the O
street O
itself O
. O

It O
would O
join O
the O
steady O
march O
of O
new O
tasting B-TYPE
counters I-TYPE
and O
omakase B-TYPE
hideaways I-TYPE
. O

And O
it O
would O
illustrate O
the O
growing O
ease O
with O
which O
New O
Yorkers O
of O
means O
can O
glide O
through O
and O
above O
the O
fray O
, O
slipping O
from O
one O
cloistered O
room O
to O
another O
in O
black O
cars O
without O
touching O
down O
. O

That O
restaurant O
would O
be O
a O
lot O
like O
Frevo B-EST
, O
which O
has O
been O
serving O
suave O
, O
$ O
124 O
tasting O
menus O
with O
a O
modern B-CUISINE
- O
French O
sensibility O
in O
Greenwich B-LOC
Village I-LOC
for O
the O
past O
four O
months O
. O

Frevo B-EST
is O
the O
work O
of O
Franco O
Sampogna O
, O
who O
is O
the O
chef O
, O
and O
Bernardo O
Silva O
, O
the O
manager O
. O

Mr. O
Sampogna O
is O
from O
Brazil B-LOC
and O
Mr. O
Silva O
comes O
from O
Portugal B-LOC
; O
they O
met O
10 O
years O
ago O
while O
working O
in O
restaurants O
in O
France B-LOC
, O
and O
quickly O
decided O
that O
one O
day O
they O
would O
open O
a O
restaurant O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
that O
would O
give O
diners O
" O
that O
feeling O
of O
being O
in O
your O
own O
secluded O
safe O
haven O
, O
" O
as O
Mr. O
Sampogna O
put O
it O
. O

To O
get O
into O
Frevo B-EST
, O
you O
first O
need O
to O
know O
that O
Frevo B-EST
exists O
. O

There O
's O
no O
sign O
. O

When O
you O
arrive O
at O
the O
correct O
address O
, O
what O
you O
see O
is O
an O
art O
gallery O
with O
just O
enough O
room O
on O
its O
white O
walls O
for O
the O
six O
abstract O
paintings O
that O
hang O
there O
fairly O
close O
together O
. O

The O
paintings O
are O
real O
paintings O
made O
by O
a O
real O
artist O
, O
Thomas O
Labarthe O
, O
who O
goes O
by O
Toma O
- O
L O
, O
but O
the O
gallery O
is O
not O
entirely O
a O
real O
gallery O
. O

If O
it O
were O
, O
the O
young O
woman O
who O
sits O
there O
keeping O
an O
eye O
on O
things O
would O
stare O
blankly O
ahead O
when O
you O
entered O
, O
instead O
of O
walking O
up O
to O
you O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
reassuring O
you O
that O
, O
yes O
, O
you O
've O
come O
to O
the O
right O
place O
. O

Then O
she O
reaches O
behind O
one O
of O
the O
canvases O
and O
it O
swings O
out O
on O
invisible O
hinges O
, O
leaving O
in O
its O
place O
a O
doorway O
through O
which O
you O
can O
see O
, O
illuminated O
in O
a O
large O
, O
dark O
room O
, O
a O
stainless O
- O
steel O
kitchen O
and O
a O
long O
, O
curving O
counter O
of O
polished O
quartzite O
. O

You O
hop O
up O
on O
one O
of O
the O
18 O
padded O
seats O
, O
and O
the O
door O
clicks O
closed O
. O

You O
are O
in O
. O

When O
the O
door O
opens O
again O
, O
typically O
not O
for O
another O
half O
an O
hour O
, O
in O
will O
walk O
another O
set O
of O
people O
who O
, O
like O
you O
, O
knew O
that O
the O
gallery O
was O
not O
a O
normal O
gallery O
. O

Let O
's O
say O
that O
the O
misdirection O
of O
the O
gallery O
and O
the O
secret O
door O
do O
not O
make O
these O
newcomers O
feel O
sufficiently O
insulated O
from O
the O
outside O
world O
. O

Frevo B-EST
gives O
them O
the O
opportunity O
to O
sit O
at O
a O
round O
chef O
's O
table O
in O
a O
back O
corner O
around O
which O
a O
curtain O
can O
be O
drawn O
, O
as O
in O
a O
hospital O
room O
. O

Much O
of O
this O
comes O
right O
out O
of O
the O
neo B-TYPE
- O
speakeasy O
handbook O
, O
although O
Frevo B-EST
does O
throw O
itself O
into O
the O
act O
with O
an O
unusual O
level O
of O
commitment O
. O

The O
gallery O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
installed O
a O
new O
batch O
of O
Mr. O
Labarthe O
's O
canvases O
around O
Labor O
Day O
. O

But O
each O
time O
I O
went O
to O
Frevo B-EST
, O
I O
stared O
at O
that O
curtain O
. O

Nobody O
ever O
closed O
it O
while O
I O
was O
there O
, O
but O
it O
still O
reminded O
me O
how O
easy O
it O
is O
now O
for O
some O
New O
Yorkers O
to O
climb O
into O
the O
treehouse O
and O
pull O
the O
ladder O
up O
behind O
them O
. O

I O
have O
to O
admit O
, O
though O
, O
that O
I O
like O
Frevo B-EST
more O
than O
I O
like O
the O
version O
of O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
that O
it O
brings O
to O
mind O
. O

The O
pleasures O
of O
this O
secluded O
safe O
haven O
are O
real O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Sampogna O
's O
cooking O
is O
focused O
and O
refined O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
been O
able O
to O
get O
his O
halibut B-DISH
dish O
out O
of O
my O
mind O
, O
for O
instance O
. O

The O
fish B-FOOD
rests O
on O
a O
thin O
, O
crisp O
platform O
of O
fried B-FOOD
bread I-FOOD
shellacked O
with O
a O
dark O
mushroom B-FOOD
marmalade I-FOOD
; O
this O
miniature O
mushroom B-FOOD
tart I-FOOD
drinks O
up O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
halibut B-FOOD
as O
it O
goes O
, O
in O
the O
oven O
, O
from O
raw O
to O
that O
just O
- O
cooked O
state O
where O
its O
flesh O
slides O
apart O
into O
thick O
and O
almost O
fluffy O
white O
flakes O
. O

Alongside O
the O
fish B-FOOD
are O
bulbs O
of O
melted B-FOOD
fennel I-FOOD
, O
their O
spiced O
cooking O
juices O
boiled O
down O
to O
a O
bittersweet O
syrup B-FOOD
. O

Mr. O
Sampogna O
's O
opening O
salvo O
often O
involves O
quinoa B-FOOD
doing O
something O
quinoa B-FOOD
does O
n't O
usually O
do O
, O
and O
doing O
it O
quite O
nicely O
. O

I O
liked O
its O
freshness O
when O
it O
was O
used O
in O
a O
salad B-FOOD
spooned O
over O
a O
demitasse O
of O
creamy O
hummus B-FOOD
; O
I O
liked O
its O
crunch O
when O
it O
was O
dehydrated O
and O
sprinkled O
over O
a O
few O
mouthfuls O
of O
black B-FOOD
lentils I-FOOD
topped O
with O
glistening O
orbs O
of O
smoked B-FOOD
trout I-FOOD
roe I-FOOD
. O

A O
dish O
from O
early O
July O
brought O
peas B-FOOD
, O
at O
the O
tail O
end O
of O
their O
season O
, O
together O
with O
a O
rich O
pistachio B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
tarragon O
cream O
and O
white O
puffs O
of O
coconut B-FOOD
mousse I-FOOD
: O
light O
and O
charming O
. O

I O
wished O
Mr. O
Sampogna O
had O
exploited O
summer O
produce O
as O
sensitively O
when O
I O
went O
back O
in O
August O
and O
September O
. O

His O
kitchen O
is O
small O
enough O
that O
he O
could O
respond O
to O
the O
market O
day O
by O
day O
, O
but O
so O
far O
this O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
interest O
him O
. O

Frevo B-EST
, O
at O
$ O
124 O
for O
five O
courses O
, O
is O
not O
a O
huge O
splurge O
by O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
standards O
, O
but O
servers O
try O
to O
inflate O
the O
total O
by O
pushing O
supplements O
. O

For O
$ O

you O
can O
get O
Kaluga B-FOOD
caviar I-FOOD
troweled O
on O
to O
your O
first O
course O
; O
$ O

gets O
you O
upgraded O
to O
a O
foie B-DISH
gras I-DISH
torchon I-DISH
instead O
of O
the O
less O

thrilling O
mushrooms B-DISH
with I-DISH

; O
it O

, O
and O
another O
$ O

to O
have O
white B-FOOD

with O
the O

. O

This O
tactic O
is O
not O
as O
grating O
as O
it O
is O
at O
Per B-EST

, O
where O
the O
supplements O
are O
piled O
onto O
a O
base O
charge O
of O
$ O
355 O
, O
but O
it O
is O
still O
a O
snag O
in O
the O
otherwise O
smooth O
hospitality O
provided O
by O
Frevo B-EST
's O
small O
crew O
of O
servers O
and O
cooks O
. O

Everyone O
I O
've O
brought O
to O
Frevo B-EST
has O
fallen O
under O
its O
spell O
, O
which O
is O
hard O
to O
resist O
. O

The O
music O
is O
slinky O
and O
sinuous O
. O

The O
room O
has O
a O
nocturnal O
theatricality O
; O
sitting O
at O
the O
counter O
with O
darkness O
behind O
you O
facing O
the O
spotlighted O
kitchen O
can O
feel O
like O
attending O
an O
extremely O
elegant O
campfire O
. O

I O
still O
think O
Frevo B-EST
is O
a O
perfect O
spot O
to O
familiarize O
yourself O
with O
the O
frictionless O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
of O
2019 O
. O

Still O
, O
when O
my O
out O

of O

arrived O
, O
we O
had O
our O
dinner O
at O

We O
were O
hungry O
for O
a O

Billy O
Durney O
, O
the O
Brooklyn B-LOC
restaurateur O
and O
pitmaster O
, O
has O
been O
talking O
for O
several O
years O
about O
the O
fried B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
that O
he O
planned O
to O
bring O
to O
Red B-EST
Hook I-EST
. O

At O
first O
, O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
to O
doubt O
him O
. O

That O
the O
man O
is O
comfortable O
with O
long O
time O
horizons O
was O
clear O
to O
anyone O
who O
watched O
how O
patiently O
he O
studied O
the O
science O
of O
indirect O
heat O
at O
his O
first O
establishment O
in O
the O

Hometown B-EST

After O
Hurricane O

flooded O

and O
knocked O
out O
power O
in O
the O
area O
shortly O
before O
the O
scheduled O
opening O
in O
2012 O
, O
he O
gave O
away O
smoked B-FOOD
briskets I-FOOD
, O
ribs B-FOOD
and O
shoulders B-FOOD
to O
local O
residents O
until O
electricity O
was O
restored O
almost O
three O

all O
the O

The O

rolled O
by O
without O
a O

But O
as O
recently O
as O
March O
, O
it O
was O
still O
possible O
to O
take O
Mr. O
Durney O
at O
his O
word O
when O
he O
talked O
about O
the O
star O
attraction O
of O
his O
nearly O
completed O
fried B-FOOD
- O
chicken O
emporium B-TYPE

to O
be O

The O

how O

What O
was O
something O
of O

surprise O
, O
though O

was O
that O

were O
not O

anywhere O

fact O
, O
Red B-EST

To O
be O
fair O
, O
Mr. O
Durney O
probably O
would O
not O
have O
drummed O
up O
much O
enthusiasm O
had O
he O
gone O
around O
telling O
people O
he O
was O
going O
to O
open O
a O

that O
served O

New B-LOC
York I-LOC
has O
so O
many O
of O
those O
already O
that O
the O

they O

is O
a O
recognized O
subgenre O
that O
George O

calls O
" O
the B-DISH
New I-DISH

" O

According O
to O
Mr. O
Motz O
, O
a O
filmmaker O
and O
author O
whose O
work O
explores O
all O
things O
ground B-FOOD
- O
beef O

, O
the O
hallmarks O
of O
a O

are O
a O
thicker O
- O
than O
- O
average O
patty B-FOOD
and O
a O
relative O
lack O

It O

Mr. O

has O
said O
that O
he O
intends O
the O
Red B-DISH

as O
a O
homage O
to O
the O
one O
at O
Peter B-EST

( O
You O
might O
think O
that O
Luger B-EST
traffics O
in O
the O
style O
known O
as O
the O
steakhouse B-DISH
burger I-DISH
, O
but O
most O
burger B-FOOD
taxonomists O
agree O
that O
what O
it O
serves O

only O
at O
the O

only O
at O
lunch O
, O
is O
a O
pub B-DISH

) O

Like O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST

Red B-EST

crust O
that O
fills O
your O
head O
with O
the O
instinct O
- O
triggering O
aromas O
and O
flavors O
whose O
creation O
in O
browned B-FOOD
meat I-FOOD
was O
described O
by O
Louis O
Camille O
Maillard O
. O

There O
are O
some O
minor O
divergences O
. O

At O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
, O
cheese B-FOOD
is O
optional O
, O
while O
the O
top O
and O
sides O
of O
the O
burger B-FOOD
at O
Red B-EST
Hook I-EST
Tavern I-EST
are O
tightly O
wrapped O
in O
glossy O
yellow O
American B-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
by O
default O
. O

A O
thick O
cross O
- O
section O
of O
white B-FOOD
onion I-FOOD
is O
laid O
below O
the O
top O
bun B-FOOD
at O
Luger B-EST
. O

At O
Red B-EST
Hook I-EST
Tavern I-EST
, O
the O
onion B-FOOD
is O
stationed O
below O
the O
patty B-FOOD
, O
where O
it O
helps O
keep O
the O
bottom O
bun B-FOOD
dry O
, O
like O
a O
coaster O
. O

They O
give O
you O
a O
half B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
sour I-FOOD
pickle O
spear O
and O
fries B-FOOD
, O
too O
, O
which O
are O
about O
the O
same O
dimensions O
. O

The O
important O
difference O
between O
the O
burgers B-FOOD
, O
though O
, O
is O
that O
lately O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
's O
have O
tended O
to O
be O
better O
in O
memory O
than O
in O
reality O
, O
while O
the O
Red B-EST
Hook I-EST
Tavern I-EST
's O
is O
, O
right O
now O
, O
one O
of O
the O
few O
absolutely O
mandatory O
burgers B-FOOD
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
. O

The O
kitchen O
is O
overseen O
by O
Allison O
Plumer O
, O
a O
chef O
who O
has O
done O
most O
of O
her O
cooking O
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
. O

She O
has O
an O
excellent O
dry B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
aged O
steak O
-- O
New B-FOOD
York I-FOOD
strip I-FOOD
, O
naturally O
-- O
impressively O
browned O
and O
served O
with O
a O
small O
cast O
- O
iron O
skillet O
full O
of O
creamed B-FOOD
spinach I-FOOD
, O
a O
touch O
so O
right O
it O
may O
qualify O
as O
art O
. O

It O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
detail O
that O
makes O
Red B-EST
Hook I-EST
Tavern I-EST
something O
more O
than O
a O
place O
for O
the O
locals O
to O
get O
beer B-FOOD
and O
burgers B-FOOD
. O

Another O
is O
the O
golden B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
gravy I-FOOD
with O
a O
hint O
of O
butterscotch B-FOOD
that O
is O
ladled O
into O
a O
well O
in O
the O
mashed B-FOOD
potatoes I-FOOD
that O
come O
with O
the O
half B-FOOD
- O
chicken O
, O
which O
is O
advertised O
as O
simply O
pan O
- O
roasted O
, O
although O
it O
has O
the O
wonderfully O
stiff O
shards O
of O
skin O
you O
get O
from O
weighting O
down O
the O
bird O
as O
it O
cooks O
. O

Everybody O
who O
has O
eaten O
at O
Red B-EST
Hook I-EST
Tavern I-EST
will O
tell O
you O
to O
get O
the O
country B-DISH
- I-DISH
ham O
- O
and O
- O
Cheddar O
croquettes O
on O
a O
creamy O
pool O
of O
whole B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
grain O
Dijonnaise O
. O

Everybody O
is O
right O
, O
too O
. O

Consensus O
has O
also O
formed O
around O
the O
wedge B-DISH
salad I-DISH
, O
which O
is O
clearly O
not O
a O
wedge O
, O
but O
is O
still O
a O
very O
fine O
salad B-FOOD
, O
with O
blue B-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
and O
a O
thick O
, O
Lugeresque B-EST
bacon B-FOOD
slice O
flopped O
over O
individual O
leaves O
of O
romaine B-FOOD
. O

There O
is O
considerably O
less O
unanimity O
about O
the O
roasted B-FOOD
corn I-FOOD
, O
kernels O
of O
which O
you O
are O
supposed O
to O
wrap O
in O
radicchio B-FOOD
that O
you O
've O
first O
smeared O
with O
' B-FOOD
nduja O
; O
I O
'm O
in O
the O
camp O
that O
thinks O
it O
would O
be O
a O
fine O
dish O
for O
another O
restaurant O
. O

There O
is O
no O
restaurant O
where O
I O
'd O
be O
glad O
to O
see O
littlenecks B-FOOD
steamed O
with O
way O
too O
much O
stale O
, O
acrid O
garlic B-FOOD
. O

Of O
course O
, O
there O
's O
no O
correct O
amount O
of O
stale O
, O
acrid O
garlic B-FOOD
, O
but O
the O
kitchen O
really O
goes O
all O
in O
. O

There O
are O
two O
desserts O
. O

Both O
are O
sundaes B-FOOD
. O

They O
do O
not O
have O
the O
thematic O
inevitability O
of O
the O
creamed B-FOOD
spinach I-FOOD
, O
but O
they O
're O
put O
together O
with O
more O
sophistication O
than O
average O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
though O
, O
that O
nothing O
on O
the O
menu O
gives O
the O
burger B-FOOD
a O
real O
run O
for O
its O
money O
. O

What O
does O
, O
or O
at O
least O
equals O
it O
as O
a O
reason O
to O
reserve O
a O
table O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
in O
advance O
, O
is O
the O
list O
of O
drinks O
Mr. O
Durney O
has O
put O
together O
with O
Jeff O
Porter O
and O
Kenneth O
Crum O
. O

Mr. O
Durney O
's O
enthusiasm O
for O
wines B-FOOD
made O
by O
small O
, O
eccentric O
producers O
is O
on O
view O
at O
Hometown B-EST
, O
surely O
the O
only O
place O
on O
earth O
where O
you O
can O
drink O

For O
a O
long O
time O
, O
the O
seriousness O
of O
a O
pizzeria B-TYPE
could O
be O
gauged O
by O
a O
simple O
yes O
- O
or O
- O
no O
question O
: O
Did O
it O
sell O
pizza B-FOOD
by O
the O
slice O
? O

The O
ones O
that O
cared O
the O
most O
about O
upholding O
traditions O
, O
maintaining O
quality O
and O
so O
on O
-- O
like O
Totonno B-EST
's O
, O
John B-EST
's I-EST
of I-EST
Bleecker I-EST
Street O
, O
Keste B-EST
, O
Lucali B-EST
, O
Una B-EST
Pizza I-EST
Napoletana I-EST
-- O
emphatically O
did O
not O
. O

Today O
, O
we O
live O
in O
the O
era O
of O
the O
elevated O
slice B-TYPE
joint I-TYPE
. O

Some O
of O
them O
, O
like O
Scarr B-EST
's O
, O
grind O
wheat B-FOOD
berries I-FOOD
into O
new O
flour B-FOOD
every O
day O
. O

Many O
use O
minuscule O
quantities O
of O
yeast B-FOOD
; O
others O
abandon O
commercial O
yeast B-FOOD
altogether O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
natural O
leavening O
in O
sourdough B-FOOD
starters I-FOOD
. O

There O
are O
slice B-TYPE
joints I-TYPE
that O
ferment O
their O
dough B-FOOD
for O
a O
day O
, O
some O
that O
let O
it O
bubble O
away O
for O
two O
days O
and O
a O
few O
that O
go O
in O
for O
three O
days O
. O

A O
new O
example O
of O
the O
breed O
, O
F&F B-EST
Pizzeria I-EST
, O
opened O
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
last O
week O
with O
the O
help O
of O
a O
baker O
whose O
starter B-FOOD
dough I-FOOD
has O
traveled O
internationally O
and O
another O
baker O
who O
has O
decades O
of O
experience O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
pizza O
paddle O
. O

Among O
themselves O
, O
these O
new O
- O
school O
pizza B-FOOD
makers O
speak O
of O
hydration O
levels O
, O
fermentation O
periods O
and O
digestibility O
. O

Many O
of O
these O
slice O
masters O
are O
chasing O
an O
ideal O
version O
of O
the O
foldable O
, O
portable O
triangle O
sold O
across O
linoleum O
counters O
in O
all O
five O
boroughs O
, O
a O
search O
suffused O
with O
nostalgia O
for O
an O
era O
before O
processed O
cheese B-FOOD
, O
sweetened O
sauce B-FOOD
and O
wholesale O
dough B-FOOD
. O

Others O
are O
celebrated O
for O
achievements O
in O
the O
square O
slice O
, O
a O
descendant O
of O
the O
Sicilian B-CUISINE
, O
with O
an O
airier O
, O
less O
doughy O
crust B-FOOD
; O
leaders O
in O
this O
style O
include O
Corner B-EST
Slice I-EST
and O
Mama B-EST
's I-EST
Too O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
smallest O
group O
of O
all O
are O
the O
bakers O
who O
turn O
their O
eyes O
toward O
Rome B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
slices O
are O
rectangular O
and O
are O
known O
as O
pizza B-DISH
al I-DISH
taglio I-DISH
. O

They O
resemble O
focaccia B-FOOD
more O
than O
a O
$ O
3 O
slice O
from O
Ray B-EST
's O
, O
and O
it O
's O
doubtful O
that O
the O
practitioners O
of O
this O
style O
even O
think O
of O
themselves O
as O
belonging O
to O
the O
elevated O
- O
slice O
movement O
. O

But O
I O
'd O
argue O
that O
they O
do O
belong O
to O
it O
, O
and O
that O
some O
of O
the O
most O
elevated O
slices O
in O
the O
area O
at O
the O
moment O
are O
the O
Roman B-CUISINE
- O
style O
ones O
that O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
sells O
inside O
its O
bakery B-TYPE
and O
restaurant O
on O
Palisade B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
, O
up O
in O
the O
Jersey B-LOC
City I-LOC
Heights I-LOC
. O

At O
any O
given O
time O
, O
three O
to O
six O
pizzas B-FOOD
sit O
on O
the O
counter O
. O

They O
are O
oblong O
and O
, O
because O
they O
are O
baked O
without O
a O
pan O
to O
shape O
the O
dough B-FOOD
, O
they O
have O
rounded O
corners O
, O
like O
a O
horse O
track O
. O

The O
crust B-FOOD
is O
noticeably O
lightweight O
when O
you O
pick O
it O
up O
, O
an O
impression O
that O
is O
confirmed O
by O
the O
mouth O
and O
, O
later O
, O
the O
stomach O
. O

The O
interior O
is O
honeycombed O
with O
air O
pockets O
. O

The O
underside O
of O
each O
slice O
is O
strong O
enough O
to O
carry O
a O
relatively O
heavy O
load O
of O
toppings O
without O
bending O
or O
collapsing O
. O

This O
structural O
soundness O
is O
key O
to O
the O
pleasure O
. O

The O
toppings O
on O
a O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
slice O
are O
not O
decorations O
or O
seasonings O
, O
as O
they O
often O
are O
on O
round O
pizza B-FOOD
. O

Each O
one O
is O
the O
point O
of O
its O
slice O
: O
a O
mix O
of O
fresh O
mushrooms B-FOOD
with O
pepper B-FOOD
, O
parsley B-FOOD
and O
flecks O
of O
grated O
Parmigiano B-FOOD

Reggiano O

zucchini B-FOOD
shaved O
into O
fine O
threads O
and O
showered O
at O
the O
last O
minute O
with O
mint B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
; O
slices O
of O
late O
- O
summer O
red B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
yellow I-FOOD
peppers I-FOOD
picked O
while O
they O
still O
had O
few O
faintly O
bitter O
streaks O
of O
green O
reaching O
up O
their O
sides O
; O
a O
rough O
, O
dark O
pesto B-FOOD
spooned O
around O
cherry B-FOOD
tomatoes I-FOOD
that O
were O
roasted O
until O
their O
skins O
turned O
black O
and O
pulled O
away O
from O
the O
globes O
of O
pulp O
inside O
; O
Concord B-FOOD
grapes I-FOOD
that O
blotch O
the O
dough B-FOOD
with O
purple O
like O
exploded O
jelly B-FOOD
grenades O
. O

A O
chef O
's O
hand O
is O
at O
work O
here O
, O
tossing O
black B-FOOD
pepper I-FOOD
and O
rosemary B-FOOD
over O
the O

adding O

and O
hammering O

The O
hand O
belongs O
to O
Rick O
Easton O
, O
who O
oversees O
the O
pizzas B-FOOD
and O
the O
nonpizzas O
and O
owns O
the O
restaurant O

He O
also O
owned O
its O
predecessor O
, O
the O
Bread B-EST

Salt I-EST
that O
operated O
in O
Pittsburgh B-LOC
for O
all O
of O
2015 O
plus O
a O
few O
weeks O
on O
either O
side O
. O

For O
a O
short O
- O
lived O
place O
, O
it O
got O
a O
lot O
of O
media O
attention O
, O
luring O
restaurant O
hunters O
and O
recipe O
gatherers O
from O
across O
the O
country O
. O

By O
the O
start O
of O
2016 O
, O
he O
had O
decided O
to O
move O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
. O

When O
his O
first O
job O
fell O
through O
, O
he O
began O
shopping O
for O
a O
location O
for O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
. O

The O
real O
estate O
market O
had O
ideas O
of O
its O
own O
, O
as O
it O
often O
does O
, O
which O
is O
how O
the O
incarnation O
of O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
that O
Mr. O
Easton O
opened O
early O
this O
summer O
wound O
up O
in O
New B-LOC
Jersey I-LOC
. O

In O
addition O
to O
cheaper O
rents O
, O
Jersey B-LOC
City I-LOC
has O
ordinances O
that O
allow O
customers O
to O
show O
up O
with O
bottles O
of O
wine B-FOOD
or O
beer B-FOOD
and O
drink O
them O
, O
a O
handy O
policy O
because O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
's O
beverage O
list O
has O
nothing O
more O
potent O
than O
Italian B-FOOD
sodas I-FOOD

Each O

at O

as O
many O
things O
that O
are O
not O
pizza B-FOOD
as O
things O
that O
are O

Generally O
these O

are O
modest O
in O
size O
and O

meatballs B-DISH
almost O
always O
are O
, O
and O
they O
are O
wonderful O
, O
made O
with O
enough O
bread B-FOOD
that O
they O
are O
extremely O
tender O
in O
a O
bright O
marinara B-FOOD
. O

Another O
reliable O
find O
is O
a O
sandwich B-FOOD
of O
some O
kind O
, O
made O
with O
plain O
, O
untopped O
pizza B-FOOD
. O

Twice O
I O
've O
had O
a O
warm O
mortadella B-DISH
sandwich I-DISH
there O
, O
and O
both O
times O
I O
was O
convinced O
there O
was O
no O
way O
to O
improve O
on O
it O
. O

One O
dish O
was O
denoted O
on O
the O
menu O
by O
a O
single O
word O
: O
beans B-DISH
. O

I O
've O
thought O
of O
it O
nearly O
every O
day O
since O
, O
partly O
because O
the O
beans B-FOOD
-- O
scarlet B-FOOD
runners I-FOOD
-- O
were O
perfectly O
intact O
but O
perfectly O
tender O
; O
partly O
because O
of O
the O
brooding O
depth O
they O
took O
on O
from O
being O
finished O
with O
sweet B-FOOD
red I-FOOD
peppers I-FOOD
that O
the O
kitchen O
dried O
and O
fried O
, O
an O
ingredient O
the O
Italians O
call O
peperoni B-FOOD
cruschi I-FOOD
; O
and O
partly O
because O
their O
broth B-FOOD
tasted O
so O
good O
when O
given O
a O
chance O
to O
soak O
into O
the O
slice O
of O
thick O
- O
crusted O
sourdough B-FOOD
bread I-FOOD
that O
came O
on O
top O
. O

That O
bread B-FOOD
is O
Mr. O
Easton O
's O
, O
too O
. O

It O
comes O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
, O
and O
it O
is O
excellent O
. O

Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
is O
still O
settling O
into O
New B-LOC
Jersey I-LOC
. O

Some O
ingredients O
may O
be O
better O
when O
Mr. O
Easton O
has O
had O
time O
to O
infiltrate O
the O
local O
farm O
scene O
. O

In O
August O
, O
when O
the O
state O
was O
rolling O
in O
juicy O
peaches B-FOOD
, O
he O
was O
serving O
crunchy O
unripe O
ones O
in O
red B-FOOD
wine I-FOOD
for O
dessert O
. O

There O
was O
also O
a O
very O
strange O
cantaloupe B-DISH
pudding I-DISH
. O

By O
September O
things O
were O
looking O
up O
; O
one O
day O
there O
was O
a O
scoop O
of O
Tristar B-DISH
strawberry I-DISH
sorbet I-DISH
served O
with O
anise B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
seed I-FOOD
- O
flecked O
polenta O
gelato O
, O
both O
made O
by O
Superiority B-EST
Burger I-EST
. O

( O
Mr. O
Easton O
is O
friendly O
with O
that O
restaurant O
's O
owner O
, O
Brooks O
Headley O
, O
and O
helped O
devise O
the O
recipe O
for O
the O
focaccia B-FOOD
Superiority B-EST
Burger I-EST
serves O
on O
Fridays O
. O
) O

Although O
Mr. O
Easton O
has O
a O
handful O
of O
employees O
, O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
has O
some O
of O
the O
blind O
spots O
of O
a O
one O
- O
person O
operation O
. O

It O
is O
not O
the O
easiest O
restaurant O
to O
communicate O
with O
, O
having O
an O
Instagram O
account O
but O
no O
website O
or O
phone O
. O

On O
a O
recent O
Sunday O
, O
when O
the O
restaurant O
was O
supposed O
to O
open O
at O
1 O
p.m. O
, O
a O
sign O
on O
the O
front O
door O
announced O
that O
it O
would O
be O
delayed O
until O
1:30 O
. O

That O
was O
the O
last O
communique O
; O
the O
doors O
were O
not O
unlocked O
until O
2 O
. O

But O
Mr. O
Easton O
has O
a O
singular O
vision O
, O
and O
it O
is O
the O
reason O
the O
food O
is O
so O
compelling O
. O

Looking O
around O
at O
the O
place O
, O
you O
're O
not O
sure O
how O
it O
can O
keep O
going O
like O
this O
. O

But O
then O
the O
plates O
start O
to O
come O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
them O
ever O
to O
stop O
. O

Over O
the O
years O
, O
I O
have O
eaten O
many O
bowls O
of O
pasta B-DISH
with I-DISH
clams I-DISH
that O
have O
been O
rewired O
by O
a O
chef O
who O
was O
trying O
to O
stand O
out O
. O

But O
I O
had O
not O
come O
across O
one O
that O
made O
as O
much O
sense O
to O
me O
as O
the O
big O
, O
sloshing O
platters O
you O
get O
at O
old O
- O
line O
Italian B-CUISINE
- O
American O
clam B-TYPE
bars I-TYPE
like O
Randazzo B-EST
's O
until O
tripping O
into O
a O
new O
Greenwich B-LOC
Village I-LOC
restaurant O
called O
Babs B-EST
this O
summer O
. O

Mind O
you O
, O
virtually O
the O
only O
Italian B-CUISINE
thing O
about O
the O
tagliatelle B-DISH
with I-DISH
clams I-DISH
at O
Babs B-EST
was O
the O
tagliatelle B-FOOD
. O

The O
sauce B-FOOD
was O
a O
mustard B-FOOD
beurre I-FOOD
blanc I-FOOD
, O
one O
of O
those O
French B-CUISINE
sauces B-FOOD
that O
all O
culinary O
- O
school O
students O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
able O
to O
make O
in O
their O
sleep O
. O

Mustard B-FOOD
beurre I-FOOD
blanc I-FOOD
is O
often O
found O
providing O
a O
decorous O
yellow O
veil O
over O
a O
chicken B-FOOD
breast I-FOOD
or O
salmon B-FOOD
fillet I-FOOD
. O

It O
is O
not O
normally O
poured O
over O
noodles B-FOOD
. O

But O
, O
tossed O
with O
salty O
French B-FOOD
ham I-FOOD
and O
Manila B-FOOD
clams I-FOOD
smaller O
than O
a O
thumbprint O
, O
it O
made O
a O
strangely O
exciting O
bowl O
of O
pasta B-FOOD
that O
was O
much O
more O
coherent O
than O
it O
sounds O
. O

Once O
I O
got O
to O
know O
Babs B-EST
better O
, O
I O
understood O
that O
strange O
excitement O
is O
what O
it O
does O
best O
. O

Its O
chef O
, O
Efren O
Hernandez O
, O
has O
talked O
about O
Babs B-EST
as O
a O
European B-CUISINE
grill B-TYPE
, O
and O
many O
of O
the O
dishes O
are O
seared O
over O
hot O
charcoal O
, O
but O
he O
has O
a O
wider O
frame O
of O
reference O
than O
that O
. O

He O
was O
raised O
in O
Southern B-LOC
California I-LOC
by O
immigrants O
from O
Mexico B-LOC
, O
and O
Mexican B-CUISINE
cuisine O
runs O
through O
his O
menu O
like O
an O
underground O
stream O
that O
sometimes O
gurgles O
up O
to O
the O
surface O
. O

Mr. O
Hernandez O
is O
not O
particularly O
interested O
in O
fusion O
, O
though O
; O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell O
, O
he O
likes O
rubbing O
cultures O
together O
to O
see O
what O
color O
the O
sparks O
will O
be O
. O

See O
, O
for O
example O
, O
what O
the O
menu O
calls O
divorced B-DISH
sea I-DISH
bream I-DISH
, O
a O
handsome O
dish O
that O
would O
be O
splashed O
around O
Instagram O
even O
more O
frequently O
than O
it O
already O
is O
if O
the O
dining O
tables O
were O
lighted O
by O
ceiling O
pinspots O
rather O
than O
disco O
- O
era O
chrome O
globes O
that O
look O
as O
if O
they O
were O
salvaged O
from O
Regine O
's O
. O

The O
bream B-FOOD
is O
split O
, O
and O
one O
side O
brushed O
with O
a O
red B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
and O
the O
other O
with O
a O
green B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
, O
before O
it O
is O
grilled O
over O
charcoal O
. O

The O
dish O
is O
an O
allusion O
to O
the O
two O
- O
tone O
pescado B-DISH
a I-DISH
la I-DISH
talla I-DISH
served O
at O
Contramar B-EST
in O
Mexico B-LOC
City I-LOC
, O
itself O
derived O
from O
huevos B-DISH
divorciados I-DISH
, O
a O
breakfast O
of O
two O
fried B-FOOD
eggs I-FOOD
beneath O
two O
contrasting O
salsas B-FOOD
. O

In O
Mr. O
Hernandez O
's O
kitchen O
, O
though O
, O
the O
red O
adobo B-FOOD
at O
Contramar B-EST
is O
replaced O
by O
a O
Catalan B-FOOD
romesco I-FOOD
, O
and O
the O
parsley B-FOOD
salsa I-FOOD
becomes O
a O
French B-FOOD
pistou I-FOOD
. O

But O
surely O
the O
tortilla B-FOOD
on O
its O
own O
plate O
off O
to O
one O
side O
brings O
it O
back O
to O
Mexico B-LOC
? O

Not O
so O
fast O
. O

According O
to O
the O
menu O
, O
it O
is O
a O
taloa B-FOOD
, O
a O
Basque B-CUISINE
cornmeal B-FOOD
cake I-FOOD
that O
cooks O
from O
Bayonne B-LOC
to O
Bilbao B-LOC
have O
been O
griddling O
for O
centuries O
. O

The O
taloa B-DISH
at O
Babs B-EST
is O
tender O
, O
smooth O
and O
floral O
. O

Mr. O
Hernandez O
has O
been O
cooking O
at O
Babs B-EST
since O
it O
opened O
in O
July O
. O

He O
is O
also O
the O
chef O
at O
Mimi B-EST
, O
a O
French B-CUISINE
restaurant O
a O
block O
away O
that O
is O
owned O
by O
the O
same O
people O
( O
Daniel O
Bennett O
, O
his O
brother O
Evan O
, O
and O
Louis O
Levy O
; O
they O
named O
Babs B-EST
and O
Mimi B-EST
after O
their O
grandmothers O
. O
) O

I O
have O
n't O
been O
back O
to O
Mimi B-EST
since O
Liz O
Johnson O
was O
the O
chef O
. O

She O
was O
aiming O
for O
a O
style O
that O
was O
at O
once O
brawny O
and O
lavish O
, O
and O
since O
taking O
over O
last O
year O
Mr. O
Hernandez O
has O
seemed O
to O
continue O
in O
that O
vein O
while O
bringing O
his O
far O
- O
ranging O
curiosity O
to O
bear O
. O

As O
they O
did O
at O
Mimi B-EST
, O
the O
owners O
have O
planted O
a O
small O
curved O
bar O
right O
by O
the O
door O
at O
Babs B-EST
. O

The O
cocktails B-FOOD
stirred O
and O
shaken O
there O
are O
mostly O
recognizable O
relatives O
of O
classics O
, O
like O
a O
martini B-FOOD
made O
with O
two O
brands O
of O
gin B-FOOD
. O

There O
's O
something O
charmingly O
self O
- O
deprecating O
about O
a O
cocktail O
list O
that O
includes O
Mount B-DISH
Gay I-DISH
and I-DISH
tonic I-DISH
, O
which O
seasoned O
barflies O
know O
as O
one O
of O
the O
drinks O
you O
can O
safely O
order O
in O
dives O
that O
do O
n't O
do O
anything O
else O
right O
. O

The O
wine O
list O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
is O
mostly O
French B-CUISINE
and O
sticks O
to O
the O
old O
guard O
; O
you O
can O
tell O
it O
's O
not O
trying O
especially O
hard O
to O
be O
cool O
by O
the O
way O
it O
has O
just O
one O
orange O
wine B-FOOD
, O
lumped O
in O
with O
the O
sparkling B-FOOD
wines I-FOOD
. O

Only O
the O
wine O
geeks O
will O
wish O
for O
more O
, O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
might O
wish O
there O
were O
as O
many O
bottles O
costing O
around O
$ O
50 O
as O
there O
are O
in O
the O
$ O
90 O
range O
. O

The O
numbers O
on O
the O
menu O
can O
sneak O
up O
on O
you O
, O
too O
. O

My O
$ O
48 O
lobster B-DISH
was O
a O
small O
creature O
that O
could O
n't O
have O
weighed O
much O
more O
than O
a O
pound O
. O

The O
server O
brightly O
suggested O
dunking O
its O
tomalley B-FOOD
into O
the O
smoked B-DISH
potato I-DISH
puree I-DISH
, O
and O
I O
would O
have O
tried O
it O
if O
I O
had O
found O
any O
tomalley B-FOOD
. O

And O
while O
I O
can O
imagine O
happily O
paying O
$ O
36 O
for O
Babs B-EST
's O
lamb B-DISH
chops I-DISH
, O
I O
'd O
want O
them O
to O
be O
served O
with O
something O
more O
compelling O
than O
the O
cold O
, O
underseasoned O
" O
Basque B-DISH
potato I-DISH
salad I-DISH
" O
into O
which O
some O
baby O
sardines B-FOOD
had O
apparently O
disappeared O
without O
a O
trace O

But O
there O
is O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
the O

and O
if O

full O

Like O
many O

restaurants O
these O
days O
, O
Babs B-EST
does O

offer O
many O
desserts O
, O
but O
the O
ones O
it O
does O
are O
far O
more O
intriguing O
than O

. O

A O

a O

Tsismis B-EST
, O
which O
opened O
in O
June O
, O
is O
a O
chatty O
restaurant O
. O

At O
times O
, O
when O
one O
of O
the O
owners O
pulls O
up O
alongside O
your O
table O
and O
expounds O
on O
how O
the O
chef O
's O
interpretation O
of O
the O
dish O
you O
're O
trying O
to O
eat O
differs O
from O
what O
you O
might O
find O
in O
the O
Philippines B-LOC
, O
you O
may O
find O
yourself O
eyeing O
the O
exit O
. O

If O
you O
've O
found O
your O
way O
to O
the O
menu O
's O
strengths O
, O
though O
, O
odds O
are O
you O
wo O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
anywhere O

Kinilaw B-DISH
, O
a O
Filipino B-CUISINE
ceviche B-FOOD
in O
a O
piercingly O
sour O
calamansi B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
cane I-FOOD
vinegar I-FOOD
marinade I-FOOD
with O
a O
jab O
of O
bird's B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
eye O
chile O
, O
is O
worth O
sticking O
around O
for O
, O
especially O
on O
those O
nights O
when O
it O
's O
made O
with O
bay B-FOOD
scallops I-FOOD
instead O
of O
fish B-FOOD
. O

After O
that O
, O
you O
might O
look O
into O
the O
fried B-DISH
pork I-DISH
- I-DISH
and I-DISH
- O
carrot O
won O
tons O
called O
pinsec B-DISH
frito I-DISH
( O
or O
, O
as O
the O
menu O
has O
them O
, O
pinsit B-DISH
frito I-DISH
) O
. O

They O
are O
typically O
folded O
into O
triangles O
, O
but O
the O
ones O
at O
Tsismis B-EST
are O
twisted O
into O
little O
cones O
that O
look O
like O
Hershey B-FOOD
's I-FOOD
kisses O
, O
though O
slightly O
bigger O
and O
golden O
- O
brown O
. O

Once O
they O
stop O
steaming O
, O
you O
can O
hold O
them O
by O
the O
cowlick O
of O
fried B-FOOD
wrapper I-FOOD
at O
the O
top O
and O
swish O
them O
around O
in O
the O
sweet B-FOOD
chile I-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
. O

Won B-FOOD
tons I-FOOD
with O
the O
same O
filling O
flop O
around O
in O
the O
soup B-FOOD
called O
pancit B-DISH
molo I-DISH
, O
although O
these O
are O
boiled O
. O

There O
is O
almost O
as O
much O
ground B-FOOD
pork I-FOOD
inside O
them O
as O
outside O
in O
the O
broth B-FOOD
, O
which O
is O
thick O
with O
garlic B-FOOD
and O
chopped O
scallions B-FOOD
. O

Even O
if O
it O
's O
well O
after O
5 O
: O
thirsty O
and O
you O
're O
not O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar O
, O
Jappy B-DISH
's I-DISH
wings O
are O
worth O
considering O
. O

Jappy O
is O
the O
chef O
, O
Jappy O
Afzelius O
, O
and O
he O
fries O
those O
wings B-FOOD
with O
thinly O
sliced O
garlic B-FOOD
and O
sends O
them O
out O
to O
the O
dining O
room O
with O
a O
salsa B-FOOD
of I-FOOD
raw I-FOOD
mangoes I-FOOD
, I-FOOD
charred I-FOOD
onions I-FOOD
and I-FOOD
chiles O
. O

The O
heat O
of O
the O
salsa B-FOOD
will O
not O
cause O
your O
shirt O
to O
burst O
into O
flames O
, O
but O
it O
is O
hot O
enough O
to O
make O
your O
memory O
of O
Jappy B-DISH
's I-DISH
wings O
a O
lasting O
one O
. O

Mr. O
Afzelius O
is O
a O
native O
of O
the O
Philippines B-LOC
and O
a O
graduate O
of O
a O
cooking O
academy O
in O
Manila B-LOC
, O
which O
shipped O
him O
off O
to O
Paris B-LOC
to O
intern O
in O
one O
of O
Alain O
Ducasse O
's O
bistros B-TYPE
. O

The O
Ducasse O
masterminds O
then O
sent O
him O
to O
work O
at O
Benoit B-EST
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
after O
which O
he O
turned O
up O
as O
the O
sous O
- O
chef O
at O
a O
Filipino B-TYPE
restaurant O
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
that O
was O
best O
known O
for O
its O
$ O
100 O
doughnut B-DISH
-- O
ube B-FOOD
- O
filled O
, O
Cristal B-FOOD
- O
frosted O
and O
gold B-FOOD
- O
leafed O
. O

Happily O
, O
nothing O
at O
Tsismis B-EST
approaches O
that O
level O
of O
look O
- O
at O
- O
me O
desperation O
. O

Mr. O
Afzelius O
's O
cooking O
is O
loose O
, O
unfussy O
and O
liberated O
. O

He O
tosses O
tradition O
under O
the O
bus O
when O
it O
suits O
him O
. O

The O
result O
is O
Filipino B-CUISINE
- O
American O
drinking O
food O
that O
tends O
to O
be O
charmingly O
offhand O
. O

From O
time O
to O
time O
, O
it O
can O
lean O
toward O
sloppiness O
. O

One O
night O
the O
fried B-DISH
milkfish I-DISH
in I-DISH
pritong I-DISH
isda I-DISH
was O
so O
overdone O
that O
even O
topping O
it O
with O
calamansi B-FOOD
juice I-FOOD
, O
fish B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
and O
a O
crisp O
, O
juicy O
spoonful O
of O
marinated B-FOOD
chayote I-FOOD
on O
top O
did O
n't O
revive O
it O
. O

A O
version O
of O
adobong B-DISH
manok I-DISH
, O
which O
Mr. O
Afzelius O
makes O
as O
a O
roasted B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
plus O
a O
soy B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
turmeric O
sauce O
rather O
than O
an O
all O
- O
in O
- O
one O
stew B-FOOD
, O
would O
have O
been O
more O
successful O
if O
the O
smoked B-FOOD
eggplant I-FOOD
had O
n't O
been O
so O
undercooked O
it O
squeaked O
. O

But O
the O
grilled B-FOOD
eggplant I-FOOD
on O
top O
of O
the O
kare B-FOOD
- O
kare O
was O
as O
soft O
as O
warm O
marrow B-FOOD
, O
and O
the O
other O
vegetables B-FOOD
-- O
crisp O
green B-FOOD
beans I-FOOD
, O
bok B-FOOD
choy I-FOOD
, O
enoki B-FOOD
mushrooms I-FOOD
-- O
made O
a O
refreshing O
counterpoint O
to O
the O
stewed B-FOOD
oxtails I-FOOD
in O
thick O
peanut B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
. O

Already O
pungent O
with O
shrimp B-FOOD
paste I-FOOD
, O
the O
kare B-FOOD
- O
kare O
comes O
with O
extra O
on O
the O
side O
that O
you O
can O
add O
to O
your O
heart O
's O
content O
. O

As O
they O
do O
at O
Bad B-EST
Saint I-EST
in O
Washington B-LOC
, O
probably O
the O
country O
's O
most O
talked O
- O
about O
Filipino B-CUISINE
restaurant O

, O
Tsismis B-EST
makes O
its O
laing B-FOOD
by O
simmering O
local O
kale B-FOOD
, O
rather O
than O
the O
more O
traditional O
taro B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
, O
in O
coconut B-FOOD
milk I-FOOD
. O

And O
if O
this O
version O
does O
n't O
have O
the O
perspective O
- O
altering O
funk O
of O
Bad B-EST
Saint I-EST
's O
, O
it O
still O
draws O
plenty O
of O
depth O
from O
the O
shrimp B-FOOD
paste I-FOOD
and O
smoked B-FOOD
fish I-FOOD
in O
the O
milk B-FOOD
and O
the O
big O
handful O
of O
dried B-FOOD
baby I-FOOD
shrimp I-FOOD
dropped O
on O
top O
. O

By O
this O
point O
, O
you O
will O
probably O
want O
to O
have O
a O
glass O
in O
your O
hand O
. O

Housemade O
calamansi B-DISH
soda I-DISH
sounds O
lovely O
, O
but O
mine O
was O
a O
little O
flat O
and O
weak O
. O

In O
lieu O
of O
hard O
spirits O
, O
sake B-FOOD
is O
the O
backbone O
of O
most O
of O
the O
cocktails O
. O

They O
are O
typically O
fleshed O
out O
with O
half O
a O
dozen O
other O
ingredients O
-- O
vermouth B-FOOD
, O
Aperol B-FOOD
, O
artichoke B-FOOD
liqueur I-FOOD
and O
bitters B-FOOD
, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
A B-DISH
La I-DISH
Bira I-DISH
-- O
which O
sound O
at O
first O
as O
if O
they O
had O
been O
assembled O
by O
walking O
through O
a O
liquor O
store O
blindfolded O
, O
but O
which O
after O
a O
closer O
look O
reveal O
a O
degree O
of O
inner O
logic O
. O

If O
this O
does O
not O
pique O
your O
curiosity O
, O
the O
list O
of O
wines B-FOOD
by O
the O
glass O
is O
almost O
long O
enough O
to O
qualify O
Tsismis B-EST
as O
a O
wine B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
, O
although O
the O
choices O
are O
not O
as O
outre O
as O
they O
are O
across O
the O
street O
at O
Wildair B-EST
. O

In O
a O
city O
crazy O
for O
kakigori B-FOOD
, O
patbingsu B-FOOD
and O
other O
varieties O
of O
flavored O
snow O
, O
Tsismis B-EST
's O
halo B-DISH
- O
halo O
will O
probably O
be O
an O
instant O
hit O
. O

Mr. O
Afzelius O
has O
the O
very O
good O
idea O
of O
putting O
coconut B-FOOD
sorbet I-FOOD
where O
the O
shaved B-FOOD
ice I-FOOD
would O
usually O
go O
; O
from O
there O
he O
goes O
to O
town O
with O
coconut B-FOOD
jellies I-FOOD
and O
what O
seems O
like O
every O
fresh O
fruit B-FOOD
he O
can O
put O
his O
hands O
on O
. O

But O
discerning O
collectors O
of O
Filipino B-CUISINE
sweets O
should O
note O
that O
Tsismis B-EST
serves O
excellent O
silvanas B-FOOD
. O

A O
silvana B-FOOD
is O
either O
a O
shrunken O
cake B-FOOD
or O
a O
cookie B-FOOD
with O
big O
ideas O
, O
depending O
on O
your O
perspective O
. O

It O
is O
made O
of O
two O
cashew B-FOOD
meringues I-FOOD
that O
are O
sandwiched O
together O
with O
buttercream B-FOOD
and O
then O
painted O
with O
more O
buttercream B-FOOD
, O
which O
holds O
cashew B-FOOD
crumbs I-FOOD
to O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
whole O
package O
. O

Once O
frosted O
and O
crumbed O
, O
it O
has O
to O
be O
refrigerated O
or O
the O
buttercream B-FOOD
will O
melt O
before O
it O
gets O
inside O
your O
mouth O
. O

No O
gold B-FOOD
leaf I-FOOD
adorns O
the O
silvanas B-FOOD
. O

It O
would O
only O
get O
in O
the O
way O
. O

I O
can O
count O
on O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
Steak I-EST
House I-EST
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
to O
produce O
certain O
sensations O
at O
every O
meal O
. O

There O
is O
the O
insistent O
smell O
of O
broiled B-DISH
dry I-DISH
- I-DISH
aged O
steak O
that O
hits O
me O
the O
minute O

I O
open O
the O
door O
and O
sometimes O
sooner O
, O
while O
I O
'm O
still O
outside O
on O
the O
South B-LOC
Williamsburg I-LOC
sidewalk O
, O
producing O
a O
raised O
pulse O
, O
a O
quickening O
of O
the O
senses O
and O
a O
restlessness O
familiar O
to O
anyone O
who O
has O
seen O
a O
tiger O
that O
has O
just O
heard O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
lunch O
bucket O
. O

There O
is O
the O
hiss O
of O
butter B-FOOD
and O
melted O
tallow B-FOOD
as O
they O
slide O
down O
the O
hot O
platter O
, O
past O
the O
sliced B-DISH
porterhouse I-DISH
or O
rib B-DISH
steak I-DISH
and O
their O
charred O
bones O
, O
to O
make O
a O
pool O
at O
one O
end O
. O

The O
server O
will O
spoon O
some O
of O
this O
sizzling O
fat O
over O
the O
meat B-FOOD
he O
has O
just O
plated O
, O
generally O
with O
some O
line O
like O
" O
Here O
are O
your O
vitamins O
. O
" O

There O
is O
the O
thunk O
of O
a O
bowl O
filled O
with O
schlag B-FOOD
landing O
on O
a O
bare O
wood O
table O
when O
dessert O
is O
served O
, O
and O
soon O
after O
, O
the O
softer O
tap O
- O
tap O
- O
tap O
of O
waxy O
chocolate B-FOOD
coins O
in O
gold O
foil O
dropped O
one O
at O
a O
time O
on O
top O
of O
the O
check O
. O

And O
after O
I O
've O
paid O
, O
there O
is O
the O
unshakable O
sense O
that O
I O
've O
been O
scammed O
. O

The O
last O
sensation O
was O
not O
part O
of O
the O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
experience O
when O
I O
started O
eating O
there O
, O
in O
the O
1990s O
. O

I O
was O
acutely O
aware O
of O
the O
cost O
back O
then O
because O
I O
would O
settle O
the O
tab O
by O
counting O
out O
$ O
20 O
bills O
; O
cash O
was O
the O
only O
way O
to O
pay O
unless O
you O
had O
a O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
credit O
card O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
night O
my O
wallet O
would O
be O
empty O
. O

Because O
a O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
steak B-DISH
made O
me O
feel O
alive O
in O
a O
way O
that O
few O
other O
things O
did O
, O
I O
considered O
this O
a O
fair O
trade O
, O
although O
I O
could O
afford O
it O
only O
once O
a O
year O
or O
so O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
remember O
when O
the O
doubts O
began O
, O
but O
they O
grew O
over O
time O
. O

Diners O
who O
walk O
in O
the O
door O
eager O
to O
hand O
over O
literal O
piles O
of O
money O
are O
n't O
greeted O
; O
they O
're O
processed O
. O

A O
host O
with O
a O
clipboard O
looks O
for O
the O
name O
, O
or O
writes O
it O
down O
and O
quotes O
a O
waiting O
time O
. O

There O
is O
almost O
always O
a O
wait O
, O
with O
or O
without O
a O
reservation O
, O
and O
there O
is O
almost O
always O
a O
long O
line O
of O
supplicants O
against O
the O
wall O
. O

A O
kind O
word O
or O
reassuring O
smile O
from O
somebody O
on O
staff O
would O
help O
the O
time O
pass O

The O
smile O
never O
comes O

The O
management O
seems O
to O
go O
out O
of O
its O
way O
to O
make O
things O
inconvenient O
. O

Customers O
at O
the O
bar O
have O
to O
order O
drinks O
from O
the O
bartender O
and O
food O
from O
an O
overworked O
server O
on O
the O

side O
of O
the O
bar O

and O
then O
pay O
two O
separate O
checks O
and O
leave O
two O
separate O
tips O

And O
they O
ca O
n't O
order O
lunch O
after O
2:30 O
p.m. O
, O
even O
though O
the O
bar O

written O
by O
Frank O
Bruni O
in O
2007 O

the O
restaurant O
has O
started O
taking O
online O
reservations O

It O
accepts O
debit O
cards O

too O

which O
is O
nice O

But O
the O
credit O

you O
use O
to O
buy O
a O
cortado B-FOOD
at O
the O
cafe B-TYPE

a O
bag O

at O
the O
bodega B-TYPE
will O
still O
not O
buy O
you O
a O
meal O
at O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
. O

The O
servers O
, O
who O
once O
were O
charmingly O
brusque O
, O
now O
give O
the O
strong O
impression O
that O
these O
endless O
demands O
for O
food O
and O
drink O
are O
all O
that O
's O
standing O
between O
them O
and O
a O
hard O

up O

the O
canned O

do O
n't O
flow O
as O
freely O
. O

Some O
things O
are O
the O
same O
as O
ever O
. O

The O
shrimp B-DISH
cocktail I-DISH
has O
always O
tasted O
like O
cold O
latex O
dipped O
in O
ketchup B-FOOD
and O
horseradish B-FOOD

The O
steak B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
has O
always O
tasted O
like O
the O
same O
ketchup B-FOOD
and O
horseradish B-FOOD
fortified O
by O
corn B-FOOD
syrup I-FOOD
. O

Although O
the O
fries B-DISH
are O
reasonably O
crisp O
, O
their O
insides O
are O
mealy O
and O
bland O
in O
a O
way O
that O
fresh O

straight O
out O

the O

always O
so O
white O
and O
rubbery O

I O
know O
there O
was O
a O
time O
the O
German B-DISH
fried I-DISH
potatoes I-DISH
were O
brown O
and O
crunchy O
, O
because O
I O
eagerly O
ate O
them O
each O
time O
I O
went O
. O

Now O
they O
are O
mushy O
, O
dingy O

gray O

sometimes O
cold O

I O

Lunch O
one O
afternoon O
vividly O
demonstrated O
the O
kitchen O
's O
inconsistency O
: O
I O
ordered O
a O
burger B-DISH
, O
medium O
- O
rare O
, O
at O
the O
bar O
. O

So O
had O
the O
two O
people O
sitting O
to O
my O
right O
, O
it O
turned O
out O
. O

One O
of O
them O
got O
what O
we O
'd O
all O
asked O
for O
, O
a O
midnight O
- O
dark O
crust O
giving O
way O
to O
an O
evenly O
rosy O
interior O
so O
full O
of O
juices O
it O
looked O
like O
it O
was O
ready O
to O
cry O
. O

The O
other O
one O
got O
a O
patty B-FOOD
that O
was O
almost O
completely O
brown O
inside O
. O

I O
got O
a O
weird O
hybrid O
, O
a O
burger B-FOOD
whose O
interior O
shaded O
from O
nearly O
perfect O
on O
one O
side O
to O
gray O
and O
hard O
on O
the O
other O
. O

The O
same O
issue O
afflicted O
a O
medium B-DISH
- I-DISH
rare O
porterhouse O
I O
was O
served O
one O
night O
: O

The O
fillet B-FOOD
was O
ideal O
but O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
T B-FOOD
- O
bone O
, O
the O
strip B-FOOD
, O
ranged O
from O
medium O
- O
rare O
to O
medium O
- O
well O
. O

I O
could O
live O
with O
this O
; O
big O
cuts O
of O
meat O
do O
n't O
always O
cook O
evenly O
. O

What O
gnaws O
at O
me O
every O
time O
I O
eat O
a O
Luger B-EST
porterhouse B-DISH
is O
the O
realization O
that O
it O
's O
just O
another O
steak B-FOOD
, O
and O
far O
from O
the O
best O

it O
rarely O
achieves O
a O
hypnotic O
or O

even O

interesting O
one O

But O

Luger B-EST
is O
not O
the O
city O

it O
's O
the O
one O
in O
which O
age O
, O
tradition O
, O
superb O
beef B-FOOD
, O
blistering O
heat O
, O
an O
instinctive O
avoidance O
of O
anything O
fancy O
and O
an O
immensely O
attractive O
self O
- O
assurance O
came O
together O
to O
produce O
something O
that O
felt O
less O
like O
a O
restaurant O
than O
an O
affirmation O
of O
life O
, O
or O
at O
least O
life O
as O
it O
is O
lived O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
. O

This O
sounds O
ridiculously O
grand O
. O

Years O
ago O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
true O
, O
though O
, O
and O
so O
did O
other O
people O
. O

The O
restaurant O
will O
always O
have O
its O
loyalists O
. O

They O
will O
laugh O
away O
the O
prices O
, O
the O
$ O
16.95 O
sliced B-DISH
tomatoes I-DISH
that O
taste O
like O
1979 O
, O
the O
$ O
229.80 O
porterhouse B-DISH
for I-DISH
four I-DISH
. O

They O
will O
say O
that O
nobody O
goes O
to O
Luger B-EST
for O
the O
sole B-FOOD
, O
nobody O
goes O
to O
Luger B-EST
for O
the O
wine B-FOOD
, O
nobody O
goes O
to O
Luger B-EST
for O
the O
salad B-FOOD
, O
nobody O
goes O
to O
Luger B-EST
for O
the O
service O
. O

The O
list O
goes O
on O
, O
and O
gets O
harder O
to O
swallow O
, O
until O
you O
start O
to O
wonder O
who O
really O
needs O
to O
go O
to O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST

start O
to O
think O
the O
answer O
is O

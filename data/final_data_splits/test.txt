Lately O
I O
have O
fallen O
under O
the O
spell O
of O
an O
East B-LOC
Village I-LOC
restaurant O
called O
Foxface B-EST
. O
The O
cooking O
there O
is O
hard O
to O
pin O
down, O
geographically. O
Stopping O
in O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago, O
I O
ate O
Low B-DISH
Countryish I-DISH
wild I-DISH
red I-DISH
shrimp I-DISH
on I-DISH
grits, I-DISH
with O
sweet B-FOOD
corn I-FOOD
off I-FOOD
the I-FOOD
cob I-FOOD
and O
a O
potent O
saffron-lobster B-EST
sauce. I-EST
More O
recently, O
I O
had O
skinless O
pork B-FOOD
sausage I-FOOD
inspired I-FOOD
by O
sai B-FOOD
ua, I-FOOD
the O
spicy O
and O
tangy O
specialty O
identified O
with O
the O
northern O
Thai O
city O
of O
Chiang B-LOC
Mai. I-LOC
The O
soft O
tripe B-FOOD
I O
enjoyed O
the O
other O
weekend O
had O
been O
simmered O
with O
'nduja, O
the O
fiery O
and O
malleable O
Calabrian O
sausage, O
and O
then O
covered O
with O
a O
few O
thin O
shingles O
of O
shaved O
pecorino. O
If O
I O
had O
started O
hanging O
around O
at O
Foxface O
sooner, O
especially O
during O
the O
cold O
months O
after O
its O
opening, O
in O
February, O
I O
might O
have O
run O
into O
a O
wider O
variety O
of O
cuisines O
and O
main O
ingredients. O
I O
did O
manage O
to O
get O
some O
of O
the O
elk O
osso O
buco O
while O
that O
was O
still O
on O
the O
menu. O
I O
never O
got O
to O
try O
the O
wild O
hare, O
though, O
stewed O
in O
red O
wine O
with O
a O
bit O
of O
chocolate O
and O
thickened O
with O
its O
own O
blood, O
a O
formula O
that O
students O
of O
very O
old-guard O
French O
cooking O
will O
recognize O
as O
lièvre O
à O
la O
royale. O
Nor O
did O
I O
make O
it O
in O
time O
for O
the O
venison, O
left O
to O
bubble O
for O
hours O
in O
white O
wine O
with O
mushrooms O
and O
dark O
juniper O
berries. O
The O
Foxface O
dish O
I O
may O
never O
forgive O
myself O
for O
missing, O
though, O
is O
the O
kebabs O
served O
with O
preserved O
lemons O
and O
tahini, O
because O
the O
kebabs O
were O
made O
from O
ground O
lamb O
and O
camel. O
Although O
these O
foods O
may O
lack O
any O
unifying O
cultural O
background, O
they O
did O
have O
one O
thing O
in O
common: O
They O
were O
all O
served O
on O
rolls. O
Apart O
from O
an O
occasional O
salad O
or O
soup, O
everything O
cooked O
at O
Foxface O
arrives O
in O
sandwich O
form. O
And O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
a O
muffuletta O
that O
briefly O
manifested O
a O
few O
months O
back, O
every O
sandwich O
at O
Foxface O
is O
filled O
with O
hot, O
cooked O
meat O
or O
seafood O
or O
vegetables. O
In O
Mexico, O
certain O
taco O
stands O
specialize O
in O
tacos O
de O
guisado, O
tortillas O
filled O
with O
one O
kind O
of O
stew O
or O
another. O
Most O
of O
Foxface's O
offerings O
are, O
in O
effect, O
sandwiches O
de O
guisado. O
Which O
reminds O
me O
of O
another O
impressive O
Foxface O
sandwich, O
a O
magenta O
and O
green O
tangle O
of O
cilantro O
stems O
and O
pickled O
onions O
pressed O
into O
an O
engagingly O
tart O
pile O
of O
pork, O
marinated O
in O
sour O
orange O
juice O
and O
roasted O
very O
slowly O
under O
a O
banana O
leaf O
in O
emulation O
of O
cochinita O
pibil O
from O
the O
Yucatán. O
There O
is O
no O
guarantee O
that O
any O
of O
these O
items O
will O
be O
available O
when O
you O
go O
to O
Foxface. O
The O
menu O
is O
printed O
daily O
and O
taped O
up O
next O
to O
the O
window O
on O
St. O
Marks O
Place O
where O
most O
of O
the O
business O
is O
transacted. O
Sometimes O
a O
new O
sandwich O
appears O
after O
the O
printed O
menu O
has O
already O
been O
posted, O
so O
it O
will O
be O
written O
out O
by O
hand O
on O
a O
card O
that O
has O
in O
its O
upper O
left O
corner O
the O
restaurant's O
logo, O
a O
drawing O
of O
an O
elegant O
fox O
in O
cat's-eye O
glasses O
with O
a O
cigarette O
holder O
in O
one O
gloved O
hand. O
The O
sandwiches O
have O
names O
like O
It's O
What's O
'Nside O
(for O
the O
tripe O
with O
'nduja) O
or O
120 O
BPM O
(bison O
heart O
with O
tahini O
and O
"many O
spices"). O
The O
Smoking O
Fox O
is O
sold O
every O
day. O
It O
is O
filled O
with O
smoked O
pork O
rib O
the O
color O
of O
a O
dry O
rosé, O
separated O
from O
the O
bones O
and O
covered O
with O
coleslaw, O
pickles O
and O
a O
few O
splashes O
of O
habanero-orange O
vinegar. O
Your O
mind, O
of O
course, O
goes O
either O
to O
Memphis O
or O
to O
the O
McRib O
, O
and O
neither O
is O
exactly O
wrong, O
but O
the O
meat O
is O
of O
a O
superior O
grade O
and O
is O
smoked O
with O
the O
attention O
to O
timing O
and O
nuance O
that O
characterizes O
Foxface's O
cooking. O
It's O
a O
great O
sandwich. O
To O
place O
an O
order, O
you O
lean O
in O
to O
the O
window O
and O
speak O
with O
Sivan O
Lahat, O
who O
owns O
and O
runs O
Foxface O
with O
Ori O
Kushnir, O
her O
partner O
in O
life O
and O
in O
sandwiches. O
They O
immigrated O
to O
New O
York O
from O
Israel O
almost O
20 O
years O
ago O
and O
have O
lived O
here O
ever O
since, O
apart O
from O
a O
brief O
flirtation O
with O
the O
Midwest O
and O
a O
longer O
experimental O
period O
in O
Tokyo. O
While O
they O
were O
in O
Japan, O
they O
operated O
a O
pop-up O
restaurant, O
which O
is O
the O
closest O
either O
of O
them O
came O
to O
running O
a O
food O
business O
before O
opening O
Foxface. O
Like O
the O
fox O
in O
the O
logo, O
Ms. O
Lahat O
has O
coppery O
hair O
and O
wears O
cat's-eye O
glasses. O
She O
prepares O
the O
orders O
in O
the O
room O
behind O
the O
window, O
which O
measures O
48 O
square O
feet. O
Inside O
the O
building, O
under O
the O
stairs, O
Foxface O
has O
a O
second O
room. O
Mr. O
Kushnir O
thinks O
it O
could O
be O
as O
large O
as O
14 O
square O
feet. O
A O
variety O
of O
equipment O
is O
stowed O
in O
the O
two O
rooms, O
including O
three O
induction O
burners, O
a O
roaster, O
a O
smoker O
and O
a O
dishwasher. O
After O
business O
hours, O
some O
of O
it O
comes O
out O
as O
Mr. O
Kushnir O
supervises O
the O
more O
time-consuming O
roasts O
and O
stews. O
He O
describes O
the O
food O
that O
he O
and O
Ms. O
Lahat O
cook O
as O
"dishes O
we O
like O
to O
eat, O
reimagined O
as O
sandwiches." O
I O
like O
to O
eat O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
same O
dishes, O
as O
it O
happens, O
but O
they O
have O
been O
hard O
to O
come O
by O
lately, O
especially O
those O
shapeless O
brown O
stews O
that O
are O
so O
out O
of O
style. O
Following O
some O
of O
the O
world's O
most O
influential O
chefs O
and O
shamed, O
perhaps, O
by O
the O
unflattering O
lenses O
of O
a O
million O
amateur O
photographers, O
restaurants O
have O
shifted O
away O
from O
plain O
and O
plain-looking O
cooking. O
The O
subtlety O
and O
the O
thrill O
of O
plain O
cooking O
comes O
from O
searing, O
simmering, O
reducing, O
skimming O
and O
so O
on. O
All O
the O
people O
who O
own O
Instant O
Pots O
know O
this, O
but O
the O
segment O
of O
the O
restaurant O
scene O
with O
artistic O
leanings O
has O
forgotten O
it, O
focusing O
instead O
on O
plating, O
arranging O
six O
or O
seven O
things O
in O
some O
photogenic O
design O
and O
hoping O
they O
will O
cohere. O
Slapping O
a O
roll O
on O
it O
is O
one O
way O
to O
get O
a O
shapeless O
brown O
stew O
ready O
for O
its O
close-up, O
although O
it O
has O
to O
be O
said O
that O
on O
the O
mean O
streets O
of O
Instagram, O
an O
elk O
osso O
buco O
sandwich O
is O
no O
match O
for O
a O
rainbow O
unicorn O
ice O
cream O
sundae. O
Because O
space O
is O
at O
a O
premium, O
there O
is O
no O
room O
to O
sit O
and O
eat O
your O
Smoking O
Fox O
at O
Foxface O
itself. O
You O
can, O
however, O
take O
it O
to O
a O
table O
a O
few O
steps O
away O
inside O
an O
adjoining O
business O
called O
the O
William O
Barnacle O
Tavern O
. O
This O
is O
a O
reassuringly O
gloomy O
bar O
that O
is O
said O
to O
have O
originated O
as O
a O
speakeasy. O
Model O
ships O
and O
other O
nautical O
paraphernalia O
are O
strewn O
about, O
references O
to O
the O
rumrunning O
operation O
a O
former O
owner O
of O
the O
building O
presided O
over O
during O
Prohibition. O
(The O
stairs O
that O
Foxface's O
dishwasher O
is O
housed O
below O
lead O
to O
an O
exhibition O
space O
called O
the O
Museum O
of O
the O
American O
Gangster O
.) O
The O
bar's O
current O
owner O
has O
resisted O
some O
modern O
conveniences. O
Most O
of O
the O
lighting O
at O
night O
comes O
from O
small O
candles, O
and O
all O
of O
the O
music O
is O
provided O
by O
old O
films O
-- O
of O
Irish O
folk O
recitals, O
Cab O
Calloway O
concerts O
-- O
that O
run O
in O
looping, O
watery O
projections O
on O
the O
back O
wall. O
All O
Foxface O
sandwiches O
are O
presented O
in O
a O
trim O
little O
white O
box O
that O
can O
be O
unfolded O
into O
a O
place O
mat. O
You O
can O
purchase O
an O
Italian O
fruit O
soda O
for O
$3 O
from O
Foxface, O
or O
buy O
alcohol O
from O
the O
tavern. O
The O
beer O
is O
not O
expensive, O
but O
the O
specialty O
of O
the O
house O
is O
absinthe. O
Most O
patrons O
drink O
theirs O
diluted O
with O
ice O
water O
poured O
from O
a O
four-spigot O
absinthe O
fountain O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
bar. O
The O
bartender O
will O
make O
absinthe O
cocktails, O
too, O
including O
the O
one O
Ernest O
Hemingway O
supposedly O
invented O
that O
is O
just O
absinthe O
and O
Champagne O
in O
a O
big O
glass O
. O
He O
called O
it O
Death O
in O
the O
Afternoon, O
and O
it O
is O
what O
I O
intend O
to O
drink O
if O
I O
ever O
get O
my O
hands O
on O
that O
camel O
sandwich. O

I O
would O
avoid O
the O

was O
more O
like O

it O
is O

Four O
summers O
ago, O
a O
young O
chef O
named O
José O
Luis O
Chávez O
began O
leveraging O
the O
poke B-FOOD
craze O
and O
the O
salad-bowl B-FOOD
trend O
into O
a O
string O
of O
fast-casual B-TYPE
ceviche O
bars. O
He O
began O
with O
a O
counter O
in O
the O
Gansevoort O
Market O
food O
hall O
called O
Mission O
Ceviche O
; O
there O
is O
now O
another O
in O
Canal O
Street O
Market O
and O
a O
third O
is O
supposed O
to O
open O
in O
Norwalk, O
Conn., O
later O
this O
year. O
At O
all O
locations, O
the O
stock-in-trade O
is O
citrus-marinated O
raw O
fish O
with O
sweet O
potatoes O
and O
kernels O
of O
chubby O
Andean O
corn, O
in O
both O
its O
soft O
and O
crunchy O
forms. O
This O
is O
of O
course O
the O
standard O
Peruvian O
formula, O
but O
Mr. O
Chávez O
had O
the O
inspiration O
of O
serving O
his O
ceviche O
in O
a O
clear O
plastic O
bowl O
over O
a O
base O
of O
salad, O
rice O
or, O
for O
a O
dollar O
more, O
quinoa. O
The O
supplemental O
ingredients O
make O
a O
plausible O
desk O
lunch O
out O
of O
a O
dish O
that O
some O
New O
Yorkers O
still O
aren't O
quite O
sure O
what O
to O
do O
with. O
The O
surprising O
thing O
about O
Mission O
Ceviche's O
salad O
bowls O
is O
that O
they O
taste O
like O
real O
Peruvian O
food. O
The O
raw O
fish O
is O
firm O
and O
cold O
and O
neatly O
cut O
up O
into O
solid O
pieces O
that O
hold O
their O
shape. O
The O
leche O
de O
tigre O
marinade O
in O
Mr. O
Chávez's O
"ceviche O
clásico" O
is O
a O
bright O
and O
precise O
cocktail O
of O
lime O
and O
rocoto O
chiles, O
although O
you O
might O
wish O
that O
the O
rocotos O
had O
been O
applied O
with O
a O
little O
less O
restraint. O
You O
get O
a O
higher-caliber O
shot O
of O
spice, O
this O
time O
from O
ají O
amarillo O
chiles, O
in O
the O
ceviche O
mixto, O
a O
combination O
of O
octopus, O
shrimp O
and O
fluke O
enveloped O
in O
a O
creamy, O
goldenrod-colored O
leche O
de O
tigre. O
The O
clásico O
is O
accessorized O
with O
sweet O
potato O
purée; O
the O
mixto O
gets O
avocado O
purée, O
too. O
The O
purées O
are O
piped O
out O
of O
pastry O
bags O
like O
buttercream O
roses O
on O
a O
wedding O
cake, O
and O
they O
are O
delicious. O
When O
I O
wandered O
into O
the O
Gansevoort O
Market O
location O
in O
February, O
it O
seemed O
clear O
that O
Mr. O
Chávez O
could O
run O
an O
interesting O
restaurant O
if O
he O
ever O
decided O
to O
put O
his O
food O
into O
something O
other O
than O
recyclable O
salad O
bowls. O
Then, O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
summer, O
he O
did O
just O
that, O
opening O
a O
sit-down O
restaurant O
on O
the O
Upper O
East O
Side O
with O
real O
plates O
and O
bowls. O
The O
new O
space O
is O
not O
particularly O
large O
or O
lavish, O
but O
compared O
with O
the O
earlier O
efforts, O
Mission O
Ceviche O
Restaurant O
& O
Bar O
is O
a O
palace. O
There O
is O
seating O
for O
65 O
or O
so O
people O
beneath O
a O
wall O
sculpture O
of O
a O
fish O
that O
glows O
from O
behind O
and O
a O
pink O
neon O
sign O
that O
reads O
"tiger O
milk O
effect," O
probably O
a O
reference O
to O
the O
belief O
that O
drinking O
leftover O
leche O
de O
tigre O
can O
put O
extra O
topspin O
on O
sexual O
performance. O
The O
menu O
now O
paints O
a O
slightly O
fuller O
picture O
of O
Peruvian O
cuisine, O
extending O
into O
new O
foods O
including O
the O
grilled O
skewers O
known O
as O
anticuchos. O
Mr. O
Chávez O
dresses O
up O
the O
country's O
most O
popular O
anticucho, O
grilled O
beef O
heart, O
brushing O
it O
with O
a O
creamy O
rocoto O
sauce O
and O
serving O
it O
with O
newly O
fried O
blue O
potato O
chips O
and O
kernels O
of O
choclo O
corn. O
The O
trio O
of O
rocoto, O
blue O
potatoes O
and O
choclo O
is O
so O
solidly O
Peruvian O
that O
it O
can O
withstand O
the O
chimichurri O
that O
Mr. O
Chávez O
brings O
in, O
by O
way O
of O
Argentina, O
as O
a O
final O
touch. O
He O
clearly O
has O
a O
soft O
spot O
for O
chimichurri O
because O
he O
deploys O
it O
again O
with O
the O
shrimp O
anticuchos O
(the O
shrimp O
are O
very O
big O
and O
look O
even O
bigger O
because O
they're O
grilled O
with O
their O
heads O
on), O
served O
with O
a O
squirt O
of O
huancaína, O
the O
spicy O
yellow O
cheese O
sauce O
that O
is O
something O
like O
Peru's O
version O
of O
queso O
dip. O
My O
favorite O
anticucho O
is O
a O
more O
straightforward O
situation, O
grilled O
scallops O
under O
arugula, O
lime O
zest O
and O
a O
smooth O
Parmesan O
fondue. O
But O
Mr. O
Chávez O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
put O
several O
flavors O
in O
motion O
at O
once O
and O
keep O
his O
balance, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
the O
beef-heart O
skewer O
and O
his O
octopus O
causa. O
This O
is, O
reduced O
to O
bare O
bones, O
a O
tendril O
of O
octopus O
curled O
around O
a O
disc O
of O
mashed O
potatoes. O
But O
the O
potatoes, O
seasoned O
with O
lime O
and O
yellow O
chiles, O
are O
coated O
in O
a O
smooth O
lavender-colored O
sauce O
made O
from O
Peruvian O
black O
olives; O
the O
octopus O
has O
been O
rubbed O
with O
cumin, O
oregano O
and O
ají O
panca O
paste O
and O
grilled O
to O
a O
crackle; O
the O
plate O
is O
decorated O
with O
a O
few O
wobbly O
curls O
of O
paper O
made O
with O
purple O
Peruvian O
potatoes. O
Mission O
Ceviche's O
servers, O
while O
eager O
to O
be O
helpful, O
have O
a O
habit O
of O
singling O
out O
the O
most O
obvious O
dishes O
-- O
the O
classic O
ceviche, O
the O
octopus O
leg O
-- O
and O
pushing O
them O
so O
hard O
you O
might O
suspect O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
menu O
is O
a O
minefield. O
It O
isn't. O
There O
is O
nothing O
to O
avoid O
unless O
the O
kitchen O
brings O
back O
the O
bizarre O
strawberry-kiwi O
ceviche O
that O
showed O
up O
as O
a O
special O
one O
night. O
If O
you O
are O
being O
herded O
into O
getting O
the O
"Peruvian O
paella," O
you O
should O
know O
that O
the O
other O
three O
main O
courses O
are O
also O
worth O
looking O
into, O
like O
the O
ají O
de O
gallina, O
shredded O
chicken O
breast O
in O
a O
creamy O
ají O
amarillo O
sauce O
that O
is O
both O
soothing O
and O
spicy; O
or O
the O
seco O
norteño, O
a O
slowly O
braised O
short O
rib O
in O
cilantro O
sauce. O
All O
are O
larger O
than O
average, O
too. O
Still, O
nothing O
on O
the O
menu O
quite O
rivals O
the O
ceviches. O
They O
are O
served, O
yes, O
without O
lettuce O
or O
rice, O
and O
they O
are O
better O
for O
it. O
Mr. O
Chávez's O
creative O
engine O
seems O
to O
have O
a O
high O
idle, O
and O
he O
has O
come O
up O
with O
different O
ways O
to O
present O
dishes O
that O
are O
also O
on O
the O
menu O
at O
the O
fast-casual O
counters. O
The O
"Nikkei" O
ceviche, O
for O
instance O
-- O
tuna O
in O
a O
kind O
of O
modified O
ponzu O
sauce O
seasoned O
with O
ají O
amarilllo O
and O
togarashi O
-- O
now O
comes O
with O
watermelon O
and O
a O
bloop O
of O
ginger O
foam O
that O
would O
never O
survive O
a O
trip O
from O
the O
food O
court O
back O
to O
the O
office. O
Neither O
would O
the O
odd O
but O
intriguing O
attempt O
at O
a O
vegetarian O
ceviche O
where O
the O
fish O
is O
replaced O
by O
shiitakes O
and O
the O
leche O
de O
tigre O
takes O
the O
form O
of O
snow, O
frozen O
by O
liquid O
nitrogen. O
The O
art O
of O
ceviche-making O
has O
at O
least O
as O
much O
in O
common O
with O
mixology O
as O
with O
cooking, O
so O
it O
is O
no O
surprise O
that O
the O
cocktails O
are O
well O
calibrated O
and O
sing O
out O
with O
fresh O
lime. O
There O
is O
a O
twist O
on O
the O
pisco O
sour O
made O
with O
passion-fruit O
juice O
and O
another O
with O
the O
purple-corn O
drink O
chicha O
morada, O
although O
neither O
quite O
achieves O
the O
bracing O
elegance O
of O
the O
original. O
And O
it's O
nice O
to O
see O
the O
less O
well-known O
chilcano, O
a O
pisco O
highball O
made O
with O
lime O
juice O
and O
ginger O
ale. O
(Would O
ginger O
beer O
be O
better?) O
Chicha O
morada O
appears O
again O
in O
the O
raspadilla O
dessert. O
This O
time O
it O
is O
a O
syrup O
poured O
over O
shaved O
ice O
and O
sprinkled O
with O
lucuma O
foam. O
When O
I O
had O
the O
raspadilla, O
it O
was O
sprinkled O
with O
candied O
pecan O
crumbs O
but O
in O
a O
phone O
interview O
on O
Monday O
Mr. O
Chávez O
said O
he O
had O
replaced O
the O
nuts O
with O
crumbled O
Oreos. O
This, O
it O
hardly O
needs O
pointing O
out, O
was O
not O
exactly O
a O
staple O
in O
the O
diet O
of O
the O
Incas. O
"What O
can O
I O
say?" O
he O
asked. O
"I O
just O
really O
like O
Oreos." O

Hutong's. B-EST
Where O
else O
will O
you O
find O
cooks O
who O
have O
the O
dexterity O
to O
make O
Wagyu-beef B-DISH
mille-feuilles I-DISH
whose O
flaky O
layers O
of O
pastry B-FOOD
overlap O
each O
other O
by O
only O
a O
few O
millimeters, O
like O
the O
feathers O
on O
a O
songbird's O
wing? O
Who O
can O
craft O
steamed B-FOOD
buns I-FOOD
that O
look O
just O
like O
shiitake B-FOOD
mushrooms, I-FOOD
which O
happen O
to O
be O
the O
chief O
ingredient O
in O
their O
filling? O
Or O
who O
knows O
the O
secret O
that O
allows O
the O
crunchy, O
chewy, O
charcoal-black O
mini-footballs O
stuffed O
with O
pork B-FOOD
(in O
what O
is O
known O
in O
Sichuan B-CUISINE
as O
"fish-fragrant" B-FOOD
seasoning) O
to O
sparkle O
as O
if O
diamond O
chips O
had O
been O
kneaded O
into O
the O
dough? B-FOOD
There O
is O
real O
skill O
in O
the O
kitchen O
at O
Hutong. B-EST
You O
see O
it O
most O
clearly O
in O
the O
dim B-FOOD
sum, I-FOOD
but O
much O
of O
the O
other O
cooking O
evinces O
the O
kind O
of O
discipline, O
precision O
and O
technical O
mastery O
that O
has O
rarely O
been O
seen O
in O
this O
city O
over O
the O
past O
few O
decades, O
to O
the O
dismay O
of O
eaters O
who O
know O
what O
Chinese B-CUISINE
food O
is O
capable O
of. O
"While O
expensive O
French B-CUISINE
restaurants O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
can O
hold O
their O
own O
against O
many O
places O
in O
Paris, B-LOC
if O
you O
want O
to O
move O
beyond O
steamed B-FOOD
dumplings I-FOOD
and O
stir-fries O
to O
experience O
the O
complexity O
of O
Chinese O
banquet O
cuisine, O
the O
possibilities O
grow O
dimmer O
each O
year," O
Ruth O
Reichl O
wrote O
in O
The O
New O
York O
Times O
in O
1998. O
She O
gave O
reasons O
for O
the O
poor O
showing, O
including O
talented O
chefs O
being O
paid O
more O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
and O
China. O
That O
is O
as O
true O
as O
it O
was O
21 O
years O
ago, O
but O
what O
has O
changed O
is O
the O
rise O
of O
global O
Chinese O
restaurant O
groups, O
from O
the O
disappointing O
duck O
specialist O
DaDong O
to O
the O
surprisingly O
solid O
Hao O
Noodle O
outposts O
and, O
now, O
to O
Hutong. O
The O
original O
Hutong O
opened O
in O
2003 O
on O
the O
28th O
floor O
of O
a O
glass O
tower O
overlooking O
the O
Hong O
Kong O
harbor, O
but O
the O
dining O
room O
tries O
to O
conjure O
the O
atmosphere O
of O
Beijing's O
vanishing O
premodern O
alleys, O
or O
hutongs, O
by O
means O
of O
red O
paper O
lanterns, O
carved O
wooden O
doors O
and O
birdcages. O
The O
Manhattan O
branch O
makes O
a O
different O
impression. O
The O
entrance O
is O
on O
the O
east O
side O
of O
the O
circular O
driveway O
below O
the O
Bloomberg O
Building O
between O
East O
58th O
and O
59th O
Streets. O
Turn O
right O
and O
you O
are O
in O
a O
narrow O
hallway O
between O
two O
soaring O
glass O
stacks O
of O
wine O
bottles, O
every O
one O
of O
them O
for O
decorative O
purposes O
only. O
Turn O
left O
and O
you O
are O
in O
a O
glittering, O
soaring, O
hard-edge O
dining O
room. O
The O
inspiration O
seems O
to O
be O
Art O
Deco O
with O
a O
pinch O
of O
cocaine; O
the O
blue O
leather O
banquettes, O
beveled O
mirrors O
and O
chandeliers O
of O
mirror-polished O
steel O
could O
come O
from O
the O
set O
of O
a O
nightclub O
in O
some O
cross O
between O
" O
Scarface O
" O
and O
"Gentlemen O
Prefer O
Blondes." O
A O
guest O
who O
has O
lived O
in O
China O
allowed O
his O
eyes O
to O
adjust O
to O
the O
glinting O
light O
as O
he O
looked O
toward O
the O
ceiling, O
which O
seemed O
to O
be O
far O
away. O
"It's O
very O
… O
yin," O
he O
said. O
Hutong O
is O
ostensibly O
a O
Northern O
Chinese O
restaurant. O
This O
is O
more O
apparent O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
than O
in O
Manhattan, O
where O
the O
menu O
has O
been O
pruned O
to O
about O
half O
the O
size. O
Lamb, O
a O
mainstay O
in O
the O
northern O
provinces, O
was O
represented O
in O
August O
by O
a O
single O
dish, O
cumin-speckled O
ribs O
roasted O
languorously O
to O
a O
mind-altering O
tenderness. O
By O
the O
time O
of O
my O
last O
visit, O
lamb O
had O
ambled O
off O
the O
menu O
entirely. O
The O
most O
famous O
preparation O
from O
northern O
China, O
Peking O
duck, O
arrived O
at O
my O
table O
worse O
for O
wear O
and O
tear, O
carved O
haphazardly, O
with O
blobs O
of O
unmelted O
fat O
clinging O
to O
limp O
skin. O
The O
second O
course, O
a O
dark-meat O
stir-fry O
to O
be O
folded O
in O
iceberg O
lettuce, O
was O
more O
skillfully O
done, O
but O
the O
sting O
of O
paying O
$84 O
for O
a O
whole O
duck O
with O
uncrisp O
skin O
lingered. O
Much O
of O
what O
hasn't O
been O
trimmed O
from O
the O
Hong O
Kong O
menu O
comes O
from O
Sichuan. O
So O
does O
Fei O
Wang, O
the O
executive O
chef O
of O
the O
New O
York O
branch, O
and O
a O
native O
of O
Chengdu. O
Most O
recently O
seen O
running O
the O
kitchen O
of O
the O
Hutong O
in O
London, O
Mr. O
Wang O
weaves O
chiles O
-- O
fresh, O
dried, O
roasted, O
pickled, O
name O
it O
-- O
into O
nearly O
everything. O
In O
the O
dish O
known O
as O
Red O
Lantern, O
the O
whole O
dried O
peppers O
the O
size O
of O
cherries O
are O
mostly O
decorative; O
fried O
soft-shell O
crabs O
are O
buried O
under O
the O
chiles O
in O
a O
pan O
with O
an O
arcing O
bamboo O
handle, O
like O
jelly O
beans O
in O
the O
plastic O
grass O
of O
an O
Easter O
basket. O
The O
ground O
spices O
on O
the O
crabs' O
shatteringly O
brittle O
crust O
-- O
lightly O
sweet O
and O
more O
aromatic O
than O
searingly O
hot O
-- O
may O
remind O
you O
of O
a O
Chinese O
rice-cracker O
snack O
you O
grew O
up O
on, O
or O
it O
may O
make O
you O
think O
of O
Old O
Bay. O
Fermented O
chiles O
provide O
an O
electric O
buzz, O
and O
a O
modicum O
of O
heat, O
to O
the O
steamed O
halibut O
that O
arrives O
boxed O
up O
inside O
a O
red O
bell O
pepper O
and O
sitting O
on O
a O
nest O
of O
rice O
noodles. O
(The O
pepper O
opens O
into O
a O
six-pointed O
star O
that O
gives O
the O
dish O
its O
name, O
halibut O
red O
star O
noodles.) O
Kou O
shui O
chicken O
is O
nearly O
submerged O
in O
an O
orange O
lake O
of O
excellent O
chile O
oil, O
although O
the O
adroit O
way O
the O
oil O
is O
balanced O
by O
rice O
vinegar, O
sesame O
oil, O
soy O
sauce, O
ginger O
and O
other O
flavors O
is O
what O
gives O
Hutong O
one O
of O
the O
city's O
most O
impressive O
versions O
of O
this O
traditional O
cold O
dish. O
If O
Hutong O
has O
another O
appetizer O
that O
equals O
it, O
I O
haven't O
found O
it O
yet. O
I O
did, O
however, O
have O
a O
cryptic O
encounter O
with O
a O
log-cabin O
stack O
of O
okra O
doused O
in O
a O
sweet O
wasabi O
sauce, O
and O
an O
inconclusive O
rendezvous O
with O
some O
steamed O
asparagus O
stalks O
whose O
tips O
were O
enrobed O
in O
white O
sesame O
sauce; O
it O
was O
as O
if O
somebody O
had O
tried O
to O
replicate O
strawberries O
dipped O
in O
white O
chocolate O
without O
access O
to O
strawberries O
or O
white O
chocolate. O
You O
could O
attempt O
to O
unknot O
these O
mysteries. O
Then O
again, O
you O
could O
simply O
begin O
your O
meal O
with O
dim O
sum. O
And O
then, O
after O
picking O
your O
way O
through O
the O
chile-besotted O
main O
courses, O
you O
could O
end O
it O
that O
way, O
too. O
There O
is O
a O
dessert O
that O
mimics O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
steamed O
bun, O
pleated O
and O
twisted O
into O
a O
pucker O
at O
the O
top. O
It O
is O
made O
of O
white O
chocolate, O
the O
wrapper O
on O
this O
trompe O
l'oeil O
bao, O
and O
filled O
with O
white O
sesame O
cream O
and O
a O
core O
of O
bittersweet O
salted O
caramel. O
Alongside O
it O
is O
a O
single O
scoop O
of O
ice O
cream O
made O
from O
lightly O
sweetened O
soy O
milk. O
The O
soy O
milk O
is O
extremely O
fresh. O
I O
don't O
mean O
that O
the O
carton O
won't O
expire O
for O
another O
three O
weeks; O
I O
mean O
that O
somebody O
in O
the O
kitchen O
was O
squeezing O
the O
soybeans O
shortly O
before O
the O
ice O
cream O
was O
frozen. O
This O
is O
a O
snack O
from O
a O
Chinese O
childhood, O
bread O
and O
a O
glass O
of O
milk, O
and O
it O
would O
be O
hard, O
after O
several O
courses O
of O
spice, O
to O
think O
of O
anything O
more O
welcome. O

Last O
month O
I O
had O
dinner O
with O
a O
friend O
who O
lives O
a O
thousand O
miles O
away O
and O
doesn't O
get O
to O
Manhattan B-LOC
as O
often O
as O
he O
once O
did. O
When O
I O
asked O
where O
he O
wanted O
to O
eat, O
he O
answered, O
a O
bit O
wistfully, O
"Somewhere O
that O
speaks O
of O
New B-LOC
York, I-LOC
a O
city O
I O
have O
lost O
touch O
with." O
At O
first, O
I O
looked O
for O
a O
place O
where O
we O
could O
be O
in O
the O
thick O
of O
it O
all. O
I O
thought O
of O
Bar B-EST
Pisellino I-EST
, O
that O
narrow O
glass O
sarcophagus O
run O
by O
Rita O
Sodi O
and O
Jody O
Williams, O
where O
you O
drink O
your O
sgroppino B-FOOD
standing O
up O
between O
the O
window O
along O
Grove B-LOC
Street I-LOC
and O
the O
one O
along O
Seventh B-LOC
Avenue. I-LOC
People O
trickle O
in, O
eat O
some O
olives B-FOOD
and O
a O
tuna B-DISH
tramezzino, I-DISH
and O
head O
out O
again. O
Although O
it's O
about O
the O
size O
of O
a O
subway O
car, O
you O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
if O
you O
stayed O
long O
enough, O
you'd O
eventually O
see O
everybody O
you O
know. O
But O
a O
restaurant O
that O
truly O
speaks O
of O
the O
place O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
has O
become O
over O
the O
past O
decade O
or O
so O
would O
be O
nearly O
the O
opposite O
of O
Bar B-EST
Pisellino. I-EST
This O
restaurant O
would O
not O
be O
in O
the O
thick O
of O
it O
all. O
It O
would O
be O
hushed, O
sheltered, O
exclusive, O
admitting O
no O
more O
than O
a O
handful O
of O
people O
at O
a O
time. O
It O
would O
protect O
those O
people, O
once O
they O
were O
inside, O
from O
crowds O
spilling O
in O
from O
the O
street, O
even O
from O
the O
street O
itself. O
It O
would O
join O
the O
steady O
march O
of O
new O
tasting B-TYPE
counters I-TYPE
and O
omakase B-TYPE
hideaways. I-TYPE
And O
it O
would O
illustrate O
the O
growing O
ease O
with O
which O
New O
Yorkers O
of O
means O
can O
glide O
through O
and O
above O
the O
fray, O
slipping O
from O
one O
cloistered O
room O
to O
another O
in O
black O
cars O
without O
touching O
down. O
That O
restaurant O
would O
be O
a O
lot O
like O
Frevo B-EST
, O
which O
has O
been O
serving O
suave, O
$124 O
tasting O
menus O
with O
a O
modern-French B-CUISINE
sensibility O
in O
Greenwich B-LOC
Village I-LOC
for O
the O
past O
four O
months. O
Frevo B-EST
is O
the O
work O
of O
Franco O
Sampogna, O
who O
is O
the O
chef, O
and O
Bernardo O
Silva, O
the O
manager. O
Mr. O
Sampogna O
is O
from O
Brazil B-LOC
and O
Mr. O
Silva O
comes O
from O
Portugal; B-LOC
they O
met O
10 O
years O
ago O
while O
working O
in O
restaurants O
in O
France, B-LOC
and O
quickly O
decided O
that O
one O
day O
they O
would O
open O
a O
restaurant O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
that O
would O
give O
diners O
"that O
feeling O
of O
being O
in O
your O
own O
secluded O
safe O
haven," O
as O
Mr. O
Sampogna O
put O
it. O
To O
get O
into O
Frevo, B-EST
you O
first O
need O
to O
know O
that O
Frevo B-EST
exists. O
There's O
no O
sign. O
When O
you O
arrive O
at O
the O
correct O
address, O
what O
you O
see O
is O
an O
art O
gallery O
with O
just O
enough O
room O
on O
its O
white O
walls O
for O
the O
six O
abstract O
paintings O
that O
hang O
there O
fairly O
close O
together. O
The O
paintings O
are O
real O
paintings O
made O
by O
a O
real O
artist, O
Thomas O
Labarthe, O
who O
goes O
by O
Toma-L O
, O
but O
the O
gallery O
is O
not O
entirely O
a O
real O
gallery. O
If O
it O
were, O
the O
young O
woman O
who O
sits O
there O
keeping O
an O
eye O
on O
things O
would O
stare O
blankly O
ahead O
when O
you O
entered, O
instead O
of O
walking O
up O
to O
you O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
reassuring O
you O
that, O
yes, O
you've O
come O
to O
the O
right O
place. O
Then O
she O
reaches O
behind O
one O
of O
the O
canvases O
and O
it O
swings O
out O
on O
invisible O
hinges, O
leaving O
in O
its O
place O
a O
doorway O
through O
which O
you O
can O
see, O
illuminated O
in O
a O
large, O
dark O
room, O
a O
stainless-steel O
kitchen O
and O
a O
long, O
curving O
counter O
of O
polished O
quartzite. O
You O
hop O
up O
on O
one O
of O
the O
18 O
padded O
seats, O
and O
the O
door O
clicks O
closed. O
You O
are O
in. O
When O
the O
door O
opens O
again, O
typically O
not O
for O
another O
half O
an O
hour, O
in O
will O
walk O
another O
set O
of O
people O
who, O
like O
you, O
knew O
that O
the O
gallery O
was O
not O
a O
normal O
gallery. O
Let's O
say O
that O
the O
misdirection O
of O
the O
gallery O
and O
the O
secret O
door O
do O
not O
make O
these O
newcomers O
feel O
sufficiently O
insulated O
from O
the O
outside O
world. O
Frevo B-EST
gives O
them O
the O
opportunity O
to O
sit O
at O
a O
round O
chef's O
table O
in O
a O
back O
corner O
around O
which O
a O
curtain O
can O
be O
drawn, O
as O
in O
a O
hospital O
room. O
Much O
of O
this O
comes O
right O
out O
of O
the O
neo-speakeasy B-TYPE
handbook, O
although O
Frevo B-EST
does O
throw O
itself O
into O
the O
act O
with O
an O
unusual O
level O
of O
commitment. O
The O
gallery, O
for O
instance, O
installed O
a O
new O
batch O
of O
Mr. O
Labarthe's O
canvases O
around O
Labor O
Day. O
But O
each O
time O
I O
went O
to O
Frevo, B-EST
I O
stared O
at O
that O
curtain. O
Nobody O
ever O
closed O
it O
while O
I O
was O
there, O
but O
it O
still O
reminded O
me O
how O
easy O
it O
is O
now O
for O
some O
New O
Yorkers O
to O
climb O
into O
the O
treehouse O
and O
pull O
the O
ladder O
up O
behind O
them. O
I O
have O
to O
admit, O
though, O
that O
I O
like O
Frevo B-EST
more O
than O
I O
like O
the O
version O
of O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
that O
it O
brings O
to O
mind. O
The O
pleasures O
of O
this O
secluded O
safe O
haven O
are O
real, O
and O
Mr. O
Sampogna's O
cooking O
is O
focused O
and O
refined. O
I O
haven't O
been O
able O
to O
get O
his O
halibut B-DISH
dish O
out O
of O
my O
mind, O
for O
instance. O
The O
fish B-FOOD
rests O
on O
a O
thin, O
crisp O
platform O
of O
fried B-FOOD
bread I-FOOD
shellacked O
with O
a O
dark O
mushroom B-FOOD
marmalade; I-FOOD
this O
miniature O
mushroom O
tart O
drinks O
up O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
halibut O
as O
it O
goes, O
in O
the O
oven, O
from O
raw O
to O
that O
just-cooked O
state O
where O
its O
flesh O
slides O
apart O
into O
thick O
and O
almost O
fluffy O
white O
flakes. O
Alongside O
the O

Mr. O
Sampogna's O
opening O
salvo O
often O
involves O
quinoa O
doing O
something O
quinoa O
doesn't O
usually O
do, O
and O
doing O
it O
quite O
nicely. O
I O
liked O
its O
freshness O
when O
it O
was O
used O
in O
a O
salad O
spooned O
over O
a O
demitasse O
of O
creamy O
hummus; O
I O
liked O
its O
crunch O
when O
it O
was O
dehydrated O
and O
sprinkled O
over O
a O
few O
mouthfuls O
of O
black O
lentils O
topped O
with O
glistening O
orbs O
of O
smoked O
trout O
roe. O
A O
dish O
from O
early O
July O
brought O
peas, O
at O
the O
tail O
end O
of O
their O
season, O
together O
with O
a O
rich O
pistachio-tarragon O
cream O
and O
white O
puffs O
of O
coconut O
mousse: O
light O
and O
charming. O
I O
wished O
Mr. O
Sampogna O
had O
exploited O
summer O
produce O
as O
sensitively O
when O
I O
went O
back O
in O
August O
and O
September. O
His O
kitchen O
is O
small O
enough O
that O
he O
could O
respond O
to O
the O
market O
day O
by O
day, O
but O
so O
far O
this O
doesn't O
seem O
to O
interest O
him. O
Frevo, O
at O
$124 O
for O
five O
courses, O
is O
not O
a O
huge O
splurge O
by O
New O
York O
standards, O
but O
servers O
try O
to O
inflate O
the O
total O
by O
pushing O
supplements. O
For O
$30 O
you O
can O
get O
Kaluga O
caviar O
troweled O
on O
to O
your O
first O
course; O
$20 O
gets O
you O
upgraded O
to O
a O
foie O
gras O
torchon O
instead O
of O
the O
less-thrilling O
mushrooms O
with O
gnocchi; O
it's O
$18 O
for O
a O
serving O
of O
aged O
Comté O
before O
dessert, O
and O
another O
$30 O
to O
have O
white O
truffles O
with O
the O
cheese. O
This O
tactic O
is O
not O
as O
grating O
as O
it O
is O
at O
Per O
Se O
, O
where O
the O
supplements O
are O
piled O
onto O
a O
base O
charge O
of O
$355, O
but O
it O
is O
still O
a O
snag O
in O
the O
otherwise O
smooth O
hospitality O
provided O
by O
Frevo's O
small O
crew O
of O
servers O
and O
cooks. O
Everyone O
I've O
brought O
to O
Frevo O
has O
fallen O
under O
its O
spell, O
which O
is O
hard O
to O
resist. O
The O
music O
is O
slinky O
and O
sinuous. O
The O
room O
has O
a O
nocturnal O
theatricality; O
sitting O
at O
the O
counter O
with O
darkness O
behind O
you O
facing O
the O
spotlighted O
kitchen O
can O
feel O
like O
attending O
an O
extremely O
elegant O
campfire. O
I O
still O
think O
Frevo O
is O
a O
perfect O
spot O
to O
familiarize O
yourself O
with O
the O
frictionless O
New O
York O
of O
2019. O
Still, O
when O
my O
out-of-town O
friend O
arrived, O
we O
had O
our O
dinner O
at O
Bar O
Pisellino. O
We O
were O
hungry O
for O
a O
taste O
of O
the O
old O
chaos. O

Billy O
Durney, O
the O
Brooklyn B-LOC
restaurateur O
and O
pitmaster, O
has O
been O
talking O
for O
several O
years O
about O
the O
fried B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
that O
he O
planned O
to O
bring O
to O
Red B-EST
Hook. I-EST
At O
first, O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
to O
doubt O
him. O
That O
the O
man O
is O
comfortable O
with O
long O
time O
horizons O
was O
clear O
to O
anyone O
who O
watched O
how O
patiently O
he O
studied O
the O
science O
of O
indirect O
heat O
at O
his O
first O
establishment O
in O
the O
neighborhood, O
Hometown B-EST
Bar-B-Que I-EST
. O
After O
Hurricane O
Sandy O
flooded O
streets O
and O
knocked O
out O
power O
in O
the O
area O
shortly O
before O
the O
scheduled O
opening O
in O
2012, O
he O
gave O
away O
smoked B-FOOD
briskets, I-FOOD
ribs B-FOOD
and O
shoulders B-FOOD
to O
local O
residents O
until O
electricity O
was O
restored O
almost O
three O
weeks O
later, O
honing O
his O
technique O
all O
the O
while. O
The O
years O
rolled O
by O
without O
a O
drumstick B-FOOD
in O
sight. O
But O
as O
recently O
as O
March, O
it O
was O
still O
possible O
to O
take O
Mr. O
Durney O
at O
his O
word O
when O
he O
talked O
about O
the O
star O
attraction O
of O
his O
nearly O
completed O
fried-chicken B-FOOD
emporium B-TYPE
, O
to O
be O
called O
Red B-EST
Hook I-EST
Tavern. I-EST
The O
doors O
were O
finally O
unlocked O
in O
July, O
revealing O
a O
row O
of O
tables O
under O
electrified O
gas O
lamps O
and O
a O
row O
of O
stools O
in O
front O
of O
a O
white-oak O
bar O
that O
looks O
as O
if O
it O
was O
built O
to O
last O
at O
least O
until O
Van B-LOC
Brunt I-LOC
Street I-LOC
sinks O
into O
the O
sea. O
Wearing O
wallpaper O
and O
wainscoting O
and O
pressed O
tin, O
Red B-EST
Hook I-EST
Tavern I-EST
does O
a O
straight-faced O
impression O
of O
a O
whiskey-simmered O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
corner B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
of O
a O
certain O
age. O
The O
attention O
to O
detail O
was O
to O
be O
expected, O
given O
how O
convincingly O
Hometown B-EST
conjures O
a O
Texas B-LOC
Hill I-LOC
Country I-LOC
barbecue B-FOOD
palace. O
What O
was O
something O
of O
a O
surprise, O
though, O
was O
that O
chickens O
were O
not O
being O
fried O
anywhere O
on O
the O
premises. O
In O
fact, O
Red B-EST
Hook I-EST
Tavern's I-EST
star O
attraction O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
cheeseburger. B-DISH
To O
be O
fair, O
Mr. O
Durney O
probably O
would O
not O
have O
drummed O
up O
much O
enthusiasm O
had O
he O
gone O
around O
telling O
people O
he O
was O
going O
to O
open O
a O
bar B-TYPE
that O
served O
hamburgers. B-FOOD
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
has O
so O
many O
of O
those O
already O
that O
the O
style O
they O
typically O
serve O
is O
a O
recognized O
subgenre O
that O
George O
Motz O
calls O
"the B-DISH
New I-DISH
York I-DISH
City I-DISH
pub I-DISH
burger." I-DISH
According O
to O
Mr. O
Motz, O
a O
filmmaker O
and O
author O
whose O
work O
explores O
all O
things O
ground-beef-and-bun-related, O
the O
hallmarks O
of O
a O
pub O
burger O
are O
a O
thicker-than-average O
patty O
and O
a O
relative O
lack O
of O
adornment. O
It O
is O
the O
plain, O
sturdy O
and O
hunger-calming O
burger O
you O
get O
at O
P.J. O
Clarke's O
, O
JG O
Melon O
and O
Fanelli O
Cafe O
in O
Manhattan O
and O
at O
Donovan's O
Pub O
in O
Queens. O
Mr. O
Durney O
has O
said O
that O
he O
intends O
the O
Red O
Hook O
Tavern O
burger O
as O
a O
homage O
to O
the O
one O
at O
Peter O
Luger O
Steak O
House O
. O
(You O
might O
think O
that O
Luger O
traffics O
in O
the O
style O
known O
as O
the O
steakhouse O
burger, O
but O
most O
burger O
taxonomists O
agree O
that O
what O
it O
serves, O
only O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
only O
at O
lunch, O
is O
a O
pub O
burger.) O
Like O
Peter O
Luger, O
Red O
Hook O
Tavern O
employs O
a O
toasted O
and O
buttered O
hard O
roll O
with O
a O
smattering O
of O
sesame O
seeds O
-- O
about O
as O
many O
as O
the O
stars O
you O
can O
see O
in O
the O
sky O
over O
Manhattan O
on O
a O
very O
clear O
night. O
In O
both O
places, O
the O
patties O
are O
made O
with O
some O
portion O
of O
dry-aged O
prime O
beef, O
stand O
about O
an O
inch O
and O
a O
half O
tall, O
and O
possess O
a O
dark O
crust O
that O
fills O
your O
head O
with O
the O
instinct-triggering O
aromas O
and O
flavors O
whose O
creation O
in O
browned O
meat O
was O
described O
by O
Louis O
Camille O
Maillard O
. O
There O
are O
some O
minor O
divergences. O
At O
Peter O
Luger, O
cheese O
is O
optional, O
while O
the O
top O
and O
sides O
of O
the O
burger O
at O
Red O
Hook O
Tavern O
are O
tightly O
wrapped O
in O
glossy O
yellow O
American O
cheese O
by O
default. O
A O
thick O
cross-section O
of O
white O
onion O
is O
laid O
below O
the O
top O
bun O
at O
Luger. O
At O
Red O
Hook O
Tavern, O
the O
onion O
is O
stationed O
below O
the O
patty, O
where O
it O
helps O
keep O
the O
bottom O
bun O
dry, O
like O
a O
coaster. O
They O
give O
you O
a O
half-sour O
pickle O
spear O
and O
fries, O
too, O
which O
are O
about O
the O
same O
dimensions. O
The O
important O
difference O
between O
the O
burgers, O
though, O
is O
that O
lately O
Peter O
Luger's O
have O
tended O
to O
be O
better O
in O
memory O
than O
in O
reality, O
while O
the O
Red O
Hook O
Tavern's O
is, O
right O
now, O
one O
of O
the O
few O
absolutely O
mandatory O
burgers O
in O
New O
York O
City. O
The O
kitchen O
is O
overseen O
by O
Allison O
Plumer, O
a O
chef O
who O
has O
done O
most O
of O
her O
cooking O
in O
Brooklyn. O
She O
has O
an O
excellent O
dry-aged O
steak O
-- O
New O
York O
strip, O
naturally O
-- O
impressively O
browned O
and O
served O
with O
a O
small O
cast-iron O
skillet O
full O
of O
creamed O
spinach, O
a O
touch O
so O
right O
it O
may O
qualify O
as O
art. O
It O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
detail O
that O
makes O
Red O
Hook O
Tavern O
something O
more O
than O
a O
place O
for O
the O
locals O
to O
get O
beer O
and O
burgers. O
Another O
is O
the O
golden O
chicken O
gravy O
with O
a O
hint O
of O
butterscotch O
that O
is O
ladled O
into O
a O
well O
in O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
that O
come O
with O
the O
half-chicken, O
which O
is O
advertised O
as O
simply O
pan-roasted, O
although O
it O
has O
the O
wonderfully O
stiff O
shards O
of O
skin O
you O
get O
from O
weighting O
down O
the O
bird O
as O
it O
cooks. O
Everybody O
who O
has O
eaten O
at O
Red O
Hook O
Tavern O
will O
tell O
you O
to O
get O
the O
country-ham-and-Cheddar O
croquettes O
on O
a O
creamy O
pool O
of O
whole-grain O
Dijonnaise. O
Everybody O
is O
right, O
too. O
Consensus O
has O
also O
formed O
around O
the O
wedge O
salad, O
which O
is O
clearly O
not O
a O
wedge, O
but O
is O
still O
a O
very O
fine O
salad, O
with O
blue O
cheese O
and O
a O
thick, O
Lugeresque O
bacon O
slice O
flopped O
over O
individual O
leaves O
of O
romaine. O
There O
is O
considerably O
less O
unanimity O
about O
the O
roasted O
corn, O
kernels O
of O
which O
you O
are O
supposed O
to O
wrap O
in O
radicchio O
that O
you've O
first O
smeared O
with O
'nduja; O
I'm O
in O
the O
camp O
that O
thinks O
it O
would O
be O
a O
fine O
dish O
for O
another O
restaurant. O
There O
is O
no O
restaurant O
where O
I'd O
be O
glad O
to O
see O
littlenecks O
steamed O
with O
way O
too O
much O
stale, O
acrid O
garlic. O
Of O
course, O
there's O
no O
correct O
amount O
of O
stale, O
acrid O
garlic, O
but O
the O
kitchen O
really O
goes O
all O
in. O
There O
are O
two O
desserts. O
Both O
are O
sundaes O
. O
They O
do O
not O
have O
the O
thematic O
inevitability O
of O
the O
creamed O
spinach, O
but O
they're O
put O
together O
with O
more O
sophistication O
than O
average. O
The O
truth O
is, O
though, O
that O
nothing O
on O
the O
menu O
gives O
the O
burger O
a O
real O
run O
for O
its O
money. O
What O
does, O
or O
at O
least O
equals O
it O
as O
a O
reason O
to O
reserve O
a O
table O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
in O
advance, O
is O
the O
list O
of O
drinks O
Mr. O
Durney O
has O
put O
together O
with O
Jeff O
Porter O
and O
Kenneth O
Crum. O
Mr. O
Durney's O
enthusiasm O
for O
wines O
made O
by O
small, O
eccentric O
producers O
is O
on O
view O
at O
Hometown, O
surely O
the O
only O
place O
on O
earth O
where O
you O
can O
drink O
Milan O
Nasterec's O
skin-fermented O
Moravian O
pinot O
noir O
alongside O
a O
taco O
filled O
with O
a O
slice O
of O
barbecued O
brisket O
and, O
in O
lieu O
of O
salsa, O
a O
glowing O
yellow O
stripe O
of O
queso. O
Mr. O
Durney O
indulges O
his O
curiosity O
more O
deeply O
at O
the O
tavern. O
Ten O
grower O
Champagnes O
can O
be O
had O
for O
under O
$100 O
a O
bottle, O
and O
there's O
a O
$40 O
sparkling O
red O
from O
Maryland. O
Darlings O
of O
the O
nonconformist O
wine O
movement O
such O
as O
Radikon O
, O
Marcel O
Lapierre O
and O
Frank O
Cornelissen O
are O
all O
given O
the O
space O
you'd O
expect, O
but O
there O
are O
also O
less O
familiar O
names O
like O
Subject O
to O
Change O
, O
a O
Forestville, O
Calif., O
outfit O
that O
has O
the O
peculiar O
idea O
of O
making O
a O
bright-toned, O
low-alcohol O
zinfandel-syrah O
blend O
and O
calling O
it O
Moon O
Juice. O
A O
small O
number O
of O
brews O
from O
Other O
Half, O
Folksbier O
and O
Threes O
Brewing, O
leading O
lights O
of O
the O
Brooklyn O

along O
with O
uncredited O
light O
and O
dark O
ales O
billed O
as O
"A O
Tribute O
To O
McSorleys O
Ale O

McSorley's, O
famously, O
has O
you O
buy O
two O
mugs O
at O
once, O
which O
Red O
Hook O
Tavern O
doesn't O
do. O
It's O
less O
well O
known O
that O
McSorley's O
serves O
a O
burger. O
Like O
the O
one O
at O
Luger, O
it's O
only O
available O
at O
lunch. O
It O
is, O
of O
course, O
a O

For O
a O
long O
time, O
the O
seriousness O
of O
a O
pizzeria B-TYPE
could O
be O
gauged O
by O
a O
simple O
yes-or-no O
question: O
Did O
it O
sell O
pizza B-FOOD
by O
the O
slice? O
The O
ones O
that O
cared O
the O
most O
about O
upholding O
traditions, O
maintaining O
quality O
and O
so O
on O
-- O
like O
Totonno's B-EST
, O
John's B-EST
of I-EST
Bleecker I-EST
Street I-EST
, O
Kesté B-EST
, O
Lucali B-EST
, O
Una B-EST
Pizza I-EST
Napoletana I-EST
-- O
emphatically O
did O
not. O
Today, O
we O
live O
in O
the O
era O
of O
the O
elevated O
slice B-TYPE
joint. I-TYPE
Some O
of O
them, O
like O
Scarr's B-EST
, O
grind O
wheat B-FOOD
berries I-FOOD
into O
new O
flour B-FOOD
every O
day. O
Many O
use O
minuscule O
quantities O
of O
yeast; B-FOOD
others O
abandon O
commercial O
yeast B-FOOD
altogether O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
natural O
leavening O
in O
sourdough B-FOOD
starters. I-FOOD
There O
are O
slice B-TYPE
joints I-TYPE
that O
ferment O
their O
dough B-FOOD
for O
a O
day, O
some O
that O
let O
it O
bubble O
away O
for O
two O
days O
and O
a O
few O
that O
go O
in O
for O
three O
days. O
A O
new O
example O
of O
the O
breed, O
F&F B-EST
Pizzeria I-EST
, O
opened O
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
last O
week O
with O
the O
help O
of O
a O
baker O
whose O
starter B-FOOD
dough I-FOOD
has O
traveled O
internationally O
and O
another O
baker O
who O
has O
decades O
of O
experience O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
pizza O
paddle. O
Among O
themselves, O
these O
new-school O
pizza B-FOOD
makers O
speak O
of O
hydration O
levels, O
fermentation O
periods O
and O
digestibility. O
Many O
of O
these O
slice O
masters O
are O
chasing O
an O
ideal O
version O
of O
the O
foldable, O
portable O
triangle O
sold O
across O
linoleum O
counters O
in O
all O
five O
boroughs, O
a O
search O
suffused O
with O
nostalgia O
for O
an O
era O
before O
processed O
cheese, B-FOOD
sweetened O
sauce B-FOOD
and O
wholesale O
dough. B-FOOD
Others O
are O
celebrated O
for O
achievements O
in O
the O
square O
slice, O
a O
descendant O
of O
the O
Sicilian, B-CUISINE
with O
an O
airier, O
less O
doughy O
crust; B-FOOD
leaders O
in O
this O
style O
include O
Corner B-EST
Slice I-EST
and O
Mama's B-EST
Too I-EST
. O
Perhaps O
the O
smallest O
group O
of O
all O
are O
the O
bakers O
who O
turn O
their O
eyes O
toward O
Rome, B-LOC
where O
the O
slices O
are O
rectangular O
and O
are O
known O
as O
pizza B-DISH
al I-DISH
taglio. I-DISH
They O
resemble O
focaccia B-FOOD
more O
than O
a O
$3 O
slice O
from O
Ray's B-EST
, O
and O
it's O
doubtful O
that O
the O
practitioners O
of O
this O
style O
even O
think O
of O
themselves O
as O
belonging O
to O
the O
elevated-slice O
movement. O
But O
I'd O
argue O
that O
they O
do O
belong O
to O
it, O
and O
that O
some O
of O
the O
most O
elevated O
slices O
in O
the O
area O
at O
the O
moment O
are O
the O
Roman-style B-CUISINE
ones O
that O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
sells O
inside O
its O
bakery B-TYPE
and O
restaurant O
on O
Palisade B-LOC
Avenue, I-LOC
up O
in O
the O
Jersey B-LOC
City I-LOC
Heights. I-LOC
At O
any O
given O
time, O
three O
to O
six O
pizzas B-FOOD
sit O
on O
the O
counter. O
They O
are O
oblong O
and, O
because O
they O
are O
baked O
without O
a O
pan O
to O
shape O
the O
dough, B-FOOD
they O
have O
rounded O
corners, O
like O
a O
horse O
track. O
The O
crust B-FOOD
is O
noticeably O
lightweight O
when O
you O
pick O
it O
up, O
an O
impression O
that O
is O
confirmed O
by O
the O
mouth O
and, O
later, O
the O
stomach. O
The O
interior O
is O
honeycombed O
with O
air O
pockets. O
The O
underside O
of O
each O
slice O
is O
strong O
enough O
to O
carry O
a O
relatively O
heavy O
load O
of O
toppings O
without O
bending O
or O
collapsing. O
This O
structural O
soundness O
is O
key O
to O
the O
pleasure. O
The O
toppings O
on O
a O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
slice O
are O
not O
decorations O
or O
seasonings, O
as O
they O
often O
are O
on O
round O
pizza. B-FOOD
Each O
one O
is O
the O
point O
of O
its O
slice: O
a O
mix O
of O
fresh O
mushrooms B-FOOD
with O
pepper, B-FOOD
parsley B-FOOD
and O
flecks O
of O
grated O
Parmigiano-Reggiano; B-FOOD
zucchini B-FOOD
shaved O
into O
fine O
threads O
and O
showered O
at O
the O
last O
minute O
with O
mint B-FOOD
leaves; I-FOOD
slices O
of O
late-summer O
red B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
yellow I-FOOD
peppers I-FOOD
picked O
while O
they O
still O
had O
few O
faintly O
bitter O
streaks O
of O
green O
reaching O
up O
their O
sides; O
a O
rough, O
dark O
pesto B-FOOD
spooned O
around O
cherry B-FOOD
tomatoes I-FOOD
that O
were O
roasted O
until O
their O
skins O
turned O
black O
and O
pulled O
away O
from O
the O
globes O
of O
pulp O
inside; O
Concord B-FOOD
grapes I-FOOD
that O
blotch O
the O
dough B-FOOD
with O
purple O
like O
exploded O
jelly B-FOOD
grenades. O
A O
chef's O
hand O
is O
at O
work O
here, O
tossing O
black B-FOOD
pepper I-FOOD
and O
rosemary B-FOOD
over O
the O
grape B-DISH
pizza, I-DISH
adding O
salt B-FOOD
and O
excellent O
Sicilian B-FOOD
olive I-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
to O
the O
tomato B-FOOD
pulp, O
and O
hammering O
basil B-FOOD
and O
hazelnuts B-FOOD
for O
the O
pesto B-FOOD
in O
a O
mortar. O
The O
hand O
belongs O
to O
Rick O
Easton, O
who O
oversees O
the O
pizzas B-FOOD
and O
the O
nonpizzas O
and O
owns O
the O
restaurant. O
He O
also O
owned O
its O
predecessor, O
the O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
that O
operated O
in O
Pittsburgh B-LOC
for O
all O
of O
2015 O
plus O
a O
few O
weeks O
on O
either O
side. O
For O
a O
short-lived O
place, O
it O
got O
a O
lot O
of O
media O
attention, O
luring O
restaurant O
hunters O
and O
recipe O
gatherers O
from O
across O
the O
country. O
By O
the O
start O
of O
2016, O
he O
had O
decided O
to O
move O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City. I-LOC
When O
his O
first O
job O
fell O
through, O
he O
began O
shopping O
for O
a O
location O
for O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt. I-EST
The O
real O
estate O
market O
had O
ideas O
of O
its O
own, O
as O
it O
often O
does, O
which O
is O
how O
the O
incarnation O
of O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
that O
Mr. O
Easton O
opened O
early O
this O
summer O
wound O
up O
in O
New B-LOC
Jersey. I-LOC
In O
addition O
to O
cheaper O
rents, O
Jersey B-LOC
City I-LOC
has O
ordinances O
that O
allow O
customers O
to O
show O
up O
with O
bottles O
of O
wine B-FOOD
or O
beer B-FOOD
and O
drink O
them, O
a O
handy O
policy O
because O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt's I-EST
beverage O
list O
has O
nothing O
more O
potent O
than O
Italian B-FOOD
sodas I-FOOD
and O
sparkling B-FOOD
water. I-FOOD
Each O
night's O
menu, O
written O
in O
chalk O
on O
a O
blackboard O
next O
to O
the O
counter O
where O
you O
order, O
contains O
at O
least O
as O
many O
things O
that O
are O
not O
pizza B-FOOD
as O
things O
that O
are. O
Generally O
these O
other O
items O
are O
modest O
in O
size O
and O
trattoria-ish B-TYPE
in O
spirit; O
prepared O
ahead O
of O
time, O
they O
need O
at O
most O
five O
minutes O
in O
the O
oven O
before O
a O
cook O
will O
arrange O
them O
on O
a O
board O
and O
carry O
them O
to O
one O
of O
the O
25 O
or O
so O
seats. O
I O
wish O
the O
tripe B-DISH
stewed I-DISH
in I-DISH
spicy I-DISH
tomato I-DISH
sauce, I-DISH
the O
way O
Romans O
do O
it, O
were O
available O
all O
the O
time. O
It O
is O
not, O
but O
the O
meatballs B-DISH
almost O
always O
are, O
and O
they O
are O
wonderful, O
made O
with O
enough O
bread B-FOOD
that O
they O
are O
extremely O
tender O
in O
a O
bright O
marinara. B-FOOD
Another O
reliable O
find O
is O
a O
sandwich B-FOOD
of O
some O
kind, O
made O
with O
plain, O
untopped O
pizza. B-FOOD
Twice O
I've O
had O
a O
warm O
mortadella B-DISH
sandwich I-DISH
there, O
and O
both O
times O
I O
was O
convinced O
there O
was O
no O
way O
to O
improve O
on O
it. O
One O
dish O
was O
denoted O
on O
the O
menu O
by O
a O
single O
word: O
beans. B-DISH
I've O
thought O
of O
it O
nearly O
every O
day O
since, O
partly O
because O
the O
beans B-FOOD
-- O
scarlet B-FOOD
runners I-FOOD
-- O
were O
perfectly O
intact O
but O
perfectly O
tender; O
partly O
because O
of O
the O
brooding O
depth O
they O
took O
on O
from O
being O
finished O
with O
sweet B-FOOD
red I-FOOD
peppers I-FOOD
that O
the O
kitchen O
dried O
and O
fried, O
an O
ingredient O
the O
Italians O
call O
peperoni B-FOOD
cruschi; I-FOOD
and O
partly O
because O
their O
broth B-FOOD
tasted O
so O
good O
when O
given O
a O
chance O
to O
soak O
into O
the O
slice O
of O
thick-crusted O
sourdough B-FOOD
bread I-FOOD
that O
came O
on O
top. O
That O
bread B-FOOD
is O
Mr. O
Easton's, O
too. O
It O
comes O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
things, O
and O
it O
is O
excellent. O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
is O
still O
settling O
into O
New B-LOC
Jersey. I-LOC
Some O
ingredients O
may O
be O
better O
when O
Mr. O
Easton O
has O
had O
time O
to O
infiltrate O
the O
local O
farm O
scene. O
In O
August, O
when O
the O
state O
was O
rolling O
in O
juicy O
peaches, B-FOOD
he O
was O
serving O
crunchy O
unripe O
ones O
in O
red B-FOOD
wine I-FOOD
for O
dessert. O
There O
was O
also O
a O
very O
strange O
cantaloupe B-DISH
pudding. I-DISH
By O
September O
things O
were O
looking O
up; O
one O
day O
there O
was O
a O
scoop O
of O
Tristar B-DISH
strawberry I-DISH
sorbet I-DISH
served O
with O
anise-seed-flecked B-FOOD
polenta I-FOOD
gelato, I-FOOD
both O
made O
by O
Superiority B-EST
Burger. I-EST
(Mr. O
Easton O
is O
friendly O
with O
that O
restaurant's O
owner, O
Brooks O
Headley O
, O
and O
helped O
devise O
the O
recipe O
for O
the O
focaccia B-FOOD
Superiority B-EST
Burger I-EST
serves O
on O
Fridays.) O
Although O
Mr. O
Easton O
has O
a O
handful O
of O
employees, O
Bread B-EST
and I-EST
Salt I-EST
has O
some O
of O
the O
blind O
spots O
of O
a O
one-person O
operation. O
It O
is O
not O
the O
easiest O
restaurant O
to O
communicate O
with, O
having O
an O
Instagram O
account O
but O
no O
website O
or O
phone. O
On O
a O
recent O
Sunday, O
when O
the O
restaurant O
was O
supposed O
to O
open O
at O
1 O
p.m., O
a O
sign O
on O
the O
front O
door O
announced O
that O
it O
would O
be O
delayed O
until O
1:30. O
That O
was O
the O
last O
communiqué; O
the O
doors O
were O
not O
unlocked O
until O
2. O
But O
Mr. O
Easton O
has O
a O
singular O
vision, O
and O
it O
is O
the O
reason O
the O
food O
is O
so O
compelling. O
Looking O
around O
at O
the O
place, O
you're O
not O
sure O
how O
it O
can O
keep O
going O
like O
this. O
But O
then O
the O
plates O
start O
to O
come O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
and O
you O
don't O
want O
them O
ever O
to O
stop. O

-DOCSTART- O

Over O
the O
years, O
I O
have O
eaten O
many O
bowls O
of O
pasta B-DISH
with I-DISH
clams I-DISH
that O
have O
been O
rewired O
by O
a O
chef O
who O
was O
trying O
to O
stand O
out. O
But O
I O
had O
not O
come O
across O
one O
that O
made O
as O
much O
sense O
to O
me O
as O
the O
big, O
sloshing O
platters O
you O
get O
at O
old-line O
Italian-American B-CUISINE
clam B-TYPE
bars I-TYPE
like O
Randazzo's B-EST
until O
tripping O
into O
a O
new O
Greenwich B-LOC
Village I-LOC
restaurant O
called O
Babs B-EST
this O
summer. O
Mind O
you, O
virtually O
the O
only O
Italian B-CUISINE
thing O
about O
the O
tagliatelle B-DISH
with I-DISH
clams I-DISH
at O
Babs B-EST
was O
the O
tagliatelle. B-FOOD
The O
sauce B-FOOD
was O
a O
mustard B-FOOD
beurre I-FOOD
blanc, I-FOOD
one O
of O
those O
French B-CUISINE
sauces B-FOOD
that O
all O
culinary-school O
students O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
able O
to O
make O
in O
their O
sleep. O
Mustard B-FOOD
beurre I-FOOD
blanc I-FOOD
is O
often O
found O
providing O
a O
decorous O
yellow O
veil O
over O
a O
chicken B-FOOD
breast I-FOOD
or O
salmon B-FOOD
fillet. I-FOOD
It O
is O
not O
normally O
poured O
over O
noodles. B-FOOD
But, O
tossed O
with O
salty O
French B-FOOD
ham I-FOOD
and O
Manila O
clams O
smaller O
than O
a O
thumbprint, O
it O
made O
a O
strangely O
exciting O
bowl O
of O
pasta O
that O
was O
much O
more O
coherent O
than O
it O
sounds. O
Once O
I O
got O
to O
know O
Babs O
better, O
I O
understood O
that O
strange O
excitement O
is O
what O
it O
does O
best. O
Its O
chef, O
Efrén O
Hernández, O
has O
talked O
about O
Babs O
as O
a O
European O
grill, O
and O
many O
of O
the O
dishes O
are O
seared O
over O
hot O
charcoal, O
but O
he O
has O
a O
wider O
frame O
of O
reference O
than O
that. O
He O
was O
raised O
in O
Southern O
California O
by O
immigrants O
from O
Mexico, O
and O
Mexican O
cuisine O
runs O
through O
his O
menu O
like O
an O
underground O
stream O
that O
sometimes O
gurgles O
up O
to O
the O
surface. O
Mr. O
Hernández O
is O
not O
particularly O
interested O
in O
fusion, O
though; O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell, O
he O
likes O
rubbing O
cultures O
together O
to O
see O
what O
color O
the O
sparks O
will O
be. O
See, O
for O
example, O
what O
the O
menu O
calls O
divorced O
sea O
bream, O
a O
handsome O
dish O
that O
would O
be O
splashed O
around O
Instagram O
even O
more O
frequently O
than O
it O
already O
is O
if O
the O
dining O
tables O
were O
lighted O
by O
ceiling O
pinspots O
rather O
than O
disco-era O
chrome O
globes O
that O
look O
as O
if O
they O
were O
salvaged O
from O
Regine's O
. O
The O
bream O
is O
split, O
and O
one O
side O
brushed O
with O
a O
red O
sauce O
and O
the O
other O
with O
a O
green O
sauce, O
before O
it O
is O
grilled O
over O
charcoal. O
The O
dish O
is O
an O
allusion O
to O
the O
two-tone O
pescado O
a O
la O
talla O
served O
at O
Contramar O
in O
Mexico O
City, O
itself O
derived O
from O
huevos O
divorciados, O
a O
breakfast O
of O
two O
fried O
eggs O
beneath O
two O
contrasting O
salsas. O
In O
Mr. O
Hernández's O
kitchen, O
though, O
the O
red O
adobo O
at O
Contramar O
is O
replaced O
by O
a O
Catalan O
romesco, O
and O
the O
parsley O
salsa O
becomes O
a O
French O
pistou. O
But O
surely O
the O
tortilla O
on O
its O
own O
plate O
off O
to O
one O
side O
brings O
it O
back O
to O
Mexico? O
Not O
so O
fast. O
According O
to O
the O
menu, O
it O
is O
a O
taloa, O
a O
Basque O
cornmeal O
cake O
that O
cooks O
from O
Bayonne O
to O
Bilbao O
have O
been O
griddling O
for O
centuries. O
The O
taloa O
at O
Babs O
is O
tender, O
smooth O
and O
floral. O
Mr. O
Hernández O
has O
been O
cooking O
at O
Babs O
since O
it O
opened O
in O
July. O
He O
is O
also O
the O
chef O
at O
Mimi O
, O
a O
French O
restaurant O
a O
block O
away O
that O
is O
owned O
by O
the O
same O
people O
(Daniel O
Bennett, O
his O
brother O
Evan, O
and O
Louis O
Levy; O
they O
named O
Babs O
and O
Mimi O
after O
their O
grandmothers.) O
I O
haven't O
been O
back O
to O
Mimi O
since O
Liz O
Johnson O
was O
the O
chef O
. O
She O
was O
aiming O
for O
a O
style O
that O
was O
at O
once O
brawny O
and O
lavish, O
and O
since O
taking O
over O
last O
year O
Mr. O
Hernández O
has O
seemed O
to O
continue O
in O
that O
vein O
while O
bringing O
his O
far-ranging O
curiosity O
to O
bear. O
As O
they O
did O
at O
Mimi, O
the O
owners O
have O
planted O
a O
small O
curved O
bar O
right O
by O
the O
door O
at O
Babs. O
The O
cocktails O
stirred O
and O
shaken O
there O
are O
mostly O
recognizable O
relatives O
of O
classics, O
like O
a O
martini O
made O
with O
two O
brands O
of O
gin. O
There's O
something O
charmingly O
self-deprecating O
about O
a O
cocktail O
list O
that O
includes O
Mount O
Gay O
and O
tonic, O
which O
seasoned O
barflies O
know O
as O
one O
of O
the O
drinks O
you O
can O
safely O
order O
in O
dives O
that O
don't O
do O
anything O
else O
right. O
The O
wine O
list, O
meanwhile, O
is O
mostly O
French O
and O
sticks O
to O
the O
old O
guard; O
you O
can O
tell O
it's O
not O
trying O
especially O
hard O
to O
be O
cool O
by O
the O
way O
it O
has O
just O
one O
orange O
wine, O
lumped O
in O
with O
the O
sparkling O
wines. O
Only O
the O
wine O
geeks O
will O
wish O
for O
more, O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
might O
wish O
there O
were O
as O
many O
bottles O
costing O
around O
$50 O
as O
there O
are O
in O
the O
$90 O
range. O
The O
numbers O
on O
the O
menu O
can O
sneak O
up O
on O
you, O
too. O
My O
$48 O
lobster O
was O
a O
small O
creature O
that O
couldn't O
have O
weighed O
much O
more O
than O
a O
pound. O
The O
server O
brightly O
suggested O
dunking O
its O
tomalley O
into O
the O
smoked O
potato O
purée, O
and O
I O
would O
have O
tried O
it O
if O
I O
had O
found O
any O
tomalley. O
And O
while O
I O
can O
imagine O
happily O
paying O
$36 O
for O
Babs's O
lamb O
chops, O
I'd O
want O
them O
to O
be O
served O
with O
something O
more O
compelling O
than O
the O
cold, O
underseasoned O
"Basque O
potato O
salad" O
into O
which O
some O
baby O
sardines O
had O
apparently O
disappeared O
without O
a O
trace. O
But O
there O
is O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
the O
charcoal-grilled O
swordfish O
with O
mint O
salsa O
verde, O
fennel O
and O
green O
olives, O
and O
if O
you O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
andouille O
this O
summer O
you O
found O
Mr. O
Hernández O
knocking O
cuisines O
together O
again, O
this O
time O
with O
a O
corn-and-chanterelles O
risotto O
under O
a O
slow-burning O
splash O
of O
Calabrian O
chile O
oil. O
He O
shows O
how O
well O
he O
can O
work O
in O
small O
strokes O
with O
a O
layered O
appetizer O
of O
raw O
sea O
scallops, O
sweet O
potato O
purée O
and O
trout O
roe, O
seasoned O
with O
a O
briny O
and O
fascinating O
salsa O
of O
chopped O
cucumbers, O
seaweed O
and O
fermented O
serrano O
chiles; O
or O
the O
fried O
cod O
cheeks, O
tender O
and O
crunchy O
over O
an O
orange O
slick O
of O
romesco O
aioli. O
Mr. O
Hernández's O
imagination O
fights O
against O
predictability. O
A O
crab O
salad, O
for O
instance, O
doesn't O
need O
to O
be O
interesting O
if O
it O
is O
fresh, O
but O
the O
one O
at O
Babs O
is O
both. O
It's O
seasoned O
with O
a O
gribiche O
that's O
full O
of O
chopped O
fresh O
dill, O
and O
then O
it's O
piled O
up O
in O
a O
big O
beehive O
on O
top O
of O
a O
smoked O
potato O
pancake. O
Like O
many O
small O
restaurants O
these O
days, O
Babs O
doesn't O
offer O
many O
desserts, O
but O
the O
ones O
it O
does O
are O
far O
more O
intriguing O
than O
average. O
A O
fine O
apple O
galette O
is O
improved O
by O
a O
grating O
of O
Swiss-style O
cheese O
from O
Edelweiss O
Creamery O
in O
Wisconsin O
and O
by O
a O
drizzle O
of O
20-year-old O
Pedro O
Ximénez O
sherry, O
thick O
as O
syrup O
and O
tasting O
like O
chocolate O
and O
coffee. O
Why O
sherry O
with O
Swiss O
cheese? O
I O
don't O
know, O
but O
Mr. O
Hernández O
does. O

Tsismis B-EST
is O
the O
opposite O
of O
a O
speakeasy. B-TYPE
It O
isn't O
hiding O
anything; O
its O
glass O
facade O
on O
Orchard B-LOC
Street I-LOC
wants O
to O
strike O
up O
a O
conversation O
so O
badly O
that O
it O
almost O
follows O
you O
home. O
The O
windows O
are O
stenciled O
with O
cartoon O
characters O
and O
with O
text-message O
bubbles O
that O
call O
out O
in O
English O
("Hello! O
New O
York"), O
Spanish O
("que O
rico!"), O
French O
("bon O
appétit") O
and O
Tagalog O
("masarap," O
for O
delicious). O
The O
language O
lessons O
continue O
on O
the O
front O
door, O
which O
gives O
translations O
for O
"tuloy O
po O
kayo" O
(welcome) O
and O
the O
restaurant's O
name O
(gossip), O
pronounced O
chiss-miss. O
In O
case O
you O
miss O
all O
of O
this, O
a O
sandwich O
board O
straddles O
the O
sidewalk, O
advertising O
discounted O
beer, B-FOOD
wine B-FOOD
and O
wings B-FOOD
at O
the O
bar O
during O
happy O
hour O
("5:thirsty"). O
If O
you O
accept O
the O
facade's O
invitation O
to O
benaquitodits O
(come O
here O
here, O
a O
repetitive O
bit O
of O
Tagalog O
slang), O
the O
conversation O
will O
continue O
inside. O
Tsismis, B-EST
which O
opened O
in O
June, O
is O
a O
chatty O
restaurant. O
At O
times, O
when O
one O
of O
the O
owners O
pulls O
up O
alongside O
your O
table O
and O
expounds O
on O
how O
the O
chef's O
interpretation O
of O
the O
dish O
you're O
trying O
to O
eat O
differs O
from O
what O
you O
might O
find O
in O
the O
Philippines, B-LOC
you O
may O
find O
yourself O
eyeing O
the O
exit. O
If O
you've O
found O
your O
way O
to O
the O
menu's O
strengths, O
though, O
odds O
are O
you O
won't O
want O
to O
go O
anywhere. O
Kinilaw, B-DISH
a O
Filipino B-CUISINE
ceviche B-FOOD
in O
a O
piercingly O
sour O
calamansi B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
cane I-FOOD
vinegar I-FOOD
marinade I-FOOD
with O
a O
jab O
of O
bird's-eye B-FOOD
chile, I-FOOD
is O
worth O
sticking O
around O
for, O
especially O
on O
those O
nights O
when O
it's O
made O
with O
bay B-FOOD
scallops I-FOOD
instead O
of O
fish. B-FOOD
After O
that, O
you O
might O
look O
into O
the O
fried O
pork-and-carrot O
won O
tons O
called O
pinsec O
frito O
(or, O
as O
the O
menu O
has O
them, O
pinsit O
frito). O
They O
are O
typically O
folded O
into O
triangles, O
but O
the O
ones O
at O
Tsismis O
are O
twisted O
into O
little O
cones O
that O
look O
like O
Hershey's O
kisses, O
though O
slightly O
bigger O
and O
golden-brown. O
Once O
they O
stop O
steaming, O
you O
can O
hold O
them O
by O
the O
cowlick O
of O
fried O
wrapper O
at O
the O
top O
and O
swish O
them O
around O
in O
the O
sweet O
chile O
sauce. O
Won O
tons O
with O
the O
same O
filling O
flop O
around O
in O
the O
soup O
called O
pancit O
molo, O
although O
these O
are O
boiled. O
There O
is O
almost O
as O
much O
ground O
pork O
inside O
them O
as O
outside O
in O
the O
broth, O
which O
is O
thick O
with O
garlic O
and O
chopped O
scallions. O
Even O
if O
it's O
well O
after O
5:thirsty O
and O
you're O
not O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar, O
Jappy's O
wings O
are O
worth O
considering. O
Jappy O
is O
the O
chef, O
Jappy O
Afzelius, O
and O
he O
fries O
those O
wings O
with O
thinly O
sliced O
garlic O
and O
sends O
them O
out O
to O
the O
dining O
room O
with O
a O
salsa O
of O
raw O
mangoes, O
charred O
onions O
and O
chiles. O
The O
heat O
of O
the O
salsa O
will O
not O
cause O
your O
shirt O
to O
burst O
into O
flames, O
but O
it O
is O
hot O
enough O
to O
make O
your O
memory O
of O
Jappy's O
wings O
a O
lasting O
one. O
Mr. O
Afzelius O
is O
a O
native O
of O
the O
Philippines O
and O
a O
graduate O
of O
a O
cooking O
academy O
in O
Manila, O
which O
shipped O
him O
off O
to O
Paris O
to O
intern O
in O
one O
of O
Alain O
Ducasse's O
bistros. O
The O
Ducasse O
masterminds O
then O
sent O
him O
to O
work O
at O
Benoit O
in O
New O
York, O
after O
which O
he O
turned O
up O
as O
the O
sous-chef O
at O
a O
Filipino O
restaurant O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
was O
best O
known O
for O
its O
$100 O
doughnut O
-- O
ube-filled, O
Cristal-frosted O
and O
gold-leafed. O
Happily, O
nothing O
at O
Tsismis O
approaches O
that O
level O
of O
look-at-me O
desperation. O
Mr. O
Afzelius's O
cooking O
is O
loose, O
unfussy O
and O
liberated. O
He O
tosses O
tradition O
under O
the O
bus O
when O
it O
suits O
him. O
The O
result O
is O
Filipino-American O
drinking O
food O
that O
tends O
to O
be O
charmingly O
offhand. O
From O
time O
to O
time, O
it O
can O
lean O
toward O
sloppiness. O
One O
night O
the O
fried O
milkfish O
in O
pritong O
isda O
was O
so O
overdone O
that O
even O
topping O
it O
with O
calamansi O
juice, O
fish O
sauce O
and O
a O
crisp, O
juicy O
spoonful O
of O
marinated O
chayote O
on O
top O
didn't O
revive O
it. O
A O
version O
of O
adobong O
manok, O
which O
Mr. O
Afzelius O
makes O
as O
a O
roasted O
chicken O
plus O
a O
soy-turmeric O
sauce O
rather O
than O
an O
all-in-one O
stew, O
would O
have O
been O
more O
successful O
if O
the O
smoked O
eggplant O
hadn't O
been O
so O
undercooked O
it O
squeaked. O
But O
the O
grilled O
eggplant O
on O
top O
of O
the O
kare-kare O
was O
as O
soft O
as O
warm O
marrow, O
and O
the O
other O
vegetables O
-- O
crisp O
green O
beans, O
bok O
choy, O
enoki O
mushrooms O
-- O
made O
a O
refreshing O
counterpoint O
to O
the O
stewed O
oxtails O
in O
thick O
peanut O
sauce. O
Already O
pungent O
with O
shrimp O
paste, O
the O
kare-kare O
comes O
with O
extra O
on O
the O
side O
that O
you O
can O
add O
to O
your O
heart's O
content. O
As O
they O
do O
at O
Bad O
Saint O
in O
Washington, O
probably O
the O
country's O
most O
talked-about O
Filipino O
restaurant, O
Tsismis O
makes O
its O
laing O
by O
simmering O
local O
kale, O
rather O
than O
the O
more O
traditional O
taro O
leaves, O
in O
coconut O
milk. O
And O
if O
this O
version O
doesn't O
have O
the O
perspective-altering O
funk O
of O
Bad O
Saint's, O
it O
still O
draws O
plenty O
of O
depth O
from O
the O
shrimp O
paste O
and O
smoked O
fish O
in O
the O
milk O
and O
the O
big O
handful O
of O
dried O
baby O
shrimp O
dropped O
on O
top. O
By O
this O
point, O
you O
will O
probably O
want O
to O
have O
a O
glass O
in O
your O
hand. O
Housemade O
calamansi O
soda O
sounds O
lovely, O
but O
mine O
was O
a O
little O
flat O
and O
weak. O
In O
lieu O
of O
hard O
spirits, O
sake O
is O
the O
backbone O
of O
most O
of O
the O
cocktails. O
They O
are O
typically O
fleshed O
out O
with O
half O
a O
dozen O
other O
ingredients O
-- O
vermouth, O
Aperol, O
artichoke O
liqueur O
and O
bitters, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
A O
La O
Bira O
-- O
which O
sound O
at O
first O
as O
if O
they O
had O
been O
assembled O
by O
walking O
through O
a O
liquor O
store O
blindfolded, O
but O
which O
after O
a O
closer O
look O
reveal O
a O
degree O
of O
inner O
logic. O
If O
this O
does O
not O
pique O
your O
curiosity, O
the O
list O
of O
wines O
by O
the O
glass O
is O
almost O
long O
enough O
to O
qualify O
Tsismis O
as O
a O
wine O
bar, O
although O
the O
choices O
are O
not O
as O
outré O
as O
they O
are O
across O
the O
street O
at O
Wildair O
. O
In O
a O
city O
crazy O
for O
kakigori O
, O
patbingsu O
and O
other O
varieties O
of O
flavored O
snow, O
Tsismis's O
halo-halo O
will O
probably O
be O
an O
instant O
hit. O
Mr. O
Afzelius O
has O
the O
very O
good O
idea O
of O
putting O
coconut O
sorbet O
where O
the O
shaved O
ice O
would O
usually O
go; O
from O
there O
he O
goes O
to O
town O
with O
coconut O
jellies O
and O
what O
seems O
like O
every O
fresh O
fruit O
he O
can O
put O
his O
hands O
on. O
But O
discerning O
collectors O
of O
Filipino O
sweets O
should O
note O
that O
Tsismis O
serves O
excellent O
silvanas. O
A O
silvana O
is O
either O
a O
shrunken O
cake O
or O
a O
cookie O
with O
big O
ideas, O
depending O
on O
your O
perspective. O
It O
is O
made O
of O
two O
cashew O
meringues O
that O
are O
sandwiched O
together O
with O
buttercream O
and O
then O
painted O
with O
more O
buttercream, O
which O
holds O
cashew O
crumbs O
to O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
whole O
package. O
Once O
frosted O
and O
crumbed, O
it O
has O
to O
be O
refrigerated O
or O
the O
buttercream O
will O
melt O
before O
it O
gets O
inside O
your O
mouth. O
No O
gold O
leaf O
adorns O
the O
silvanas. O
It O
would O
only O
get O
in O
the O
way. O

count O
on O
Peter B-EST

Steak I-EST
House I-EST
in O

produce O
certain O

at O

There O

the O
insistent O
smell O
of O
broiled B-DISH
dry-aged I-DISH
steak I-DISH
that O
hits O
me O
the O
minute O
I O
open O
the O
door O
and O
sometimes O
sooner, O
while O
I'm O
still O
outside O
on O
the O
South B-LOC
Williamsburg I-LOC
sidewalk, O
producing O
a O
raised O
pulse, O
a O
quickening O
of O
the O
senses O
and O
a O
restlessness O
familiar O
to O
anyone O
who O
has O
seen O
a O
tiger O
that O
has O
just O
heard O
the O
approach O
of O

is O
the O
hiss O
of O
butter B-FOOD

melted O

they O
slide O
down O

past O
the O

rib B-DISH
steak I-DISH
and O
their O
charred O
bones, O
to O
make O
a O

The O

will O
spoon O
some O
of O
this O
sizzling O
fat O
over O
the O
meat B-FOOD
he O
has O
just O
plated, O
generally O
with O
some O
line O
like O
"Here O

There O
is O
the O
thunk O
of O
a O
bowl O
filled O
with O
schlag B-FOOD
landing O
on O
a O
bare O
wood O
table O
when O

the O
softer O
tap-tap-tap O
of O

dropped O
one O
at O
a O

And O
after O
I've O
paid, O
there O
is O
the O
unshakable O
sense O
that O
I've O
been O
scammed. O
The O
last O
sensation O
was O
not O
part O
of O
the O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
experience O
when O
I O
started O
eating O
there, O
in O
the O
1990s. O
I O
was O
acutely O
aware O
of O
the O
cost O
back O
then O
because O
I O
would O
settle O
the O
tab O
by O
counting O
out O
$20 O
bills; O
cash O
was O
the O
only O
way O
to O
pay O
unless O
you O
had O
a O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
credit O
card. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
night O
my O
wallet O
would O
be O
empty. O
Because O
a O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
steak B-DISH
made O
me O
feel O
alive O
in O
a O
way O
that O
few O
other O
things O
did, O
I O
considered O
this O
a O
fair O
trade, O
although O
I O
could O
afford O
it O
only O
once O
a O
year O
or O
so. O
I O
don't O
remember O
when O
the O
doubts O
began, O
but O
they O
grew O
over O
time. O
Diners O
who O
walk O
in O
the O
door O
eager O
to O
hand O
over O
literal O
piles O
of O
money O
aren't O
greeted; O
they're O
processed. O
A O
host O
with O
a O
clipboard O
looks O
for O
the O
name, O
or O
writes O
it O
down O
and O
quotes O
a O
waiting O
time. O
There O
is O
almost O
always O
a O
wait, O
with O
or O
without O
a O
reservation, O
and O
there O
is O
almost O
always O
a O
long O
line O
of O
supplicants O
against O
the O
wall. O
A O
kind O
word O
or O
reassuring O
smile O
from O
somebody O
on O
staff O
would O
help O
the O
time O
pass. O
The O
smile O
never O

The O

to O

meal O
at O
Peter B-EST
Luger. I-EST
The O
servers, O
who O
once O
were O
charmingly O
brusque, O
now O
give O
the O
strong O
impression O
that O
these O
endless O
demands O
for O
food O
and O
drink O
are O
all O
that's O
standing O
between O
them O
and O
a O
hard-earned O
nap. O
Signals O
that O
a O
customer O
has O
a O
question O
or O
request O
don't O
get O
picked O
up O
as O
quickly; O
the O
canned O
jokes O
about O
spinach B-FOOD
and O
schlag B-FOOD
don't O
flow O
as O
freely. O
Some O
things O
are O
the O
same O
as O
ever. O
The O
shrimp B-DISH
cocktail I-DISH
has O
always O
tasted O
like O
cold O
latex O
dipped O
in O
ketchup B-FOOD
and O
horseradish. B-FOOD
The O
steak B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
has O
always O
tasted O
like O
the O
same O
ketchup B-FOOD
and O
horseradish B-FOOD
fortified O
by O
corn B-FOOD
syrup. I-FOOD
Although O
the O
fries B-DISH
are O
reasonably O
crisp, O
their O
insides O
are O
mealy O
and O
bland O
in O
a O
way O
that O
fresh-cut O
potatoes B-FOOD
almost O
certainly O
would O
not O
be. O
The O
sole B-DISH
-- O
yes, O
I'm O
the O
person O
who O
ordered O
the O
sole B-DISH
at O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
-- O
was O
strangely O
similar: O
The O
bread B-FOOD
crumbs I-FOOD
on O
top O
were O
gold O
and O
crunchy, O
but O
the O
fish B-FOOD
underneath O
was O
dry O
and O
almost O
powdery. O
Was O
the O
Caesar B-DISH
salad I-DISH
always O
so O
drippy, O
the O
croutons B-FOOD
always O
straight O
out O
of O
a O
bag, O
the O
grated O
cheese B-FOOD
always O
so O
white O
and O
rubbery? O
I O
know O
there O
was O
a O
time O
the O
German B-DISH
fried I-DISH
potatoes I-DISH
were O
brown O
and O
crunchy, O
because O
I O
eagerly O
ate O
them O
each O
time O
I O
went. O
Now O
they O
are O
mushy, O
dingy, O
gray O
and O
sometimes O
cold. O
I O
look O
forward O
to O
them O
the O
way O
I O
look O
forward O
to O
finding O
a O
new, O
irregularly O
shaped O
mole. O

the O
Pete O
Wells O
review O
of O
Peter B-EST
Luger I-EST
.] O
Lunch O
one O
afternoon O
vividly O
demonstrated O
the O
kitchen's O
inconsistency: O
I O
ordered O
a O
burger, B-DISH
medium-rare, O
at O
the O
bar. O
So O
had O
the O
two O
people O
sitting O
to O
my O
right, O
it O
turned O
out. O
One O
of O
them O
got O
what O
we'd O
all O
asked O
for, O
a O
midnight-dark O
crust O
giving O
way O
to O
an O
evenly O
rosy O
interior O
so O
full O
of O
juices O
it O
looked O
like O
it O
was O
ready O
to O
cry. O
The O
other O
one O
got O
a O
patty B-FOOD
that O
was O
almost O
completely O
brown O
inside. O
I O
got O
a O
weird O
hybrid, O
a O
burger B-FOOD
whose O
interior O
shaded O
from O
nearly O
perfect O
on O
one O
side O
to O
gray O
and O
hard O
on O
the O
other. O
The O
same O
issue O
afflicted O
a O
medium-rare B-DISH
porterhouse I-DISH
I O
was O
served O
one O
night: O
The O
fillet B-FOOD
was O
ideal O
but O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
T-bone, B-FOOD
the O
strip, B-FOOD
ranged O
from O
medium-rare O
to O
medium-well. O
I O
could O
live O
with O
this; O
big O
cuts O
of O
meat O
don't O
always O
cook O
evenly. O
What O
gnaws O
at O
me O
every O
time O
I O
eat O
a O
Luger B-EST
porterhouse B-DISH
is O
the O
realization O
that O
it's O
just O
another O
steak, B-FOOD
and O
far O
from O
the O
best O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
has O
to O
offer. O
[ O
Melissa O
Clark O
shows O
you O
how O
to O
cook O
a O
steak B-FOOD
at O
home O
. O
] O
Other O
restaurants, O
and O
not O
just O
steakhouses, B-TYPE
can O
put O
a O
formidable O
crust O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
cut; O
Luger B-EST
caramelizes O
the O
top O
side O
only, O
while O
the O
underside O
is O
barely O
past O
raw, O
as O
if O
it O
had O
done O
all O
its O
cooking O
on O
the O
hot O
platter. O
Other O
restaurants, O
and O
not O
just O
steakhouses, B-TYPE
buy O
beef B-FOOD
that O
is O
tender, O
richly O
marbled O
and O
deeply O
flavorful; O
at O
Luger, B-EST
you O
get O
the O
first O
two O
but O
not O
the O
third. O
Other O
restaurants, O
and O
not O
just O
steakhouses, B-TYPE
age O
that O
beef B-FOOD
to O
make O
flavor O
grow O
and O
intensify O
and O
double O
back O
on O
itself; O
dry-aging O
at O
Luger B-EST
still O
results O
in O
a O
tender O
steak, B-FOOD
but O
it O
rarely O
achieves O
a O
hypnotic O
or O
compelling O
or O
even O
very O
interesting O
one. O
But O
those O
other O
restaurants O
are O
not O
Peter B-EST
Luger, I-EST
as O
Friedrich O
Nietzsche O
might O
have O
said. O
"When O
in O
this O
essay O
I O
declare O
war O
upon O
Wagner," O
Nietzsche O
wrote O
in O
" O
The O
Case O
of O
Wagner O
," O
"the O
last O
thing O
I O
want O
to O
do O
is O
start O
a O
celebration O
for O
any O
other O
musicians. O
Other O
musicians O
don't O
count O
compared O
to O
Wagner." O
I O
could O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
about O
other O
steakhouses B-TYPE
-- O
compared O
to O
Peter B-EST
Luger, I-EST
they O
don't O
count. O
Luger B-EST
is O
not O
the O
city's O
oldest, O
but O
it's O
the O
one O
in O
which O
age, O
tradition, O
superb O
beef, B-FOOD
blistering O
heat, O
an O
instinctive O
avoidance O
of O
anything O
fancy O
and O
an O
immensely O
attractive O
self-assurance O
came O
together O
to O
produce O
something O
that O
felt O
less O
like O
a O
restaurant O
than O
an O
affirmation O
of O
life, O
or O
at O
least O
life O
as O
it O
is O
lived O
in O
New O
York O
City. O
This O
sounds O
ridiculously O
grand. O
Years O
ago O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
true, O
though, O
and O
so O
did O
other O
people. O
The O
restaurant O
will O
always O
have O
its O
loyalists. O
They O
will O
laugh O
away O
the O
prices, O
the O
$16.95 O
sliced O
tomatoes O
that O
taste O
like O
1979, O
the O
$229.80 O
porterhouse O
for O
four. O
They O
will O
say O
that O
nobody O
goes O
to O
Luger O
for O
the O
sole, O
nobody O
goes O
to O
Luger O
for O
the O
wine, O
nobody O
goes O
to O
Luger O
for O
the O
salad, O
nobody O
goes O
to O
Luger O
for O
the O
service. O
The O
list O
goes O
on, O
and O
gets O
harder O
to O
swallow, O
until O
you O
start O
to O
wonder O
who O
really O
needs O
to O
go O
to O
Peter O
Luger, O
and O
start O
to O
think O
the O
answer O
is O
nobody. O

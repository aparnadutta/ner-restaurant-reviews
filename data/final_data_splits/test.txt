Lately O O O
I O O O
have O O O
fallen O O O
under O O O
the O O O
spell O O O
of O O O
an O O O
East B-LOC B-LOC B-LOC

restaurant O O O
called O O O
Foxface B-EST B-EST B-EST
. O O O
The O O O
cooking O O O
there O O O
is O O O
hard O O O
to O O O
pin O O O
down, O O O
geographically. O O O
Stopping O O O

The O O O
soft B-DISH O O
tripe I-DISH B-FOOD B-DISH
I O O O
enjoyed O O O
the O O O
other O O O
weekend O O O
had O O O
been O O O
simmered O O O
with O O O
'nduja, O O O
the O O O
fiery O O O
and O O O
malleable O O O
Calabrian O O O
sausage, O O O
and O O O
then O O O
covered O O O
with O O O
a O O O
few O O O
thin O O O
shingles O O O
of O O O
shaved O O O
pecorino. O O O
If O O O
I O O O
had O O O
started O O O
hanging O O O
around O O O
at O O O
Foxface O O O
sooner, O O O
especially O O O
during O O O
the O O O
cold O O O
months O O O
after O O O
its O O O
opening, O O O
in O O O
February, O O O
I O O O
might O O O
have O O O
run O O O
into O O O
a O O O
wider O O O
variety O O O
of O O O
cuisines O O O
and O O O
main O O O
ingredients. O O O
I O O O
did O O O
manage O O O
to O O O
get O O O
some O O O
of O O O
the O O O
elk O O O
osso O O O
buco O O O
while O O O
that O O O
was O O O
still O O O
on O O O
the O O O
menu. O O O
I O O O
never O O O
got O O O
to O O O
try O O O
the O O O
wild O O O
hare, O O O
though, O O O
stewed O O O
in O O O
red O O O
wine O O O
with O O O
a O O O
bit O O O
of O O O
chocolate O O O
and O O O
thickened O O O
with O O O
its O O O
own O O O
blood, O O O
a O O O
formula O O O
that O O O
students O O O
of O O O
very O O O
old-guard O O O
French O O O
cooking O O O
will O O O
recognize O O O
as O O O
lièvre O O O
à O O O
la O O O
royale. O O O
Nor O O O
did O O O
I O O O
make O O O
it O O O
in O O O
time O O O
for O O O
the O O O
venison, O O O
left O O O
to O O O
bubble O O O
for O O O
hours O O O
in O O O
white O O O
wine O O O
with O O O
mushrooms O O O
and O O O
dark O O O
juniper O O O
berries. O O O
The O O O
Foxface O O O
dish O O O
I O O O
may O O O
never O O O
forgive O O O
myself O O O
for O O O
missing, O O O
though, O O O
is O O O
the O O O
kebabs O O O
served O O O
with O O O
preserved O O O
lemons O O O
and O O O
tahini, O O O
because O O O
the O O O
kebabs O O O
were O O O
made O O O
from O O O
ground O O O
lamb O O O
and O O O
camel. O O O
Although O O O
these O O O
foods O O O
may O O O
lack O O O
any O O O
unifying O O O
cultural O O O
background, O O O
they O O O
did O O O
have O O O
one O O O
thing O O O
in O O O
common: O O O
They O O O
were O O O
all O O O
served O O O
on O O O
rolls. O O O
Apart O O O
from O O O
an O O O
occasional O O O
salad O O O
or O O O
soup, O O O
everything O O O
cooked O O O
at O O O
Foxface O O O
arrives O O O
in O O O
sandwich O O O
form. O O O
And O O O
with O O O
the O O O
exception O O O
of O O O
a O O O
muffuletta O O O
that O O O
briefly O O O
manifested O O O
a O O O
few O O O
months O O O
back, O O O
every O O O
sandwich O O O
at O O O
Foxface O O O
is O O O
filled O O O
with O O O
hot, O O O
cooked O O O
meat O O O
or O O O
seafood O O O
or O O O
vegetables. O O O
In O O O
Mexico, O O O
certain O O O
taco O O O
stands O O O
specialize O O O
in O O O
tacos O O O
de O O O
guisado, O O O
tortillas O O O
filled O O O
with O O O
one O O O
kind O O O
of O O O
stew O O O
or O O O
another. O O O
Most O O O
of O O O
Foxface's O O O
offerings O O O
are, O O O
in O O O
effect, O O O
sandwiches O O O
de O O O
guisado. O O O
Which O O O
reminds O O O
me O O O
of O O O
another O O O
impressive O O O
Foxface O O O
sandwich, O O O
a O O O
magenta O O O
and O O O
green O O O
tangle O O O
of O O O
cilantro O O O
stems O O O
and O O O
pickled O O O
onions O O O
pressed O O O
into O O O
an O O O
engagingly O O O
tart O O O
pile O O O
of O O O
pork, O O O
marinated O O O
in O O O
sour O O O
orange O O O
juice O O O
and O O O
roasted O O O
very O O O
slowly O O O
under O O O
a O O O
banana O O O
leaf O O O
in O O O
emulation O O O
of O O O
cochinita O O O
pibil O O O
from O O O
the O O O
Yucatán. O O O
There O O O
is O O O
no O O O
guarantee O O O
that O O O
any O O O
of O O O
these O O O
items O O O
will O O O
be O O O
available O O O
when O O O
you O O O
go O O O
to O O O
Foxface. O O O
The O O O
menu O O O
is O O O
printed O O O
daily O O O
and O O O
taped O O O
up O O O
next O O O
to O O O
the O O O
window O O O
on O O O
St. O O O
Marks O O O
Place O O O
where O O O
most O O O
of O O O
the O O O
business O O O
is O O O
transacted. O O O
Sometimes O O O
a O O O
new O O O
sandwich O O O
appears O O O
after O O O
the O O O
printed O O O
menu O O O
has O O O
already O O O
been O O O
posted, O O O
so O O O
it O O O
will O O O
be O O O
written O O O
out O O O
by O O O
hand O O O
on O O O
a O O O
card O O O
that O O O
has O O O
in O O O
its O O O
upper O O O
left O O O
corner O O O
the O O O
restaurant's O O O
logo, O O O
a O O O
drawing O O O
of O O O
an O O O
elegant O O O
fox O O O
in O O O
cat's-eye O O O
glasses O O O
with O O O
a O O O
cigarette O O O
holder O O O
in O O O
one O O O
gloved O O O
hand. O O O
The O O O
sandwiches O O O
have O O O
names O O O
like O O O
It's O O O
What's O O O
'Nside O O O
(for O O O
the O O O
tripe O O O
with O O O
'nduja) O O O
or O O O
120 O O O
BPM O O O
(bison O O O
heart O O O
with O O O
tahini O O O
and O O O
"many O O O
spices"). O O O
The O O O
Smoking O O O
Fox O O O
is O O O
sold O O O
every O O O
day. O O O
It O O O
is O O O
filled O O O
with O O O
smoked O O O
pork O O O
rib O O O
the O O O
color O O O
of O O O
a O O O
dry O O O
rosé, O O O
separated O O O
from O O O
the O O O
bones O O O
and O O O
covered O O O
with O O O
coleslaw, O O O
pickles O O O
and O O O
a O O O
few O O O
splashes O O O
of O O O
habanero-orange O O O
vinegar. O O O
Your O O O
mind, O O O
of O O O
course, O O O
goes O O O
either O O O
to O O O
Memphis O O O
or O O O
to O O O
the O O O
McRib O O O
, O O O
and O O O
neither O O O
is O O O
exactly O O O
wrong, O O O
but O O O
the O O O
meat O O O
is O O O
of O O O
a O O O
superior O O O
grade O O O
and O O O
is O O O
smoked O O O
with O O O
the O O O
attention O O O
to O O O
timing O O O
and O O O
nuance O O O
that O O O
characterizes O O O
Foxface's O O O
cooking. O O O
It's O O O
a O O O
great O O O
sandwich. O O O
To O O O
place O O O
an O O O
order, O O O
you O O O
lean O O O
in O O O
to O O O
the O O O
window O O O
and O O O
speak O O O
with O O O
Sivan O O O
Lahat, O O O
who O O O
owns O O O
and O O O
runs O O O
Foxface O O O
with O O O
Ori O O O
Kushnir, O O O
her O O O
partner O O O
in O O O
life O O O
and O O O
in O O O
sandwiches. O O O
They O O O
immigrated O O O
to O O O
New O O O
York O O O
from O O O
Israel O O O
almost O O O
20 O O O
years O O O
ago O O O
and O O O
have O O O
lived O O O
here O O O
ever O O O
since, O O O
apart O O O
from O O O
a O O O
brief O O O
flirtation O O O
with O O O
the O O O
Midwest O O O
and O O O
a O O O
longer O O O
experimental O O O
period O O O
in O O O
Tokyo. O O O
While O O O
they O O O
were O O O
in O O O
Japan, O O O
they O O O
operated O O O
a O O O
pop-up O O O
restaurant, O O O
which O O O
is O O O
the O O O
closest O O O
either O O O
of O O O
them O O O
came O O O
to O O O
running O O O
a O O O
food O O O
business O O O
before O O O
opening O O O
Foxface. O O O
Like O O O
the O O O
fox O O O
in O O O
the O O O
logo, O O O
Ms. O O O
Lahat O O O
has O O O
coppery O O O
hair O O O
and O O O
wears O O O
cat's-eye O O O
glasses. O O O
She O O O
prepares O O O
the O O O
orders O O O
in O O O
the O O O
room O O O
behind O O O
the O O O
window, O O O
which O O O
measures O O O
48 O O O
square O O O
feet. O O O
Inside O O O
the O O O
building, O O O
under O O O
the O O O
stairs, O O O
Foxface O O O
has O O O
a O O O
second O O O
room. O O O
Mr. O O O
Kushnir O O O
thinks O O O
it O O O
could O O O
be O O O
as O O O
large O O O
as O O O
14 O O O
square O O O
feet. O O O
A O O O
variety O O O
of O O O
equipment O O O
is O O O
stowed O O O
in O O O
the O O O
two O O O
rooms, O O O
including O O O
three O O O
induction O O O
burners, O O O
a O O O
roaster, O O O
a O O O
smoker O O O
and O O O
a O O O
dishwasher. O O O
After O O O
business O O O
hours, O O O
some O O O
of O O O
it O O O
comes O O O
out O O O
as O O O
Mr. O O O
Kushnir O O O
supervises O O O
the O O O
more O O O
time-consuming O O O
roasts O O O
and O O O
stews. O O O
He O O O
describes O O O
the O O O
food O O O
that O O O
he O O O
and O O O
Ms. O O O
Lahat O O O
cook O O O
as O O O
"dishes O O O
we O O O
like O O O
to O O O
eat, O O O
reimagined O O O
as O O O
sandwiches." O O O
I O O O
like O O O
to O O O
eat O O O
a O O O
lot O O O
of O O O
the O O O
same O O O
dishes, O O O
as O O O
it O O O
happens, O O O
but O O O
they O O O
have O O O
been O O O
hard O O O
to O O O
come O O O
by O O O
lately, O O O
especially O O O
those O O O
shapeless O O O
brown O O O
stews O O O
that O O O
are O O O
so O O O
out O O O
of O O O
style. O O O
Following O O O
some O O O
of O O O
the O O O
world's O O O
most O O O
influential O O O
chefs O O O
and O O O
shamed, O O O
perhaps, O O O
by O O O
the O O O
unflattering O O O
lenses O O O
of O O O
a O O O
million O O O
amateur O O O
photographers, O O O
restaurants O O O
have O O O
shifted O O O
away O O O
from O O O
plain O O O
and O O O
plain-looking O O O
cooking. O O O
The O O O
subtlety O O O
and O O O
the O O O
thrill O O O
of O O O
plain O O O
cooking O O O
comes O O O
from O O O
searing, O O O
simmering, O O O
reducing, O O O
skimming O O O
and O O O
so O O O
on. O O O
All O O O
the O O O
people O O O
who O O O
own O O O
Instant O O O
Pots O O O
know O O O
this, O O O
but O O O
the O O O
segment O O O
of O O O
the O O O
restaurant O O O
scene O O O
with O O O
artistic O O O
leanings O O O
has O O O
forgotten O O O
it, O O O
focusing O O O
instead O O O
on O O O
plating, O O O
arranging O O O
six O O O
or O O O
seven O O O
things O O O
in O O O
some O O O
photogenic O O O
design O O O
and O O O
hoping O O O
they O O O
will O O O
cohere. O O O
Slapping O O O
a O O O
roll O O O
on O O O
it O O O
is O O O
one O O O
way O O O
to O O O
get O O O
a O O O
shapeless O O O
brown O O O
stew O O O
ready O O O
for O O O
its O O O
close-up, O O O
although O O O
it O O O
has O O O
to O O O
be O O O
said O O O
that O O O
on O O O
the O O O
mean O O O
streets O O O
of O O O
Instagram, O O O
an O O O
elk O O O
osso O O O
buco O O O
sandwich O O O
is O O O
no O O O
match O O O
for O O O
a O O O
rainbow O O O
unicorn O O O
ice O O O
cream O O O
sundae. O O O
Because O O O
space O O O
is O O O
at O O O
a O O O
premium, O O O
there O O O
is O O O
no O O O
room O O O
to O O O
sit O O O
and O O O
eat O O O
your O O O
Smoking O O O
Fox O O O
at O O O
Foxface O O O
itself. O O O
You O O O
can, O O O
however, O O O
take O O O
it O O O
to O O O
a O O O
table O O O
a O O O
few O O O
steps O O O
away O O O
inside O O O
an O O O
adjoining O O O
business O O O
called O O O
the O O O
William O O O
Barnacle O O O
Tavern O O O
. O O O
This O O O
is O O O
a O O O
reassuringly O O O
gloomy O O O
bar O O O
that O O O
is O O O
said O O O
to O O O
have O O O
originated O O O
as O O O
a O O O
speakeasy. O O O
Model O O O
ships O O O

are O O O
strewn O O O

operation O O O
a O O O
former O O O
owner O O O
of O O O
the O O O

presided O O O
over O O O
during O O O
Prohibition. O O O
(The O O O
stairs O O O
that O O O
Foxface's O O O

lead O O O
to O O O

called O O O
the O O O

.) O O O
The O O O
bar's O O O
current O O O
owner O O O
has O O O
resisted O O O
some O O O
modern O O O
conveniences. O O O
Most O O O
of O O O
the O O O
lighting O O O
at O O O
night O O O
comes O O O
from O O O
small O O O
candles, O O O
and O O O
all O O O
of O O O
the O O O
music O O O
is O O O
provided O O O
by O O O
old O O O

-- O O O
of O O O
Irish O O O

-- O O O
that O O O
run O O O
in O O O
looping, O O O
watery O O O
projections O O O
on O O O
the O O O
back O O O
wall. O O O
All O O O
Foxface O O O
sandwiches O O O
are O O O
presented O O O
in O O O
a O O O
trim O O O
little O O O
white O O O
box O O O
that O O O
can O O O

can O O O
purchase O O O
an O O O

for O O O
$3 O O O
from O O O
Foxface, O O O
or O O O
buy O O O
alcohol O O O
from O O O
the O O O
tavern. O O O
The O O O
beer O O O
is O O O
not O O O
expensive, O O O
but O O O
the O O O
specialty O O O
of O O O
the O O O
house O O O
is O O O
absinthe. O O O
Most O O O
patrons O O O
drink O O O
theirs O O O

a O O O

absinthe O O O
fountain O O O
at O O O
the O O O
end O O O
of O O O
the O O O
bar. O O O
The O O O
bartender O O O
will O O O
make O O O
absinthe O O O
cocktails, O O O
too, O O O
including O O O
the O O O
one O O O
Ernest O O O

it O O O
is O O O
what O O O
I O O O
intend O O O
to O O O

Four N/A O O
summers N/A O O
ago, N/A O O
a N/A O O
young N/A O O
chef N/A O O
named N/A O O
José N/A O O
Luis N/A O O
Chávez N/A O O
began N/A O O
leveraging N/A O O
the N/A O O
poke N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
craze N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
salad-bowl N/A B-FOOD O
trend N/A O O
into N/A O O
a N/A O O
string N/A O O
of N/A O O
fast-casual N/A B-TYPE O
ceviche N/A O B-TYPE
bars. N/A O I-TYPE
He N/A O O
began N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
counter N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
Gansevoort N/A O B-EST
Market N/A O I-EST
food N/A O B-TYPE
hall N/A O I-TYPE
called N/A O O
Mission N/A O B-EST
Ceviche N/A O I-EST
; N/A O O
there N/A O O
is N/A O O
now N/A O O
another N/A O O
in N/A O O
Canal N/A O B-LOC
Street N/A O I-LOC
Market N/A O I-LOC
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
third N/A O O
is N/A O O
supposed N/A O O
to N/A O O
open N/A O O
in N/A O O
Norwalk, N/A O B-LOC
Conn., N/A O I-LOC
later N/A O O
this N/A O O
year. N/A O O
At N/A O O
all N/A O O
locations, N/A O O
the N/A O O
stock-in-trade N/A O O
is N/A O O
citrus-marinated N/A O B-DISH
raw N/A O I-DISH
fish N/A O I-DISH
with N/A O O
sweet N/A O B-FOOD
potatoes N/A O I-FOOD
and N/A O O
kernels N/A O O
of N/A O O
chubby N/A O O
Andean N/A O B-FOOD
corn, N/A O I-FOOD
in N/A O O
both N/A O O
its N/A O O
soft N/A O O
and N/A O O
crunchy N/A O O
forms. N/A O O
This N/A O O
is N/A O O
of N/A O O
course N/A O O
the N/A O O
standard N/A O O
Peruvian N/A O B-CUISINE
formula, N/A O O
but N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Chávez N/A O O
had N/A O O
the N/A O O
inspiration N/A O O
of N/A O O
serving N/A O O
his N/A O O
ceviche N/A O B-FOOD
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
clear N/A O O
plastic N/A O O
bowl N/A O O
over N/A O O
a N/A O O
base N/A O O
of N/A O O
salad, N/A O B-FOOD
rice N/A O B-FOOD
or, N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O
dollar N/A O O
more, N/A O O
quinoa. N/A O B-FOOD
The N/A O O
supplemental N/A O O
ingredients N/A O O
make N/A O O
a N/A O O
plausible N/A O O
desk N/A O O
lunch N/A O O
out N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
dish N/A O O
that N/A O O
some N/A O O
New N/A O O
Yorkers N/A O O
still N/A O O
aren't N/A O O
quite N/A O O
sure N/A O O
what N/A O O
to N/A O O
do N/A O O
with. N/A O O
The N/A O O
surprising N/A O O
thing N/A O O
about N/A O O
Mission N/A O B-EST
Ceviche's N/A O I-EST
salad N/A O B-FOOD
bowls N/A O I-FOOD
is N/A O O
that N/A O O
they N/A O O
taste N/A O O
like N/A O O
real N/A O O
Peruvian N/A O B-CUISINE
food. N/A O O
The N/A O O
raw N/A O B-FOOD
fish N/A O I-FOOD
is N/A O O
firm N/A O O
and N/A O O
cold N/A O O
and N/A O O
neatly N/A O O
cut N/A O O
up N/A O O
into N/A O O
solid N/A O O
pieces N/A O O
that N/A O O
hold N/A O O
their N/A O O
shape. N/A O O

in N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Chávez's N/A O O
"ceviche N/A O B-DISH
clásico" N/A O I-DISH
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
bright N/A O O
and N/A O O
precise N/A O O
cocktail N/A O O
of N/A O O
lime N/A O B-FOOD
and N/A O O
rocoto N/A O B-FOOD
chiles, N/A O I-FOOD
although N/A O O
you N/A O O
might N/A O O
wish N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
rocotos N/A O B-FOOD
had N/A O O
been N/A O O
applied N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
little N/A O O
less N/A O O
restraint. N/A O O
You N/A O O
get N/A O O
a N/A O O
higher-caliber N/A O O
shot N/A O O
of N/A O O
spice, N/A O O
this N/A O O
time N/A O O
from N/A O O
ají N/A O B-FOOD
amarillo N/A O I-FOOD
chiles, N/A O I-FOOD
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
ceviche N/A O B-DISH

a N/A O O
combination N/A O O
of N/A O O
octopus, N/A O B-FOOD
shrimp N/A O B-FOOD
and N/A O O

enveloped N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
creamy, N/A O O
goldenrod-colored N/A O O
leche N/A O B-FOOD

The N/A O O
clásico N/A O B-DISH
is N/A O O
accessorized N/A O O
with N/A O O
sweet N/A O B-FOOD
potato N/A O I-FOOD
purée; N/A O I-FOOD
the N/A O O
mixto N/A O B-DISH
gets N/A O O
avocado N/A O B-FOOD
purée, N/A O I-FOOD
too. N/A O O
The N/A O O
purées N/A O O
are N/A O O
piped N/A O O
out N/A O O
of N/A O O
pastry N/A O O
bags N/A O O
like N/A O O
buttercream N/A O B-FOOD
roses N/A O I-FOOD
on N/A O O
a N/A O O
wedding N/A O B-FOOD
cake, N/A O I-FOOD
and N/A O O
they N/A O O
are N/A O O
delicious. N/A O O
When N/A O O
I N/A O O
wandered N/A O O
into N/A O O
the N/A O O
Gansevoort N/A O B-EST
Market N/A O I-EST
location N/A O O
in N/A O O
February, N/A O O
it N/A O O
seemed N/A O O
clear N/A O O
that N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Chávez N/A O O
could N/A O O
run N/A O O
an N/A O O
interesting N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
if N/A O O
he N/A O O
ever N/A O O
decided N/A O O
to N/A O O
put N/A O O
his N/A O O
food N/A O O
into N/A O O
something N/A O O
other N/A O O
than N/A O O
recyclable N/A O O
salad N/A O O
bowls. N/A O O
Then, N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
beginning N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
summer, N/A O O
he N/A O O
did N/A O O
just N/A O O
that, N/A O O
opening N/A O O
a N/A O O
sit-down N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
Upper N/A O B-LOC
East N/A O I-LOC
Side N/A O I-LOC
with N/A O O
real N/A O O
plates N/A O O
and N/A O O
bowls. N/A O O
The N/A O O
new N/A O O
space N/A O O
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
particularly N/A O O
large N/A O O
or N/A O O
lavish, N/A O O
but N/A O O
compared N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
earlier N/A O O
efforts, N/A O O
Mission N/A O B-EST
Ceviche N/A O I-EST
Restaurant N/A O I-EST
& N/A O I-EST
Bar N/A O I-EST
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
palace. N/A O O
There N/A O O
is N/A O O
seating N/A O O
for N/A O O
65 N/A O O
or N/A O O
so N/A O O
people N/A O O
beneath N/A O O
a N/A O O
wall N/A O O
sculpture N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
fish N/A O O
that N/A O O
glows N/A O O
from N/A O O
behind N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
pink N/A O O
neon N/A O O
sign N/A O O
that N/A O O
reads N/A O O
"tiger N/A O O
milk N/A O O
effect," N/A O O
probably N/A O O
a N/A O O
reference N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
belief N/A O O
that N/A O O
drinking N/A O O
leftover N/A O O
leche N/A O B-FOOD
de N/A O I-FOOD
tigre N/A O I-FOOD
can N/A O O
put N/A O O
extra N/A O O
topspin N/A O O
on N/A O O
sexual N/A O O
performance. N/A O O
The N/A O O
menu N/A O O
now N/A O O
paints N/A O O
a N/A O O
slightly N/A O O
fuller N/A O O
picture N/A O O
of N/A O O
Peruvian N/A O B-CUISINE
cuisine, N/A O O
extending N/A O O
into N/A O O
new N/A O O
foods N/A O O
including N/A O O
the N/A O O
grilled N/A O O
skewers N/A O O
known N/A O O
as N/A O O
anticuchos. N/A O B-FOOD
Mr. N/A O O

most N/A O O

anticucho, N/A O B-FOOD
grilled N/A O B-DISH

brushing N/A O O
it N/A O O

is N/A O I-FOOD
so N/A O O
solidly N/A O O
Peruvian N/A O B-CUISINE
that N/A O O
it N/A O O
can N/A O O
withstand N/A O O
the N/A O O
chimichurri N/A O B-FOOD
that N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Chávez N/A O O
brings N/A O O
in, N/A O O
by N/A O O
way N/A O O
of N/A O O
Argentina, N/A O B-LOC
as N/A O O
a N/A O O
final N/A O O
touch. N/A O O
He N/A O O
clearly N/A O O
has N/A O O
a N/A O O
soft N/A O O
spot N/A O O
for N/A O O
chimichurri N/A O B-FOOD
because N/A O O
he N/A O O
deploys N/A O O
it N/A O O
again N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
shrimp N/A O B-DISH
anticuchos N/A O I-DISH
(the N/A O O
shrimp N/A O B-FOOD
are N/A O O
very N/A O O
big N/A O O
and N/A O O
look N/A O O
even N/A O O
bigger N/A O O
because N/A O O
they're N/A O O
grilled N/A O O
with N/A O O
their N/A O O
heads N/A O O
on), N/A O O
served N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
squirt N/A O O
of N/A O O
huancaína, N/A O B-FOOD
the N/A O O
spicy N/A O O
yellow N/A O O
cheese N/A O B-FOOD
sauce N/A O I-FOOD
that N/A O O
is N/A O O
something N/A O O
like N/A O O
Peru's N/A O B-LOC
version N/A O O
of N/A O O
queso N/A O B-FOOD
dip. N/A O I-FOOD
My N/A O O
favorite N/A O O
anticucho N/A O B-FOOD
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
more N/A O O
straightforward N/A O O
situation, N/A O O
grilled N/A O B-DISH
scallops N/A O I-DISH
under N/A O I-DISH
arugula, N/A O I-DISH

a N/A O I-DISH
smooth N/A O I-DISH
Parmesan N/A O I-DISH
fondue. N/A O I-DISH
But N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Chávez N/A O O
has N/A O O
the N/A O O
ability N/A O O
to N/A O O
put N/A O O
several N/A O O
flavors N/A O O
in N/A O O
motion N/A O O
at N/A O O
once N/A O O
and N/A O O
keep N/A O O
his N/A O O
balance, N/A O O
as N/A O O

Ceviche's N/A O O

while N/A O O
eager N/A O O
to N/A O O

have N/A O O
a N/A O O
habit N/A O O
of N/A O O
singling N/A O O
out N/A O O
the N/A O O
most N/A O O
obvious N/A O O
dishes N/A O O
-- N/A O O
the N/A O O
classic N/A O B-DISH
ceviche, N/A O I-DISH
the N/A O O
octopus N/A O O
leg N/A O O
-- N/A O O
and N/A O O
pushing N/A O O
them N/A O O
so N/A O O
hard N/A O O
you N/A O O
might N/A O O
suspect N/A O O
the N/A O O
rest N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
minefield. N/A O O
It N/A O O
isn't. N/A O O
There N/A O O
is N/A O O
nothing N/A O O
to N/A O O
avoid N/A O O
unless N/A O O
the N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
brings N/A O O
back N/A O O
the N/A O O
bizarre N/A O O
strawberry-kiwi N/A O O
ceviche N/A O O
that N/A O O
showed N/A O O
up N/A O O
as N/A O O
a N/A O O
special N/A O O
one N/A O O
night. N/A O O
If N/A O O
you N/A O O
are N/A O O
being N/A O O
herded N/A O O
into N/A O O
getting N/A O O
the N/A O O
"Peruvian N/A O O
paella," N/A O O
you N/A O O
should N/A O O
know N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
other N/A O O
three N/A O O
main N/A O O
courses N/A O O
are N/A O O
also N/A O O
worth N/A O O
looking N/A O O
into, N/A O O
like N/A O O
the N/A O O
ají N/A O O
de N/A O O
gallina, N/A O O
shredded N/A O O
chicken N/A O O
breast N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
creamy N/A O O
ají N/A O O

sauce N/A O O
that N/A O O
is N/A O O
both N/A O O
soothing N/A O O
and N/A O O
spicy; N/A O O
or N/A O O
the N/A O O
seco N/A O O

a N/A O O
slowly N/A O O
braised N/A O O
short N/A O O

cilantro N/A O O
sauce. N/A O O
All N/A O O
are N/A O O
larger N/A O O
than N/A O O
average, N/A O O
too. N/A O O
Still, N/A O O
nothing N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
quite N/A O O
rivals N/A O O
the N/A O O
ceviches. N/A O O
They N/A O O
are N/A O O
served, N/A O O
yes, N/A O O
without N/A O O
lettuce N/A O O
or N/A O O
rice, N/A O O
and N/A O O
they N/A O O
are N/A O O
better N/A O O
for N/A O O
it. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O

and N/A O O
he N/A O O
has N/A O O
come N/A O O
up N/A O O
with N/A O O
different N/A O O
ways N/A O O
to N/A O O
present N/A O O
dishes N/A O O
that N/A O O

The N/A O O

watermelon N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
bloop N/A O O
of N/A O O
ginger N/A O O

Neither N/A O O

intriguing N/A O O
attempt N/A O O
at N/A O O
a N/A O O
vegetarian N/A O O
ceviche N/A O O
where N/A O O
the N/A O O
fish N/A O O
is N/A O O
replaced N/A O O
by N/A O O
shiitakes N/A O O

the N/A O O

The N/A O O

has N/A O O
at N/A O O
least N/A O O
as N/A O O

in N/A O O
common N/A O O
with N/A O O
mixology N/A O O
as N/A O O
with N/A O O
cooking, N/A O O
so N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
no N/A O O
surprise N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
cocktails N/A O O
are N/A O O
well N/A O O
calibrated N/A O O
and N/A O O
sing N/A O O
out N/A O O
with N/A O O
fresh N/A O O
lime. N/A O O
There N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
twist N/A O O

another N/A O O

the N/A O O
purple-corn N/A O O
drink N/A O O
chicha N/A O O
morada, N/A O O
although N/A O O
neither N/A O O
quite N/A O O
achieves N/A O O
the N/A O O
bracing N/A O O
elegance N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
original. N/A O O
And N/A O O
it's N/A O O
nice N/A O O
to N/A O O
see N/A O O
the N/A O O
less N/A O O
well-known N/A O O

(Would N/A O O

be N/A O O
better?) N/A O O
Chicha N/A O O

appears N/A O O
again N/A O O

the N/A O O
raspadilla N/A O O

This, N/A O O
it N/A O O
hardly N/A O O

"What N/A O O

a N/A O O

The N/A O O

to N/A O O
be N/A O O
Art N/A O O

with N/A O O
a N/A O O

A N/A O O
guest N/A O O
who N/A O O
has N/A O O
lived N/A O O
in N/A O O
China N/A O O
allowed N/A O O
his N/A O O
eyes N/A O O
to N/A O O
adjust N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
glinting N/A O O
light N/A O O
as N/A O O
he N/A O O
looked N/A O O
toward N/A O O
the N/A O O
ceiling, N/A O O
which N/A O O
seemed N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
far N/A O O
away. N/A O O
"It's N/A O O
very N/A O O
… N/A O O
yin," N/A O O
he N/A O O
said. N/A O O
Hutong N/A O O
is N/A O O
ostensibly N/A O O
a N/A O O
Northern N/A O O
Chinese N/A O O
restaurant. N/A O O
This N/A O O
is N/A O O
more N/A O O
apparent N/A O O
in N/A O O
Hong N/A O O
Kong N/A O O
than N/A O O
in N/A O O
Manhattan, N/A O O
where N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
has N/A O O
been N/A O O
pruned N/A O O
to N/A O O
about N/A O O
half N/A O O
the N/A O O
size. N/A O O
Lamb, N/A O O
a N/A O O
mainstay N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
northern N/A O O
provinces, N/A O O
was N/A O O
represented N/A O O
in N/A O O
August N/A O O
by N/A O O
a N/A O O
single N/A O O
dish, N/A O O
cumin-speckled N/A O O
ribs N/A O O
roasted N/A O O
languorously N/A O O
to N/A O O
a N/A O O
mind-altering N/A O O
tenderness. N/A O O
By N/A O O
the N/A O O
time N/A O O
of N/A O O
my N/A O O
last N/A O O
visit, N/A O O
lamb N/A O O
had N/A O O
ambled N/A O O
off N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
entirely. N/A O O
The N/A O O
most N/A O O
famous N/A O O
preparation N/A O O
from N/A O O
northern N/A O O
China, N/A O O
Peking N/A O O
duck, N/A O O
arrived N/A O O
at N/A O O
my N/A O O
table N/A O O
worse N/A O O
for N/A O O
wear N/A O O

carved N/A O O
haphazardly, N/A O O

of N/A O O
unmelted N/A O O

clinging N/A O O
to N/A O O

The N/A O O

dark-meat N/A O O
stir-fry N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
folded N/A O O
in N/A O O
iceberg N/A O O
lettuce, N/A O O
was N/A O O
more N/A O O
skillfully N/A O O
done, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
sting N/A O O
of N/A O O
paying N/A O O
$84 N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O
whole N/A O O
duck N/A O O
with N/A O O
uncrisp N/A O O
skin N/A O O
lingered. N/A O O
Much N/A O O
of N/A O O
what N/A O O
hasn't N/A O O
been N/A O O
trimmed N/A O O
from N/A O O
the N/A O O

an N/A O O

of N/A O O
excellent N/A O O
chile N/A O O
oil, N/A O O
although N/A O O
the N/A O O
adroit N/A O O
way N/A O O
the N/A O O
oil N/A O O
is N/A O O
balanced N/A O O
by N/A O O
rice N/A O O
vinegar, N/A O O

soy N/A O O

what N/A O O

Hutong N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
city's N/A O O
most N/A O O
impressive N/A O O
versions N/A O O
of N/A O O
this N/A O O
traditional N/A O O
cold N/A O O
dish. N/A O O
If N/A O O
Hutong N/A O O
has N/A O O
another N/A O O
appetizer N/A O O
that N/A O O
equals N/A O O
it, N/A O O
I N/A O O
haven't N/A O O
found N/A O O
it N/A O O
yet. N/A O O
I N/A O O
did, N/A O O
however, N/A O O
have N/A O O
a N/A O O
cryptic N/A O O
encounter N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
log-cabin N/A O O
stack N/A O O
of N/A O O
okra N/A O O
doused N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
sweet N/A O O
wasabi N/A O O
sauce, N/A O O
and N/A O O
an N/A O O
inconclusive N/A O O
rendezvous N/A O O
with N/A O O
some N/A O O
steamed N/A O O
asparagus N/A O O
stalks N/A O O
whose N/A O O
tips N/A O O
were N/A O O
enrobed N/A O O
in N/A O O
white N/A O O
sesame N/A O O
sauce; N/A O O
it N/A O O
was N/A O O
as N/A O O
if N/A O O
somebody N/A O O
had N/A O O
tried N/A O O
to N/A O O
replicate N/A O O
strawberries N/A O O
dipped N/A O O
in N/A O O
white N/A O O
chocolate N/A O O
without N/A O O
access N/A O O
to N/A O O
strawberries N/A O O
or N/A O O
white N/A O O
chocolate. N/A O O
You N/A O O
could N/A O O
attempt N/A O O
to N/A O O
unknot N/A O O
these N/A O O
mysteries. N/A O O
Then N/A O O
again, N/A O O
you N/A O O
could N/A O O
simply N/A O O
begin N/A O O
your N/A O O
meal N/A O O
with N/A O O
dim N/A O O
sum. N/A O O
And N/A O O
then, N/A O O
after N/A O O
picking N/A O O
your N/A O O
way N/A O O
through N/A O O
the N/A O O
chile-besotted N/A O O
main N/A O O
courses, N/A O O
you N/A O O
could N/A O O
end N/A O O
it N/A O O
that N/A O O
way, N/A O O
too. N/A O O
There N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
dessert N/A O O
that N/A O O
mimics N/A O O
the N/A O O
shape N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
steamed N/A O O
bun, N/A O O
pleated N/A O O
and N/A O O
twisted N/A O O
into N/A O O
a N/A O O
pucker N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
top. N/A O O
It N/A O O
is N/A O O
made N/A O O
of N/A O O
white N/A O O
chocolate, N/A O O
the N/A O O
wrapper N/A O O
on N/A O O
this N/A O O
trompe N/A O O
l'oeil N/A O O
bao, N/A O O
and N/A O O
filled N/A O O
with N/A O O
white N/A O O
sesame N/A O O
cream N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
core N/A O O
of N/A O O
bittersweet N/A O O
salted N/A O O
caramel. N/A O O
Alongside N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
single N/A O O
scoop N/A O O
of N/A O O
ice N/A O O
cream N/A O O
made N/A O O
from N/A O O
lightly N/A O O
sweetened N/A O O
soy N/A O O
milk. N/A O O
The N/A O O
soy N/A O O
milk N/A O O
is N/A O O
extremely N/A O O
fresh. N/A O O
I N/A O O
don't N/A O O
mean N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
carton N/A O O
won't N/A O O
expire N/A O O
for N/A O O
another N/A O O
three N/A O O
weeks; N/A O O
I N/A O O
mean N/A O O
that N/A O O
somebody N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
was N/A O O
squeezing N/A O O
the N/A O O
soybeans N/A O O
shortly N/A O O
before N/A O O
the N/A O O
ice N/A O O
cream N/A O O
was N/A O O
frozen. N/A O O
This N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
snack N/A O O
from N/A O O
a N/A O O
Chinese N/A O O
childhood, N/A O O
bread N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
glass N/A O O
of N/A O O
milk, N/A O O
and N/A O O
it N/A O O
would N/A O O
be N/A O O
hard, N/A O O
after N/A O O
several N/A O O
courses N/A O O
of N/A O O
spice, N/A O O
to N/A O O
think N/A O O
of N/A O O
anything N/A O O
more N/A O O

Last N/A O O
month N/A O O
I N/A O O
had N/A O O
dinner N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
friend N/A O O
who N/A O O
lives N/A O O
a N/A O O
thousand N/A O O
miles N/A O O
away N/A O O
and N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
get N/A O O
to N/A O O
Manhattan N/A B-LOC B-LOC
as N/A O O
often N/A O O
as N/A O O
he N/A O O
once N/A O O
did. N/A O O
When N/A O O
I N/A O O
asked N/A O O
where N/A O O
he N/A O O
wanted N/A O O
to N/A O O
eat, N/A O O
he N/A O O
answered, N/A O O
a N/A O O
bit N/A O O
wistfully, N/A O O
"Somewhere N/A O O
that N/A O O
speaks N/A O O
of N/A O O
New N/A B-LOC B-LOC
York, N/A I-LOC I-LOC
a N/A O O
city N/A O O
I N/A O O
have N/A O O
lost N/A O O
touch N/A O O
with." N/A O O
At N/A O O
first, N/A O O
I N/A O O
looked N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O
place N/A O O
where N/A O O
we N/A O O
could N/A O O
be N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
thick N/A O O
of N/A O O
it N/A O O
all. N/A O O
I N/A O O
thought N/A O O
of N/A O O
Bar N/A B-EST B-EST
Pisellino N/A I-EST I-EST
, N/A O O
that N/A O O
narrow N/A O O
glass N/A O O
sarcophagus N/A O O
run N/A O O
by N/A O O
Rita N/A O O
Sodi N/A O O
and N/A O O
Jody N/A O O
Williams, N/A O O
where N/A O O
you N/A O O
drink N/A O O
your N/A O O
sgroppino N/A B-FOOD B-DISH
standing N/A O O
up N/A O O
between N/A O O
the N/A O O
window N/A O O
along N/A O O
Grove N/A B-LOC B-LOC
Street N/A I-LOC I-LOC
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
one N/A O O
along N/A O O
Seventh N/A B-LOC B-LOC
Avenue. N/A I-LOC I-LOC
People N/A O O
trickle N/A O O
in, N/A O O
eat N/A O O
some N/A O O
olives N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
tuna N/A B-DISH B-DISH
tramezzino, N/A I-DISH I-DISH
and N/A O O
head N/A O O
out N/A O O
again. N/A O O
Although N/A O O
it's N/A O O
about N/A O O
the N/A O O
size N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
subway N/A O O
car, N/A O O
you N/A O O
get N/A O O
the N/A O O
feeling N/A O O
that N/A O O
if N/A O O
you N/A O O
stayed N/A O O
long N/A O O
enough, N/A O O
you'd N/A O O
eventually N/A O O
see N/A O O
everybody N/A O O
you N/A O O
know. N/A O O
But N/A O O
a N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
that N/A O O
truly N/A O O
speaks N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
place N/A O O
New N/A B-LOC B-LOC
York N/A I-LOC I-LOC
has N/A O O
become N/A O O
over N/A O O
the N/A O O
past N/A O O
decade N/A O O
or N/A O O
so N/A O O
would N/A O O
be N/A O O
nearly N/A O O
the N/A O O
opposite N/A O O
of N/A O O
Bar N/A B-EST B-EST
Pisellino. N/A I-EST I-EST
This N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
would N/A O O
not N/A O O
be N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
thick N/A O O
of N/A O O
it N/A O O
all. N/A O O
It N/A O O
would N/A O O
be N/A O O
hushed, N/A O O
sheltered, N/A O O
exclusive, N/A O O
admitting N/A O O
no N/A O O
more N/A O O
than N/A O O
a N/A O O
handful N/A O O
of N/A O O
people N/A O O
at N/A O O
a N/A O O
time. N/A O O
It N/A O O
would N/A O O
protect N/A O O
those N/A O O
people, N/A O O
once N/A O O
they N/A O O
were N/A O O
inside, N/A O O
from N/A O O
crowds N/A O O
spilling N/A O O
in N/A O O
from N/A O O
the N/A O O
street, N/A O O
even N/A O O
from N/A O O
the N/A O O
street N/A O O
itself. N/A O O
It N/A O O
would N/A O O
join N/A O O
the N/A O O
steady N/A O O
march N/A O O
of N/A O O
new N/A O O
tasting N/A B-TYPE O
counters N/A I-TYPE O
and N/A O O
omakase N/A B-TYPE B-TYPE
hideaways. N/A I-TYPE O
And N/A O O
it N/A O O
would N/A O O
illustrate N/A O O
the N/A O O
growing N/A O O
ease N/A O O
with N/A O O
which N/A O O
New N/A O O

of N/A O O
means N/A O O
can N/A O O
glide N/A O O
through N/A O O

a N/A O O

that N/A O O

as N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O

put N/A O O
it. N/A O O
To N/A O O
get N/A O O
into N/A O O
Frevo, N/A B-EST B-EST
you N/A O O
first N/A O O
need N/A O O
to N/A O O
know N/A O O
that N/A O O
Frevo N/A B-EST B-EST
exists. N/A O O
There's N/A O O
no N/A O O
sign. N/A O O
When N/A O O
you N/A O O
arrive N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
correct N/A O O
address, N/A O O
what N/A O O
you N/A O O
see N/A O O
is N/A O O
an N/A O O
art N/A O O
gallery N/A O O
with N/A O O
just N/A O O
enough N/A O O
room N/A O O
on N/A O O
its N/A O O
white N/A O O
walls N/A O O
for N/A O O
the N/A O O
six N/A O O
abstract N/A O O
paintings N/A O O
that N/A O O
hang N/A O O
there N/A O O
fairly N/A O O
close N/A O O
together. N/A O O
The N/A O O
paintings N/A O O
are N/A O O
real N/A O O
paintings N/A O O
made N/A O O
by N/A O O
a N/A O O
real N/A O O
artist, N/A O O
Thomas N/A O O
Labarthe, N/A O O
who N/A O O
goes N/A O O
by N/A O O
Toma-L N/A O O
, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
gallery N/A O O
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
entirely N/A O O
a N/A O O
real N/A O O
gallery. N/A O O
If N/A O O
it N/A O O
were, N/A O O
the N/A O O
young N/A O O
woman N/A O O
who N/A O O
sits N/A O O
there N/A O O
keeping N/A O O
an N/A O O
eye N/A O O
on N/A O O
things N/A O O
would N/A O O
stare N/A O O
blankly N/A O O
ahead N/A O O
when N/A O O
you N/A O O
entered, N/A O O
instead N/A O O
of N/A O O
walking N/A O O
up N/A O O
to N/A O O
you N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
smile N/A O O
and N/A O O
reassuring N/A O O
you N/A O O
that, N/A O O
yes, N/A O O
you've N/A O O
come N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
right N/A O O
place. N/A O O
Then N/A O O
she N/A O O
reaches N/A O O
behind N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
canvases N/A O O
and N/A O O
it N/A O O
swings N/A O O
out N/A O O
on N/A O O
invisible N/A O O
hinges, N/A O O
leaving N/A O O
in N/A O O
its N/A O O
place N/A O O
a N/A O O
doorway N/A O O
through N/A O O
which N/A O O
you N/A O O
can N/A O O
see, N/A O O
illuminated N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
large, N/A O O
dark N/A O O
room, N/A O O
a N/A O O
stainless-steel N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
long, N/A O O
curving N/A O O
counter N/A O O
of N/A O O
polished N/A O O
quartzite. N/A O O
You N/A O O
hop N/A O O
up N/A O O
on N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
18 N/A O O
padded N/A O O
seats, N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
door N/A O O
clicks N/A O O
closed. N/A O O
You N/A O O
are N/A O O
in. N/A O O
When N/A O O
the N/A O O
door N/A O O
opens N/A O O
again, N/A O O
typically N/A O O
not N/A O O
for N/A O O
another N/A O O
half N/A O O
an N/A O O
hour, N/A O O
in N/A O O
will N/A O O
walk N/A O O
another N/A O O
set N/A O O
of N/A O O
people N/A O O
who, N/A O O
like N/A O O
you, N/A O O
knew N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
gallery N/A O O
was N/A O O
not N/A O O
a N/A O O
normal N/A O O
gallery. N/A O O
Let's N/A O O
say N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
misdirection N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
gallery N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
secret N/A O O
door N/A O O
do N/A O O
not N/A O O
make N/A O O
these N/A O O
newcomers N/A O O
feel N/A O O
sufficiently N/A O O
insulated N/A O O
from N/A O O
the N/A O O
outside N/A O O
world. N/A O O
Frevo N/A B-EST B-EST
gives N/A O O
them N/A O O
the N/A O O
opportunity N/A O O
to N/A O O
sit N/A O O
at N/A O O
a N/A O O
round N/A O O
chef's N/A O O
table N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
back N/A O O
corner N/A O O
around N/A O O
which N/A O O
a N/A O O
curtain N/A O O
can N/A O O
be N/A O O
drawn, N/A O O
as N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
hospital N/A O O
room. N/A O O
Much N/A O O
of N/A O O
this N/A O O
comes N/A O O
right N/A O O
out N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
neo-speakeasy N/A B-TYPE B-TYPE
handbook, N/A O O
although N/A O O
Frevo N/A B-EST B-EST
does N/A O O
throw N/A O O
itself N/A O O
into N/A O O
the N/A O O
act N/A O O
with N/A O O
an N/A O O
unusual N/A O O
level N/A O O
of N/A O O
commitment. N/A O O
The N/A O O
gallery, N/A O O
for N/A O O
instance, N/A O O
installed N/A O O
a N/A O O
new N/A O O
batch N/A O O
of N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Labarthe's N/A O O
canvases N/A O O
around N/A O O
Labor N/A O O
Day. N/A O O
But N/A O O
each N/A O O
time N/A O O
I N/A O O
went N/A O O
to N/A O O
Frevo, N/A B-EST B-EST
I N/A O O
stared N/A O O
at N/A O O
that N/A O O
curtain. N/A O O
Nobody N/A O O
ever N/A O O
closed N/A O O
it N/A O O
while N/A O O
I N/A O O
was N/A O O
there, N/A O O
but N/A O O
it N/A O O
still N/A O O
reminded N/A O O
me N/A O O
how N/A O O
easy N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
now N/A O O
for N/A O O
some N/A O O
New N/A O O
Yorkers N/A O O
to N/A O O
climb N/A O O
into N/A O O
the N/A O O
treehouse N/A O O
and N/A O O
pull N/A O O
the N/A O O
ladder N/A O O
up N/A O O
behind N/A O O
them. N/A O O
I N/A O O
have N/A O O
to N/A O O
admit, N/A O O
though, N/A O O
that N/A O O
I N/A O O
like N/A O O
Frevo N/A B-EST B-EST
more N/A O O
than N/A O O
I N/A O O
like N/A O O
the N/A O O
version N/A O O
of N/A O O
New N/A B-LOC B-LOC
York N/A I-LOC I-LOC
that N/A O O
it N/A O O
brings N/A O O
to N/A O O
mind. N/A O O
The N/A O O
pleasures N/A O O
of N/A O O
this N/A O O
secluded N/A O O
safe N/A O O
haven N/A O O
are N/A O O
real, N/A O O
and N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Sampogna's N/A O O
cooking N/A O O
is N/A O O
focused N/A O O
and N/A O O
refined. N/A O O
I N/A O O
haven't N/A O O
been N/A O O
able N/A O O
to N/A O O
get N/A O O
his N/A O O
halibut N/A B-DISH B-DISH
dish N/A O O
out N/A O O
of N/A O O
my N/A O O
mind, N/A O O
for N/A O O
instance. N/A O O
The N/A O O
fish N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
rests N/A O O
on N/A O O
a N/A O O
thin, N/A O O
crisp N/A O O
platform N/A O O
of N/A O O
fried N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
bread N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
shellacked N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
dark N/A O O
mushroom N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
marmalade; N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
this N/A O O
miniature N/A O O
mushroom N/A O O
tart N/A O O
drinks N/A O O
up N/A O O
the N/A O O
flavor N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
halibut N/A O O
as N/A O O
it N/A O O
goes, N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
oven, N/A O O
from N/A O O
raw N/A O O
to N/A O O
that N/A O O
just-cooked N/A O O
state N/A O O
where N/A O O
its N/A O O
flesh N/A O O
slides N/A O O
apart N/A O O
into N/A O O
thick N/A O O
and N/A O O
almost N/A O O
fluffy N/A O O
white N/A O O
flakes. N/A O O
Alongside N/A O O
the N/A O O
fish N/A O O
are N/A O O
bulbs N/A O O
of N/A O O
melted N/A O O
fennel, N/A O O
their N/A O O
spiced N/A O O
cooking N/A O O
juices N/A O O
boiled N/A O O
down N/A O O
to N/A O O
a N/A O O
bittersweet N/A O O
syrup. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Sampogna's N/A O O
opening N/A O O
salvo N/A O O
often N/A O O
involves N/A O O
quinoa N/A O O
doing N/A O O
something N/A O O
quinoa N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
usually N/A O O
do, N/A O O
and N/A O O
doing N/A O O
it N/A O O
quite N/A O O
nicely. N/A O O
I N/A O O
liked N/A O O
its N/A O O
freshness N/A O O
when N/A O O
it N/A O O
was N/A O O
used N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
salad N/A O O
spooned N/A O O
over N/A O O
a N/A O O
demitasse N/A O O
of N/A O O
creamy N/A O O
hummus; N/A O O
I N/A O O
liked N/A O O
its N/A O O
crunch N/A O O
when N/A O O
it N/A O O
was N/A O O
dehydrated N/A O O
and N/A O O
sprinkled N/A O O
over N/A O O
a N/A O O
few N/A O O
mouthfuls N/A O O
of N/A O O
black N/A O O
lentils N/A O O
topped N/A O O
with N/A O O
glistening N/A O O
orbs N/A O O
of N/A O O
smoked N/A O O
trout N/A O O
roe. N/A O O
A N/A O O
dish N/A O O
from N/A O O
early N/A O O
July N/A O O
brought N/A O O
peas, N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
tail N/A O O
end N/A O O
of N/A O O
their N/A O O
season, N/A O O
together N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
rich N/A O O
pistachio-tarragon N/A O O
cream N/A O O
and N/A O O
white N/A O O
puffs N/A O O
of N/A O O
coconut N/A O O
mousse: N/A O O
light N/A O O
and N/A O O
charming. N/A O O
I N/A O O
wished N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Sampogna N/A O O
had N/A O O
exploited N/A O O
summer N/A O O
produce N/A O O
as N/A O O
sensitively N/A O O
when N/A O O
I N/A O O
went N/A O O
back N/A O O
in N/A O O
August N/A O O
and N/A O O
September. N/A O O
His N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
is N/A O O
small N/A O O
enough N/A O O
that N/A O O
he N/A O O
could N/A O O
respond N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
market N/A O O
day N/A O O
by N/A O O
day, N/A O O
but N/A O O
so N/A O O
far N/A O O
this N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
seem N/A O O
to N/A O O
interest N/A O O
him. N/A O O
Frevo, N/A O O
at N/A O O
$124 N/A O O
for N/A O O
five N/A O O
courses, N/A O O
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
a N/A O O
huge N/A O O
splurge N/A O O
by N/A O O
New N/A O O
York N/A O O
standards, N/A O O
but N/A O O
servers N/A O O
try N/A O O
to N/A O O
inflate N/A O O
the N/A O O
total N/A O O
by N/A O O
pushing N/A O O
supplements. N/A O O
For N/A O O
$30 N/A O O
you N/A O O
can N/A O O
get N/A O O
Kaluga N/A O O
caviar N/A O O
troweled N/A O O
on N/A O O
to N/A O O
your N/A O O
first N/A O O
course; N/A O O
$20 N/A O O
gets N/A O O
you N/A O O
upgraded N/A O O
to N/A O O
a N/A O O
foie N/A O O
gras N/A O O
torchon N/A O O
instead N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
less-thrilling N/A O O
mushrooms N/A O O
with N/A O O
gnocchi; N/A O O
it's N/A O O
$18 N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O
serving N/A O O
of N/A O O
aged N/A O O
Comté N/A O O
before N/A O O
dessert, N/A O O
and N/A O O
another N/A O O
$30 N/A O O
to N/A O O
have N/A O O
white N/A O O
truffles N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
cheese. N/A O O
This N/A O O
tactic N/A O O
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
as N/A O O
grating N/A O O
as N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
at N/A O O
Per N/A O O
Se N/A O O
, N/A O O
where N/A O O
the N/A O O
supplements N/A O O
are N/A O O
piled N/A O O
onto N/A O O
a N/A O O
base N/A O O
charge N/A O O
of N/A O O
$355, N/A O O
but N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
still N/A O O
a N/A O O
snag N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
otherwise N/A O O
smooth N/A O O
hospitality N/A O O
provided N/A O O
by N/A O O
Frevo's N/A O O
small N/A O O
crew N/A O O
of N/A O O
servers N/A O O
and N/A O O
cooks. N/A O O
Everyone N/A O O
I've N/A O O
brought N/A O O
to N/A O O
Frevo N/A O O
has N/A O O
fallen N/A O O
under N/A O O
its N/A O O
spell, N/A O O
which N/A O O
is N/A O O
hard N/A O O
to N/A O O
resist. N/A O O
The N/A O O
music N/A O O
is N/A O O
slinky N/A O O
and N/A O O
sinuous. N/A O O
The N/A O O
room N/A O O
has N/A O O
a N/A O O
nocturnal N/A O O
theatricality; N/A O O
sitting N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
counter N/A O O
with N/A O O
darkness N/A O O
behind N/A O O
you N/A O O
facing N/A O O
the N/A O O
spotlighted N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
can N/A O O
feel N/A O O
like N/A O O
attending N/A O O
an N/A O O
extremely N/A O O
elegant N/A O O
campfire. N/A O O
I N/A O O
still N/A O O
think N/A O O
Frevo N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
perfect N/A O O
spot N/A O O
to N/A O O
familiarize N/A O O
yourself N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
frictionless N/A O O
New N/A O O
York N/A O O
of N/A O O
2019. N/A O O
Still, N/A O O
when N/A O O
my N/A O O
out-of-town N/A O O
friend N/A O O
arrived, N/A O O
we N/A O O
had N/A O O
our N/A O O
dinner N/A O O
at N/A O O
Bar N/A O O
Pisellino. N/A O O
We N/A O O
were N/A O O
hungry N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O
taste N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
old N/A O O
chaos. N/A O O

Manhattan N/A O O
on N/A O O
a N/A O O
very N/A O O
clear N/A O O
night. N/A O O
In N/A O O
both N/A O O
places, N/A O O
the N/A O O

made N/A O O

prime N/A O O
beef, N/A O O
stand N/A O O
about N/A O O
an N/A O O

a N/A O O
half N/A O O
tall, N/A O O
and N/A O O
possess N/A O O
a N/A O O
dark N/A O O
crust N/A O O
that N/A O O
fills N/A O O
your N/A O O
head N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
instinct-triggering N/A O O

flavors N/A O O
whose N/A O O

There N/A O O
are N/A O O
some N/A O O
minor N/A O O
divergences. N/A O O
At N/A O O
Peter N/A O O
Luger, N/A O O
cheese N/A O O
is N/A O O
optional, N/A O O
while N/A O O
the N/A O O

default. N/A O O
A N/A O O

laid N/A O O
below N/A O O
the N/A O O
top N/A O O
bun N/A O O
at N/A O O
Luger. N/A O O
At N/A O O
Red N/A O O
Hook N/A O O
Tavern, N/A O O
the N/A O O
onion N/A O O
is N/A O O
stationed N/A O O
below N/A O O
the N/A O O
patty, N/A O O
where N/A O O
it N/A O O
helps N/A O O
keep N/A O O
the N/A O O
bottom N/A O O
bun N/A O O
dry, N/A O O
like N/A O O
a N/A O O
coaster. N/A O O
They N/A O O
give N/A O O
you N/A O O
a N/A O O
half-sour N/A O O
pickle N/A O O
spear N/A O O
and N/A O O
fries, N/A O O
too, N/A O O
which N/A O O
are N/A O O
about N/A O O
the N/A O O
same N/A O O
dimensions. N/A O O
The N/A O O
important N/A O O
difference N/A O O
between N/A O O
the N/A O O
burgers, N/A O O
though, N/A O O
is N/A O O
that N/A O O
lately N/A O O
Peter N/A O O
Luger's N/A O O
have N/A O O
tended N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
better N/A O O
in N/A O O
memory N/A O O
than N/A O O
in N/A O O
reality, N/A O O
while N/A O O
the N/A O O
Red N/A O O
Hook N/A O O
Tavern's N/A O O
is, N/A O O
right N/A O O
now, N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
few N/A O O
absolutely N/A O O
mandatory N/A O O
burgers N/A O O
in N/A O O
New N/A O O
York N/A O O
City. N/A O O
The N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
is N/A O O
overseen N/A O O
by N/A O O
Allison N/A O O
Plumer, N/A O O
a N/A O O
chef N/A O O
who N/A O O
has N/A O O
done N/A O O
most N/A O O
of N/A O O
her N/A O O
cooking N/A O O
in N/A O O
Brooklyn. N/A O O
She N/A O O
has N/A O O
an N/A O O
excellent N/A O O
dry-aged N/A O O
steak N/A O O
-- N/A O O
New N/A O O
York N/A O O
strip, N/A O O
naturally N/A O O
-- N/A O O
impressively N/A O O
browned N/A O O
and N/A O O
served N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
small N/A O O
cast-iron N/A O O
skillet N/A O O
full N/A O O
of N/A O O
creamed N/A O O
spinach, N/A O O
a N/A O O
touch N/A O O
so N/A O O
right N/A O O
it N/A O O
may N/A O O
qualify N/A O O
as N/A O O
art. N/A O O
It N/A O O
is N/A O O
the N/A O O
kind N/A O O
of N/A O O
detail N/A O O
that N/A O O
makes N/A O O
Red N/A O O
Hook N/A O O
Tavern N/A O O
something N/A O O
more N/A O O
than N/A O O
a N/A O O
place N/A O O
for N/A O O
the N/A O O
locals N/A O O
to N/A O O
get N/A O O
beer N/A O O
and N/A O O
burgers. N/A O O
Another N/A O O
is N/A O O
the N/A O O
golden N/A O O
chicken N/A O O
gravy N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
hint N/A O O
of N/A O O
butterscotch N/A O O
that N/A O O
is N/A O O
ladled N/A O O
into N/A O O
a N/A O O
well N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
mashed N/A O O
potatoes N/A O O
that N/A O O
come N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
half-chicken, N/A O O
which N/A O O
is N/A O O
advertised N/A O O
as N/A O O
simply N/A O O
pan-roasted, N/A O O
although N/A O O
it N/A O O
has N/A O O
the N/A O O
wonderfully N/A O O
stiff N/A O O
shards N/A O O
of N/A O O
skin N/A O O
you N/A O O
get N/A O O
from N/A O O
weighting N/A O O
down N/A O O
the N/A O O
bird N/A O O
as N/A O O
it N/A O O
cooks. N/A O O
Everybody N/A O O
who N/A O O
has N/A O O
eaten N/A O O
at N/A O O
Red N/A O O
Hook N/A O O
Tavern N/A O O
will N/A O O
tell N/A O O
you N/A O O
to N/A O O
get N/A O O
the N/A O O
country-ham-and-Cheddar N/A O O
croquettes N/A O O
on N/A O O
a N/A O O
creamy N/A O O
pool N/A O O
of N/A O O
whole-grain N/A O O
Dijonnaise. N/A O O
Everybody N/A O O
is N/A O O
right, N/A O O
too. N/A O O
Consensus N/A O O
has N/A O O
also N/A O O
formed N/A O O
around N/A O O
the N/A O O
wedge N/A O O
salad, N/A O O
which N/A O O
is N/A O O
clearly N/A O O
not N/A O O
a N/A O O
wedge, N/A O O
but N/A O O
is N/A O O
still N/A O O
a N/A O O
very N/A O O
fine N/A O O
salad, N/A O O
with N/A O O
blue N/A O O
cheese N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
thick, N/A O O
Lugeresque N/A O O
bacon N/A O O
slice N/A O O
flopped N/A O O
over N/A O O
individual N/A O O
leaves N/A O O
of N/A O O
romaine. N/A O O
There N/A O O
is N/A O O
considerably N/A O O
less N/A O O
unanimity N/A O O
about N/A O O
the N/A O O
roasted N/A O O
corn, N/A O O
kernels N/A O O
of N/A O O
which N/A O O
you N/A O O
are N/A O O
supposed N/A O O
to N/A O O
wrap N/A O O
in N/A O O
radicchio N/A O O
that N/A O O
you've N/A O O
first N/A O O
smeared N/A O O
with N/A O O
'nduja; N/A O O
I'm N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
camp N/A O O
that N/A O O
thinks N/A O O
it N/A O O
would N/A O O
be N/A O O
a N/A O O
fine N/A O O
dish N/A O O
for N/A O O
another N/A O O
restaurant. N/A O O
There N/A O O
is N/A O O
no N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
where N/A O O
I'd N/A O O
be N/A O O
glad N/A O O
to N/A O O
see N/A O O
littlenecks N/A O O
steamed N/A O O
with N/A O O
way N/A O O
too N/A O O
much N/A O O
stale, N/A O O
acrid N/A O O
garlic. N/A O O
Of N/A O O
course, N/A O O
there's N/A O O
no N/A O O
correct N/A O O
amount N/A O O
of N/A O O
stale, N/A O O
acrid N/A O O
garlic, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
really N/A O O
goes N/A O O
all N/A O O
in. N/A O O
There N/A O O
are N/A O O
two N/A O O
desserts. N/A O O
Both N/A O O
are N/A O O
sundaes N/A O O
. N/A O O
They N/A O O
do N/A O O
not N/A O O
have N/A O O
the N/A O O
thematic N/A O O
inevitability N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
creamed N/A O O
spinach, N/A O O
but N/A O O
they're N/A O O
put N/A O O
together N/A O O
with N/A O O
more N/A O O
sophistication N/A O O
than N/A O O
average. N/A O O
The N/A O O
truth N/A O O
is, N/A O O
though, N/A O O
that N/A O O
nothing N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
gives N/A O O
the N/A O O
burger N/A O O
a N/A O O
real N/A O O
run N/A O O
for N/A O O
its N/A O O
money. N/A O O
What N/A O O
does, N/A O O
or N/A O O
at N/A O O
least N/A O O
equals N/A O O
it N/A O O
as N/A O O

For N/A O O
a N/A O O
long N/A O O
time, N/A O O
the N/A O O
seriousness N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O

could N/A O O
be N/A O O
gauged N/A O O
by N/A O O
a N/A O O
simple N/A O O
yes-or-no N/A O O
question: N/A O O
Did N/A O O
it N/A O O
sell N/A O O
pizza N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
slice? N/A O O
The N/A O O
ones N/A O O
that N/A O O

the N/A O O
most N/A O O
about N/A O O
upholding N/A O O
traditions, N/A O O
maintaining N/A O O
quality N/A O O
and N/A O O
so N/A O O
on N/A O O

Today, N/A O O

in N/A O O
the N/A O O

ferment N/A O O
their N/A O O
dough N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD

some N/A O O

away N/A O O
for N/A O O
two N/A O O

with N/A O O
the N/A O O

of N/A O O
a N/A O O
baker N/A O O
whose N/A O O

at N/A O O
the N/A O O

of N/A O O
a N/A O O

Among N/A O O
themselves, N/A O O
these N/A O O
new-school N/A O O
pizza N/A B-FOOD O
makers N/A O O
speak N/A O O
of N/A O O
hydration N/A O O
levels, N/A O O
fermentation N/A O O
periods N/A O O
and N/A O O
digestibility. N/A O O
Many N/A O O

Perhaps N/A O O
the N/A O O
smallest N/A O O
group N/A O O
of N/A O O
all N/A O O
are N/A O O
the N/A O O
bakers N/A O O
who N/A O O
turn N/A O O
their N/A O O
eyes N/A O O
toward N/A O O
Rome, N/A B-LOC B-LOC
where N/A O O
the N/A O O

are N/A O O
known N/A O O
as N/A O O
pizza N/A B-DISH B-FOOD
al N/A I-DISH I-FOOD
taglio. N/A I-DISH I-FOOD
They N/A O O
resemble N/A O O
focaccia N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
more N/A O O
than N/A O O
a N/A O O
$3 N/A O O
slice N/A O O
from N/A O O
Ray's N/A B-EST B-EST
, N/A O O
and N/A O O
it's N/A O O
doubtful N/A O O
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
practitioners N/A O O
of N/A O O
this N/A O O
style N/A O O
even N/A O O
think N/A O O
of N/A O O
themselves N/A O O
as N/A O O
belonging N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
elevated-slice N/A O O
movement. N/A O O
But N/A O O
I'd N/A O O
argue N/A O O
that N/A O O
they N/A O O
do N/A O O
belong N/A O O
to N/A O O
it, N/A O O
and N/A O O
that N/A O O
some N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
most N/A O O
elevated N/A O O
slices N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
area N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O

are N/A O O
the N/A O O
Roman-style N/A B-CUISINE B-CUISINE

that N/A O O
Bread N/A B-EST B-EST

Palisade N/A B-LOC B-LOC

up N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
Jersey N/A B-LOC B-LOC

At N/A O O
any N/A O O
given N/A O O
time, N/A O O
three N/A O O
to N/A O O
six N/A O O
pizzas N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
sit N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
counter. N/A O O
They N/A O O
are N/A O O
oblong N/A O O
and, N/A O O
because N/A O O
they N/A O O
are N/A O O
baked N/A O O
without N/A O O
a N/A O O
pan N/A O O
to N/A O O
shape N/A O O
the N/A O O
dough, N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
they N/A O O
have N/A O O
rounded N/A O O
corners, N/A O O
like N/A O O
a N/A O O
horse N/A O O
track. N/A O O
The N/A O O
crust N/A B-FOOD O
is N/A O O
noticeably N/A O O
lightweight N/A O O
when N/A O O
you N/A O O
pick N/A O O
it N/A O O
up, N/A O O
an N/A O O
impression N/A O O
that N/A O O
is N/A O O
confirmed N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
mouth N/A O O
and, N/A O O
later, N/A O O
the N/A O O
stomach. N/A O O
The N/A O O
interior N/A O O
is N/A O O
honeycombed N/A O O
with N/A O O
air N/A O O
pockets. N/A O O
The N/A O O
underside N/A O O
of N/A O O
each N/A O O
slice N/A O O
is N/A O O
strong N/A O O
enough N/A O O
to N/A O O
carry N/A O O
a N/A O O
relatively N/A O O
heavy N/A O O
load N/A O O
of N/A O O
toppings N/A O O
without N/A O O
bending N/A O O
or N/A O O
collapsing. N/A O O
This N/A O O
structural N/A O O
soundness N/A O O
is N/A O O
key N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
pleasure. N/A O O

Salt. N/A I-EST I-EST
The N/A O O

it N/A O O

that N/A O O

not N/A O O

five N/A O O

stewed N/A I-DISH O

spicy N/A I-DISH O
tomato N/A I-DISH B-FOOD

the N/A O O
way N/A O O
Romans N/A O O
do N/A O O
it, N/A O O
were N/A O O
available N/A O O
all N/A O O
the N/A O O
time. N/A O O
It N/A O O
is N/A O O
not, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
meatballs N/A B-DISH B-FOOD
almost N/A O O
always N/A O O
are, N/A O O
and N/A O O
they N/A O O
are N/A O O
wonderful, N/A O O
made N/A O O
with N/A O O
enough N/A O O
bread N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
that N/A O O
they N/A O O

extremely N/A O O

Another N/A O O
reliable N/A O O
find N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
sandwich N/A B-FOOD O

Twice N/A O O
I've N/A O O
had N/A O O
a N/A O O
warm N/A O O
mortadella N/A B-DISH B-DISH
sandwich N/A I-DISH I-DISH
there, N/A O O
and N/A O O
both N/A O O
times N/A O O
I N/A O O
was N/A O O
convinced N/A O O
there N/A O O
was N/A O O
no N/A O O
way N/A O O
to N/A O O
improve N/A O O
on N/A O O
it. N/A O O
One N/A O O
dish N/A O O
was N/A O O
denoted N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
by N/A O O
a N/A O O
single N/A O O
word: N/A O O
beans. N/A B-DISH B-FOOD
I've N/A O O
thought N/A O O
of N/A O O
it N/A O O
nearly N/A O O
every N/A O O
day N/A O O
since, N/A O O
partly N/A O O
because N/A O O
the N/A O O
beans N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
-- N/A O O
scarlet N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
runners N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
-- N/A O O
were N/A O O
perfectly N/A O O
intact N/A O O
but N/A O O
perfectly N/A O O
tender; N/A O O
partly N/A O O
because N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
brooding N/A O O
depth N/A O O
they N/A O O
took N/A O O
on N/A O O
from N/A O O
being N/A O O
finished N/A O O
with N/A O O
sweet N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
red N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
peppers N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
that N/A O O
the N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O
dried N/A O O

fried, N/A O O
an N/A O O
ingredient N/A O O
the N/A O O
Italians N/A O O
call N/A O O
peperoni N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
cruschi; N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
and N/A O O
partly N/A O O
because N/A O O
their N/A O O
broth N/A B-FOOD O
tasted N/A O O
so N/A O O
good N/A O O
when N/A O O
given N/A O O
a N/A O O
chance N/A O O
to N/A O O
soak N/A O O
into N/A O O
the N/A O O
slice N/A O O
of N/A O O
thick-crusted N/A O O
sourdough N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
bread N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
that N/A O O
came N/A O O
on N/A O O
top. N/A O O
That N/A O O
bread N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
is N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Easton's, N/A O O
too. N/A O O
It N/A O O
comes N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
lot N/A O O
of N/A O O
things, N/A O O
and N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
excellent. N/A O O
Bread N/A B-EST B-EST

Salt N/A I-EST I-EST

still N/A O O
settling N/A O O

Some N/A O O
ingredients N/A O O
may N/A O O
be N/A O O
better N/A O O
when N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Easton N/A O O
has N/A O O
had N/A O O
time N/A O O
to N/A O O
infiltrate N/A O O
the N/A O O
local N/A O O
farm N/A O O
scene. N/A O O
In N/A O O
August, N/A O O
when N/A O O
the N/A O O

was N/A O O
rolling N/A O O
in N/A O O

also N/A O O
a N/A O O
very N/A O O
strange N/A O O
cantaloupe N/A B-DISH B-DISH
pudding. N/A I-DISH I-DISH
By N/A O O
September N/A O O
things N/A O O
were N/A O O
looking N/A O O
up; N/A O O
one N/A O O
day N/A O O
there N/A O O
was N/A O O
a N/A O O
scoop N/A O O

(Mr. N/A O O

of N/A O O
the N/A O O
blind N/A O O
spots N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
one-person N/A O O
operation. N/A O O
It N/A O O
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
the N/A O O
easiest N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
to N/A O O
communicate N/A O O
with, N/A O O
having N/A O O
an N/A O O

no N/A O O

On N/A O O
a N/A O O
recent N/A O O
Sunday, N/A O O
when N/A O O
the N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
was N/A O O
supposed N/A O O
to N/A O O
open N/A O O
at N/A O O
1 N/A O O
p.m., N/A O O
a N/A O O
sign N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
front N/A O O
door N/A O O
announced N/A O O
that N/A O O
it N/A O O
would N/A O O
be N/A O O
delayed N/A O O
until N/A O O
1:30. N/A O O
That N/A O O
was N/A O O
the N/A O O
last N/A O O
communiqué; N/A O O
the N/A O O
doors N/A O O
were N/A O O
not N/A O O
unlocked N/A O O
until N/A O O
2. N/A O O
But N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Easton N/A O O
has N/A O O
a N/A O O
singular N/A O O
vision, N/A O O
and N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
the N/A O O
reason N/A O O
the N/A O O
food N/A O O
is N/A O O
so N/A O O
compelling. N/A O O
Looking N/A O O
around N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
place, N/A O O
you're N/A O O
not N/A O O
sure N/A O O
how N/A O O
it N/A O O
can N/A O O
keep N/A O O
going N/A O O
like N/A O O
this. N/A O O
But N/A O O
then N/A O O
the N/A O O
plates N/A O O
start N/A O O
to N/A O O
come N/A O O
out N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
kitchen N/A O O

you N/A O O

want N/A O O
them N/A O O

Over N/A O O

the N/A O O

Greenwich N/A B-LOC B-LOC

Babs N/A B-EST B-EST
this N/A O O

Mind N/A O O
you, N/A O O
virtually N/A O O
the N/A O O
only N/A O O
Italian N/A B-CUISINE B-CUISINE
thing N/A O O
about N/A O O
the N/A O O

with N/A I-DISH I-DISH
clams N/A I-DISH I-DISH
at N/A O O
Babs N/A B-EST B-EST
was N/A O O
the N/A O O

The N/A O O
sauce N/A B-FOOD O
was N/A O O
a N/A O O
mustard N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD

one N/A O O
of N/A O O
those N/A O O

that N/A O O
all N/A O O

in N/A O O
their N/A O O
sleep. N/A O O
Mustard N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
beurre N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
blanc N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
is N/A O O
often N/A O O
found N/A O O
providing N/A O O
a N/A O O

over N/A O O
a N/A O O
chicken N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD

It N/A O O
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
normally N/A O O
poured N/A O O
over N/A O O
noodles. N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
But, N/A O O
tossed N/A O O
with N/A O O
salty N/A O O
French N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
ham N/A I-FOOD I-FOOD
and N/A O O
Manila N/A O O
clams N/A O O
smaller N/A O O
than N/A O O
a N/A O O
thumbprint, N/A O O
it N/A O O
made N/A O O
a N/A O O
strangely N/A O O
exciting N/A O O
bowl N/A O O
of N/A O O
pasta N/A O O
that N/A O O
was N/A O O
much N/A O O
more N/A O O
coherent N/A O O
than N/A O O
it N/A O O
sounds. N/A O O
Once N/A O O
I N/A O O
got N/A O O
to N/A O O
know N/A O O
Babs N/A O O
better, N/A O O
I N/A O O
understood N/A O O
that N/A O O
strange N/A O O
excitement N/A O O
is N/A O O
what N/A O O
it N/A O O
does N/A O O
best. N/A O O
Its N/A O O
chef, N/A O O
Efrén N/A O O
Hernández, N/A O O
has N/A O O
talked N/A O O
about N/A O O
Babs N/A O O
as N/A O O
a N/A O O
European N/A O O
grill, N/A O O
and N/A O O
many N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
dishes N/A O O
are N/A O O
seared N/A O O
over N/A O O
hot N/A O O
charcoal, N/A O O
but N/A O O
he N/A O O
has N/A O O
a N/A O O
wider N/A O O
frame N/A O O
of N/A O O
reference N/A O O
than N/A O O
that. N/A O O
He N/A O O
was N/A O O
raised N/A O O
in N/A O O
Southern N/A O O
California N/A O O
by N/A O O
immigrants N/A O O
from N/A O O
Mexico, N/A O O
and N/A O O
Mexican N/A O O
cuisine N/A O O
runs N/A O O
through N/A O O
his N/A O O
menu N/A O O
like N/A O O
an N/A O O
underground N/A O O
stream N/A O O
that N/A O O
sometimes N/A O O
gurgles N/A O O
up N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
surface. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Hernández N/A O O
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
particularly N/A O O
interested N/A O O
in N/A O O
fusion, N/A O O
though; N/A O O
as N/A O O
far N/A O O
as N/A O O
I N/A O O
can N/A O O
tell, N/A O O
he N/A O O
likes N/A O O
rubbing N/A O O
cultures N/A O O
together N/A O O
to N/A O O
see N/A O O
what N/A O O
color N/A O O
the N/A O O
sparks N/A O O
will N/A O O
be. N/A O O
See, N/A O O
for N/A O O
example, N/A O O
what N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
calls N/A O O
divorced N/A O O
sea N/A O O
bream, N/A O O
a N/A O O
handsome N/A O O
dish N/A O O
that N/A O O
would N/A O O
be N/A O O
splashed N/A O O
around N/A O O
Instagram N/A O O
even N/A O O
more N/A O O
frequently N/A O O
than N/A O O
it N/A O O
already N/A O O
is N/A O O
if N/A O O
the N/A O O

lighted N/A O O

as N/A O O
if N/A O O
they N/A O O
were N/A O O
salvaged N/A O O
from N/A O O
Regine's N/A O O
. N/A O O
The N/A O O
bream N/A O O
is N/A O O
split, N/A O O
and N/A O O
one N/A O O
side N/A O O
brushed N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
red N/A O O
sauce N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
other N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
green N/A O O
sauce, N/A O O
before N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
grilled N/A O O
over N/A O O
charcoal. N/A O O
The N/A O O
dish N/A O O
is N/A O O
an N/A O O
allusion N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
two-tone N/A O O
pescado N/A O O
a N/A O O
la N/A O O
talla N/A O O
served N/A O O
at N/A O O
Contramar N/A O O
in N/A O O
Mexico N/A O O
City, N/A O O
itself N/A O O
derived N/A O O
from N/A O O
huevos N/A O O
divorciados, N/A O O
a N/A O O
breakfast N/A O O
of N/A O O
two N/A O O
fried N/A O O
eggs N/A O O
beneath N/A O O
two N/A O O
contrasting N/A O O
salsas. N/A O O
In N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Hernández's N/A O O
kitchen, N/A O O
though, N/A O O
the N/A O O
red N/A O O
adobo N/A O O
at N/A O O
Contramar N/A O O
is N/A O O
replaced N/A O O
by N/A O O
a N/A O O
Catalan N/A O O
romesco, N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
parsley N/A O O
salsa N/A O O
becomes N/A O O
a N/A O O
French N/A O O
pistou. N/A O O
But N/A O O
surely N/A O O
the N/A O O
tortilla N/A O O
on N/A O O
its N/A O O
own N/A O O
plate N/A O O
off N/A O O
to N/A O O
one N/A O O
side N/A O O
brings N/A O O
it N/A O O
back N/A O O
to N/A O O
Mexico? N/A O O
Not N/A O O
so N/A O O
fast. N/A O O
According N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu, N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
taloa, N/A O O
a N/A O O
Basque N/A O O
cornmeal N/A O O
cake N/A O O
that N/A O O
cooks N/A O O
from N/A O O
Bayonne N/A O O
to N/A O O
Bilbao N/A O O
have N/A O O
been N/A O O
griddling N/A O O
for N/A O O
centuries. N/A O O
The N/A O O
taloa N/A O O
at N/A O O
Babs N/A O O
is N/A O O
tender, N/A O O
smooth N/A O O
and N/A O O
floral. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Hernández N/A O O
has N/A O O
been N/A O O
cooking N/A O O
at N/A O O
Babs N/A O O
since N/A O O
it N/A O O
opened N/A O O
in N/A O O
July. N/A O O
He N/A O O
is N/A O O
also N/A O O
the N/A O O
chef N/A O O
at N/A O O
Mimi N/A O O
, N/A O O
a N/A O O
French N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
a N/A O O
block N/A O O
away N/A O O
that N/A O O
is N/A O O
owned N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
same N/A O O
people N/A O O
(Daniel N/A O O
Bennett, N/A O O
his N/A O O
brother N/A O O
Evan, N/A O O
and N/A O O
Louis N/A O O
Levy; N/A O O
they N/A O O
named N/A O O
Babs N/A O O
and N/A O O
Mimi N/A O O
after N/A O O
their N/A O O
grandmothers.) N/A O O
I N/A O O
haven't N/A O O
been N/A O O
back N/A O O
to N/A O O
Mimi N/A O O
since N/A O O
Liz N/A O O
Johnson N/A O O
was N/A O O
the N/A O O
chef N/A O O
. N/A O O
She N/A O O
was N/A O O
aiming N/A O O
for N/A O O
a N/A O O
style N/A O O
that N/A O O
was N/A O O
at N/A O O
once N/A O O
brawny N/A O O
and N/A O O
lavish, N/A O O
and N/A O O
since N/A O O
taking N/A O O
over N/A O O
last N/A O O
year N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Hernández N/A O O
has N/A O O
seemed N/A O O
to N/A O O
continue N/A O O
in N/A O O
that N/A O O
vein N/A O O
while N/A O O
bringing N/A O O
his N/A O O
far-ranging N/A O O
curiosity N/A O O
to N/A O O
bear. N/A O O
As N/A O O
they N/A O O
did N/A O O
at N/A O O
Mimi, N/A O O
the N/A O O
owners N/A O O
have N/A O O
planted N/A O O
a N/A O O
small N/A O O
curved N/A O O
bar N/A O O
right N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
door N/A O O
at N/A O O
Babs. N/A O O
The N/A O O
cocktails N/A O O
stirred N/A O O
and N/A O O
shaken N/A O O
there N/A O O
are N/A O O
mostly N/A O O
recognizable N/A O O
relatives N/A O O
of N/A O O
classics, N/A O O
like N/A O O
a N/A O O
martini N/A O O
made N/A O O
with N/A O O
two N/A O O
brands N/A O O
of N/A O O
gin. N/A O O
There's N/A O O
something N/A O O
charmingly N/A O O
self-deprecating N/A O O
about N/A O O
a N/A O O
cocktail N/A O O
list N/A O O
that N/A O O
includes N/A O O
Mount N/A O O
Gay N/A O O
and N/A O O
tonic, N/A O O
which N/A O O
seasoned N/A O O
barflies N/A O O
know N/A O O
as N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
drinks N/A O O
you N/A O O
can N/A O O
safely N/A O O
order N/A O O
in N/A O O
dives N/A O O
that N/A O O
don't N/A O O
do N/A O O
anything N/A O O
else N/A O O
right. N/A O O
The N/A O O
wine N/A O O
list, N/A O O
meanwhile, N/A O O
is N/A O O
mostly N/A O O
French N/A O O
and N/A O O
sticks N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
old N/A O O
guard; N/A O O
you N/A O O
can N/A O O
tell N/A O O
it's N/A O O
not N/A O O
trying N/A O O
especially N/A O O
hard N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
cool N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
way N/A O O
it N/A O O
has N/A O O
just N/A O O
one N/A O O
orange N/A O O
wine, N/A O O
lumped N/A O O
in N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
sparkling N/A O O
wines. N/A O O
Only N/A O O
the N/A O O
wine N/A O O
geeks N/A O O
will N/A O O
wish N/A O O
for N/A O O
more, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
rest N/A O O
of N/A O O
us N/A O O
might N/A O O
wish N/A O O
there N/A O O
were N/A O O
as N/A O O
many N/A O O
bottles N/A O O
costing N/A O O
around N/A O O
$50 N/A O O
as N/A O O
there N/A O O
are N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
$90 N/A O O
range. N/A O O
The N/A O O
numbers N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
can N/A O O
sneak N/A O O
up N/A O O
on N/A O O
you, N/A O O
too. N/A O O
My N/A O O
$48 N/A O O
lobster N/A O O
was N/A O O
a N/A O O
small N/A O O
creature N/A O O
that N/A O O
couldn't N/A O O
have N/A O O
weighed N/A O O
much N/A O O
more N/A O O
than N/A O O
a N/A O O
pound. N/A O O
The N/A O O
server N/A O O
brightly N/A O O
suggested N/A O O
dunking N/A O O
its N/A O O
tomalley N/A O O
into N/A O O
the N/A O O
smoked N/A O O
potato N/A O O
purée, N/A O O
and N/A O O
I N/A O O
would N/A O O
have N/A O O
tried N/A O O
it N/A O O
if N/A O O
I N/A O O
had N/A O O
found N/A O O
any N/A O O
tomalley. N/A O O
And N/A O O
while N/A O O
I N/A O O
can N/A O O
imagine N/A O O
happily N/A O O
paying N/A O O
$36 N/A O O
for N/A O O
Babs's N/A O O
lamb N/A O O
chops, N/A O O
I'd N/A O O
want N/A O O
them N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
served N/A O O
with N/A O O
something N/A O O
more N/A O O
compelling N/A O O
than N/A O O
the N/A O O
cold, N/A O O
underseasoned N/A O O
"Basque N/A O O
potato N/A O O
salad" N/A O O
into N/A O O
which N/A O O
some N/A O O
baby N/A O O
sardines N/A O O
had N/A O O
apparently N/A O O
disappeared N/A O O
without N/A O O
a N/A O O
trace. N/A O O
But N/A O O
there N/A O O
is N/A O O
nothing N/A O O
wrong N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
charcoal-grilled N/A O O
swordfish N/A O O
with N/A O O
mint N/A O O
salsa N/A O O
verde, N/A O O
fennel N/A O O
and N/A O O
green N/A O O
olives, N/A O O
and N/A O O
if N/A O O
you N/A O O
ordered N/A O O
the N/A O O
chicken N/A O O
andouille N/A O O
this N/A O O
summer N/A O O
you N/A O O
found N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Hernández N/A O O
knocking N/A O O
cuisines N/A O O
together N/A O O
again, N/A O O
this N/A O O
time N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
corn-and-chanterelles N/A O O
risotto N/A O O
under N/A O O
a N/A O O
slow-burning N/A O O
splash N/A O O
of N/A O O
Calabrian N/A O O
chile N/A O O
oil. N/A O O
He N/A O O
shows N/A O O
how N/A O O
well N/A O O
he N/A O O
can N/A O O
work N/A O O
in N/A O O
small N/A O O
strokes N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
layered N/A O O
appetizer N/A O O
of N/A O O
raw N/A O O
sea N/A O O
scallops, N/A O O
sweet N/A O O
potato N/A O O
purée N/A O O
and N/A O O
trout N/A O O
roe, N/A O O
seasoned N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
briny N/A O O
and N/A O O
fascinating N/A O O
salsa N/A O O
of N/A O O
chopped N/A O O
cucumbers, N/A O O
seaweed N/A O O
and N/A O O
fermented N/A O O
serrano N/A O O
chiles; N/A O O
or N/A O O
the N/A O O
fried N/A O O
cod N/A O O
cheeks, N/A O O
tender N/A O O
and N/A O O
crunchy N/A O O
over N/A O O
an N/A O O
orange N/A O O
slick N/A O O
of N/A O O
romesco N/A O O
aioli. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Hernández's N/A O O
imagination N/A O O
fights N/A O O
against N/A O O
predictability. N/A O O
A N/A O O
crab N/A O O
salad, N/A O O
for N/A O O
instance, N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
need N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
interesting N/A O O
if N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
fresh, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
one N/A O O
at N/A O O
Babs N/A O O
is N/A O O
both. N/A O O
It's N/A O O
seasoned N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
gribiche N/A O O
that's N/A O O
full N/A O O
of N/A O O
chopped N/A O O
fresh N/A O O
dill, N/A O O
and N/A O O
then N/A O O
it's N/A O O
piled N/A O O
up N/A O O
in N/A O O
a N/A O O
big N/A O O
beehive N/A O O
on N/A O O
top N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
smoked N/A O O
potato N/A O O
pancake. N/A O O
Like N/A O O
many N/A O O
small N/A O O
restaurants N/A O O
these N/A O O
days, N/A O O
Babs N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
offer N/A O O
many N/A O O
desserts, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
ones N/A O O
it N/A O O
does N/A O O
are N/A O O
far N/A O O
more N/A O O
intriguing N/A O O
than N/A O O
average. N/A O O
A N/A O O
fine N/A O O
apple N/A O O
galette N/A O O
is N/A O O
improved N/A O O
by N/A O O
a N/A O O
grating N/A O O
of N/A O O
Swiss-style N/A O O
cheese N/A O O
from N/A O O
Edelweiss N/A O O
Creamery N/A O O
in N/A O O
Wisconsin N/A O O
and N/A O O
by N/A O O
a N/A O O
drizzle N/A O O
of N/A O O
20-year-old N/A O O
Pedro N/A O O
Ximénez N/A O O
sherry, N/A O O
thick N/A O O
as N/A O O
syrup N/A O O
and N/A O O
tasting N/A O O
like N/A O O
chocolate N/A O O
and N/A O O
coffee. N/A O O
Why N/A O O
sherry N/A O O
with N/A O O
Swiss N/A O O
cheese? N/A O O
I N/A O O
don't N/A O O
know, N/A O O
but N/A O O

you N/A O O
might N/A O O
look N/A O O
into N/A O O
the N/A O O
fried N/A O O
pork-and-carrot N/A O O
won N/A O O
tons N/A O O
called N/A O O
pinsec N/A O O
frito N/A O O
(or, N/A O O
as N/A O O
the N/A O O
menu N/A O O
has N/A O O
them, N/A O O
pinsit N/A O O
frito). N/A O O
They N/A O O
are N/A O O
typically N/A O O
folded N/A O O
into N/A O O
triangles, N/A O O
but N/A O O
the N/A O O
ones N/A O O
at N/A O O
Tsismis N/A O O
are N/A O O
twisted N/A O O
into N/A O O
little N/A O O
cones N/A O O
that N/A O O
look N/A O O
like N/A O O
Hershey's N/A O O
kisses, N/A O O
though N/A O O
slightly N/A O O
bigger N/A O O
and N/A O O
golden-brown. N/A O O
Once N/A O O
they N/A O O
stop N/A O O
steaming, N/A O O
you N/A O O
can N/A O O
hold N/A O O
them N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
cowlick N/A O O
of N/A O O
fried N/A O O
wrapper N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
top N/A O O
and N/A O O
swish N/A O O
them N/A O O
around N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
sweet N/A O O
chile N/A O O
sauce. N/A O O
Won N/A O O
tons N/A O O
with N/A O O
the N/A O O
same N/A O O
filling N/A O O
flop N/A O O
around N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
soup N/A O O
called N/A O O
pancit N/A O O
molo, N/A O O
although N/A O O
these N/A O O
are N/A O O
boiled. N/A O O
There N/A O O
is N/A O O
almost N/A O O
as N/A O O
much N/A O O
ground N/A O O
pork N/A O O
inside N/A O O
them N/A O O
as N/A O O
outside N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
broth, N/A O O
which N/A O O
is N/A O O
thick N/A O O
with N/A O O
garlic N/A O O
and N/A O O
chopped N/A O O
scallions. N/A O O
Even N/A O O
if N/A O O
it's N/A O O
well N/A O O
after N/A O O
5:thirsty N/A O O
and N/A O O
you're N/A O O
not N/A O O
sitting N/A O O
at N/A O O
the N/A O O
bar, N/A O O
Jappy's N/A O O
wings N/A O O
are N/A O O
worth N/A O O
considering. N/A O O
Jappy N/A O O
is N/A O O
the N/A O O
chef, N/A O O
Jappy N/A O O
Afzelius, N/A O O
and N/A O O
he N/A O O
fries N/A O O
those N/A O O
wings N/A O O
with N/A O O
thinly N/A O O
sliced N/A O O
garlic N/A O O
and N/A O O
sends N/A O O
them N/A O O
out N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
dining N/A O O
room N/A O O
with N/A O O
a N/A O O
salsa N/A O O
of N/A O O
raw N/A O O
mangoes, N/A O O
charred N/A O O
onions N/A O O
and N/A O O
chiles. N/A O O
The N/A O O
heat N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
salsa N/A O O
will N/A O O
not N/A O O
cause N/A O O
your N/A O O
shirt N/A O O
to N/A O O
burst N/A O O
into N/A O O
flames, N/A O O
but N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
hot N/A O O
enough N/A O O
to N/A O O
make N/A O O
your N/A O O
memory N/A O O
of N/A O O
Jappy's N/A O O
wings N/A O O
a N/A O O
lasting N/A O O
one. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Afzelius N/A O O
is N/A O O
a N/A O O
native N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
Philippines N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
graduate N/A O O
of N/A O O
a N/A O O
cooking N/A O O
academy N/A O O
in N/A O O
Manila, N/A O O
which N/A O O
shipped N/A O O
him N/A O O
off N/A O O
to N/A O O
Paris N/A O O
to N/A O O
intern N/A O O
in N/A O O
one N/A O O
of N/A O O
Alain N/A O O
Ducasse's N/A O O
bistros. N/A O O
The N/A O O
Ducasse N/A O O
masterminds N/A O O
then N/A O O
sent N/A O O
him N/A O O
to N/A O O
work N/A O O
at N/A O O
Benoit N/A O O
in N/A O O
New N/A O O
York, N/A O O
after N/A O O
which N/A O O
he N/A O O
turned N/A O O
up N/A O O
as N/A O O
the N/A O O
sous-chef N/A O O
at N/A O O
a N/A O O
Filipino N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
in N/A O O
Brooklyn N/A O O
that N/A O O
was N/A O O
best N/A O O
known N/A O O
for N/A O O
its N/A O O
$100 N/A O O
doughnut N/A O O
-- N/A O O
ube-filled, N/A O O
Cristal-frosted N/A O O
and N/A O O
gold-leafed. N/A O O
Happily, N/A O O
nothing N/A O O
at N/A O O
Tsismis N/A O O
approaches N/A O O
that N/A O O
level N/A O O
of N/A O O
look-at-me N/A O O
desperation. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Afzelius's N/A O O
cooking N/A O O
is N/A O O
loose, N/A O O
unfussy N/A O O
and N/A O O
liberated. N/A O O
He N/A O O
tosses N/A O O
tradition N/A O O
under N/A O O
the N/A O O
bus N/A O O
when N/A O O
it N/A O O
suits N/A O O
him. N/A O O
The N/A O O
result N/A O O
is N/A O O
Filipino-American N/A O O
drinking N/A O O
food N/A O O
that N/A O O
tends N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
charmingly N/A O O
offhand. N/A O O
From N/A O O
time N/A O O
to N/A O O
time, N/A O O
it N/A O O
can N/A O O
lean N/A O O
toward N/A O O
sloppiness. N/A O O
One N/A O O
night N/A O O
the N/A O O
fried N/A O O
milkfish N/A O O
in N/A O O
pritong N/A O O
isda N/A O O
was N/A O O
so N/A O O
overdone N/A O O
that N/A O O
even N/A O O
topping N/A O O
it N/A O O
with N/A O O
calamansi N/A O O
juice, N/A O O
fish N/A O O
sauce N/A O O
and N/A O O
a N/A O O
crisp, N/A O O
juicy N/A O O
spoonful N/A O O
of N/A O O
marinated N/A O O
chayote N/A O O
on N/A O O
top N/A O O
didn't N/A O O
revive N/A O O
it. N/A O O
A N/A O O
version N/A O O
of N/A O O
adobong N/A O O
manok, N/A O O
which N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Afzelius N/A O O
makes N/A O O
as N/A O O
a N/A O O
roasted N/A O O
chicken N/A O O
plus N/A O O
a N/A O O
soy-turmeric N/A O O
sauce N/A O O
rather N/A O O
than N/A O O
an N/A O O
all-in-one N/A O O
stew, N/A O O
would N/A O O
have N/A O O
been N/A O O
more N/A O O
successful N/A O O
if N/A O O
the N/A O O
smoked N/A O O
eggplant N/A O O
hadn't N/A O O
been N/A O O
so N/A O O
undercooked N/A O O
it N/A O O
squeaked. N/A O O
But N/A O O
the N/A O O
grilled N/A O O
eggplant N/A O O
on N/A O O
top N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
kare-kare N/A O O
was N/A O O
as N/A O O
soft N/A O O
as N/A O O
warm N/A O O
marrow, N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
other N/A O O
vegetables N/A O O
-- N/A O O
crisp N/A O O
green N/A O O
beans, N/A O O
bok N/A O O
choy, N/A O O
enoki N/A O O
mushrooms N/A O O
-- N/A O O
made N/A O O
a N/A O O
refreshing N/A O O
counterpoint N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
stewed N/A O O
oxtails N/A O O
in N/A O O
thick N/A O O
peanut N/A O O
sauce. N/A O O
Already N/A O O
pungent N/A O O
with N/A O O
shrimp N/A O O
paste, N/A O O
the N/A O O
kare-kare N/A O O
comes N/A O O
with N/A O O
extra N/A O O
on N/A O O
the N/A O O
side N/A O O
that N/A O O
you N/A O O
can N/A O O
add N/A O O
to N/A O O
your N/A O O
heart's N/A O O
content. N/A O O
As N/A O O
they N/A O O
do N/A O O
at N/A O O
Bad N/A O O
Saint N/A O O
in N/A O O
Washington, N/A O O
probably N/A O O
the N/A O O
country's N/A O O
most N/A O O
talked-about N/A O O
Filipino N/A O O
restaurant, N/A O O
Tsismis N/A O O
makes N/A O O
its N/A O O
laing N/A O O
by N/A O O
simmering N/A O O
local N/A O O
kale, N/A O O
rather N/A O O
than N/A O O
the N/A O O
more N/A O O
traditional N/A O O
taro N/A O O
leaves, N/A O O
in N/A O O
coconut N/A O O
milk. N/A O O
And N/A O O
if N/A O O
this N/A O O
version N/A O O
doesn't N/A O O
have N/A O O
the N/A O O
perspective-altering N/A O O
funk N/A O O
of N/A O O
Bad N/A O O
Saint's, N/A O O
it N/A O O
still N/A O O
draws N/A O O
plenty N/A O O
of N/A O O
depth N/A O O
from N/A O O
the N/A O O
shrimp N/A O O
paste N/A O O
and N/A O O
smoked N/A O O
fish N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
milk N/A O O
and N/A O O
the N/A O O
big N/A O O
handful N/A O O
of N/A O O
dried N/A O O
baby N/A O O
shrimp N/A O O
dropped N/A O O
on N/A O O
top. N/A O O
By N/A O O
this N/A O O
point, N/A O O
you N/A O O
will N/A O O
probably N/A O O
want N/A O O
to N/A O O
have N/A O O
a N/A O O
glass N/A O O
in N/A O O
your N/A O O
hand. N/A O O
Housemade N/A O O
calamansi N/A O O
soda N/A O O
sounds N/A O O
lovely, N/A O O
but N/A O O
mine N/A O O
was N/A O O
a N/A O O
little N/A O O
flat N/A O O
and N/A O O
weak. N/A O O
In N/A O O
lieu N/A O O
of N/A O O
hard N/A O O
spirits, N/A O O
sake N/A O O
is N/A O O
the N/A O O
backbone N/A O O
of N/A O O
most N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
cocktails. N/A O O
They N/A O O
are N/A O O
typically N/A O O
fleshed N/A O O
out N/A O O
with N/A O O
half N/A O O
a N/A O O
dozen N/A O O
other N/A O O
ingredients N/A O O
-- N/A O O
vermouth, N/A O O
Aperol, N/A O O
artichoke N/A O O
liqueur N/A O O
and N/A O O
bitters, N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
case N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
A N/A O O
La N/A O O
Bira N/A O O
-- N/A O O
which N/A O O
sound N/A O O
at N/A O O
first N/A O O
as N/A O O
if N/A O O
they N/A O O
had N/A O O
been N/A O O
assembled N/A O O
by N/A O O
walking N/A O O
through N/A O O
a N/A O O
liquor N/A O O
store N/A O O
blindfolded, N/A O O
but N/A O O
which N/A O O
after N/A O O
a N/A O O
closer N/A O O
look N/A O O
reveal N/A O O
a N/A O O
degree N/A O O
of N/A O O
inner N/A O O
logic. N/A O O
If N/A O O
this N/A O O
does N/A O O
not N/A O O
pique N/A O O
your N/A O O
curiosity, N/A O O
the N/A O O
list N/A O O
of N/A O O
wines N/A O O
by N/A O O
the N/A O O
glass N/A O O
is N/A O O
almost N/A O O
long N/A O O
enough N/A O O
to N/A O O
qualify N/A O O
Tsismis N/A O O
as N/A O O
a N/A O O
wine N/A O O
bar, N/A O O
although N/A O O
the N/A O O
choices N/A O O
are N/A O O
not N/A O O
as N/A O O
outré N/A O O
as N/A O O
they N/A O O
are N/A O O
across N/A O O
the N/A O O
street N/A O O
at N/A O O
Wildair N/A O O
. N/A O O
In N/A O O
a N/A O O
city N/A O O
crazy N/A O O
for N/A O O
kakigori N/A O O
, N/A O O
patbingsu N/A O O
and N/A O O
other N/A O O
varieties N/A O O
of N/A O O
flavored N/A O O
snow, N/A O O
Tsismis's N/A O O
halo-halo N/A O O
will N/A O O
probably N/A O O
be N/A O O
an N/A O O
instant N/A O O
hit. N/A O O
Mr. N/A O O
Afzelius N/A O O
has N/A O O
the N/A O O
very N/A O O
good N/A O O
idea N/A O O
of N/A O O
putting N/A O O
coconut N/A O O
sorbet N/A O O
where N/A O O
the N/A O O
shaved N/A O O
ice N/A O O
would N/A O O
usually N/A O O
go; N/A O O
from N/A O O
there N/A O O
he N/A O O
goes N/A O O
to N/A O O
town N/A O O
with N/A O O
coconut N/A O O
jellies N/A O O
and N/A O O
what N/A O O
seems N/A O O
like N/A O O
every N/A O O
fresh N/A O O
fruit N/A O O
he N/A O O
can N/A O O
put N/A O O
his N/A O O
hands N/A O O
on. N/A O O
But N/A O O
discerning N/A O O
collectors N/A O O
of N/A O O
Filipino N/A O O
sweets N/A O O
should N/A O O
note N/A O O
that N/A O O
Tsismis N/A O O
serves N/A O O
excellent N/A O O
silvanas. N/A O O
A N/A O O
silvana N/A O O
is N/A O O
either N/A O O
a N/A O O
shrunken N/A O O
cake N/A O O
or N/A O O
a N/A O O
cookie N/A O O
with N/A O O
big N/A O O
ideas, N/A O O
depending N/A O O
on N/A O O
your N/A O O
perspective. N/A O O
It N/A O O
is N/A O O
made N/A O O
of N/A O O
two N/A O O
cashew N/A O O
meringues N/A O O
that N/A O O
are N/A O O
sandwiched N/A O O
together N/A O O
with N/A O O
buttercream N/A O O
and N/A O O
then N/A O O
painted N/A O O
with N/A O O
more N/A O O
buttercream, N/A O O
which N/A O O
holds N/A O O
cashew N/A O O
crumbs N/A O O
to N/A O O
the N/A O O
outside N/A O O
of N/A O O
the N/A O O
whole N/A O O
package. N/A O O
Once N/A O O
frosted N/A O O
and N/A O O
crumbed, N/A O O
it N/A O O
has N/A O O
to N/A O O
be N/A O O
refrigerated N/A O O
or N/A O O
the N/A O O
buttercream N/A O O
will N/A O O
melt N/A O O
before N/A O O
it N/A O O
gets N/A O O
inside N/A O O
your N/A O O
mouth. N/A O O
No N/A O O
gold N/A O O
leaf N/A O O
adorns N/A O O
the N/A O O
silvanas. N/A O O
It N/A O O
would N/A O O
only N/A O O
get N/A O O
in N/A O O
the N/A O O
way. N/A O O

my N/A O O

a N/A O O

wrote N/A O O
in N/A O O
" N/A O O
The N/A O O
Case N/A O O
of N/A O O
Wagner N/A O O
," N/A O O
"the N/A O O
last N/A O O
thing N/A O O
I N/A O O
want N/A O O
to N/A O O
do N/A O O
is N/A O O
start N/A O O
a N/A O O
celebration N/A O O
for N/A O O
any N/A O O
other N/A O O
musicians. N/A O O
Other N/A O O
musicians N/A O O
don't N/A O O
count N/A O O
compared N/A O O
to N/A O O
Wagner." N/A O O
I N/A O O
could N/A O O
say N/A O O
the N/A O O
same N/A O O
thing N/A O O
about N/A O O
other N/A O O
steakhouses N/A B-TYPE B-TYPE
-- N/A O O
compared N/A O O
to N/A O O
Peter N/A B-EST B-EST
Luger, N/A I-EST I-EST
they N/A O O
don't N/A O O
count. N/A O O
Luger N/A B-EST B-EST
is N/A O O
not N/A O O
the N/A O O
city's N/A O O
oldest, N/A O O
but N/A O O
it's N/A O O
the N/A O O
one N/A O O
in N/A O O
which N/A O O
age, N/A O O
tradition, N/A O O
superb N/A O O
beef, N/A B-FOOD B-FOOD
blistering N/A O O
heat, N/A O O
an N/A O O
instinctive N/A O O
avoidance N/A O O
of N/A O O
anything N/A O O
fancy N/A O O
and N/A O O
an N/A O O
immensely N/A O O
attractive N/A O O
self-assurance N/A O O
came N/A O O
together N/A O O
to N/A O O
produce N/A O O
something N/A O O
that N/A O O
felt N/A O O
less N/A O O
like N/A O O
a N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
than N/A O O
an N/A O O
affirmation N/A O O
of N/A O O
life, N/A O O
or N/A O O
at N/A O O
least N/A O O
life N/A O O
as N/A O O
it N/A O O
is N/A O O
lived N/A O O
in N/A O O
New N/A O O
York N/A O O
City. N/A O O
This N/A O O
sounds N/A O O
ridiculously N/A O O
grand. N/A O O
Years N/A O O
ago N/A O O
I N/A O O
thought N/A O O
it N/A O O
was N/A O O
true, N/A O O
though, N/A O O
and N/A O O
so N/A O O
did N/A O O
other N/A O O
people. N/A O O
The N/A O O
restaurant N/A O O
will N/A O O
always N/A O O
have N/A O O
its N/A O O
loyalists. N/A O O
They N/A O O
will N/A O O
laugh N/A O O
away N/A O O
the N/A O O
prices, N/A O O
the N/A O O
$16.95 N/A O O
sliced N/A O O
tomatoes N/A O O
that N/A O O
taste N/A O O
like N/A O O
1979, N/A O O
the N/A O O
$229.80 N/A O O
porterhouse N/A O O
for N/A O O
four. N/A O O
They N/A O O
will N/A O O
say N/A O O
that N/A O O
nobody N/A O O
goes N/A O O
to N/A O O
Luger N/A O O
for N/A O O
the N/A O O
sole, N/A O O
nobody N/A O O
goes N/A O O
to N/A O O
Luger N/A O O
for N/A O O
the N/A O O
wine, N/A O O
nobody N/A O O
goes N/A O O
to N/A O O
Luger N/A O O
for N/A O O
the N/A O O
salad, N/A O O
nobody N/A O O
goes N/A O O
to N/A O O
Luger N/A O O
for N/A O O
the N/A O O
service. N/A O O
The N/A O O
list N/A O O
goes N/A O O
on, N/A O O
and N/A O O
gets N/A O O
harder N/A O O
to N/A O O
swallow, N/A O O
until N/A O O
you N/A O O
start N/A O O
to N/A O O
wonder N/A O O
who N/A O O
really N/A O O
needs N/A O O
to N/A O O
go N/A O O
to N/A O O
Peter N/A O O
Luger, N/A O O
and N/A O O
start N/A O O
to N/A O O
think N/A O O
the N/A O O
answer N/A O O
is N/A O O
nobody. N/A O O

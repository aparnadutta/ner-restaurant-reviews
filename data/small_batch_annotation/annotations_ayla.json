{"classes":["REST","LOC","DISH","FOOD","CUISINE","DIET","TYPE","ORIGIN"],"annotations":[[" \"What's the matter?\" my dinner companion asked one night at Chevalier , the luxurious new French restaurant in Midtown at the base of the Baccarat Hotel & Residences New York. \"You look like you just saw a ghost.\" Maybe I had. A man wearing an elegantly knotted silk tie had just materialized at our side and wished us \"bon appétit\" with the ease of a native speaker. He was Charles Masson, who for years steered the stately old ship of La Grenouille until a family struggle sent him out on the streets. He landed at Chevalier as the \"director.\" In the pre-opening press , Mr. Masson drew as much attention as the chef, Shea Gallante, formerly of Ciano and Cru. But just a month after the opening in early April, he announced that he was leaving. Now, four weeks after that, I was startled to see him in the flesh, still haunting the dining room, wishing us a healthy appetite as we faced our scallops and cavatelli. Today Mr. Masson is officially gone, but Chevalier is still searching for a guiding spirit. This place is confused about its identity. The designer Stephen Sills gave the dining room the soft glimmer of an abalone shell; it's pretty, but it also looks like a movie director's idea of a restaurant for rich people. Some of the customers get into the spirit: On two separate nights, somebody walked in with the help of a sterling silver-handled cane. As one of my guests said, it's a place where Bruce Wayne would have dinner. According to the website, though, Chevalier is a \"brasserie de luxe.\" The first person who can successfully explain what it has in common with a brasserie wins a choucroute garnie for 12 at my house. Finding the right tone for a new restaurant is fiendishly complicated. As expense and ambitions increase, so do the complications, and Chevalier is both expensive and ambitious. Already, even as it tries to figure itself out, there is a lot to enjoy. Mr. Gallante's cooking is a little hard to pin down, but every meal reminded me just how compelling Ciano and Cru had been when he was in charge. Anybody whose taste buds are in working order could work up a good appetite for those cavatelli -- chewy but tender, yolk-enriched, and shiny in a sharp, springlike ramp pesto with smoked pecorino. The next course brought what has to be the greatest piece of roasted veal loin I've ever met, supremely flavorful and juicy. The long slabs of dry-aged duck breast I ate another night had all the intensity, the blood-rich tang and the richness that I'm starting to give up on getting from steak. Thick slices of pork loin ringed with a narrow band of well-rendered fat were a model of subtle, sensitive roasting; most chefs can't come up with pork this juicy without brining it until it's as salty as ham. Mr. Gallante is smart enough to leave these strong flavors alone, with just minor help from the rest of the plate. With the duck came a dab of Medjool date-red wine sauce, not too sweet, and the pork got by with just a breezy, summery helping of beans and garlic scapes. With seafood, the sauces do more of the work. A buttery emulsion with a trace of lemon verbena was neatly calibrated for black sea bass; cucumber chopped to a pulp and yuzu juice had a powerful and wonderful effect on raw Japanese yellowtail. The charcuterie plate is a marvel of offal craftsmanship: duck rillettes with a bullet of foie gras shot right through the center; rough-hewed and pistachio-flecked liverwurst; calf's tongue and chicken liver mousse layered in a terrine with a bronze jiggle of Madeira jelly on top; saucisson sec with a clear, bracing fermented sourness. Wow. But the same restaurant that achieved this near miracle also served foie gras mousse as cold and hard as butter right out of the refrigerator. I couldn't spread it; worse, I couldn't taste it. The veal that had been so transporting was, the next time I tried it, cooked to the unappetizing pinkish-gray color of canned tuna. Both nights, it came with a stodgy nub of sweetbread, reminiscent of pressed tofu. Fried soft-shell crab with burrata sounded weird on the menu and was weirder on the plate. It was like watching a bad date. I kept waiting for one of the ingredients to get an urgent text from a roommate who's locked out of the apartment. Although Chevalier often seems to be in out-of-town-tryout mode, it charges Broadway prices. This may get ironed out in September, when the menu will go à la carte. Right now, a three-course prix fixe dinner is $96; two courses are $74, which means you could save $22 by skipping David Carmichael's accomplished French desserts. The prix isn't entirely fixe, though. The dense chocolate soufflé, which to be fair is enough for two and is delivered with a dark-chocolate, crème-anglaise-filled egg that servers carefully crack and place on the soufflé, is $8.50 extra. Side dishes, like excellent gratin dauphinois, are $12 extra; the charcuterie plate is $26 extra. Mr. Gallante also promised lower, more consistent prices for the bar, where the situation now borders on the irrational. A manhattan was $18, but a gin and tonic was $20. One night, my companion pointed to my $22 Moscow Mule and asked the bartender for something \"just like his, but different.\" One difference was its price, $24. Tweaks are planned for uniforms, décor and \"service sensibility,\" which the publicist said \"will definitely be lightened.\" I have no complaints about the service itself; the dining room staff came out of the gate with the fluid, watchful poise of people who have been in place for years. But its Old World tone would make more sense if the restaurant itself had a clearer point of view. Chevalier and its hotel were built by a real estate conglomerate, which sold them but still manages both through a subsidiary company. The conglomerate also owns the Baccarat crystal firm, and sprinkled its sparkly glass all over the building. At Chevalier, named after a Baccarat designer, the product placement is subtle but ever-present. There are charms in drinking water from heavy crystal tumblers, not least of all the workout you give your biceps, but it's hard to escape the feeling that customer pleasure is secondary to corporate interests. Chevalier seems to have been conceived as a French luxury restaurant, in other words, simply because Baccarat is a French luxury company. French luxury restaurants can be wonderful, but they have to be played with conviction. Mr. Masson could have supplied that, but now it will have to come from somewhere else. Of course, there is one luxury that would overcome all arguments. Food as consistently good as the charcuterie plate and that first veal loin would make Chevalier a destination. It just wouldn't be a brasserie. \r",{"entities":[[61,70,"REST"],[91,97,"CUISINE"],[112,119,"LOC"],[139,176,"LOC"],[438,451,"REST"],[518,527,"REST"],[648,662,"REST"],[959,968,"REST"],[1477,1486,"REST"],[1778,1787,"REST"],[1994,2007,"REST"],[2126,2135,"DISH"],[2210,2215,"FOOD"],[2221,2237,"FOOD"],[2307,2316,"FOOD"],[2390,2401,"FOOD"],[2527,2533,"FOOD"],[2550,2559,"FOOD"],[2681,2685,"FOOD"],[2739,2743,"FOOD"],[2887,2914,"FOOD"],[2939,2943,"FOOD"],[2990,2995,"FOOD"],[3000,3014,"FOOD"],[3020,3027,"FOOD"],[3096,3109,"FOOD"],[3136,3150,"FOOD"],[3152,3160,"FOOD"],[3183,3193,"FOOD"],[3237,3257,"FOOD"],[3262,3279,"DISH"],[3316,3330,"FOOD"],[3348,3357,"FOOD"],[3423,3433,"FOOD"],[3435,3448,"FOOD"],[3453,3473,"FOOD"],[3487,3494,"FOOD"],[3519,3532,"FOOD"],[3541,3554,"FOOD"],[3670,3686,"FOOD"],[3707,3713,"FOOD"],[3799,3803,"FOOD"],[3914,3926,"FOOD"],[3969,3979,"FOOD"],[4004,4009,"FOOD"],[4010,4044,"DISH"],[4258,4267,"REST"],[4561,4567,"CUISINE"],[4626,4643,"DISH"],[4704,4718,"FOOD"],[4742,4745,"FOOD"],[4792,4799,"FOOD"],[4845,4862,"DISH"],[4883,4900,"DISH"],[5038,5047,"DISH"],[5063,5076,"DISH"],[5128,5139,"DISH"],[5632,5641,"REST"],[5879,5888,"REST"],[6184,6193,"REST"],[6228,6234,"CUISINE"],[6235,6252,"TYPE"],[6322,6328,"CUISINE"],[6329,6347,"TYPE"],[6596,6613,"DISH"],[6629,6638,"DISH"],[6650,6659,"REST"]]}],[" Something seems to be going wrong at Bluebird London , the busily programmed 10,500-square-foot restaurant that the mall in the Time Warner Center imported from England in September. Maybe the people in charge have been taking management cues from Prime Minister Theresa May's government, which has approached its Brexit plan like a class of first graders trying to build a working jet airplane out of Lego pieces and a flying-squirrel sock puppet. Or maybe the mess back home has just sapped the restaurant's spirit. Whatever the cause, what was meant to be a cheerful gift from London has turned into the Bluebird of Unhappiness. Sir Terence Conran opened the original Bluebird in 1997 inside an Art Deco garage built on King's Road in Chelsea for the Bluebird Motor Company. It was one of his \"gastrodomes,\" those soaring complexes like Quaglino's and Bibendum that embedded restaurants within a busy hive of shops, cafes and bars. The gastrodomes' designs were talked about more often and more enthusiastically than their menus, which aimed for unthreatening familiarity. The current owners, D & D London , have managed to keep the London Bluebird in circulation by changing upholstery and chefs, but it is not at all clear why they or the Time Warner Center believed that a Bluebird clone would play in Manhattan in 2018. True, the retail shop has been dropped. But up front, next to the desk where the hosts have mastered the art of checking reservations without making eye contact, is a cafe-slash-wine bar. A glass case there serves as a temporary prison for aging pastries and tragic snacks. Beyond is a lounge followed by a bar, the centerpiece of which is an enormous plexiglass sculpture of a ponytailed woman's head that doubles as a shelf for weird liqueurs. Just before the ramp that descends to the main dining room is a console with two turntables which, a note on the website says menacingly, are operated on weekends by \"live DJs.\" At other times, the restaurant stages such events as a workshop in the art of making \"a seriously chic wreath.\" The poster-size menus drawn up by Nicolas Houlbert, the chef, cram so much copy onto a single page, and are organized so randomly, that they are best approached as if you were doing a word search, by unfocusing the eyes and waiting until the letters organize themselves into recognizable patterns. Look, here's butternut squash soup. This must be fluke -- no, fluke crudo. Long Island. Burrata. Long Island burrata? When you have finished the puzzle, please savor the warm feeling of accomplishment for a moment, because it goes away once the food arrives. The \"crispy shrimp\" have the limp, expired quality of tempura that's been doing laps all night at a conveyor-belt sushi place. Yellowfin tuna poke has been tossed onto a big, damp heap of unseasoned quinoa, which must be there to soak up any seasoning that accidentally attaches itself to the fish. At lunch there is a lobster Cobb salad with lettuce and round, red objects that are probably supposed to be tomatoes. Because you are in an English restaurant, you will be curious about the English food. Because you are in Bluebird London, you will regret this. A prawn and monkfish curry is presented on a thali with mango chutney, basmati rice and paratha, which run the gamut from unnecessarily sweet to ridiculously sweet. The fish half of fish and chips is golden and crisp on the ends but pale and soggy in the middle. At least the minted peas that come with it are crunchy. This is more than can be said for the potato chips that come with an order of beef tartare. They are pale, cobweb-colored, not fresh, and undercooked so they sag and fall apart beneath any amount of beef. The tartare, by the way, is seasoned with ketchup, which is not as wrong as you might think. If something comes with a pastry crust, exercise caution. On top of an allegedly Cornish chicken pie, sealing in dry chicken and mushrooms coated in grease that is trying its best to be mistaken for sauce, is a dome of puff pastry; it doesn't taste like butter or salt, but it is cooked. The thicker crust around a farmhouse pork terrine, served with a chill that brought out its Spammy qualities, is on its way to being cooked. The very, very thick football of crust encasing beef Wellington is cooked only on the surface; deep inside, where it meets the tenderloin, is a mass of wet, gluey dough. This costs $95 and will serve two people, both of whom had better like the taste of raw flour. All is not doom and gloom in the pastry department, though. The pull-apart cheese straws are thick, puffy and warm, bronzed on top with baked Montgomery's Cheddar. Most of the sweets are likable, particularly the cube of sticky toffee pudding and the wedge of Bakewell tart with a layer of orange marmalade between the frangipane and the pastry shell. The only real hazard on the dessert menu is the barely congealed Pimm's jelly at which somebody has hurled fistfuls of chopped cucumbers and strawberries. It's like a stray plate of salad that you might pick up at a party before you realized that somebody had dumped the warm dregs of a drink into it. The servers seemed eager to oblige, but gave the impression of struggling in the face of unseen enemies. One night, asked \"Still or sparkling?,\" I chose the sparkling water. My server began to walk away, then turned on his heel and said, \"I'm sorry, we're all out of sparkling.\" \"That's fine,\" I said. \"I'll just have the BrewDog I.P.A. instead.\" \"I apologize,\" he said. \"We don't have any draft beer.\" After the main course was cleared, I asked him for the Chocolate Bluebird. \"That is our signature dessert,\" he said. I nodded. I had read that this was a chocolate mousse inside a blue-chocolate shell in the shape of a vintage racecar once made by the Bluebird Motor Company. \"Unfortunately, we do not have it tonight,\" he said. His courtesy went a long way. Ultimately, though, I preferred the blunt approach that one of the bartenders took with one of my guests. Looking over the long list of old and new cocktails, she asked the bartender which he would recommend. \"If you want to drink something that tastes good,\" he said, \"I wouldn't order anything off our menu.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

It has only taken me five years. In my time as critic, I've searched the streets between Lincoln Center and Columbia University for good places to eat. I've come across some, but I could never convince myself that any of them were worth a special trip. That finally changed after October, when Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield opened White Gold Butchers , a restaurant inside a butcher shop on Amsterdam Avenue. Here's something strange: In all this time, I've never heard from Upper West Side readers either attacking me for ignoring their neighborhood or tipping me off to a gem I'd overlooked. Have they just given up hope after watching the local restaurants they could honestly tell friends were worth traveling for -- Picholine, Telepan, Ouest -- close one by one? Another odd thing: White Gold is the first Bloomfield-Friedman restaurant where I have never had to wait to be seated. True, one night I showed up ridiculously early, and by the time I left, a small crowd by the door was eyeing my table. But people in the neighborhood tell me it is possible more often than not to walk right in and sit down. This is not typically the case at the Spotted Pig , the Breslin Bar & Dining Room , Salvation Burger or other restaurants run by Ms. Bloomfield and Mr. Friedman. Where is everybody? People, April Bloomfield is cooking meat, one of the things she does best. Two young butchers, Jocelyn Guest and Erika Nakamura, are partners in the restaurant; in their blue aprons and white shirts, they oversee the carving and trimming and sawing and chopping. Looking at the colors in the glass butcher's case, the plum purple of the raw pork and the marigold yellow of the chicken skin, you know that this meat will cook up so nicely that it can be eaten and enjoyed all by itself. White Gold doesn't go quite that far, but it comes close. The menu gets right to the point, no small talk: The main courses fall under the heading Plates. There are usually four of them, cooked very simply. A gorgeously juicy and pink length of grilled pork, for example, was flecked with sage salt, and its only garnish was a spoonful of sauce made from apples -- not applesauce but a saltier and more complex reduction. Beef heart was served like steak, sliced into small, tender, nearly rare slabs. The spice-and-nut blend dukkah was the seasoning. Probably meant more for the roasted carrots on the same plate, the dukkah was also at home with the heart. A special one night was a portion of pork shoulder cooked in milk at a quiet murmur until the meat had relaxed and the liquid had boiled away and the fat had pulled together in sweet curds the color of peanut butter. It sounds and looks creepy, but it's wonderful. As good as it felt to lose myself in tender pork and caramelized milk, the high point of that dinner was beef carpaccio. White Gold now makes my favorite version of this classic Italian dish in New York. The toppings are sliced white mushrooms, parsley leaves and pickled broccoli stems. I'd never given much thought to pickled broccoli stems before, but now I think their highest use is with darkly lush sheets of raw beef furred over with fine white horseradish gratings. The raviolo in brodo is Italian, too, up to a point. The broth is beef, deeply brown and sticky on the lips. For the single raviolo, two circles of barely cooked kabocha squash do the work normally done by pasta, sandwiching a creamy core of taleggio that will end up running out and slipping into the broth, no matter how careful you are, flavoring the soup along with red drops of pumpkinseed oil. If none of this has persuaded you to take a train or crosstown bus to the Upper West Side, then it's time to let the \"crispy layered potato\" out of its cage. These are little golden boxes made of thin rectangles of potato stacked like Post-it notes, then fried in beef fat. I'm not sure how they stay together. They are crunchy and delicate and impossible to stop eating. White Gold has found a way to multiply the surface area of a fairly small piece of potato so that more potato comes into contact with hot oil. This is a significant advance in the field of applied potato physics. Like Fleishers Craft Butchery, Dickson's Farmstand Meats and a few other butcher shops, White Gold buys whole animals. In theory, the cooks should be able to get creative with the odds and ends, yet offal isn't a major feature of the menu. I have to admit that the White Gold of my dreams would serve not just chicken liver mousse but gizzard confit; not just grilled lamb leg but sautéed kidneys; not just pork shoulder but stuffed trotters. In the morning, White Gold is devoted to egg sandwiches. At lunch, you can order a version of the chopped cheese, a late-night specialty of bodegas in Harlem and the Bronx. As the sandwich has started showing up in other neighborhoods, at higher prices, it has become a symbol of cultural appropriation and gentrification. White Gold sells it for $11, roughly twice what it would cost on its home turf. It is also a somewhat odd interpretation, not so much the classic cheese-slicked heap of ground beef as a cheeseburger hacked into chunks. Britain does better than the Bronx on White Gold's lunch menu. Head straight to the savory-pastry case and get a sausage roll, a stub of golden crust wrapped around pink, coarse breakfast sausages, or a pasty, a hand pie that can be held by its rolled seam, which looks like a fat lip. One pasty is filled with potatoes and fontina; another with beef stew. Both are so good I'd recommend buying an extra to tote around in an empty pocket. One reason White Gold isn't mobbed at night may be that, for the first time, Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield have built a restaurant without a bar. Wine and beer are available, from Narragansett in a can to (when I was there) a six-year-old bottle of petit verdot from Clendenen Family Vineyards, but there's nowhere to drink them unless you're eating. The space doesn't encourage hanging out with a glass. This may have to do with the bright lighting -- butchers need to be able to see to do their work -- or the relative starkness of the atmosphere. The wallpaper in the restroom has more energy than the rest of the interior design put together. White Gold reminds me of small, obscure, excellent restaurants I've tripped into during vacations, the tapas bar or the trattoria that happened to be close to where I was staying and that I remember better than the places other people had recommended before I left home. White Gold may never be a destination, but in its modest and simple way, it's memorable. \r",{"entities":[[44,59,"LOC"],[206,220,"LOC"],[225,244,"LOC"],[452,471,"REST"],[496,508,"TYPE"],[512,529,"LOC"],[596,611,"LOC"],[842,851,"REST"],[853,860,"REST"],[862,867,"REST"],[908,918,"REST"],[1270,1281,"REST"],[1288,1313,"REST"],[1316,1332,"REST"],[1450,1454,"FOOD"],[1755,1759,"FOOD"],[1791,1803,"FOOD"],[1824,1828,"FOOD"],[1900,1910,"REST"],[2145,2157,"DISH"],[2255,2261,"FOOD"],[2269,2279,"FOOD"],[2322,2332,"DISH"],[2349,2354,"FOOD"],[2406,2419,"FOOD"],[2426,2432,"FOOD"],[2480,2495,"FOOD"],[2519,2525,"FOOD"],[2552,2558,"FOOD"],[2596,2609,"DISH"],[2620,2624,"FOOD"],[2653,2657,"FOOD"],[2761,2775,"FOOD"],[2861,2872,"FOOD"],[2877,2893,"FOOD"],[2929,2944,"DISH"],[2945,2955,"REST"],[3002,3009,"CUISINE"],[3018,3027,"LOC"],[3052,3067,"FOOD"],[3069,3083,"FOOD"],[3088,3111,"FOOD"],[3144,3166,"FOOD"],[3243,3247,"FOOD"],[3270,3287,"FOOD"],[3302,3318,"DISH"],[3322,3329,"CUISINE"],[3355,3360,"FOOD"],[3364,3368,"FOOD"],[3422,3429,"FOOD"],[3460,3474,"FOOD"],[3504,3509,"FOOD"],[3540,3548,"FOOD"],[3600,3605,"FOOD"],[3681,3697,"FOOD"],[3772,3787,"LOC"],[3816,3837,"DISH"],[3913,3919,"FOOD"],[3962,3971,"FOOD"],[4070,4080,"REST"],[4153,4159,"FOOD"],[4173,4179,"FOOD"],[4204,4212,"FOOD"],[4267,4273,"FOOD"],[4288,4312,"REST"],[4314,4339,"REST"],[4356,4369,"TYPE"],[4371,4381,"REST"],[4482,4487,"FOOD"],[4548,4558,"REST"],[4593,4613,"DISH"],[4618,4632,"DISH"],[4643,4659,"DISH"],[4664,4679,"DISH"],[4690,4703,"DISH"],[4708,4725,"DISH"],[4742,4752,"REST"],[4767,4782,"FOOD"],[4824,4838,"DISH"],[4866,4873,"TYPE"],[4877,4883,"LOC"],[4888,4898,"LOC"],[4906,4914,"FOOD"],[5049,5059,"REST"],[5218,5229,"FOOD"],[5235,5247,"FOOD"],[5268,5275,"LOC"],[5293,5302,"LOC"],[5306,5318,"REST"],[5381,5393,"DISH"],[5446,5464,"FOOD"],[5471,5476,"DISH"],[5480,5488,"FOOD"],[5558,5563,"DISH"],[5579,5587,"FOOD"],[5592,5599,"FOOD"],[5614,5624,"FOOD"],[5718,5728,"REST"],[5850,5854,"TYPE"],[5855,5859,"FOOD"],[5864,5868,"FOOD"],[5889,5901,"DISH"],[5958,5970,"FOOD"],[5976,6002,"REST"],[6356,6366,"REST"],[6459,6468,"TYPE"],[6476,6485,"TYPE"],[6627,6637,"REST"]]}],[" There's a lot of heavy eye contact going on at this restaurant. One of the most strenuous competitors is a guy at the next table who's staring down the woman across from him while giving her a ferocious, what-big-teeth-you-have grin. I'd call his expression carnivorous, but we're at Nix , and there's nothing to eat here but vegetables. Not long ago, vegetarian restaurants in the United States were the last place you'd expect to see people who looked as if they couldn't wait to go home and have non-tantric sex. The mood in their dining rooms could be tranquil, convalescent, earth-motherly, doctrinaire or ascetic, but rarely did it ripple with the energy of hookups in progress. The crackle in the air at Nix and other recent meatless restaurants is what you get when you liberate vegetables from vegetarianism. Stripped of ideology, Nix is freed up for hedonic pursuits. Sure, plants contain nutrients. But the people drinking Nix martinis probably aren't doing it because they hope the oils left on the vodka's surface by a thyme branch will boost their supplies of omega-3 fatty acids. Nor are the anti-inflammatory benefits of crucifers likely to be top of mind as they eat the cauliflower tempura. More likely, they are flashing back to the last time they sat on the floor eating Chinese food out of a takeout box. The fried cauliflower has been submerged in a sauce that tastes like spicy ketchup. Poppy seeds on top make a small but real contribution when one of these orange grenades of crunch and heat is stuffed, along with a pickle slice, into the soft, white half-moon of a steamed bun. The chefs lobbing those orange grenades at this four-month-old restaurant in Greenwich Village are Nicolas Farias and John Fraser. Mr. Fraser's meatless menus at Dovetail , his home base on the Upper West Side, are much talked about. Stronger demonstrations of his wit and resourcefulness, his ability to treat vegetables like meat without seeming to be pulling a scam, are the spit-roasted beets and the coffee-laced carrots Wellington at Narcissa , his more casual restaurant in the Standard East Village hotel. One of Mr. Fraser's collaborators at Narcissa is James Truman , a partner at Nix. That's him in the pressed suit and rumpled hair at the end of the bar. He recognizes me, too. Before he got into the restaurant business, we used to run into each other at the parties of friends we have in common. As an editor at Condé Nast and later its editorial director, he used to worry about helping magazines see around corners. This approach informs Nix, which among other things is an attempt to locate the future of vegetable-centered dining. The white walls and other interior features, designed by the architect Elizabeth Roberts , have a low-key simplicity, and candlelight gives them a bit of mystery. The details don't scream to be noticed. You have to look closely to see that the lamp bases are the twisted roots of old junipers. Understatement is, of course, flattering to the observer who picks up on it, which may explain why Nix seems to draw the upper crust of the downtown creative class, people with interesting jewelry and significant haircuts. I was hypnotized like a cobra by the patterns in the vintage dresses purchased for the hosts; the dyed cotton smocks designed by Paul Marlow for the female servers; and Mr. Marlow's print dresses, one for each night of the week, worn by the wine director, Andrea Morris. But lavishing all this care on the women's costumes while the male servers slink like ninjas in simple dark shirts and jeans can border on the fetishistic. Ms. Morris's wine list also avoids the obvious. She has an Alsatian Chasselas, an Edelzwicker from Oregon and a lithe Pelaverga from the Piedmont, which Mr. Truman sold me one night as the product of a \"banished grape.\" (In fact, it has D.O.C. status in the Verduno area of the region.) Staying away from name brands has another benefit: keeping the prices on almost every bottle under $100. More like this, please. Editors occasionally follow their instincts right out the window. I think Mr. Truman has done this with the restaurant's name. It comes from an 1893 Supreme Court decision, Nix v. Hedden , which held that tomatoes were a vegetable and thus subject to an import tax that did not apply to fruit. Mr. Truman also liked the look of the word with its \"three strong letters.\" What seems not to have entered the calculations, although it will occur to parents of school-age children and to any search engine, is that these three strong letters are also used by an over-the-counter delousing treatment . Now let's eat! I highly recommend starting with a wheel of flatbread baked in the tandoor, and a cup of raw young vegetables or one of the dips. The red-pepper walnut spread is a wonderful take on muhammara, while the crushed avocado with mint and chai curry powder is fun because it looks like guacamole and isn't. In the part of the menu labeled \"lighter,\" I like the little carrots baked in parchment with spices and bulgur very much. Tomato water, buzzed with fresh green chile rings, is so entrancing that it even made the mung beans bobbing in it taste good, although its higher purpose is to perk up a charred half of an avocado. In one salad, spears of Persian cucumber are splashed with a jerk sauce that's coaxed back from the brink of too-muchness by crumbled goat cheese and, in an inspired touch, sliced kumquats. In another, jicama is shaved into what the menu calls ribbons. They're more like seatbelts, and the dressing of blood oranges and Fresno peppers can't quite get a grip on them. The menu's third section is called \"bolder.\" Here you will find the fried cauliflower buns and shiitake mushrooms sauced, very effectively, as if they were pasta cacio e pepe and spooned over creamy, rough-grained polenta. There's a bowl of stir-fried brown rice that, once it's stirred up with nori, chanterelles and a runny egg, reminds me of bibimbap. Very occasionally, I wished the vegetables had been allowed to relax a little. Artichokes shouldn't have to compete with broccoli rabe, tomato sauce and ricotta. Puréed sweet potato gets the right sauce, a pumpkinseed mole, but the line of reasoning that led the kitchen to pack the purée into rubbery balloons of tofu skin should be re-examined. Servers tell you at the outset of the meal that if you want to finish with the quartered pineapple roasted for 20 minutes in the tandoor, then brushed with tamarind glaze, you should order it early. This is sound advice. They won't tell you that if you finish the whole thing, you may never make it to the rest of Italivi Reboreda's dessert menu, including the dark and tender chocolate cake that is wrapped, jelly-roll-style, around chocolate mousse. But I will. \r",{"entities":[[285,288,"REST"],[353,363,"DIET"],[383,396,"LOC"],[712,715,"REST"],[733,741,"DIET"],[804,818,"DIET"],[841,844,"REST"],[935,947,"DISH"],[1012,1019,"FOOD"],[1033,1038,"FOOD"],[1189,1209,"DISH"],[1292,1299,"CUISINE"],[1331,1348,"FOOD"],[1396,1410,"FOOD"],[1411,1422,"FOOD"],[1543,1549,"FOOD"],[1593,1605,"FOOD"],[1683,1700,"LOC"],[1768,1776,"REST"],[1800,1815,"LOC"],[1917,1927,"FOOD"],[1933,1937,"FOOD"],[1984,2002,"DISH"],[2024,2042,"DISH"],[2046,2054,"REST"],[2091,2112,"LOC"],[2157,2165,"REST"],[2197,2201,"REST"],[2560,2563,"REST"],[3048,3051,"REST"],[3658,3676,"DISH"],[3681,3692,"DISH"],[3698,3704,"LOC"],[3717,3726,"DISH"],[3736,3744,"LOC"],[4220,4228,"FOOD"],[4670,4679,"FOOD"],[4760,4784,"DISH"],[4829,4876,"DISH"],[4906,4915,"FOOD"],[4981,5037,"DISH"],[5049,5061,"DISH"],[5081,5092,"FOOD"],[5139,5149,"FOOD"],[5239,5247,"FOOD"],[5272,5288,"FOOD"],[5309,5319,"FOOD"],[5382,5393,"FOOD"],[5428,5437,"FOOD"],[5450,5456,"FOOD"],[5550,5563,"FOOD"],[5568,5582,"FOOD"],[5683,5705,"DISH"],[5710,5728,"FOOD"],[5777,5789,"DISH"],[5829,5837,"FOOD"],[5856,5877,"DISH"],[5910,5914,"FOOD"],[5916,5928,"FOOD"],[5941,5944,"FOOD"],[5960,5969,"DISH"],[6049,6059,"FOOD"],[6091,6104,"FOOD"],[6106,6118,"FOOD"],[6123,6131,"FOOD"],[6132,6151,"DISH"],[6176,6192,"FOOD"],[6284,6293,"FOOD"],[6396,6415,"DISH"],[6473,6487,"FOOD"],[6631,6649,"REST"],[6694,6708,"DISH"],[6751,6768,"FOOD"]]}],[" On Monday, I chopped a week's worth of food scraps. It took most of an hour in my kitchen to reduce carrot leaves, cauliflower stems, onion butts and scallion greens to small bits that I hoped would make an appetizing lunch for the molds, mini-bugs and earthworms in the backyard compost bin. The next night, I had a meal that made me wonder if my time would have been better spent tossing everything with a good vinaigrette and eating it myself. The setting was Dan Barber's Greenwich Village restaurant, normally known as Blue Hill. For three weeks in March, he has converted it into a pop-up called wastED where he and his cooks sell fish bones, bruised and misshapen vegetables, stale bread and other items not commonly thought of as food for $15 a plate. The pop-up presents a creative challenge to the kitchen crew (how can we make this stuff taste good?) and an intellectual challenge to the diner (why do we assume it won't?). It was a night of thoughtful, creative, entertaining and surprisingly tasty agitprop. Chefs with an eye on the bottom line try to avoid kitchen waste. In a memorable scene in Bill Buford's book \"Heat,\" Mario Batali berates Babbo's cooks for throwing out vegetable scraps that could make perfectly good ravioli fillings while he roots around in a trash can like a bear cub at a campground. In their search for overlooked ingredients, Mr. Barber and his crew did more than that. They went out on a crosstown refuse hunt. From Baldor Specialty Foods, a restaurant supplier in the Bronx, came bruised outer leaves from heads of bok choy and peelings from fennel, kohlrabi and apples for the \"Dumpster dive vegetable salad\" that persuaded me to reconsider my compost habits. To be painstakingly accurate, most of the persuasion was done by a buttery vinaigrette of ground pistachios, a swipe of tarragon sauce and a heap of white froth made by draining the liquid from chickpea cans and whisking it. Smashed pulp from Liquiteria's juice presses was dyed to a reasonably convincing beef color by beet juice, shaped into burgers and slapped on buns made from \"repurposed\" bread. From Raffetto's, the shop on Houston Street, they picked up remnant noodles that ran from the pasta rollers between batches of dough. These were boiled together, so they ranged from floppy to taut, and were dressed with a mildly fishy sauce made from monkfish tripe and smoked fish heads. The kitchen staff members took turns dropping off plates. One showed pictures of Baldor's bagged, peeled produce on an iPod and another pantomimed how he had scraped skate wings until his arms hurt. The night's guest chef, Philippe Bertineau from Alain Ducasse's bistro in Midtown, Benoit, appeared with head cheese, a pig foot croquette, stewed offal and tongue layered with foie gras, a reminder that French country cooking has a long tradition of turning scraps into treats. Halfway through dinner, Mr. Barber came to the table with a sheet of wax paper holding a fish skeleton as long as a baguette. \"I grew up on this stuff,\" he said. He didn't mean the bones, which used to belong to a black cod, but the shiny white flesh sold in appetizing shops as sable. When sable is filleted, some meat sticks to the carcass. I unstuck it with a sauce spoon. Sable is always a treat, and this came with a bonus: the gooey, soft bits hugging the spine. Between mouthfuls, I crunched on some crisp carrot tops with fried fish skin. The skin, the bones, and the heads in the salad dressing came from Acme, the Brooklyn facility that gives New York some of its finest smoked fish. The restaurant was packed to the gills, one part of the fish that was left off the menu. A long row of high tables had been shoehorned into the center of the dining room. These were not just any tables, either. \"The tables were grown -- yes, grown -- during the second half of February with compostable materials and mycelium,\" read a note on the back of the menu. The walls, meanwhile, were covered by a white fabric draped over crop rows to keep out frost and aphids. They were backlit, which gave the restaurant the feel of a wedding tent. \"A wedding tent, that's nice,\" Mr. Barber's brother and partner in Blue Hill, David, said when he stopped by my table. \"Most people say it looks like a meth lab.\" Breaking with protocol, I had asked Dan Barber for a reservation. This, of course, gave him the chance to set aside the choicest carrot tops and fish heads. Let the reader beware. I dropped the fake-name routine because seats have been scarce, my deadline was zooming in, and I am not trying to write a restaurant review. Still, the forewarned reader may wonder what I thought of the meal. I had one of the best times I've enjoyed in a restaurant in the last year. The food was great, full of the surprises that happen when cooks run into inspiration at full creative tilt. Almost every bite was delicious, with a few exceptions. \"Repurposed\" buns did not knock Martin's potato rolls from their place in my heart. I had trouble getting at the fried monkfish wings, which were shaped like a V, with most of the good stuff jammed down in the crevice. If I were going to enjoy them on a regular basis, I'd need to grow a snout. Also, the crackers served alongside an intense and rich bowl of broth made from desiccated dry-aged beef trimmings had almost no flavor. They were made from field corn, the commodity crop that goes into high-fructose corn syrup, cattle troughs and ethanol. It accounts for 99 percent of the nation's cornfields, and it is the only ingredient used at wastED that I'm convinced humans have no business eating. This was Mr. Barber's point, of course. The meal was gently and consistently seasoned with a protest against the grotesque way Americans waste food while millions of us go hungry. Lack of money and other resources forced members of 6.8 million households in the United States to eat less than they normally would at times during 2013, the latest year for which government statistics are available. At the same time, 133 billion pounds of the food that is available to consumers goes into the garbage annually. The facts and numbers could go on, but I feel ashamed already. Our food is produced and consumed in a bogglingly complex web. It can't easily be changed, certainly not by a three-week stunt in an expensive Manhattan restaurant. Perceptions do change, though, and quickly. Sliced white bread was a prestigious item in 1960. Many find it worthless today. For years our restaurant culture has placed supreme value in pristine, high-priced ingredients. What if everybody who could afford restaurants like Blue Hill learned instead to prize bruised vegetables because they had been transformed by a chef's skill and ingenuity? What might we do with the ingredients that any hack could cook? It's a provocative, appealingly subversive idea. For now, whenever one of my children complains about dinner, I'll silence him by saying that I once ate garbage, and liked it. \r",{"entities":[[101,114,"FOOD"],[116,133,"FOOD"],[135,146,"FOOD"],[151,166,"FOOD"],[414,425,"FOOD"],[477,494,"LOC"],[525,535,"REST"],[603,609,"REST"],[1238,1245,"FOOD"],[1460,1482,"REST"],[1509,1518,"LOC"],[1560,1568,"FOOD"],[1587,1593,"FOOD"],[1595,1603,"FOOD"],[1608,1614,"FOOD"],[1623,1654,"DISH"],[1781,1792,"FOOD"],[1803,1813,"FOOD"],[1826,1840,"FOOD"],[1900,1908,"FOOD"],[1949,1961,"REST"],[2026,2036,"FOOD"],[2050,2057,"FOOD"],[2113,2123,"REST"],[2137,2151,"LOC"],[2176,2183,"FOOD"],[2359,2373,"FOOD"],[2378,2396,"FOOD"],[2563,2574,"FOOD"],[2660,2666,"TYPE"],[2670,2677,"LOC"],[2679,2685,"REST"],[2701,2712,"FOOD"],[2716,2734,"FOOD"],[2736,2748,"FOOD"],[2753,2759,"FOOD"],[2773,2782,"FOOD"],[2800,2806,"CUISINE"],[2991,3000,"FOOD"],[3089,3098,"FOOD"],[3154,3160,"FOOD"],[3166,3171,"FOOD"],[3251,3256,"FOOD"],[3388,3399,"FOOD"],[3411,3421,"FOOD"],[3464,3478,"FOOD"],[3489,3493,"REST"],[3499,3507,"LOC"],[3528,3536,"LOC"],[3556,3568,"FOOD"],[4179,4188,"REST"],[4404,4415,"FOOD"],[4420,4431,"FOOD"],[4905,4922,"DISH"],[4937,4945,"REST"],[4946,4958,"FOOD"],[5018,5038,"DISH"],[5210,5218,"FOOD"],[5300,5314,"FOOD"],[5357,5367,"FOOD"],[5550,5556,"REST"],[5870,5883,"LOC"],[6324,6333,"LOC"],[6397,6408,"FOOD"],[6619,6628,"REST"]]}]]}

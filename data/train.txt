The O
age O
of O
French B-CUISINE
dining O
in O
New B-DISH
York I-DISH
that O
blossomed O
in O
the O
unpromising O
soil O
of O
the O
Corona O
ash O
dumps O
during O
the O
1939 O
World O
's O
Fair O
, O
at O
the O
French O
Pavilion O
's O
restaurant O
, O
seemed O
to O
come O
to O
its O
close O
about O
10 O
years O
ago O
as O
mastodons O
like O
Lutece O
lumbered O
into O
the O
fossil O
record O
. O

Today O
, O
that O
seems O
less O
like O
the O
end O
of O
an O
epoch O
than O
a O
salutary O
cooling O
- O
off O
period O
. O

If O
you O
are O
having O
trouble O
getting O
a O
reservation O
at O
a O
new O
place O
this O
year O
, O
odds O
are O
high O
that O
the O
menu O
is O
speckled O
with O
accents O
grave O
, O
acute O
and O
circumflex O
. O

Dirty B-EST

there O
fizzled O
. O

And O
just O
north O
of O
Washington B-LOC
Square I-LOC
Park I-LOC
, O
at O
an O
address O
that O
had O
started O
to O
look O
like O
a O
certain O
restaurant O
- O
killer O
, O
the O
doors O
at O
a O
new O
Provencal B-CUISINE
spot O
called O
Claudette B-EST
have O
been O
thrown O
open O
to O
reveal O
closely O
packed O
rattan O
chairs O
, O
none O
of O
them O
empty O
. O

Claudette B-EST
's O
charms O
are O
many O
and O
begin O
with O
those O
doors O
, O
which O
replace O
the O
woebegone O
sidewalk O
enclosure O
that O
used O
to O
make O
it O
look O
as O
if O
nobody O
were O
home O
. O

Losing O
a O
few O
seats O
has O
made O
reservations O
harder O
to O
land O
, O
but O
the O
reward O
is O
that O
the O
doors O
have O
let O
in O
the O
atypically O
cool O
breezes O
all O
summer O
, O
along O
with O
a O
view O
of O
lower O
Fifth B-LOC

wide O
, O
leisurely O
sidewalks O
, O
where O
somebody O
is O
always O
walking O
a O
bichon O

. O

Inside O
, O
Claudette B-EST
looks O
like O
an O
expensive O
summer O
rental O
that O
is O
being O
used O
as O
a O
French B-CUISINE
street B-TYPE
- I-TYPE
corner O
cafe O
. O

( O
Rattan O
connects O
the O
two O
motifs O
. O
) O

The O
beach O
rental O
aesthetic O
is O
supplied O
by O
the O
whitewashed O
tables O
, O
throw O
pillows O
and O
shelves O
lined O
with O
books O
that O
are O
arranged O
by O
color O
and O
separated O
by O
anonymous O
knickknacks O
. O

Contributing O
to O
the O
cafe O
look O
are O
the O
compact O
bar O
and O
the O
winning O
cast O
of O
aperitif O
cocktails O
, O
which O
all O
seem O
to O
be O
named O
after O
Roger O
Vadim O
's O
wives O
. O

Small O
, O
gentle O
and O
very O
appealing O
, O
the O
Brigitte O
and O
her O
cohorts O
cheerfully O
buck O
the O
trend O
toward O
potent O
, O
convoluted O
cocktails O
that O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
behave O
at O
the O
dinner O
table O
. O

Claudette B-EST
's O
food O
follows O
the O
example O
of O
the O
aperitifs O
; O
it O
is O
light O
, O
approachable O
and O
unlikely O
to O
impair O
your O
ability O
to O
stand O
up O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
an O
intelligent O
salad B-FOOD
, O
Claudette B-EST
has O
plenty O
: O
green B-FOOD
beans I-FOOD
and O
vinegared B-FOOD
hearts I-FOOD

a O

of O

and O

tugged O
in O
an O
unexpected O

Claudette B-EST
makes O
an O
unleavened O
, O
layered O
flatbread B-DISH
, O
similar O
to O
traditional O

, O
that O
is O
good O
when O
hot O

especially O
with O

Gradually O
, O
it O
becomes O
clear O
that O
Claudette B-EST

chef O
, O
Wade O
Moises O
, O
and O
chef O
de O
cuisine O
, O
Koren O
Grieveson O
, O
have O
made O
a O
smart O
decision O
about O
Provence B-LOC
. O

Rather O
than O
treating O
it O
as O
if O
it O
were O
frozen O
in O
time O
and O
sealed O
off O
from O
the O
world O
-- O
Peter O

they O
cast O
a O
few O
glances O
at O
the O
North O

who O

and O

there O
. O

Claudette B-EST
's O
owners O
, O
Carlos O
Suarez O
and O
Mark O
Barak O
, O
were O
traveling O
in O
Provence B-LOC
when O
, O
like O
many O
English O
- O
speaking O
tourists O
, O
they O
fell O
under O
the O
sunny O
spell O
of O
Lourmarin B-LOC
. O

They O
had O
a O
charmed O
meal O
in O
that O
town O
at O
a O
restaurant O
founded O
by O
Claudette O
Sammut O
, O
a O
Frenchwoman O
who O
lived O
in O
Tunisia B-LOC
until O
the O
1950s O
. O

Before O
it O
was O
over O
, O
they O
had O
asked O
her O
family O
if O
they O
could O
take O
her O
name O
back O
to O
Manhattan B-LOC
. O

They O
brought O
her O
bouillabaisse B-DISH
, O
too O
, O
an O
eccentric O
white O
version O
that O
has O
a O
puff B-FOOD
- O
pastry O
hat O
and O
lemon B-FOOD
juice I-FOOD
but O
no O
tomatoes B-FOOD
and O
an O
undetectable O
quantity O
of O
saffron B-FOOD
. O

I O
was O
not O
as O
smitten O
by O
its O
tenaciously O
sour O
broth B-FOOD
as O
they O
were O
. O

As O
a O
sauce O
for O
the O
monkfish B-DISH
, I-DISH
baby I-DISH
octopus I-DISH
and I-DISH
shellfish O
, O
it O
might O
get O
by O
, O
but O
as O
a O
soup B-FOOD
, O
it O
lost O
its O
appeal O
after O
a O
few O
spoonfuls O
, O
and O
even O
sooner O
the O
time O
it O
was O
oversalted O
. O

A O
somewhat O
more O
successful O
souvenir O
from O
Lourmarin B-LOC
is O
the O
pieds B-DISH
paquets I-DISH
. O

Traditionally O
an O

Or O
, O
as O
a O
server O
with O
an O
oratorical O
flair O
put O
it O
, O
" O
we O
absented O
the O
feet O
for O
cleanliness O
of O
flavor O

What O
we O
get O
instead O
are O
tripe B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
wrapped I-FOOD
bundles I-FOOD
of I-FOOD
pork O
shoulder O
braised O
in O
white B-FOOD
wine I-FOOD
and O
tomatoes B-FOOD

Tender O
but O
polite O
, O
they O

the O

bread I-FOOD

fantastic O
when O
dunked O

As O
the O
absented O
feet O
suggest O
, O
Claudette B-EST
's O
exploration O
of O
Provence B-LOC
can O
be O
undercut O
by O
its O
impulse O
to O
play O
it O
safe O
, O
to O
water O
down O
the O
pastis B-FOOD

Braised B-DISH

arrive O
in O
a O
tagine O

but O
they O
are O

cooked O
in O
one O
. O

When O
servers O
lift O
the O
glazed O
lid O
, O
the O
mint B-FOOD
and O
other O
aromatics O
do O
n't O
rush O
into O
your O
lungs O
the O
way O
they O
would O
in O
Tangier B-LOC
. O

The O
tiny O
dab O
of O
harissa B-FOOD
does O
n't O
go O
far O
, O
either O
. O

But O
the O
chicken B-FOOD
is O
moist O
and O
well O
browned O
, O
the O
sauce O
gets O
sunny O
Mediterranean O
sweetness O
from O
oranges B-FOOD
, O
and O
for O
complexity O
and O
originality O
, O
the O
dish O
leaves O
the O
other O
main O
courses O
in O
the O
shade O
. O

After O
making O
its O
opening O
moves O
so O
gracefully O
, O
Claudette B-EST
grows O
oddly O
clumsy O
at O
the O
end O
. O

The O
most O
reliable O
dessert O
is O
the O
pistachio B-DISH
cake I-DISH
sandwiching O
a O
layer O
of O
citrus B-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
, O
smartly O
accompanied O
by O
candied B-FOOD
orange I-FOOD
peel I-FOOD
. O

But O
a O
chocolate B-DISH
pot I-DISH
de I-DISH
creme I-DISH
with I-DISH
harissa I-DISH
was O
grainy O
, O
and O
a O
supposed O
bread B-DISH
pudding I-DISH
of I-DISH
chocolate I-DISH
- I-DISH
almond O
croissants O
looked O
and O
tasted O
exactly O
like O
a O
stack O
of O
stale O
pastries B-FOOD
. O

Most O
of O
the O
time O
, O
though O
, O
the O
kitchen O
does O
what O
it O
sets O
out O
to O
do O
, O
even O
if O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
holding O
back O
. O

If O
Mr. O
Moises O
and O
Ms. O
Grieveson O
choose O
to O
dive O
a O
bit O
deeper O
into O
their O
vision O
of O
an O
African O
- O
tinged O
Provence B-FOOD
, O
they O
could O
make O
the O
Gallic O

interesting O
by O
cleaning O

As O
always O
at O
Sammy B-EST
's O
, O
I O
walked O
out O
feeling O
as O
if O
I O
had O
eaten O
a O
football O
stuffed O
with O
chicken B-FOOD
fat I-FOOD
and O
beef B-FOOD
. O

The O
kitchen O
, O
so O
unpredictable O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
meat O
temperatures O
, O
is O
absolutely O
consistent O
in O
its O
ability O
to O
produce O
starch O
that O
detonates O
inside O
the O
stomach O
. O

The O
fried B-DISH
kreplach I-DISH
are O
grenades O
of O
dough B-FOOD
with O
a O
tiny O
core O
of O
chopped O
meat B-FOOD
that O
tastes O
like O
dough B-FOOD
, O
too O
. O

The O
latkes B-DISH
are O
flavorless O
and O
textureless O
, O
but O
not O
weightless O
. O

Better O
than O
either O
, O
the O
kishke B-DISH
could O
stand O
some O
gravy B-FOOD
and O
some O
salt B-FOOD
. O

In O
fact O
, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
the O
grandmotherly O
sweet B-DISH
- I-DISH
and I-DISH
- O
sour O
stuffed O
cabbage O
, O
almost O
everything O
at O
Sammy B-EST
's O
needed O
salt B-FOOD
. O

Once O
it O
was O
added O
freely O
, O
the O
chopped B-DISH
liver I-DISH
was O
beyond O
reproach O
, O
the O
skirt B-DISH
steaks I-DISH
and O
lamb B-DISH
chops I-DISH
were O
excellent O
, O
and O
the O
fried B-DISH
silver I-DISH
- I-DISH
dollar O
potatoes O
were O
worth O
talking O
about O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
figure O
out O
why O
Sammy B-EST
's O
is O
cutting O
back O
on O
sodium O
after O
all O
these O
years O
, O
unless O
it O
is O
suddenly O
trying O
to O
atone O
for O
decades O
of O
treating O
schmaltz B-FOOD
as O
a O
dietary O
supplement O
. O

The O
menu O
is O
less O
distinctively O
Romanian B-CUISINE
than O
it O
once O
was O
. O

This O
is O
how O

But O
if O

Sammy B-EST

still O

I O
could O
see O
her O
grow O

" O
It O
feels O
so O
good O

back O

By O

not O

It O
is O

the O

This O
was O
the O
grim O
report O
from O
inside O
the O
latest O
East B-LOC
Village I-LOC
restaurant O
to O
have O
turned O
its O
no O

policy O
into O
a O
viral O
marketing O
campaign O
. O

A O
small O
, O
hungry O
mob O
was O
gathering O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
. O

Hoping O
to O
find O
a O
pleasant O
place O
to O
drink O
and O
snack O
until O
the O
phone O
rang O
, O
I O
herded O
my O

a O
new O
Basque B-CUISINE
- O
leaning O
tapas B-TYPE
place O
a O
few O
blocks O
away O

The O
room O
smelled O
like O
garlic B-FOOD
and O
smoke O
. O

A O
cured B-FOOD
pig I-FOOD
's I-FOOD
leg O
sat O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
bar O
, O
its O
ankle O
held O
tightly O
in O
a O
clamp O

A O
sharp O
knife O
had O
exposed O
its O
interior O
architecture O
of O
meat B-FOOD
and O
fat O
and O
sinew O
. O

Later O
, O
we O
ordered O
a O
few O
slices O
of O
this O
Iberico B-FOOD
ham I-FOOD
, O
and O
as O
it O
melted O
on O
our O
tongues O
, O
warm O
and O
salty O
, O
we O
all O
traded O
looks O
. O

We O
did O
it O
again O
when O
we O
ate O
crumbly O
shards O
of O
aged B-FOOD
manchego I-FOOD
that O
tasted O
of O
brown B-FOOD
butter I-FOOD
and O
caramel B-FOOD
. O

The O
looks O
meant O
: O
This O
kitchen O
knows O
where O
to O
get O
the O
good O
stuff O

That O
applied O
to O
many O
things O
we O
ate O
that O
night O

Jonah O
Miller O
, O
Huertas B-EST

chef O
, O
has O
written O
a O
concise O
menu O
of O
Basque B-CUISINE
- O
inspired O
tapas B-FOOD
, O
not O
all O
of O
which O
could O
be O
called O
cooking O
and O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
which O
is O
canned O
. O

I O
am O
not O
revealing O
any O
secrets O
here O
. O

Some O
food O
is O
still O
in O
its O
can O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
table O
, O
like O
the O
dense O
mackerel B-DISH
in I-DISH
olive I-DISH
oil I-DISH
, O
which O
we O
ate O
, O
happily O
, O
on O
sliced O
baguettes B-FOOD
with O
pimenton B-FOOD
aioli I-FOOD

" O
All O
the O

Basque B-CUISINE
seafood B-FOOD
goes O
straight O

" O
our O
server O
told O
us O
, O
and O
she O
was O
so O
convincing O
that O
we O
asked O
if O
she O
knew O
a O
store O
that O
sold O
these O
marvelous O
cans O
. O

She O
did O
. O

She O
also O
knew O
where O
we O
could O
buy O
the O
manchego B-FOOD
, O
which O
she O
was O
as O
excited O
about O
as O
we O
were O
. O

From O
the O
front O
door O
to O
the O
table O
, O
our O
service O
had O
been O
proactively O
friendly O
and O
enthusiastic O
. O

In O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
servers O
who O
learn O
that O
night O

menu O
are O
rare O
enough O
; O
here O
was O
one O
who O
seemed O
to O
know O
everything O
about O
every O
ingredient O
. O

She O
told O
us O
about O
a O
restaurant O
in O
San B-LOC
Sebastian I-LOC
, O
where O
the O
chef O
had O
come O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
to O
point O
out O
the O
most O
delicious O
parts O
of O
a O
turbot O
, O
showing O
her O
how O
to O
scoop O
out O
his O
favorite O
part O
, O
the O
cheeks O
. O

Then O
she O
took O
a O
deep O
breath O
and O
said O
: O
" O
Spain B-LOC

" O

It O
was O
n't O
all O

hams B-FOOD
in O
Mr. O
Miller O
's O
kitchen O
, O
not O
that O
I O
would O
have O
minded O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
something O
called O
Huertas B-DISH
rotos I-DISH
, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
the O
Basque B-CUISINE
dish O
huevos B-DISH
rotos I-DISH
interpreted O
as O
a O
kind O
of O
pasta B-FOOD
dish O
. O

Skinny O
threads O
of O
potato B-FOOD
were O
cooked O
al O

and O
tossed O
with O
chorizo B-FOOD
and O
its O
oil B-FOOD
, O
with O
a O
soft B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
cooked O
egg O
on O
top O
. O

It O
was O
gone O
in O
30 O
seconds O
. O

We O
drank O
vermouth B-FOOD
, O
made O
on O
site O
, O
while O
every O
few O
minutes O
somebody O
came O
around O
with O
a O
tray O
of O
small O
bites O
straight O
from O
the O
kitchen O
. O

There O
was O
egg B-FOOD
salad I-FOOD
on O
a O
slice O
of O
baguette B-FOOD
, O
with O
a O
sweet O
red B-FOOD
shrimp I-FOOD
on O
top O
; O
a O
golden O
croqueta B-FOOD

These O
came O
in O
single O
servings O
that O
you O
could O
take O
or O
decline O
, O
depending O
on O
how O
good O
they O
looked O
and O
how O
hungry O
you O
were O
. O

Each O
plate O
you O
took O
was O
marked O
down O
on O
a O
card O

Huertas B-EST
calls O
these O
items O
pintxos B-FOOD

a O
Basque O
term O
for O

smaller O
than O

and O
pinned O
together O
with O
a O

In O

( O
Mr. O
Miller O
got O
the O
idea O
from O
State B-EST
Bird I-EST
Provisions I-EST
in O
San B-LOC
Francisco I-LOC
. O
) O

Yet O
we O
felt O
much O
closer O
to O
the O
Spanish B-CUISINE
tapas B-TYPE
- O
bar O
spirit O
than O
if O
we O
had O
ordered O
10 O
or O
15 O
" O
small O
plates O
meant O
for O
sharing O
" O
at O
once O
, O
passed O
them O
around O
the O
table O
and O
called O
it O
dinner O
. O

This O
is O
rarely O
a O
satisfying O
way O
to O
eat O
, O
but O
it O
's O
how O
many O
Spanish B-CUISINE
restaurants O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
deal O
with O
tapas O
. O

The O
Huertas B-EST
modified O
dim O
- O
sum O
approach O
was O
perfect O
for O
people O
like O
us O
, O
who O
want O
to O
start O
with O
drinks O
and O
see O
how O
the O
night O
goes O
without O
being O
forced O
to O
turn O
tapas O
into O
dinner O
. O

The O
way O
this O
night O
went O
was O
that O
by O
the O
time O
the O
other O
restaurant O
called O
, O
we O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
leave O

I O
went O
back O
to O
Huertas B-EST
a O
week O
or O
two O
later O
. O

I O
had O
made O
reservations O
for O
the O
small O
, O
square O
back O
dining O
room O
, O
where O
Mr. O
Miller O
serves O
a O
set O
menu O
for O
$ O
55 O
. O

In O
the O
front O
room O
, O
the O
plates O
are O
unconnected O
episodes O
, O
and O
you O
supply O
the O
narrative O
yourself O
. O

In O
the O
back O
, O
you O
settle O
in O
while O
Mr. O
Miller O
tells O
a O
story O
in O
five O
courses O
. O

He O
started O
with O
a O
nod O
to O
the O
front O
room O
, O
a O
plate O
of O
little O
bites O
. O

There O
were O
gildas B-DISH
, O
found O
in O
every O
tapas O
bar O
in O
San B-LOC
Sebastian I-LOC
, O
sharp O
, O
clean O
and O
salty O
skewers O
of O
white B-FOOD
anchovy I-FOOD
threaded O
with O
spicy B-FOOD
green I-FOOD
pepper I-FOOD
and O
an O
olive B-FOOD
. O

There O
was O
a O
blistered O
mound O
of O
Padron B-DISH
peppers I-DISH
and I-DISH
garlic I-DISH
shrimp I-DISH
on O
toothpicks O
, O
too O
, O
not O
the O
sweetest O
or O
firmest O
I O
'd O
ever O
eaten O
. O

This O
was O
an O
anomaly O
; O
in O
general O
, O
the O
cooking O
at O
Huertas B-EST
stands O
out O
for O
its O
pure O
, O
fresh O
flavors O
. O

Then O
a O
separated B-DISH
egg I-DISH
. O

The O
white B-FOOD
, O
fried O
, O
lay O
under O
a O
jumble O
of O
corn B-FOOD
and O
tomatoes B-FOOD
cooked O
quickly O
with O
crisp O

chewy O
pimenton B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
cured O
bacon O
. O

The O
yolk B-FOOD
, O
raw O
, O
sat O
on O
top O
and O
served O
as O
sauce B-FOOD
. O

Next O
was O
skate B-DISH
, O
sweet O
and O
still O
a O
little O
juicy O
inside O
, O
with O
roasted O
turnips B-FOOD
and O
a O
pale O
- O
green O
, O
herbaceous O
sauce O
of O
pureed B-FOOD
turnip I-FOOD
greens I-FOOD
and O
fennel B-FOOD
. O

The O
seasonal O
Greenmarket O
aesthetic O
was O
familiar O
to O
me O
. O

Would O
any O
Basques O
recognize O
the O
dish O
? O

They O
would O
know O
the O
next O
course O
, O
wonderful O
garlic O
- O
and O
- O
pimenton O
- O
scented O
lamb B-FOOD
hot I-FOOD
dogs I-FOOD
called O
chistorra B-DISH
, O
even O
though O
they O
would O
be O
used O
to O
seeing O
chistorras B-FOOD
made O
with O
pork B-FOOD
or O
beef B-FOOD
. O

Alongside O
these O
house O

made O
sausages B-FOOD
, O
Mr. O
Miller O
had O
a O
wonderful O
succotash B-FOOD
of I-FOOD
late I-FOOD
- I-FOOD
summer O
beans O
. O

Dessert O
was O
a O
dream O
, O
a O
round O
and O
closely O
packed O
little O
goat B-DISH
- I-DISH
cheese O
cheesecake O
with O
a O
topping O
of O
candied B-FOOD
almonds I-FOOD
instead O
of O
a O
bottom O
crust O
. O

More O
tangy O
than O
sugary O
, O
the O
cake B-FOOD
took O
beautifully O
to O
a O
sauce O
made O
from O
ripe O
nectarines B-FOOD
. O

This O
night O
and O
a O
later O
one O
made O
it O
clear O
that O
dinner O
in O
Huertas B-EST
's O
back O
room O
ranks O
among O
the O
best O
deals O
in O
town O
, O
up O
there O
with O
the O
how O

do O
- O
they O
- O
do O
- O
it O
bargains O
at O
Contra B-EST
and O
Delaware B-EST
& I-EST
Hudson I-EST
. O

Mr. O
Miller O
shapes O
his O
menus O
so O
skillfully O
that O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
imagine O
wanting O
more O
. O

Still O
, O
once O
the O
familiar O
conventions O
of O
the O
modern O
tasting O
menu O
kicked O
in O
, O
I O
did O
steal O
a O
few O
looks O
at O
the O
front O
room O
, O
where O
a O
tray O
of O
hot O
croquetas B-DISH
always O
seemed O
to O
be O
going O
around O
. O

Maybe O
I O
wanted O
more O

Or O
maybe O
I O
just O
wanted O
a O

If O
you O
remember O
David O
Waltuck O
's O
cooking O
at O
Chanterelle B-EST
, O
eating O
at O
his O
new O
restaurant O
, O
Elan B-EST
, O
can O
be O
a O
little O
unnerving O
. O

Chanterelle B-EST
, O
a O
downtown O
pioneer O
when O
it O
opened O
in O
1979 O
, O
was O
an O
institution O
by O
the O
time O
it O
went O
out O
of O
business O
, O
just O
a O
few O
months O
short O
of O
its O
30th O
anniversary O
. O

Like O
all O
institutions O
, O
it O
had O
become O
padded O
by O
ritual O
, O
tradition O
and O
reputation O
. O

You O
went O
there O
to O
eat O
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
you O
also O
went O
because O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
city O
's O
greatest O
restaurants O
, O
holding O
four O
stars O
from O
The O
New O
York O
Times O
at O
various O
points O
. O

You O
went O
to O
find O
out O
whether O
the O
artist O
who O
had O
drawn O
the O
cover O
of O
the O
handwritten O
menu O
would O
be O
at O
the O
next O
table O
. O

You O
went O
because O
Karen O
Waltuck O
, O
the O
chef O
's O
wife O
and O
partner O
, O
and O
her O
ballet O
corps O
of O
elegant O
, O
mildly O
bohemian O
servers O
knew O
how O
to O
make O
you O
comfortable O
even O
if O
grand O
restaurants O
like O
Chanterelle B-EST
were O
n't O
usually O
your O
thing O
. O

At O
Elan B-EST
, O
which O
Mr. O
Waltuck O
opened O
with O
George O
Stinson O
north O
of O
Union B-LOC
Square I-LOC
this O
summer O
, O
the O
institutional O
padding O
is O
gone O
. O

Restaurants O
like O
Chanterelle B-EST
have O
a O
wine O
directory O
the O
size O
and O
mass O
of O
the O
Oxford O
English O
Dictionary O
, O
but O
Elan B-EST
's O
fits O
on O
four O
very O
tempting O
pages O
of O
reds O
and O
whites O
up O
to O
$ O
105 O
, O
with O
a O
short O
appendix O
of O
more O
- O
expensive O
bottles O
under O
the O
heading O
" O
treat O
yourself O

" O

The O
one O
reminder O
of O
Mr. O
Waltuck O
's O
downtown O
- O
bohemian O
past O
is O
the O
quintuple O
self O
- O
portrait O
by O
Chuck O
Close O
that O
hangs O
opposite O
the O
wide O
concrete O
bar O
, O
a O
black O
curtain O
from O
which O
disembodied O
Close O
heads O
stare O
grimly O
out O
of O
the O
darkness O
, O
like O
a O
trick O
in O
a O
haunted O
house O
. O

The O
monochromatic O
dining O
room O
is O
attractive O
enough O
, O
but O
a O
little O
too O
bright O
by O
night O
when O
the O
pinpoint O
lights O
beam O
straight O
down O
. O

Look O
along O
the O
banquette O
, O
and O
you O
see O
a O
row O
of O
shiny O
, O
illuminated O
noses O
. O

A O
heavy O
framed O
mirror O
seems O
to O
be O
suspended O
by O
a O
thick O
white O
rope O
, O
which O
somehow O
makes O
it O
look O
less O
secure O
. O

It O
's O
a O
reasonably O
quiet O
room O
, O
friendly O
to O
conversation O
, O
but O
not O
one O
whose O
innate O
beauty O
will O
draw O
you O
back O
. O

There O
is O
, O
in O
other O
words O
, O
little O
in O
the O
environment O
for O
the O
food O
to O
hide O
behind O
. O

Standing O
out O
in O
the O
open O
, O
Mr. O
Waltuck O
's O
cooking O
is O
revealed O
to O
be O
as O
variable O
, O
as O
prone O
to O
peaks O
and O
valleys O
, O
as O
anyone O
else O
's O
. O

This O
may O
rattle O
the O
Chanterelle B-EST
sentimentalists O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
have O
liberated O
Mr. O
Waltuck O
. O

A O
chef O
with O
stars O
to O
defend O
and O
a O
reputation O
to O
maintain O
does O
what O
politicians O
do O
in O
close O
elections O
: O
sticks O
to O
the O
script O
, O
tries O
to O
stay O
predictable O
. O

At O
Elan B-EST

Mr. O
Waltuck O
gets O
to O
play O

He O
does O

have O
to O

himself O
whether O
a O
pair O
of O
pot B-DISH
stickers I-DISH
filled I-DISH
with I-DISH
mashed I-DISH

a O
funny O
, O
delicious O
surprise O
. O

He O
must O
be O
playing O
, O
too O
, O
when O
he O
stirs O
sea B-FOOD
urchin I-FOOD
into O
a O
deep O
bowl O
of O
guacamole B-FOOD
. O

Avocado B-FOOD
does O
n't O
need O
extra O
creaminess O
, O
but O
it O
takes O
extremely O
well O
to O
briny O
seafood B-FOOD
, O
as O
you O
find O
out O
when O
you O
spread O
some O
on O
a O
grease O
- O
free O
taro B-FOOD
chip I-FOOD
. O

Occasionally O
, O
what O
seems O
like O
a O
fun O
idea O
will O
land O
like O
a O
bag O
of O
wet O
laundry O
. O

Foie B-DISH
gras I-DISH
lollipops I-DISH
sound O
decadent O
, O
but O
the O
cold O
wad O
of O
dull O
liver B-FOOD
rolled O
in O
uncrunchy O
pistachios B-FOOD
is O
a O
grim O
treat O
. O

General B-DISH
Tso I-DISH
's I-DISH
sweetbreads O
are O
another O
game O
gone O
wrong O
. O

If O
the O
sweetbreads B-FOOD
were O
ever O
crisp O
, O
they O
are O
n't O
by O
the O
time O
they O
've O
been O
stir O
- O
fried O
with O
bok B-FOOD
choy I-FOOD
and O
sloshed O
around O
in O
an O
orange B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
chile O
sauce O
that O
seemed O
to O
need O
more O
spice O
and O
citrus O
tang O
. O

( O
This O
dish O
may O
fall O
into O
one O
of O
my O
blind O
spots O
, O
because O
the O
Chinese B-CUISINE
takeout O
classic O
does O
n't O
ring O
my O
doorbell O
, O
either O

Servers O
at O
Elan B-EST
will O
announce O
conspiratorially O
that O
there O
is O
an O
" O
off O
the O
menu O
special O
, O
" O
a O
burger B-DISH
of I-DISH
duck I-DISH
and I-DISH
foie I-DISH
gras I-DISH
, O
even O
though O
it O
's O
always O
available O
. O

The O
whispered O
hard O
sell O
is O
a O
tired O
ploy O
to O
begin O
with O
, O
and O
this O
slightly O
mushy O
pile O
of O
meat B-FOOD
sweetened O
with O
onion B-FOOD
chutney I-FOOD
and O
figs B-FOOD
is O
n't O
spectacular O
enough O
to O
make O
the O
gimmick O
pay O
off O
. O

At O
times O
, O
Elan B-EST
seems O
a O
little O
unfocused O
, O
as O
if O
Mr. O
Waltuck O
is O
hedging O
his O
bets O
by O
combining O
a O
grown B-TYPE
- I-TYPE
up O
bistro O
with O
a O
gastro B-TYPE
pub I-TYPE
in O
the O
crazed O
- O
carnivore O
style O
of O
the O
past O
decade O
. O

One O
of O
Elan B-EST
's O
least O
pleasant O
dishes O
is O
scallop B-DISH
fettuccine I-DISH
dressed O
with O
a O
sauce B-FOOD
that O
seems O
to O
be O
pure O
duck B-FOOD
fat I-FOOD
. O

After O
one O
forkful O
, O
I O
wanted O
a O
salad B-FOOD
. O

Fashions O
have O
changed O
since O
Chanterelle B-EST
closed O
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
Elan B-EST
is O
at O
its O
best O
when O
it O
is O
not O
trying O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
youngsters O
. O

The O
mere O
sight O
of O
tea B-DISH
- I-DISH
smoked O
salmon O
on O
the O
menu O
may O
cause O
Asian B-CUISINE
fusion I-CUISINE
flashbacks O

But O
Mr. O
Waltuck O
's O
salmon B-FOOD
is O
no O
throwback O
. O

It O
is O
silky O
and O
elegant O
, O
given O

by O

The O
dish O
that O
made O
Mr. O
Waltuck O
's O
name O
, O
the O
seafood B-DISH
sausage I-DISH
in O
which O
sweet O
bits O
of O
scallops B-FOOD
and O
shrimp B-FOOD
are O
bound O
together O
by O
a O
subtle O
fish B-FOOD

is O
back O
, O
looking O
hopelessly O
behind O
the O
times O
in O
its O
sauerkraut B-FOOD

blanc I-FOOD
. O

Do O
not O
be O
fooled O
: O
It O
is O
also O
one O
of O
the O
most O
delicious O
things O
at O
Elan B-EST
. O

I O
enjoyed O
Mr. O
Waltuck O
's O
steamed B-DISH
zucchini I-DISH
blossoms I-DISH
at O
Chanterelle B-EST
and O
enjoyed O
them O
again O
at O
Elan B-EST
, O
where O
they O
were O
stuffed O
with O
zucchini B-FOOD
and O
Parmesan B-FOOD
and O
served O
with O
slow O
- O
cooked O
tomatoes B-FOOD
and O
very O
fresh O
, O
clean O

tasting O
lemon B-FOOD
creme I-FOOD

With O
dishes O
that O
call O
for O
lightness O
and O
delicacy O
, O
Elan B-EST
comes O
into O
its O
own O
. O

The O
menu O
changes O
all O
the O
time O
, O
and O
at O
every O
meal O
, O
one O
or O
two O
recipes O
seemed O
to O
need O
more O
time O
in O
the O
test O
kitchen O
. O

A O
red B-DISH
- I-DISH
wine I-DISH
butter I-DISH
sauce I-DISH
with I-DISH
striped O
bass O
was O
very O
vague O
, O
as O
if O
it O
needed O
to O
be O
reduced O
longer O
. O

But O
a O
special O
I O
had O
the O
same O
night O
, O
fluffy O
fish B-DISH
quenelles I-DISH
bobbing I-DISH
in I-DISH
an I-DISH
aromatic I-DISH
Thai I-DISH
soup I-DISH
, O
skillfully O
combined O
Mr. O
Waltuck O
's O
longstanding O
love O
for O
Asian B-CUISINE
traditions O
with O
his O
habit O
of O
jumping O
outside O
tradition O
when O
the O
mood O
strikes O
. O

Diana O
Valenzuela O
, O
the O
pastry O
chef O
, O
seems O
to O
work O
the O
same O
way O
. O

She O
will O
be O
zigging O
in O
one O
direction O

then O
she O

might O
have O
been O
more O
interesting O
if O
it O
had O

been O
topped O
with O
an O
oddly O
waxy O
chocolate B-FOOD

But O
a O

of O

is O
an O
unexpected O
and O
excellent O
addition O
to O
blueberries B-FOOD
in O
a O
thin O
, O
crisp O

Ms. O
Valenzuela O

desserts O
are O
just O
right O
for O
a O
restaurant O
that O
takes O

out O

Morten O
Sohlberg O
designed O
the O

for O
Blenheim B-EST
, O
the O
West B-LOC
Village I-LOC
restaurant O
he O
and O
his O
wife O
opened O
in O
May. O

The O
concrete O
tops O
are O
polished O
smooth O
with O
beeswax O
, O
and O
the O
sides O
are O
edged O
with O
copper O
. O

The O
shapes O
look O
irregular O
, O
but O
the O
sides O
are O
slightly O
bowed O
so O
that O
a O
pair O
of O
two O
- O
tops O
can O
spoon O
against O
each O
other O
and O
become O
a O
four O

" O
That O
's O
the O
idea O
, O
anyway O
, O
" O
our O
server O
said O

" O
But O
they O
do O
n't O
all O
fit O
together O
. O
" O

Blenheim B-EST
is O
like O
that O
, O
too O
. O

A O
tremendous O
amount O
of O
thought O
and O
effort O
has O
gone O
into O
the O
food O
, O
drinks O
and O
design O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
always O
connect O
. O

This O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
an O
issue O
since O
the O
beginning O
. O

The O
first O
chef O
left O
about O
three O
weeks O
in O
because O
of O
what O
the O
owners O
called O
" O
irreconcilable O
differences O
. O
" O

In O
July O
, O
they O
hired O
Ryan O
Tate O
, O
who O
had O
been O
the O
chef O
at O
Le B-EST
Restaurant I-EST
in O
TriBeCa B-LOC
until O
it O
suddenly O
closed O
. O

I O
admired O
the O
$ O
100 O
set O
menus O
he O
served O
there O
enough O
that O
I O
happily O
gave O
the O
place O
two O
stars O
in O
a O
review O
last O
year O
. O

Mr. O
Tate O
has O
set O
his O
ambitions O
even O
higher O
this O
time O
. O

Besides O
a O
sizable O
a O
la O
carte O
menu O
, O
he O
offers O
a O
$ O
115 O
, O
nine O
- O
course O
tasting O
loaded O
with O
extra O
dishes O
. O

At O
times O
, O
his O
cooking O
is O
as O
thoughtful O
and O
transporting O
as O
it O
was O
at O
Le B-EST
Restaurant I-EST
, O
but O
with O
a O
higher O
degree O
of O
intricacy O
. O

At O
other O
times O
, O
the O
kitchen O
is O
obviously O
struggling O
to O
keep O
up O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
service O
runs O
the O
gamut O
from O
charming O
and O
slightly O
lost O
to O
nonexistent O
. O

On O
my O
first O
night O
there O
, O
the O
disparity O
between O
the O
two O
was O
the O
widest O
I O
had O
ever O
seen O
in O
any O
restaurant O
. O

That O
is O
not O
the O
only O
disconnect O

When O
tables O
are O
set O
up O
outside O
next O
to O
the O
cobblestone O
streets O

Blenheim B-EST
looks O
as O

, O
a O
wooden O
yoke O
and O
a O
whole O
array O
of O
carpentry O
tools O
on O
the O
walls O
, O
looks O
like O
the O
historical O
society O
of O
some O
upstate O
village O
, O
where O
it O
would O
be O
the O
only O
tourist O
attraction O

Underlining O
the O
point O
, O
servers O
tell O
you O
right O
away O
that O
this O
is O
a O
farm O
- O
to O

table O
restaurant O

that O
ingredients O
are O
trucked O
in O
from O
Blenheim B-EST
Hill I-EST
Farm I-EST
in O
Schoharie B-LOC
County I-LOC

southwest O
of O
Albany B-LOC

You O
might O
reasonably O
expect O
pork B-FOOD
cutlets I-FOOD
, O
creamed B-FOOD
corn I-FOOD
, O
maybe O
pie B-FOOD
. O

Mr. O
Tate O
has O
other O
ideas O
. O

Terrific O
ideas O
, O
often O
, O
even O
if O
they O
have O
as O
much O
business O
in O
a O
rusticated O
farm B-TYPE

table O

The O
stream O
in O
Schoharie B-LOC
County I-LOC
where O
tilefish B-FOOD
and O
sea B-FOOD
urchin I-FOOD
splash O
around O
together O
has O
n't O
been O
discovered O
yet O
, O
but O
at O
Blenheim B-EST
they O
swim O
happily O
side O
by O
side O
on O
one O
plate O
. O

The O
tilefish B-FOOD
falls O
into O
big O
, O
sweet O
white O
flakes O
that O
taste O
of O
shrimp B-FOOD
. O

The O
urchin B-FOOD
is O
whipped O
into O
a O
creamy O
, O
slightly O
briny O
sabayon B-FOOD
that O
is O
like O
a O
richer O
, O
more O
luxurious O
taramosalata B-FOOD
. O

Also O
on O
the O
plate O
are O
fat O
blueberries B-FOOD
and O
carrots B-FOOD
roasted O
in O
coffee B-FOOD
bean I-FOOD
oil I-FOOD

I O
ca O
n't O
explain O
why O
blueberries B-FOOD
taste O
so O
good O
with O
sea B-FOOD
urchin I-FOOD
sabayon I-FOOD
, O
but O
they O
do O
. O

Alaskan B-FOOD
king I-FOOD
crab I-FOOD
meat I-FOOD
had O
been O
made O
almost O
as O
sweet O
and O
tender O
as O
some O
tropical B-FOOD
fruit I-FOOD
, O
but O
the O
midnight O
funk O
of O
squid B-FOOD
ink I-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
brought O
it O
back O
to O
the O
sea O

With O
dense O
roasted O
chanterelles B-FOOD
and O
wands O
of O
naturally O
pickled O
sea B-FOOD
bean I-FOOD
scattered O
around O
the O
plate O
, O
this O
was O
an O
appetizer O
you O
could O
go O
quietly O
crazy O
over O
. O

And O
it O
would O
take O
a O
crazy O
person O
to O
complain O
that O
Alaskan B-FOOD
crab I-FOOD
and O
sea B-FOOD
urchin I-FOOD
are O
insufficiently O
farm O
- O
to O
- O
table O
when O
they O
're O
cooked O
this O
skillfully O
. O

Not O
that O
Mr. O
Tate O
turns O
his O
back O
on O
the O
owners O
' O
land O
entirely O
. O

The O
carrots B-FOOD
and O
the O
chanterelles B-FOOD
come O
from O
Blenheim B-EST
Hill I-EST
Farm I-EST

So O
does O
the O
pork B-DISH
loin I-DISH
, O
which O
is O
slowly O
roasted O
until O
it O
drips O
with O
juices O
and O
then O
sent O
to O
the O
table O
with O
a O
cast O
of O

sorghum B-FOOD
syrup I-FOOD

Those O
are O
Blenheim B-EST

crunchy O
chips O
of O
smoked B-FOOD
Blenheim I-FOOD
ham I-FOOD
in O
the O
gloriously O
crisp O

that O

The O
lemon B-FOOD

in O
a O
sensational O
group O
of O

The O
gap O
between O
the O
farm B-TYPE
- O
to O
- O
table O
ethos O
and O
Mr. O
Tate O
's O
style O
is O
minor O
compared O
with O
the O
gulf O
between O
the O
restaurant O
Blenheim B-EST
could O
be O
and O
the O
restaurant O
that O
currently O
sits O
at O
283 B-LOC
West I-LOC
12th I-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

The O
same O
dish O
can O
be O
stunning O
one O
night O
and O
a O
contorted O
mess O
on O
another O
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
had O
the O
roasted B-DISH
king I-DISH
mushrooms I-DISH
with I-DISH
spaetzle I-DISH
and I-DISH
sauerkraut I-DISH
, O
the O
mushroom B-FOOD
stems I-FOOD
had O
something O
like O
the O
flavor O
and O
texture O
of O
weisswurst B-FOOD
. O

A O
German B-CUISINE
- O
inspired O
vegetarian B-DIET
main O
course O
with O
mushrooms B-FOOD
standing O
in O
for O
sausages B-FOOD
is O
a O
fantastic O
notion O
, O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
wait O
to O
taste O
it O
again O
when O
I O
returned O
. O

But O
when O
I O
did O
, O
the O
stems B-FOOD
were O
watery O
inside O
and O
rubbery O
outside O
, O
like O
a O
steamed B-FOOD
hot I-FOOD
dog I-FOOD
wrapped O
in O
a O
balloon O
. O

An O
unusual O
dessert B-FOOD
soup I-FOOD
of O
cooked B-FOOD
barley I-FOOD
and I-FOOD
Champagne I-FOOD
grapes I-FOOD
in O
a O
chilled O
barley B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
jasmine O
tea O
went O
out O
of O
whack O
between O
visits O
, O
going O
from O
fascinating O
to O
weird O
. O

And O
there O
were O
glitches O
that O
were O
surprising O
in O
such O
a O
technique O
- O
focused O
kitchen O
. O

The O
grapefruit B-DISH
pearls I-DISH
with I-DISH
cured I-DISH
Tasmanian I-DISH
sea I-DISH
trout I-DISH
were O
meant O
to O
burst O
with O
juice O
, O
but O
they O
had O
solidified O
. O

Eating O
them O
was O
like O
chewing O
on O
the O
drippings O
of O
a O
grapefruit O
- O
scented O
candle O
. O

On O
Blenheim B-EST
's O
better O
nights O
, O
I O
might O
have O
ranked O
the O
food O
among O
the O
most O
exciting O
and O
interesting O
I O
've O
eaten O
in O
the O
last O
year O
. O

But O
it O
came O
to O
the O
table O
so O
very O
, O
very O
slowly O
that O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
stay O
excited O
or O
interested O
. O

It O
took O
more O
than O
three O
hours O
one O
night O
to O
order O
and O
eat O
appetizers O
, O
main O
courses O
and O
desserts O
. O

I O
wondered O
if O
the O
kitchen O
was O
overwhelmed O
. O

I O
was O
sure O
our O
server O
was O
. O

We O
had O
to O
flag O
him O
down O
to O
ask O
for O
more O
of O
the O
soft O
, O

took O

about O
20 O
minutes O
to O
get O
a O

glass O

We O
were O
left O
alone O
with O

for O
three O

quarters O
of O
an O
hour O
before O
we O
waved O
like O

begged O

When O
the O

out O
more O

the O

And O
Blenheim B-EST

no O

nine O

unless O
it O
is O

Maybe O
its O

would O
fit O
together O
better O
if O
there O
were O
n't O
so O
many O
of O
them O

I O
hope O
so O
, O
because O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
see O
it O
transform O
itself O
from O
a O

Halfway O
through O
dinner O
at O
Blue B-EST
Hill I-EST
, O
my O
server O
presented O
me O
with O
two O
squashes B-FOOD
. O

One O
was O
the O
common O
football O
- O
size O
butternut B-FOOD
that O
weighs O
down O
shopping O
bags O
at O
this O
time O
of O
year O
. O

The O
other O
had O
the O
same O
shape O
but O
was O
about O
as O
big O
as O
a O
sparrow O
. O

I O
held O
it O
in O
my O
palm O
. O

It O
felt O
good O
in O
there O
. O

Without O
thinking O
about O
what O
I O
was O
doing O
, O
I O
began O
petting O
it O
. O

The O
couple O
at O
the O
next O
table O
asked O
if O
they O
could O
see O
my O
tiny O
squash O
, O
and O
I O
let O
them O
stroke O
its O
smooth O
, O
cool O
skin O
. O

Before O
things O
got O
too O
weird O
, O
our O
server O
took O
my O
pet O
squash B-FOOD
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
. O

When O
it O
came O
back O
, O
it O
had O
been O
roasted O
and O
cut O
in O
half O
. O

Specks O
of O
white B-FOOD
pepper I-FOOD
and O
strands O
of O
grated B-FOOD
chestnut I-FOOD
lay O
against O
its O
dark O
orange O
insides O
. O

It O
was O
sweeter O
than O
a O
normal O
butternut B-FOOD
, O
but O
what O
I O
mostly O
noticed O
was O
that O
it O
tasted O
squashier O
, O
as O
if O
all O
the O
flavor O
had O
been O
compressed O
. O

Selective O
breeding O
was O
responsible O
, O

server O
explained O

executive O

a O

owner O
with O
his O

David O
, O
had O
asked O
a O
Cornell O
agriculture O
professor O
to O
design O
a O
squash B-FOOD
for O
him O
, O
making O
it O
as O
small O
and O

as O
possible O
. O

The O
result O
is O
the O

Mr. O

opened O
the O
one O

first O
, O
in O
2000 O
, O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
using O
local O
seasonal O
produce O
, O
including O
some O
from O
his O
family O

farm O
in O
the O

This O
put O
him O
in O
the O
company O
of O
, O
oh O
, O
several O
hundred O
other O
chefs O
. O

A O
few O
years O
later O
, O
though O
, O
he O
was O
chosen O
to O
lead O
an O
ambitious O
project O
at O
Stone B-EST

that O
combined O
a O
farm O
and O
a O
restaurant O
with O
research O
and O
education O
programs O

It O
turned O
out O
that O

Patient O

Mr. O
Barber O
has O
become O
a O
dirt O
poet O
and O
kitchen O
philosopher O
whose O
time O
outside O
with O
the O
pigs O
and O
the O
beans O
has O
had O
a O
deep O
, O
lasting O
effect O
on O
the O
way O
he O
cooks O

Today O
no O

The O

Blue B-EST

sits O
in O
the O
English O
basement O
of O
a O
townhouse O
in O
Greenwich B-LOC
Village I-LOC
, O
a O
historically O
tolerant O
neighborhood O
whose O
tolerance O
does O
not O
extend O
to O
manure O

. O

The O
city O
does O
n't O
afford O
the O
time O
or O
space O
for O
the O
leisurely O
unfurling O
of O
Mr. O
Barber O
's O
complete O
vision O
of O
how O
our O
appetites O
should O
fit O
into O
the O
land O
and O
the O
climate O
. O

The O
low O
- O
ceilinged O
space O
is O
too O
much O
like O
a O
saloon O
, O
the O
tables O
too O
close O
together O
, O
the O
restaurant O
's O
many O
ardent O
admirers O
too O
accustomed O
to O
treating O
it O
as O
a O
place O
to O
catch O
up O
over O
an O
excellent O
weeknight O
dinner O
. O

If O
Blue B-EST
Hill I-EST
had O
as O
many O
cooks O
and O
servers O
as O
its O
more O
favored O
sister O
upstate O
, O
they O
would O
probably O
iron O
out O
wrinkles O
like O
the O
long O
, O
stranded O
layovers O
between O
courses O
; O
the O
wineglasses O
that O
sat O
empty O
and O
were O
finally O
cleared O
with O
no O
offer O
of O
fresh O
ones O
; O
and O
the O
$ O
23 O
glass O
of O
Rully B-DISH
poured O
ice O
- O
cold O
, O
so O
it O
was O
clenched O
and O
astringent O
. O

It O
also O
seems O
far O
out O
of O
character O
that O
this O
intensely O
local O
restaurant O
sells O
just O
two O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
wines B-FOOD
on O
its O
Francophilic O
( O
and O
not O

list O
, O
and O
that O
its O
only O

comes O
from O

revival O
going O

in O
Mr. O

out O
of O

off O

where O
you O

yourself O

that O

may O
well O
be O
the O

For O
this O
reason O
and O
others O
, O
Blue B-EST
Hill I-EST
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
New B-LOC

restaurants O
that O
seem O
to O
get O
better O

more O
original O
as O
time O
goes O
by O
. O

This O
was O
true O
the O
last O
time O
it O
was O
reviewed O
in O
The O
New O

Times O
, O
in O
2006 O
, O
when O
Frank O
Bruni O
brought O
it O
from O
two O

to O

and O
it O

depending O
on O
how O
hungry O
the O
farmer O
is O
. O

Either O
way O
, O
the O
night O
will O
include O
a O
couple O
of O
surprise O
cameos O
by O
fruits B-FOOD
and O
vegetables B-FOOD
that O
drop O
in O
like O
the O
kooky O
neighbors O
in O
a O
sitcom O
. O

A O
meal O
in O
September O
started O
with O
wispy O
young B-FOOD
fennel I-FOOD
stalks I-FOOD
that O
had O
a O
clean O
and O
pure O
licorice B-FOOD
sweetness O
and O
ended O
with O
firm O
, O
green O
- O
skinned O
, O
yellow O
- O
fleshed O
plums B-FOOD
on O
ice O
. O

Both O
made O
me O
happy O
I O
had O
come O
to O
Blue B-EST
Hill I-EST
then O
, O
not O
a O
week O
sooner O
or O
later O
, O
which O
is O
the O
effect O
that O
certain O
fruits B-FOOD
and O
vegetables B-FOOD
can O
have O
when O
they O
're O
picked O
at O
the O
right O
time O
. O

In O
a O
more O
recent O
meal O
, O
the O
kitchen O
sent O
out O
a O
raw B-DISH
hakurei I-DISH
turnip I-DISH
as O
big O
as O
an O
apple B-FOOD
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
had O
been O
pushed O
through O
an O
apple O
slicer O
. O

I O
picked O
up O
a O
white O
wedge O
, O
swiped O
it O
through O
a O
pool O
of O
tarragon B-FOOD
vinaigrette I-FOOD
and O
braced O
for O
the O
harsh O
turnip B-FOOD
aftertaste O
that O
never O
came O
. O

I O
wo O
n't O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
ate O
the O
whole O
thing O
, O
or O
that O
it O
was O
as O
sweet O
and O
juicy O
as O
an O
apple B-FOOD
, O
but O
it O
came O
much O
closer O
than O
I O
would O
have O
thought O
possible O
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
actual O
cooking O
, O
Mr. O
Barber O
's O
approach O
is O
to O
intensify O
ingredients O
that O
are O
pretty O
intense O
already O
. O

Looking O
at O
the O
saturated O
orange O
color O
of O
fat O
slabs O
of O
roasted B-DISH
carrot I-DISH
" I-DISH
cutlet O
, O
" O
I O
could O
tell O
it O
was O
going O
to O
taste O
richer O
and O
rounder O
than O
any O
carrot B-FOOD
I O
had O
met O
before O
. O

The O
approach O
works O
on O
things O
that O
once O
had O
a O
pulse O
, O
too O
. O

Grass O

fed O

dry O

aged O
veal B-DISH
, O
carved O
into O
a O
sampler O
of O
cuts O
, O
some O
fattier O
, O
some O
leaner O
, O
was O
ruddier O
and O
more O
bloody O
- O
tasting O
than O
most O
veal B-FOOD
, O
but O
it O
still O
had O
a O
focused O
, O
refined O
taste O
that O
set O
it O
apart O
from O
beef B-FOOD
. O

The O
caramelized O
outside O
edge O
of O
a O
slowly O
roasted O
neck O
from O
a O
Blue B-LOC
Hill I-LOC
Farm I-LOC
goat O
had O
a O
profoundly O
satisfying O
chew O
; O
the O
meat B-FOOD
hiding O
under O
it O
was O
astoundingly O
tender O
and O
juicy O
. O

It O
had O
some O
of O
the O
primal O
pleasures O
of O
barbecue O
, O
and O
I O
wanted O
to O
tear O
into O
it O
with O
my O
hands O
. O

In O
the O
early O
days O
of O
Blue B-EST
Hill I-EST
, O
I O
respected O
the O
cooking O
but O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
wallow O
around O
in O
it O
the O
way O
I O
do O
now O

The O
whole O
complicated O
web O
that O
Mr. O
Barber O
oversees O
has O
many O
purposes O
, O
spinning O
off O
in O
all O
directions O
, O
but O
if O
you O
just O
sit O
down O
to O
dinner O
, O
you O
can O
believe O
that O
the O
point O
of O
the O
entire O
operation O
is O
to O
provide O
you O
with O
one O
delicious O
taste O
after O
another O

Chopped O

take O

I O
ca O
n't O
get O
enough O
of O
it O

The O
foam O
will O
not O
be O
ignored O
forever O
, O
though O
. O

While O
it O
is O
not O
the O
most O
original O
notion O
, O
it O
does O
add O
something O
, O
unlike O
most O
foams O
. O

What O
it O
adds O
is O
a O
fluffy O
wave O
of O
toasted B-FOOD
butter I-FOOD
, O
like O
the O
frosting B-FOOD
on O
a O
caramel B-FOOD
cake I-FOOD
minus O
the O
sugar O
and O
the O
heft O
. O

The O
dish O
is O
peculiarly O
good O
; O
it O
makes O
an O
extraordinary O
indulgence O
out O
of O
the O
octopus B-FOOD
. O

And O
it O
shows O
off O
the O
clear O
and O
fresh O
point O
of O
view O
Mr. O
Chen O
brings O
to O
his O
cooking O
, O
particularly O
when O
he O
interprets O
Chinese B-CUISINE
flavors O
. O

Before O
working O
at O
Eleven B-EST
Madison I-EST
Park I-EST
and O
Commerce B-EST
, O
Mr. O
Chen O
was O
an O
accountant O
. O

The O
idea O
was O
to O
stay O
as O
far O
from O
restaurants O
as O
possible O
, O
and O
it O
came O
from O
his O
parents O
. O

After O
moving O
from O
China B-LOC
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
, O
the O
Chens O
operated O
a O
Chinese B-CUISINE
restaurant O
outside O
of O
the O
city O
. O

They O
wanted O
something O
higher O
for O
Thomas O
( O
he O
was O
Tommy O
at O
home O
, O
but O
on O
his O
parents O
' O
lips O
the O
nickname O
came O
out O
" O
tow O
me O
, O
" O
which O
is O
how O
Tuome B-EST
is O
pronounced O
) O
, O
but O
after O
shepherding O
balance O
sheets O
by O
day O
and O
attending O
culinary O
school O
by O
night O
, O
he O
came O
to O
see O
cooking O
as O
the O
higher O
calling O
. O

A O
little O
more O
than O
two O
months O
in O
, O
Tuome B-EST
is O
already O
starting O
to O
feel O
mature O
. O

The O
one O
- O
page O
wine O
list O
is O
seriously O
eclectic O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
too O
cool O
for O
a O
Napa B-LOC
Valley I-LOC
cabernet B-FOOD
and O
an O
Anderson B-LOC
Valley I-LOC
chardonnay B-FOOD
. O

The O
servers O
take O
their O
jobs O
seriously O
, O
although O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
the O
point O
has O
to O
be O
underlined O
by O
forcing O
them O
all O
to O
wear O
tailored O
T O
- O
shirts O
the O
color O
of O
wet O
cement O
. O

Mr. O
Chen O
does O
n't O
need O
to O
make O
his O
staff O
look O
like O
a O
modern O
dance O
troupe O
to O
tell O
people O
Tuome B-EST
is O
n't O
your O
average O
East B-LOC
Village I-LOC
spot O
; O
his O
cooking O
does O
that O
for O
him O
. O

( O
And O
the O
East B-LOC
Village I-LOC
average O
is O
getting O
higher O
every O
year O
. O
) O

He O
has O
terrific O
control O
over O
salt B-FOOD
, O
spices B-FOOD
, O
texture O
and O
contrast O
, O
weaving O
them O
together O
until O
you O
ask O
, O
why O
has O
n't O
anyone O
done O
this O
before O
? O

Adding O
slick O
duck B-FOOD
fat I-FOOD
to O
packets O
of O
Cantonese B-FOOD
sticky I-FOOD
rice I-FOOD
steamed O
in O
lotus O
leaves O
seems O
like O
an O
obvious O
good O
idea O
. O

So O
does O
the O
extra O
crackle O
he O
puts O
into O
the O
Chinese B-FOOD
sausage I-FOOD
bits I-FOOD
to O
save O
the O
rice B-FOOD
from O
gummy O
monotony O
. O

But O
they O
are O
n't O
obvious O
until O
you O
taste O
Mr. O
Chen O
's O
version O
. O

A O
few O
dishes O
show O
off O
Mr. O
Chen O
's O
technical O
command O
more O
than O
his O
originality O
. O

The O
scoop O
of O
chicken B-DISH
liver I-DISH
mousse I-DISH
with O
maple B-FOOD
syrup I-FOOD
pooled O
in O
a O
hollow O
on O
top O
, O
like O
the O
gravy B-FOOD
on O
mashed B-FOOD
potatoes I-FOOD
, O
is O
exquisitely O
done O
, O
but O
feels O
familiar O
. O

Another O
dish O
fell O
out O
of O
focus O
between O
meals O
, O
when O
the O
carrot B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
miso O
puree O
accompanying O
seared B-DISH
scallops I-DISH
lost O
its O
savory O
, O
salty O
depth O
and O
became O
merely O
sweet O
. O

And O
there O
's O
one O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
forget O
, O
a O
dully O
sweet O
squash B-DISH
soup I-DISH
impaled O
with O
frogs B-FOOD
' I-FOOD
legs O
that O
were O
both O
mushy O
and O
stringy O
. O

But O
a O
striking O
number O
of O
dishes O
at O
Tuome B-EST
are O
memorable O
for O
the O
right O
reasons O
. O

Serving O
sous B-DISH
- I-DISH
vide O
chicken O
on O
soupy O
rice B-FOOD
cooked O
with O
garlic B-FOOD
chives I-FOOD
and O
shiitakes B-FOOD
, O
Mr. O
Chen O
does O
n't O
try O
to O
sex O
up O
his O
homey O
inspiration O
, O
congee B-DISH
; O
he O
just O
makes O
it O
more O
layered O
and O
modern O
, O
surrounding O
the O
chicken B-FOOD
with O
a O
dark O
basil B-FOOD
jus I-FOOD
, O
and O
lets O
the O
flavors O
quietly O
win O
you O
over O
. O

I O
wish O
he O
would O
take O
the O
same O
approach O
with O
pork B-DISH
belly I-DISH
instead O
of O
forcing O
it O
to O
do O
double O
- O
duty O
as O
a O
marketing O
event O
. O

Right O
now O
it O
's O
called O
the O
Pig B-DISH
Out I-DISH
( O
a O
name O
meant O
for O
hashtagging O
) O
, O
and O
it O
marches O
to O
the O
table O
as O
a O
$ O
49 O
feast O
for O
two O

10 O

squares O
of O
pork B-FOOD
belly I-FOOD

with O
a O
parade O
of O
sauces B-FOOD
and O
bowls O
of O
spicy B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
peanut O
noodles O
following O
behind O
. O

The O
crashing O
cymbals O
ca O
n't O
disguise O
how O
easily O
the O
dish O
, O
and O
its O
price O
, O
could O
be O
divided O
in O
half O
. O

But O
Mr. O
Chen O
has O
done O
something O
amazing O
to O
this O
pig O
. O

His O
inspiration O
may O
have O
been O
Cantonese B-CUISINE
roast B-DISH
pork I-DISH
, O
but O
these O
compressed O
, O
intensely O
flavorful O
squares O
of O
well O
- O
rendered O
belly B-FOOD
partake O
of O
Peking B-DISH
duck I-DISH
, O
too O
. O

After O
I O
'd O
topped O
the O
reflective O
pane O
of O
skin B-FOOD
with O
ginger B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
scallion O
sauce O
and O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
sambal B-FOOD
from O
a O
squeeze O
bottle O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
tuck O
the O
pork B-FOOD
into O
a O
steamed B-FOOD
bun I-FOOD
or O
a O
crepe B-FOOD
, O
and O
then O
chew O
and O
crunch O
and O
chew O
and O
crunch O
some O
more O
. O

Forget O
the O
gimmick O
. O

There O
are O
fresh O
ideas O
in O
this O
dish O
, O
and O
they O
are O
all O

When O
I O

on O
my O
way O
to O
a O
big O
dinner O
at O
a O
restaurant O
in O
Flushing B-LOC
, I-LOC
Queens O
, O
I O
like O
to O
limber O
up O
by O
eating O
a O
dozen O
of O
Helen O
You O
's O
dumplings B-FOOD
. O

For O
the O
last O
eight O
years O
, O
Ms. O
You O
has O
been O
the O
chef O
and O
proprietor O
of O
the O
Tianjin B-EST
Dumpling I-EST
House I-EST
, O
which O
is O
not O
so O
much O
a O
house O
as O
a O
narrow O
shaft O
of O
elbow O
room O
behind O
a O
sneeze O
guard O
in O
the O
basement O
of O
a O
Chinese B-CUISINE
food O
- O
vendors O
' O
market O
on O
Main B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

The O
first O
dumpling B-FOOD
of O
hers O
that O
I O
tried O
had O
a O
sea B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
bass O
stuffing O
cut O
with O
minced O
ginger B-FOOD
, O
which O
gave O
bracing O
clarity O
to O
the O
few O
drops O
of O
broth B-FOOD
sealed O
inside O
. O

It O
was O
so O
satisfying O
that O
at O
first O
I O
felt O
no O
need O
to O
branch O
out O
. O

The O
dumplings B-FOOD
were O
irresistibly O
priced O
, O
though O
, O
at O
about O
$ O
5 O
a O
dozen O
, O
and O
I O
began O
to O
experiment O
with O
new O
ones O
: O
lamb B-FOOD
and O
chopped O
zucchini B-FOOD
humming O
with O
Sichuan B-FOOD
peppercorns I-FOOD
, O
maybe O
, O
or O
pork B-FOOD
with O
threads O
of O
fresh B-FOOD
dill I-FOOD
. O

These O
were O
wildly O
good O
, O
too O
. O

One O
day O
, O
I O
noticed O
a O
sign O
inviting O
me O
to O
pick O
my O
own O
custom O
dumpling B-FOOD
fillings I-FOOD
from O
a O
grid O
of O
24 O
ingredients O
. O

This O
paralyzed O
me O
. O

Ms. O
You O
clearly O
had O
a O
kind O
of O
genius O
for O
creating O
miniature O
worlds O
of O
flavor O
. O

Who O
was O
I O
to O
tell O
her O
what O
she O
ought O
to O
fold O
into O
her O
circles O
of O
dough B-FOOD
? O

It O
was O
as O
if O
somebody O
had O
handed O
me O
a O
box O
of O
feathers O
, O
bones O
, O
beaks O
and O
flesh O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Here O
, O
build O
a O
parrot O

" O

What O
I O
wanted O
was O
more O
of O
Ms. O
You O
's O
recipes O
, O
not O
mine O
, O
and O
I O
got O
my O
wish O
earlier O
this O
year O
when O
Ms. O
You O
opened O
Dumpling B-EST
Galaxy I-EST
a O
few O
blocks O
from O
her O
original O
stall O
. O

Dumpling B-EST

sits O
back O
from O
the O

inside O

shares O
with O
a O
Korean B-CUISINE
- O
French O
bakery B-TYPE
and O
a O
purveyor O
of O
sparkly O
false O
eyelashes O

Ms. O
You O
designed O
the O
striking O

modern O
interior O
herself O
, O
splashing O
bold O
Chinese O
red O
across O
walls O
with O
a O

each O
with O
its O
own O
TV O

showing O
highlights O
of O
the O
100 O

heavy O

section O
shots O
that O

the O

Take O
a O
good O

because O
this O
is O
a O
sight O
you O
should O
never O
see O
if O
you O
want O
to O
get O
the O
most O
out O
of O
a O
meal O
at O
Dumpling B-EST
Galaxy I-EST
. O

Resist O
the O
exploratory O
nibble O
. O

Dip O
one O
side O
in O
black B-FOOD
vinegar I-FOOD
and O
soy B-FOOD
, O
and O
paint O
it O
with O
chile B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
if O
you O
like O

then O

thing O
in O
your O
mouth O

It O
wo O
n't O
gush O
with O
a O
waterfall O
of O

It O
will O
, O
however O
, O
hold O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
liquid O
shed O
by O
the O
filling O
as O
the O
dumpling B-FOOD
boiled O
. O

Those O
drops O
belong O
to O
you O
. O

Sometimes O
those O
juices O
taste O
like O
fresh O
green B-FOOD
herbs I-FOOD
, O
as O
when O
Ms. O
You O
mixes O
cilantro B-FOOD
with O
minced B-FOOD
lamb I-FOOD
, O
or O
dill B-FOOD
with O
excellent O
softly O
scrambled B-FOOD
eggs I-FOOD

Sometimes O
they O
combine O
those O
qualities O
with O
a O
whiplash O
of O
heat O
, O
as O
in O
the O
head O
- O
twistingly O
good O
spicy B-DISH
beef I-DISH

seasoned O

red B-FOOD

green I-FOOD
chiles I-FOOD

and O
searing O

As O
a O
young O
girl O
in O
Tianjin B-LOC
, I-LOC
China O
, O
Ms. O
You O
was O
taught O
to O
cook O
by O
her O
mother O
and O
grandparents O
. O

Her O
dumplings B-FOOD
are O
sturdy O
, O
knobby O
, O
domestic O
creatures O
in O
the O
Northern B-CUISINE
Chinese I-CUISINE
tradition O
. O

Sometimes O
you O
see O
the O
ghostly O
outline O
of O
the O
fillings O
through O
the O
shiny O
white O
skins O
, O
and O
sometimes O
you O
ca O
n't O
. O

But O
her O
dumplings B-FOOD
are O
stuffed O
to O
order O
, O
and O
Ms. O
You O
fine O
- O
tunes O
them O
with O
the O
sensitivity O
of O
a O
natural O
cook O
who O
listens O
to O
her O
ingredients O
. O

Mixing O
shrimp B-FOOD
with O
two O
varieties O
of O
celery B-FOOD
, O
the O
more O
bitter O
and O
self O
- O
assured O
Chinese O
and O
the O
sweeter O
, O
shyer O
Western O
kind O
, O
and O
using O
both O
stalks B-FOOD
and O
leaves B-FOOD
, O
she O
builds O
exhilarating O
harmonies O
. O

It O
would O
be O
a O
miracle O
on O
Main B-LOC
Street I-LOC
if O
all O
100 O
varieties O
at O
Dumpling B-EST
Galaxy I-EST
were O
equally O
lovable O
. O

They O
are O
n't O
. O

The O
one O
with O
shrimp B-FOOD
, O
scallops B-FOOD
and O
crab B-FOOD
meat I-FOOD
did O
n't O
deliver O
the O
sweet O
seafood B-FOOD
luxury O
it O
promised O
. O

Steamed B-DISH
har I-DISH
gow I-DISH
were O
less O
juicy O
than O
those O
wheeled O
around O
on O
the O
best O
dim O
sum O
carts O
. O

My O
strategy O
is O
to O
seek O
out O
the O
proprietary O
blends O
, O
which O
justify O
prices O
that O
can O
be O
slightly O
higher O
( O
as O
much O
as O
$ O
7.95 O
for O
six O
) O
than O
those O
at O
other O
places O
in O
Flushing B-LOC
, O
including O
Tianjin B-EST
Dumpling I-EST
House I-EST
. O

I O
've O
eaten O
entire O
meals O
that O
delivered O
less O
flavor O
than O
a O
single O
one O
of O
Ms. O
You O
's O
dumplings B-FOOD
stuffed O
with O
terrific O
little O
meatballs B-FOOD
of I-FOOD
duck I-FOOD
and I-FOOD
shiitakes I-FOOD
. O

And O
if O
those O
had O
n't O
cheered O
me O
up O
, O
the O
fried B-DISH
dumplings I-DISH
would O
. O

Ms. O
You O
pours O
watery O
cornstarch B-FOOD
into O
the O
pan O
, O
which O
bubbles O
and O
browns O
into O
a O
shatteringly O
thin O
, O
dumpling B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
studded O
pancake O
. O

Cracking O
that O
crust O
, O
I O
felt O
like O
the O
happiest O
guy O
in O
the O
galaxy O
. O

That O
feeling O
wavered O
whenever O
I O
had O
to O
lean O
out O
of O
my O
booth O
with O
one O
arm O
extended O
for O
minutes O
at O
a O
time O
to O
ask O
for O
water O
or O
the O
check O
or O
for O
empty O
dishes O
to O
be O
cleared O
. O

It O
was O
like O
hailing O
a O
cab O
on O
Broadway B-LOC
at O
5 O
p.m. O
, O
but O
less O
effective O
. O

As O
time O
dragged O
on O
, O
I O
wondered O
why O
nobody O
had O
invented O
Uber O
for O
waiters O
. O

Looking O
at O
the O
tables O
of O
Chinese O
families O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
their O
dumpling B-FOOD
consumption O
was O
considerably O
less O
piggish O
than O
mine O
. O

They O
might O
share O
a O
single O
order O
, O
a O
mere O
six O
dumplings B-FOOD
, O
before O
moving O
on O
to O
the O

from O
Northern B-LOC

I O
came O

green B-FOOD
chiles I-FOOD

barely O
tender O
potato B-FOOD
and O
eggplant B-FOOD
so O
creamy O
it O
may O
as O
well O
be O
pudding O

was O
an O
unusually O
good O
version O
of O
the O
Dongbei B-LOC
standby O
. O

Whole B-DISH
fish I-DISH
with I-DISH
spicy I-DISH
bean I-DISH
sauce I-DISH
was O
a O
hit O
at O
my O
table O
, O
even O
if O
we O
did O
use O
the O
marvelous O
sauce O
to O
obscure O
the O
fish B-FOOD
's O
slightly O
muddy O
flavor O
. O

You O
can O
find O
these O
dishes O
elsewhere O
, O
but O
no O
other O
kitchen O
offers O
such O
an O
embarrassment O
of O
dumpling O
riches O
, O
including O
dessert O
. O

Some O
sweet B-FOOD
dumplings I-FOOD
are O
pinched O
in O
dough B-FOOD
like O
the O
savory O
ones O
, O
such O
as O
tart O
dried B-DISH
hawthorn I-DISH
berries I-DISH
with I-DISH
white I-DISH
wood I-DISH
ears I-DISH
, O
or O
pear B-DISH
with I-DISH
eight I-DISH
treasures I-DISH
, O
which O
I O
now O
think O
of O
as O
fruitcake B-DISH
pirogi I-DISH
. O

Others O
, O
called O
tang B-DISH
yuan I-DISH
, O
are O
tinted O
orbs O
of O
dough B-FOOD
that O
are O
springy O
and O
chewy O
, O
like O
mochi B-FOOD
. O

My O
favorite O
was O
the O
pumpkin B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
flavored O
globe O
with O
a O
sugary O
paste B-FOOD
of I-FOOD
black I-FOOD
sesame I-FOOD
at O
the O
core O
. O

These O
orange O
globes O
arrived O
, O
not O
on O
a O
plate O
like O
the O
others O
, O
but O
bobbing O
in O
a O
thick O
, O
clear O
, O
steaming O
soup B-FOOD

I O
could O
stare O
at O

up O

a O
corner O

looking O
out O

Two O
months O
in O

Einat O

, O
the O
chef O

owner O
, O
was O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
closing O
it O

she O
said O
in O
a O

Nearly O
half O
of O
her O
54 O
seats O
had O
been O
taken O
away O
after O
the O
city O
ruled O
that O
one O
wing O
of O
the O
dining O
room O
was O
an O
unpermitted O
sidewalk O
enclosure O
. O

The O
disputed O
area O
was O
quarantined O
behind O
a O
velvet O
rope O

although O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
imagine O
a O
crowd O
lining O
up O
for O
admission O
to O
this O
patch O
of O
bare O
cement O
floor O
. O

This O
put O
a O
strain O
on O
revenues O
, O
no O
doubt O
, O
and O
made O
the O
place O
look O
pretty O
weird O
. O

Even O
with O
reduced O
capacity O
, O
Bar B-EST
Bolonat I-EST
was O
afflicted O
by O
suboptimal O
acoustics O
. O

When O
I O
ate O
there O
early O
in O
the O
summer O
, O
the O
screeching O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
could O
have O
crushed O

It O
nearly O
crushed O
my O
desire O
to O
come O
back O
, O
too O
, O
but O
I O
held O
on O
because O
Ms. O
Admony O
was O
up O
to O
something O
original O
in O
the O
kitchen O
. O

The O
daughter O
of O
an O
Iranian O
mother O
and O
Yemenite O
father O
, O
she O
was O
combining O
the O
flavors O
of O
contemporary O
multiethnic O
Israel B-LOC
, O
where O
she O
grew O
up O
, O
with O
the O
idioms O
of O
modern O
restaurants O
in O
New B-EST
York I-EST
, O
where O
she O
has O
been O
cooking O
since O
getting O
a O
job O
in O
Bobby O
Flay O

kitchen O
at O
Bolo B-EST
in O
1999 O
. O

I O
'd O
never O
tasted O
anything O
exactly O
like O
her O
shrimp B-FOOD
in O
a O
Yemenite B-CUISINE
curry B-FOOD
, O
with O
a O
fiery O
shot O
of O
green O
zhug B-FOOD
and O
a O
small O
round O
of O
fried B-FOOD
bread I-FOOD
called O
malawach B-FOOD
to O
soak O
up O
the O
spicy O

turmeric B-FOOD

I O
wanted O
more O

but O
I O
was O

Now O
, O
with O

up O

Bar B-EST
Bolonat I-EST
is O
a O
quieter O

though O
it O

library O

( O
One O
small O

It O

bigger O

In O

Ms. O

finally O
appeased O
the O

all O
her O

she O

of O
Bar B-EST
Bolonat I-EST

most O
likable O
dishes O

the O

the O
lemony B-DISH
grilled I-DISH
baby I-DISH
artichokes I-DISH

a O
creamy O
band O
of O
pistachio B-FOOD
yogurt I-FOOD
under O
a O
pale O
- O
green O
powder O
of O
dukkah B-FOOD
. O

That O
blend O
of O
chopped O
nuts B-FOOD
and O
herbs B-FOOD
can O
get O
tired O
if O
it O
sits O
around O
too O
long O
, O
but O
Bar B-EST
Bolonat I-EST

is O
extremely O
fresh O
, O
the O
pistachios B-FOOD
still O
sweet O
and O
bright O

A O
swipe O
of O
corn B-FOOD
puree I-FOOD
takes O
its O
seductive O

toasty O
flavor O
from O
turmeric B-FOOD

of O
a O
warming O
spice B-FOOD
blend I-FOOD
called O
hawaij B-FOOD
that O

stir O
into O

Together O
with O
the O
creeping O
heat O
and O
sweetness O
of O
a O
red B-FOOD
pepper I-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
, O
the O
spiced B-FOOD
corn I-FOOD
makes O
something O
exciting O
out O
of O
a O
grilled B-FOOD
octopus I-FOOD
leg I-FOOD

Nearly O
everybody O
orders O
the O
Jerusalem B-LOC

style O
sesame B-FOOD
bagel I-FOOD
, O
so O
light O
and O
fluffy O
it O
's O
almost O
an O
anti B-FOOD
- O
bagel O
. O

Nearly O
everybody O
is O
right O
about O
this O
. O

What O
makes O
this O
racetrack O
- O
shaped O
bread B-FOOD
so O
hard O
to O
pass O
up O
is O
the O
spoonful O
of O
really O
fragrant O
and O
complex O
za'atar B-FOOD
that O
you O
dunk O
each O
piece O
into O
after O
giving O
it O
a O
preliminary O
bath O
in O
peppery B-FOOD
olive I-FOOD
oil I-FOOD

When O
dishes O
were O
underwhelming O
, O
as O
several O
were O
one O
August O
night O
, O
timid O

could O
be O
to O
blame O

" O
Za'atar B-DISH
ravioli I-DISH

" O
stuffed O
with O
smoky O
eggplant B-FOOD

might O
have O

On O
the O

Bar B-EST
Bolonat I-EST

an O
Iranian B-CUISINE
fresh B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
herb O
stew O
served O
with O
soft O
specks O
of O
fresh O
couscous B-FOOD
, O
was O
fantastically O
vivid O

and O
it O
could O
have O
become O
one O
of O
my O
favorites O
if O
the O
short B-FOOD
rib I-FOOD
in O
the O
stew B-FOOD
had O
not O
been O
tough O
and O
dry O
. O

The O
dishes O
at O
Bar B-EST
Bolonat I-EST
are O
meant O
to O
be O
shared O
-- O
everybody O
sing O
along O
-- O
and O
come O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
as O
they O
're O
ready O
. O

Or O
so O
the O
servers O
say O
. O

The O
menu O
is O
split O
into O
small O
, O
medium O
and O
large O
plates O
. O

As O
common O
sense O
would O
tell O
you O
if O
the O
servers O
were O
n't O
telling O
you O
otherwise O
, O
the O
bigger O
ones O
, O
like O
the O
lamb B-DISH
neck I-DISH
braised O
with O
dates B-FOOD
and O
chestnuts B-FOOD
until O
it O
is O
pull O
- O
apart O
tender O
, O
are O
a O
lot O
easier O
to O
split O
than O
the O
few O
mouthfuls O
of O
fluke B-DISH
ceviche I-DISH
with O
dried B-FOOD
pomegranate I-FOOD
seeds I-FOOD
and O
juice B-FOOD
. O

The O
kitchen O
could O
do O
more O
to O
help O
by O
, O
say O
, O
carving O
the O
pomegranate B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
glazed O
poussin O
instead O
of O
sending O
it O
out O
whole O
with O
a O
serrated O
knife O
. O

The O
bit O
about O
the O
dishes O
' O
showing O
up O
at O
random O
times O
is O
misleading O
, O
too O
, O
but O
in O
a O
good O
way O
. O

My O
table O
was O
never O
laden O
down O
with O
more O
plates O
than O
it O
could O
hold O
. O

This O
ought O
to O
go O
without O
saying O
, O
but O
in O
restaurants O
these O
days O
nothing O
does O
. O

Apart O
from O
one O
or O
two O
unscheduled O
leaves O
of O
absence O
one O
night O
, O
the O
service O
was O
generally O
excellent O
, O
with O
a O
professional O
bearing O
that O
signals O
Ms. O
Admony O
's O
intent O
to O
have O
Israeli B-CUISINE
cuisine O
taken O
seriously O
. O

The O
white O
napkins O
, O
polished O
stemware O
, O
sheer O
curtains O
and O
understated O
modern O

are O
all O
a O

the O
kinds O
of O
diners O
who O
would O
steer O
clear O
of O
anything O
resembling O
a O
hummus B-FOOD
hut O

For O
dessert O
, O
Ms. O

makes O
a O
homey O
, O
from O
- O
scratch O
version O
of O
Milky B-FOOD
, O
a O
chocolate B-FOOD
pudding I-FOOD
brand O
so O
central O
to O
Israeli O
life O
that O
it O
became O
the O
symbol O
of O
a O
protest O
this O
fall O
against O
the O
high O
cost O
of O
living O
. O

The O
halvah B-DISH
creme I-DISH
brulee I-DISH
tastes O
more O
like O
butterscotch B-FOOD
than O
sesame B-FOOD
, O
but O
it O
is O
worth O
getting O
for O
the O
tuft O
of O
halvah B-FOOD
floss I-FOOD
on O
top O
. O

The O
most O
entertaining O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
dessert O
is O
a O
fried O
envelope O
of O
baklava B-DISH
with O
ice B-FOOD
cream I-FOOD

worse O

We O

The O

These O
suggestions O
help O
with O
the O
altruistic O
part O
of O
your O
mission O
. O

But O
remember O
that O
your O
highest O
priority O
is O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
are O
invited O
back O
so O
that O
you O
can O
enjoy O
the O
delicious O
sensation O
of O
not O
hosting O
again O
next O
Thanksgiving O
. O

Here O
, O
a O
small O
bribe O
is O
helpful O
. O

A O
bottle O
that O
is O
too O
good O
for O
the O
mob O
can O
be O
pressed O
discreetly O
into O
the O
host O
's O
hands O
as O
you O
murmur O
, O
" O
This O
is O
for O
tomorrow O
. O
" O

The O
more O
thought O
you O
put O
into O
the O
bribe O
, O
the O
better O
the O
odds O
it O
will O
be O
effective O
a O
year O
from O
now O

Your O
shot O
at O
a O
repeat O
performance O
will O
be O
seriously O

if O
you O

On O
the O

principle O
, O
pregaming O
with O
a O
few O
shots O
before O
you O
arrive O
is O
a O
risky O
maneuver O

You O
should O
be O
relatively O
sober O
when O
you O
present O
your O

gift O
and O
size O
up O
the O

" O
Tune O
into O
how O
the O
event O
is O
going O
and O
plug O
into O
whoever O
needs O
something O
, O
" O
Mr. O
Diesel O
said O
. O

" O
If O
the O
cook O
is O
hiding O
in O
the O
kitchen O
ask O
, O
' O
Can O
I O
help O

or O
do O
you O
need O
me O
to O

out O
there O
so O

" O
If O
you O
are O
shooed O

Or O
talk O
to O
the O
stray O
great O

on O
her O

If O
you O
are O
given O
a O
kitchen O
assignment O
, O
make O
sure O
you O
understand O
it O
down O
to O
the O
last O
detail O
, O
unlike O
the O
guest O
of O
Ms. O
Dupree O
's O
who O
piled O
potatoes B-FOOD
on O
the O
turkey O
platter O
. O

If O
the O
host O
refuses O
help O
, O
that O
should O
not O
be O
taken O
for O
an O
invitation O
to O
stand O
in O

the O

chat O
, O
even O
if O
that O

what O
you O

do O
on O
another O

On O
Thanksgiving O
, O
home O
kitchens O
are O
almost O
as O
busy O
and O
focused O
as O
professional O
ones O
, O
and O
you O
should O
n't O
enter O
the O
combat O
zone O
any O
more O
than O
you O
would O
bust O
through O

shouting O
: O

up O

? O
" O

Most O
of O
all O
, O
encourage O
the O
cooks O
from O
the O
sidelines O
. O

Bite O
your O
tongue O
if O
you O
notice O
the O
gravy B-FOOD
has O
n't O
been O
degreased O
as O
thoroughly O
as O
you O
think O
it O
should O
be O

" O
It O
's O
so O
important O
not O
to O
give O
any O
kind O
of O
advice O
on O
anything O

Denis O

professor O

" O
You O
need O
to O
be O
the O

for O
the O
food O
that O

being O
produced O
by O
the O
host O
. O

I O
have O
lots O
of O
opinions O
about O
brining O

but O
I O
realize O
I O
need O
to O
steer O
the O
conversation O
to O
safer O
topics O

like O
religion O

" O

At O

been O
carved O
and O
you O
can O
finally O
enjoy O
the O

The O
urge O
to O
cash O
in O
with O

of O
your O
favorite O

will O
be O
strong O
. O

This O
is O
the O
time O
to O
recall O
that O
you O
are O
playing O
the O
long O
game O

If O
the O
stuffing B-FOOD

gone O
before O
everyone O
has O
had O
a O
crack O
at O
it O
, O
the O

Daniel O
O'Connor O
, O
an O
architect O
who O
is O
one O
of O
the O
hosts O
, O
said O
the O
event O
is O
notable O
for O
its O
spirit O
of O
cooperation O
and O
sharing O

Still O
, O
not O
everyone O
plays O
along O

" O
You O
really O
see O
the O
divide O
when O
it O
's O
leftover O
time O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
You O
have O
some O
people O
literally O
taking O
an O
entire O
turkey B-FOOD
home O
, O
not O
a O
piece O
of O
a O
turkey B-FOOD

Or O
taking O
a O

There O

always O
someone O

" O

As O
you O
load O

, O
remember O
the O
Wall B-LOC

saying O
: O
Pigs O
get O
fat O
; O
hogs O
get O

While O
taking O
modest O

it O

Leo O
Carey O
, O
a O
senior O
editor O
at O
The O
New O

, O
who O
was O
born O
in O
England B-LOC
and O
has O
successfully O
extracted O
an O
invitation O
from O
the O
same O
Boston B-LOC
family O
for O
15 O
consecutive O
Thanksgivings O
, O
noticed O
this O
American O
technique O
of O
complimenting O
the O
host O
early O
on O
. O

" O
Everyone O
self O
- O
consciously O
, O
self O
- O
mockingly O
but O
also O
weirdly O
proudly O
, O
talks O
about O
gluttony O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
But O
the O
literal O
amounts O
of O
food O
consumed O
have O
n't O
struck O
me O
as O
totally O
unprecedented O
. O
" O

Compliments O
should O
be O
delivered O
between O
mouthfuls O
and O
scattered O
far O
and O
wide O
. O

Keep O
in O
mind O
that O
there O
may O
be O
many O
cooks O
around O
the O
table O
and O
that O
each O
one O
is O
a O
prospective O
source O
for O
next O
year O
's O
invitation O
. O

Most O
of O
all O
, O
though O
, O
remember O
that O
no O
dish O
in O
the O
American B-CUISINE
canon O
provokes O
more O
performance O
anxiety O
than O
roast O
turkey O
, O
and O
the O
host O
needs O
to O
hear O
that O
all O
the O
effort O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

One O
year O
when O
I O
invited O
people O
to O
my O
house O
for O
Thanksgiving O
, O
I O
suggested O
, O
in O
one O
of O
those O
fits O
of O
neurotic O
self O
- O
deprecation O
that O
hosts O
are O
prone O
to O
, O
that O
the O
white B-FOOD
meat I-FOOD
was O
a O
bit O
dry O
. O

A O
guest O
I O
did O

very O

When O
you O
do O

roast O
it O
yourself O

earliest O
pizzaioli B-FOOD
more O
than O
a O
century O

The O

at O
first O
- O
rank O
Roman B-CUISINE
pizzerias B-TYPE
like O
Da B-EST
Remo I-EST
in O
Testaccio B-LOC
is O
often O
compared O
to O
a O
cracker B-FOOD
, O
but O
crackers B-FOOD
crumble O
. O

This O
does O
n't O
. O

It O
is O
more O
like O
the O
crust B-FOOD
on O
a O
loaf O
of O
peasant B-FOOD
bread I-FOOD
from O
which O
all O
the O
soft O
crumbs O
have O
been O
stripped O

It O
is O
durably O
crisp O
, O
unbendingly O
flat O
, O
and O
when O
you O
hold O
a O
slice O
by O
the O
edge O
, O
the O
rest O
of O
it O
juts O
out O
above O
the O
table O
like O
a O
cliff O
. O

Because O
everything O
I O
know O
about O
cliffs O
was O
learned O
from O
Wile O
E. O
Coyote O
, O
I O
kept O
waiting O
for O
the O
tip O
on O
each O
Marta B-EST
slice O
to O
give O
way O
, O
but O
it O
never O
did O
. O

The O
pleasure O
of O
biting O
down O
on O
this O
pizza B-FOOD
is O
both O
physical O
and O
auditory O
. O

The O
noise O
detonates O
along O
the O
jaw O
and O
plows O
right O
into O
the O
inner O
ear O
. O

Every O
bite O
sounds O
and O
feels O
like O
that O
. O

There O
is O
no O
soupy O
middle O
of O
steamed B-FOOD
dough I-FOOD
under O
wet O
tomatoes B-FOOD
. O

It O
's O
pure O
crunch O
, O
all O
the O
way O
. O

What O
you O
lose O
with O
this O
style O
is O
the O
soft O
, O
springy O
, O
baguette O
- O
like O
curls O
at O
the O
edges O
of O
a O
Neapolitan B-FOOD
pizza I-FOOD
. O

The O
outer O
crusts O
of O
a O
Marta B-EST
pie B-FOOD
do O
n't O
puff O
up O
; O
they O
stay O
hard O
and O
round O
, O
like O
grissini B-FOOD
. O

When O
a O
pizza B-FOOD
crust I-FOOD
is O
all O
crackle O
, O
what O
's O
on O
top O
has O
to O
bring O
the O
flavor O
. O

This O
is O
where O
you O
see O
Mr. O
Anderer O
thinking O
like O
a O
cook O
. O

He O
has O
a O
great O
pizza B-FOOD
- O
fied O
version O
of O
carbonara B-FOOD
, O
with O
dots O
of O
egg B-FOOD
and O
grated O
pecorino B-FOOD
over O
crumbled O
, O
starchy O
potatoes B-FOOD
and O
baconlike B-FOOD
curls O
of O
guanciale B-FOOD

For O
a O
while O

was O
doing O
an O
enjoyable O
two O

the O
pie B-FOOD
and O
arranging O
tender O
, O
not O
too O
chewy O
bands O
of O
tripe B-FOOD
on O
top O
. O

In O
a O
more O
classical O
vein O
, O
the O
margherita B-DISH
, O
spread O
with O
flavorful O
tomatoes B-FOOD
that O
are O
more O
pulp B-FOOD
than O
sauce B-FOOD
and O
punctuated O
with O
mozzarella B-FOOD
, O
is O
superb O
. O

At O
$ O
16 O
, O
the O
buffalo B-DISH
mozzarella I-DISH

richer O

with O
a O
faint O
taste O
of O
the O
barnyard O

wherever O
it O

worth O

A O
little O
skepticism O
is O
in O
order O
when O
you O
hear O
about O
the O
work O
history O
of O
a O
chef O
running O
a O
kitchen O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

As O
frequent O
diners O
know O
from O
sad O
experience O
, O
it O
is O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
possible O
to O
cook O
in O
an O
acclaimed O
restaurant O
without O
picking O
up O
any O
of O
the O
qualities O
that O
it O
's O
acclaimed O
for O
. O

Even O
when O
actual O
skills O
have O
been O
learned O
, O
they O
are O
not O
always O
obvious O
. O

Or O
, O
occasionally O
, O
they O
're O
all O
too O
obvious O
, O
and O
you O
'll O
catch O
somebody O
in O
a O
two O
- O
person O
kitchen O
trying O
to O
replicate O
dishes O
originally O
assembled O
by O
a O
team O
of O
40 O
. O

One O
interesting O
thing O
about O
Soogil O
Lim O
is O
that O
you O
can O
almost O
draw O
a O
straight O
line O
from O
his O
resume O
to O
what O
's O
on O
the O
table O
at O
his O
four O
- O
month O
- O
old O
restaurant O
in O
the O
East B-LOC
Village I-LOC
, O
Soogil B-EST
. O

It O
's O
easy O
to O
spot O
the O
imprint O
of O
Hooni O
Kim O
's O
Hanjan B-EST
, O
where O
he O
was O
the O
executive O
chef O
for O
four O
years O
. O

Mr. O
Lim O
lived O
in O
South B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
until O
he O
was O
28 O
, O
so O
what O
he O
learned O
at O
Hanjan B-EST
was O
not O
how O
to O
make O
the O
country O
's O
traditional O
food O
but O
how O
to O
rework O
it O
into O
appealing O
, O
contemporary O
small O
plates O
. O

Daniel B-EST
, O
where O
he O
spent O
seven O
years O
and O
reached O
the O
rank O
of O
sous O
- O
chef O
, O
turns O
up O
in O
the O
French B-CUISINE
techniques O
Mr. O
Lim O
leans O
on O
, O
in O
the O
crisp O
presentations O
that O
carry O
an O
echo O
of O
nouvelle B-CUISINE
cuisine O
, O
in O
the O
tender O
braised B-DISH
short I-DISH
rib I-DISH
, O
in O
his O
fondness O
for O
foie B-FOOD
gras I-FOOD
and O
in O
his O
preference O
for O
skillfully O
modulating O
flavors O
rather O
than O
tossing O
umami O
grenades O
. O

It O
's O
also O
apparent O
, O
when O
you O
look O
around O
the O
dining O
room O
, O
that O
in O
his O
earlier O
jobs O
Mr. O
Lim O
spent O
most O
of O
his O
time O
in O
the O
kitchen O
; O
the O
lineage O
you O
taste O
in O
his O
cooking O
does O

show O
up O
in O

Soogil B-EST
( O

) O
does O
n't O
evoke O
a O
rambunctious O
Korean B-CUISINE

does O
. O

Nor O
is O
it O
a O

Under O
the O
guidance O
of O
Mr. O
Lim O

wife O
, O
Sasook O
Youn O

the O

been O
done O
in O
what O
we O
now O
recognize O
as O
the O
all O

Modern O
Asian O

a O

against O
one O

a O

French O

the O

Once O
in O

wide O
enough O
for O
Mr. O
Lim O

face O
to O
appear O
while O
he O
scans O
the O
tables O
. O

Sometimes O
they O
are O
full O
. O

They O
should O
be O
full O
all O
the O
time O
, O
because O
cooking O
like O
this O
does O
not O
just O
sprout O
up O
through O
every O
crack O
in O
the O
sidewalk O
, O
particularly O
at O
prices O
that O
, O
with O
one O
or O
two O
exceptions O
, O

over O

A O
good O
window O
into O
Mr. O
Lim O
's O
mind O
is O
the O
bindaetteok B-DISH
appetizer O
. O

Usually O
these O
mung B-FOOD
bean I-FOOD
pancakes I-FOOD
present O
as O
flat O
, O
starchy O
discs O
whose O
golden O
surfaces O
hint O
at O
crunchiness O
without O
actually O
delivering O
it O
. O

The O
ones O
at O
Soogil B-EST
, O
fried O
in O
pork B-FOOD
fat I-FOOD
, O
have O
golden O
crusts O
like O
veal B-FOOD
cutlets I-FOOD
; O
by O
the O
time O
you O
've O
speared O
a O
piece O
with O
some O
chopped O
kimchi B-FOOD
and O
dunked O
it O
in O
the O
traditional O
dipping B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
, O
you O
have O
all O
the O
expected O
flavors O
, O
plus O
a O
formidable O
crunch O
to O
sweeten O
the O
deal O
. O

He O
tinkers O
with O
the O
glass B-FOOD
noodle I-FOOD
dish O
called O
japchae B-DISH
in O
less O
radical O
fashion O
. O

The O
noodles B-FOOD
themselves O
, O
shaped O
into O
a O
swirl O
with O
crisp O
shreds O
of O
vegetables B-FOOD
and O
oyster B-FOOD
mushrooms I-FOOD
, O
have O
drunk O
in O
more O
soy B-FOOD
and O
sesame B-FOOD
flavor O
than O
they O
typically O
do O
. O

And O
Mr. O
Lim O
seems O
to O
have O
tripled O
, O
at O
least O
, O
the O
amount O
of O
bulgogi B-FOOD
, O
a O
point O
he O
emphasizes O
by O
mounding O
the O
meat B-FOOD
over O
the O
noodles B-FOOD
so O
it O
looks O
like O
a O
sloppy B-FOOD
Joe I-FOOD
missing O
its O
top O
bun B-FOOD
. O

The O
care O
the O
kitchen O
pays O
to O
technique O
is O
obvious O
in O
the O
seafood B-FOOD
dishes O
; O
I O
've O
never O
had O
one O
that O
was O
n't O
perfectly O
cooked O
. O

Monkfish B-FOOD
, O
which O
can O
come O
off O
as O
a O
rubber O
replica O
of O
some O
part O
of O
the O
anatomy O
I O
'd O
rather O
not O
think O
about O
, O
gets O
wrapped O
in O
a O
cabbage B-FOOD
or O
lettuce B-FOOD
leaf I-FOOD
, O
gently O
poached O
, O
and O
sliced O
into O
neat O
little O
wheels O

Arranged O
over O
stir B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
fried O
vegetables O
in O
a O
sea O
of O
fermented B-FOOD
chile I-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
, O
it O
's O
terrific O
, O
and O
about O
as O
French B-CUISINE
as O
Korean B-CUISINE
cooking O
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
get O
. O

An O
almost O
silky O
consistency O
marks O
the O
mackerel B-FOOD
that O
Soogil B-EST
serves O
, O
nigiri B-FOOD
- O
style O
, O
over O
wads O
of O
rice B-FOOD
that O
have O
been O
seasoned O
with O
ssamjang B-FOOD
( O
standing O
in O
for O
wasabi B-FOOD
? O
) O
and O
wrapped O
in O
chard B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
. O

The O
tender O
Manila B-FOOD
clams I-FOOD
, O
squid B-FOOD
and O
shrimp B-FOOD
in O
the O
spicy B-DISH
tofu I-DISH
- I-DISH
seafood O
stew O
kept O
more O
of O
their O
natural O
juiciness O
than O
usual O
, O
although O
very O
firm O
shellfish B-FOOD
is O
n't O
necessarily O
a O
defect O
in O
that O
dish O
. O

Mr. O
Lim O
herds O
all O
the O
soft B-FOOD
tofu I-FOOD
into O
a O
flan B-FOOD
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
bowl O
, O
rather O
than O
letting O
cubes O
of O
it O
fend O
for O
themselves O
in O
the O
broth B-FOOD
-- O
a O
move O
that O
nicely O
heightens O
the O
contrast O
of O
tofu B-FOOD
and O
chiles B-FOOD
. O

The O
least O
Korean B-CUISINE
thing O
on O
the O
menu O
must O
be O
the O
foie B-DISH
gras I-DISH
terrine I-DISH
, O
and O
it O
's O
also O
one O
of O
the O
only O
disappointments O
, O
with O
its O
crumbly O
Melba B-FOOD
toasts I-FOOD
and O
washed O
- O
out O
green B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
plum O
jelly O
. O

A O
dish O
called O
nurungji B-DISH
gras I-DISH
is O
something O
else O
entirely O
: O
a O
fine O
seared O
hunk O
of O
foie B-FOOD
gras I-FOOD
laid O
over O
spinach B-FOOD
and O
pickled B-FOOD
mushrooms I-FOOD
on O
a O
springy O
, O
crunchy O
sizzled O
rice B-FOOD
cake I-FOOD
. O

Slabs O
of O
pork B-FOOD
belly I-FOOD
are O
braised O
until O
the O
fat O
streaks O
are O
nearly O
liquid O
. O

Then O
they O
're O
given O
a O
meaningful O
sear O
and O
served O
alongside O
a O
stripe O
of O
a O
sauce O
I O
've O
never O
had O
before O
, O
made O
with O
fermented B-FOOD
shrimp I-FOOD
and O
green B-FOOD
plums I-FOOD
and O
fresh O
red B-FOOD
peppers I-FOOD
: O
spicy O
, O
salty O
, O
sour O
and O
hot O
. O

The O
dish O
that O
breaks O
the O
$ O
20 O
barrier O
is O
the O
short B-DISH
rib I-DISH
. O

If O
you O
've O
had O
Daniel B-EST
's O
braised B-DISH
short I-DISH
ribs I-DISH
, O
the O
tenderness O
and O
concentration O
will O
be O
familiar O
to O
you O
, O
although O
Soogil B-EST
's O
version O
is O
pointedly O
suffused O
with O
soy B-FOOD
rather O
than O
red B-FOOD
wine I-FOOD
. O

Underlining O
the O
French B-CUISINE
connection O
, O
this O
block O
of O
beef B-FOOD
is O
served O
with O
carrots B-FOOD
, O
potatoes B-FOOD
and O
winter B-FOOD
squash I-FOOD
. O

If O
you O
eat O
it O
by O
yourself O
, O
you O
could O
make O
dinner O
of O
it O
. O

After O
which O
you O
should O
probably O
investigate O
something O
that O
goes O
by O
the O
name O
Jenga B-DISH
Tower I-DISH
. O

Cigarettes O

from O
that O

A O

: O
pickled B-FOOD

with O
deep O

Until O
it O
swam O
off O
the O
menu O
, O
there O
was O
an O
intriguing O
sideways O
version O
of O
squid B-DISH
ink I-DISH
risotto I-DISH
that O
had O
beech B-FOOD
mushrooms I-FOOD
and O
very O
tender O
squid B-FOOD
confit I-FOOD
over O
a O
black O

of O

Now O
there O
are O

swirled O

into O
a O
sauce O
for O
just O
- O
firm O
shrimp B-FOOD
; O
the O
combination O
suggested O
pasta B-FOOD

but O
I O
was O
glad O
to O
have O
it O
without O
any O
starch O
getting O
in O
the O
way O
of O
the O
clear O
, O
sweet O

If O
it O

pasta B-FOOD
you O
want O

Mr. O

while O
the O

is O
thicker O

glossier O
than O
a O
normal O
acqua B-FOOD

, O
it O
is O
very O
good O
. O

What O
he O
calls O
a O
pork B-DISH

collar O
Milanese O
is O
maybe O
a O
few O
millimeters O
too O
thick O
for O
the O
name O
, O
but O
I O
'll O
take O
it O
. O

The O
cut O
is O
more O
flavorful O
than O
a O
normal O

the O

If O

Can O
anybody O
who O
has O
to O
think O
about O
the O
price O
of O
groceries O
still O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
sushi B-FOOD
scene O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
? O

Just O
in O
the O
past O
year O
we O
've O
gotten O
at O
least O
five O
omakase B-TYPE

Sushi B-EST
Noz I-EST
, O
Sushi B-EST
Amane I-EST

Noda B-EST
, O
Shoji B-EST
at I-EST
69 I-EST
Leonard I-EST

Ichimura B-EST
at I-EST
Uchu I-EST
-- O
where O
the O
price O
of O
a O

before O

and O
tax O
, O
is O
somewhere O
between O
$ O
250 O
and O
$ O
300 O
. O

If O
you O
were O
already O
inclined O
to O
think O
that O
the O
Japanese B-CUISINE
seafood B-FOOD
game O
, O
like O
so O
many O
other O
things O
in O
Manhattan B-LOC
, O
is O
rigged O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
robber O
barons O
, O
these O
restaurants O
wo O
n't O
change O
your O
mind O
. O

But O
the O
next O
time O
you O
despair O
of O
ever O
tasting O
another O
slice O
of O
yellowtail B-FOOD
, O
I O
'd O
suggest O
dropping O
into O
an O
izakaya B-TYPE
called O
Wokuni B-EST
for O
lunch O
or O
dinner O
. O

A O
short O
detour O
from O
Grand B-LOC
Central I-LOC
Terminal I-LOC
, O
it O
has O
been O
in O
business O
since O
October O
. O

So O
far O
it O
has O
not O
drawn O
much O
attention O
to O
itself O
. O

Given O
the O
mixed O
messages O
it O
sends O
out O
, O
this O
is O
understandable O
. O

It O
has O
soaring O
ceilings O
, O
a O
backlit O
bar O
with O
shelves O
so O
high O
the O
topmost O
bottles O
can O
be O
reached O
only O
by O
a O
gymnast O
, O
an O
undulating O
wall O
of O
overlapping O
tiles O
that O
suggests O
Frank O
Gehry O
in O
his O
fish O
- O
scale O
period O
, O
and O
a O
constant O
dance O
beat O
in O
the O
background O
that O
wo O
n't O
stop O
no O
matter O
how O
hard O
you O
cry O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
it O
looks O
like O
the O
Asian B-CUISINE
fusion I-CUISINE
restaurant O
in O
the O
lobby O
of O
a O
W B-LOC
hotel I-LOC
built O
around O
1999 O
. O

The O
menu O
sings O
another O
tune O
, O
though O
. O

It O
is O
full O
of O
traditional O
izakaya B-TYPE
dishes O
like O
tofu B-DISH
agedashi I-DISH
and O
chicken B-DISH
karaage I-DISH
, O
rounded O
out O
by O
sashimi B-DISH
and O
grilled B-DISH
skewers I-DISH
. O

There O
is O
one O
twist O
, O
though O
: O
Wokuni B-EST
is O
much O
, O
much O
more O
interested O
in O
seafood B-FOOD
than O
the O
average O
izakaya B-TYPE
. O

As O
a O
rule O
, O
the O
fish B-FOOD
at O
Wokuni B-EST
is O
exceptionally O
good O
and O
almost O
bizarrely O
fresh O
, O
shipped O
daily O
from O
the O
Tsukiji B-EST
fish I-EST
market I-EST
in O
Tokyo B-LOC
or O
from O
a O
fish O
farm O
in O
Nagasaki B-LOC
owned O
by O
the O
restaurant O
's O
parent O
company O
, O
Tokyo O
Ichiban O
Foods O
. O

( O
Its O
admirable O
motto O
: O
" O
We O
are O
changing O
the O
dietary O
culture O
in O
Japan B-LOC
with O
persistence O
. O
" O
) O
Raw O
or O
cooked O
, O
the O
seafood B-FOOD
at O
Wokuni B-EST
sets O
it O
apart O
from O
other O
izakayas B-TYPE
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
best O
seen O
as O
embassies O
of O
Japanese B-CUISINE
drinking O
culture O
in O
which O
the O
food O
plays O
the O
role O
of O
the O
ambassador O
's O
chauffeur O
. O

Sushi B-EST
is O
rare O
at O
standard O
izakayas B-TYPE
, O
but O
it O
is O
made O
and O
sold O
at O
Wokuni B-EST
, O
at O
very O
moderate O
prices O
. O

While O
many O
omakase B-TYPE
chefs O
age O
their O
fish B-FOOD
to O
make O
it O
supple O
and O
relaxed O
, O
the O
sushi B-FOOD
at O
Wokuni B-EST
is O
almost O
insolently O
fresh O
. O

And O
if O
you O
merely O
get O
a O
few O
$ O
5 O
pieces O
of O
king B-DISH
yellowtail I-DISH
sushi I-DISH
, O
or O
$ O
6 O
pieces O
of O
sea B-DISH
bream I-DISH
sushi I-DISH
, O
and O
maybe O
a O
slice O
or O
two O
of O
golden B-DISH
- I-DISH
eye I-DISH
snapper O
sushi O
at O
$ O
9 O
each O
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
regret O
it O
. O

The O
fish B-FOOD
will O
be O
shiny O
. O

It O
will O
probably O
be O
chewy O
. O

The O
pinks O
and O
reds O
and O
ivories O
and O
whites O
in O
its O
flesh O
will O
be O
as O
distinct O
as O
if O
they O
'd O
been O
painted O
on O
with O
a O
nail O
- O
polish O
brush O
. O

But O
sushi B-FOOD
is O
not O
the O
highest O
use O
of O
Wokuni B-EST
's O
seafood B-FOOD
. O

What O
the O
place O
lacks O
are O
the O
seasonal O
fish B-FOOD
that O
can O
make O
a O
sushi B-FOOD
excursion O
really O
memorable O
: O
gizzard B-FOOD
shad I-FOOD
, O
striped B-FOOD
jack I-FOOD
, O
firefly B-FOOD
squid I-FOOD
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
sashimi B-FOOD
, O
though O
, O
this O
is O
not O
much O
of O
a O
liability O
, O
and O
the O
firmness O
of O
Wokuni B-EST
's O
fish B-FOOD
becomes O
a O
point O
in O
its O
favor O
. O

Before O
ordering O
sashimi B-FOOD
-- O
or O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
anything O
else O
-- O
check O
the O
daily O
specials O
posted O
by O
the O
chef O
, O
Kuniaki O
Yoshizawa O
. O

They O
will O
almost O
always O
include O
several O
cuts O
of O
bluefin B-FOOD
from O
farm O
- O
raised O
fish B-FOOD
. O

If O
you O
come O
very O
early O
for O
lunch O
and O
manage O
to O
get O
the O
Wokuni B-DISH
don I-DISH
, O
a O
special O
that O
centers O
on O
a O
sashimi B-FOOD
rice I-FOOD
bowl I-FOOD
and O
shrimp B-FOOD
tempura I-FOOD
, O
it O
will O
strike O
you O
as O
an O
incredible O
bargain O
at O
$ O
24 O
. O

The O
kitchen O
makes O
only O
five O
Wokuni B-DISH
- O
dons O
a O
day O
, O
though O
, O
so O
chances O
are O
you O
will O
have O
to O
content O
yourself O
with O
the O
kaisen B-DISH
- O
don O
, O
and O
chances O
are O
that O
even O
though O
it O
does O
n't O
include O
tempura B-FOOD
, O
the O
$ O
18 O
you O
pay O
will O
still O
seem O
like O
one O
of O
the O
best O
raw B-FOOD
- O
fish O
deals O
in O
town O
. O

Things O
get O
even O
more O
intriguing O
when O
Wokuni B-EST
's O
seafood B-FOOD
comes O
into O
contact O
with O
heat O
. O

Again O
, O
the O
specials O
should O
be O
your O
starting O
point O
. O

There O
may O
well O
be O
a O
grilled B-DISH
yellowtail I-DISH
collar I-DISH
. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
ordering O
this O
at O
your O
favorite O
izakaya B-TYPE
, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
bet O
that O
you O
will O
be O
surprised O
by O
how O
much O
cleaner O
and O
sweeter O
it O
tastes O
here O
. O

Bluefin B-FOOD
collars I-FOOD
and O
jaws B-FOOD
are O
not O
served O
often O
enough O
for O
anybody O
to O
get O
into O
the O
habit O
of O
ordering O
them O
. O

The O
grilled B-FOOD
collar I-FOOD
at O
Wokuni B-EST
one O
recent O
night O
was O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
pieces O
of O
cooked O
fish B-FOOD
I O
've O
had O
in O
a O
long O
time O
, O
every O
bit O
of O
it O
worth O
chasing O
into O
the O
hollows O
of O
bone O
, O
skin O
and O
cartilage O
where O
it O
hid O
. O

It O
is O
not O
always O
available O
, O
but O
the O
grilled B-DISH
bluefin I-DISH
tail I-DISH
is O
, O
carved O
into O
a O
steak B-FOOD
with O
the O
backbone O
sliced O
open O
so O
you O
can O
get O
at O
the O
teaspoonful O
of O
hot O
, O
clear O
jelly B-FOOD
inside O
the O
spine O
. O

Mr. O
Yoshizawa O
has O
had O
the O
surprising O
idea O
of O
treating O
the O
angles O
and O
corners O
of O
the O
sea B-FOOD
bream I-FOOD
's O
body O
like O
chicken B-FOOD
wings I-FOOD
. O

Tucked O
into O
triangles O
, O
fried O
until O
crunchy O
and O
served O
with O
lemon B-FOOD
, O
they O
are O
meant O
to O
be O
gnawned O
on O
between O
sips O
of O
sake B-FOOD
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
ei B-DISH

a O
frequent O
special O
of O
cured B-FOOD
, I-FOOD
dried I-FOOD
skate I-FOOD
fin O
cut O
into O
squares O
, O
makes O
a O
chewy O
and O
likable O
sidekick O
to O
beer B-FOOD
. O

Fish B-DISH
and I-DISH
chips I-DISH
, O
of O
course O
, O
will O
go O
with O
either O
-- O
the O
fish B-FOOD
species O
changes O
from O
night O
to O
night O
, O
but O
it O
tends O
to O
be O
extremely O
fresh O
, O
crunchy O
and O
light O
on O
batter O
. O

The O
chips B-FOOD
, O
made O
from O
the O
Japanese B-CUISINE
mountain B-FOOD
yam I-FOOD
, O
were O
never O
crunchy O
and O
always O
needed O
more O
salt B-FOOD

Sometimes O
salt B-FOOD
came O
with O
them O
, O
and O
sometimes O
it O
did O
n't O
. O

Those O
yam B-FOOD
fries I-FOOD
are O
an O
example O
of O
what O
happens O
once O
you O
venture O
away O
from O
seafood B-FOOD
at O
Wokuni B-EST
: O
The O
ingredients O
are O
n't O
doing O
the O
heavy O
lifting O
anymore O
, O
and O
everything O
tastes O
sort O
of O
, O
well O
, O
ordinary O
. O

Certain O
things O
are O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
ordinary O
, O
like O
the O
fried B-DISH
tofu I-DISH
in I-DISH
dashi I-DISH
; O
the O
warm O
rolled B-DISH
omelet I-DISH
, O
particularly O
when O
topped O
with O
grilled B-FOOD
freshwater I-FOOD
eel I-FOOD
; O
and O
the O
tender O
, O
ghost O
- O
white O
baby B-DISH
sardines I-DISH
with O
grated O
daikon B-FOOD
. O

Others O
are O
on O
the O
wrong O
side O
, O
like O
the O
grilled B-DISH
scallops I-DISH
in I-DISH
butter I-DISH
and O
the O
monkfish B-DISH
liver I-DISH
that O
strongly O
recalled O
canned O
cat O
food O
. O

If O
I O
worked O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
I O
would O
eagerly O
return O
at O
least O
once O
a O
week O
, O
sticking O
as O
closely O
as O
possible O
to O
the O
fish B-FOOD
specials O
. O

I O
doubt O
I O
'd O
get O
bored O
, O
but O
I O
would O
keep O
my O
eye O
out O
for O
something O
that O
Wokuni B-EST
could O
put O
on O
the O
menu O
, O
but O
so O
far O
has O
n't O
. O

The O
parent O
company O
runs O
a O
farm O
that O
raises O
tiger B-FOOD
blowfish I-FOOD
, O
and O
about O
50 O
restaurants O
in O
Japan B-LOC
that O
serve O
it O
. O

Tiger B-FOOD
blowfish I-FOOD
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
the O
most O
delicious O
kind O
of O
fugu B-FOOD
. O

I O
think O
New B-LOC

could O
make O
it O
feel O
appreciated O
on O
Lexington B-LOC

Ever O

began O
rehabilitating O
chicken B-FOOD

Neapolitan B-FOOD

I O
've O
been O
waiting O

restaurants O
to O
carry O
the O
torch O
of O
Italian B-CUISINE
- O
American O
food O
boldly O
into O
the O
future O
. O

This O
is O
a O
major O
branch O
of O
American B-CUISINE
cuisine O
, O
too O
important O
for O
its O
fate O
to O
be O
left O
to O
the O
Olive B-EST

For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
though O
, O
the O
torch O
has O
gone O
uncarried O

I O
have O
been O
told O
that O
Palizzi B-EST
Social I-EST
Club I-EST
, O
in O
Philadelphia B-LOC
, O
may O
qualify O
, O
but O
because O
Palizzi B-EST

members O

only O

no O

I O
do O
n't O
expect O
to O
eat O
there O
before O
the O

Then O
in O
October O
, O
a O
place O
opened O
in O
the O
West B-LOC

that O
seemed O
to O
hit O
all O
the O

It O

called O
Don B-EST

Two O

The O
dining O
room O
brings O
back O
the O
high O
- O
glitz O
Italian B-CUISINE
restaurant O
decor O
of O
the O
1970s O
and O
' O
80s O
, O
the O
period O
when O
Formica O
and O
oil O
paintings O
of O
the O
Bay B-LOC
of I-LOC
Naples I-LOC
went O
out O
and O
mirrors O
with O
gold O
pinstripes O
came O
in O

The O
floor O
is O
a O
black O

and O
- O
white O
checkerboard O

The O
bar O
is O
made O
of O
polished O

the O

There O
is O
a O
house O
Chianti B-FOOD

and O
it O
comes O
in O
a O
straw O

There O
is O
hope O
for O
a O
red B-FOOD
- O

renaissance O
, O
after O
all O

Unfortunately O
, O
more O
or O
less O
from O
the O
day O
it O
opened O
, O
having O
dinner O
at O
Don B-EST
Angie I-EST
has O
been O
only O
marginally O
less O
difficult O
than O
eating O
at O
a O
private O
club O
. O

That O
has O
something O
to O
do O
with O
Ms. O
Rito O
's O
and O
Mr. O
Tacinelli O
's O
knack O
for O
cooking O
things O
that O
Instagram O
ca O
n't O
resist O
. O

The O
two O
spent O
three O
years O
running O
the O
kitchen O
at O
Quality B-EST
Italian I-EST
in O
Midtown B-LOC
, O
where O
they O
engineered O
, O
among O
other O
pieces O
of O
shutterbait O
, O
a O
chicken B-FOOD
Parm I-FOOD
that O
looked O
like O
a O
pizza B-FOOD
. O

There O
was O
some O
wonderful O
stuff O
at O
Quality B-EST
Italian I-EST
and O
some O
less O
wonderful O
stuff O
, O
and O
almost O
all O
of O
it O
either O
arrived O
on O
trolleys O
or O
was O
prepared O
at O
tableside O
or O
set O
on O
fire O
while O
you O
watched O
. O

The O
restaurant O
group O
behind O
Quality B-EST
Italian I-EST
, O
Quality O
Branded O
, O
is O
also O
backing O
Don B-EST
Angie I-EST
. O

So O
as O
I O
resigned O
myself O
to O
eating O
at O
Don B-EST
Angie I-EST
close O
to O
5:30 O
p.m. O
, O
when O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
an O
unreserved O
table O
, O
I O
also O
braced O
for O
a O
dose O
of O
abracadabra O
. O

It O
arrived O
right O
on O
schedule O
with O
my O
first O
drink O
, O
which O
a O
server O
strained O
into O
a O
glass O
through O
a O
coffee O
filter O
cone O
lined O
with O
espresso B-EST
ice I-EST
. O

It O
was O
called O
Americano B-DISH
, I-DISH
Americano O
, O
and O
combined O
at O
least O
three O
meanings O
of O
the O
word O
: O
a O
highball B-FOOD
, O
an O
Italian B-CUISINE
aperitif B-FOOD
wine I-FOOD
and O
a O
diluted O
shot O
of O
espresso B-FOOD
. O

The O
Americano B-FOOD
highball I-FOOD
, O
so O
simple O
that O
just O
about O
any O
bartender O
can O
make O
it O
, O
does O
n't O
need O
much O
improvement O
. O

But O
I O
have O
to O
admit O
that O
the O
coffee B-FOOD
did O
give O
it O
some O
ballast O
. O

I O
'm O
also O
happy O
to O
report O
that O
this O
was O
one O
of O
the O
last O
bits O
of O
stagecraft O
I O
saw O
at O
Don B-EST
Angie I-EST
. O

Ms. O
Rito O
and O
Mr. O
Tacinelli O
have O
a O
few O
tricks O
up O
their O
sleeves O
, O
but O
they O
save O
them O
for O
the O
kitchen O
. O

The O
result O
is O
food O
that O
is O
creative O
in O
a O
more O
interesting O
and O
more O
consistently O
successful O
way O
than O
it O
was O
at O
Quality B-EST
Italian I-EST
. O

And O
it O
arrives O
at O
the O
table O
without O
the O
aid O
of O
trolleys O
. O

When O
you O
get O
a O
Caesar B-DISH
salad I-DISH
, O
the O
server O
does O
n't O
whip O
together O
the O
dressing B-FOOD
on O
the O
spot O
. O

It O
's O
been O
done O
in O
the O
kitchen O
, O
where O
the O
chefs O
replaced O
romaine B-FOOD
with O
tender O
chrysanthemum B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
that O
taste O
like O
some O
newly O
discovered O
herb B-FOOD
. O

( O
The O
feathery O
leaves O
firmly O
grip O
the O
dressing B-FOOD
and O
the O
fluffy O
rasped B-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
, O
too O
. O
) O

I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
seeing O
chrysanthemum B-FOOD
in O
an O
Italian B-CUISINE
restaurant O
before O
, O
and O
it O
shows O
the O
chefs O
' O
skill O
for O
cross O
- O
pollinating O
with O
other O
cuisines O
, O
especially O
Asian B-CUISINE
ones O
. O

While O
the O
Torrisi O
- O
Carbone O
axis O
is O
generally O
faithful O
to O
Italian B-CUISINE
- O
American O
standards O
, O
using O
more O
expensive O
ingredients O
and O
more O
modern O
techniques O
but O
leaving O
the O
basic O
ideas O
intact O
, O
the O
Rito O
- O
Tacinelli O
approach O
is O
more O
radical O
. O

They O
trample O
on O
tradition O
when O
they O
feel O
like O
it O
. O

Prosciutto B-FOOD
and O
honeydew B-FOOD
melon I-FOOD
are O
tossed O
with O
candied B-FOOD
hazelnuts I-FOOD
and O
mint B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
in O
a O
lime B-FOOD
, I-FOOD
tamarind I-FOOD
and I-FOOD
fish I-FOOD
- O
sauce O
dressing O
. O

This O
very O
good O
salad B-FOOD
, O
which O
obviously O
glances O
toward O
Southeast B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
, O
is O
a O
smart O
way O
to O
handle O
an O
antipasto O
standby O
that O
is O
usually O
pointless O
except O
when O
melons B-FOOD
are O
in O
season O
. O

Their O
garlic B-DISH
bread I-DISH
turns O
out O
to O
be O
a O
very O
thin O
disc O
with O
garlic B-FOOD
chives I-FOOD
and O
melted O
cheese B-FOOD
inside O
and O
sesame B-FOOD
seeds I-FOOD
on O
top O
. O

Lightweight O
, O
salty O
and O
irresistible O
, O
it O
's O
modeled O
on O
Ligurian B-CUISINE
focaccia B-FOOD
di I-FOOD
recco I-FOOD
, O
but O
it O
may O
also O
bring O
to O
mind O
Turkish B-CUISINE
gozleme B-FOOD
, O
Azeri B-CUISINE
kutab B-FOOD
or O
even O
a O
Chinese B-CUISINE
scallion B-FOOD
pancake I-FOOD
. O

There O
's O
China B-LOC
again O
, O
in O
the O
pepperoni B-DISH
fried I-DISH
rice I-DISH
served O
under O
barbecued B-FOOD
squid I-FOOD
. O

Ignore O
the O
squid B-FOOD
unless O
you O
like O
it O
leathery O
, O
and O
just O
focus O
on O
the O
rice B-FOOD
, O
stirring O
it O
with O
labneh B-FOOD
when O
the O
heat O
starts O
to O
rise O
. O

The O
dish O
everybody O
has O
seen O
on O
Instagram O
is O
the O
pasta B-FOOD
called O
caramelle B-FOOD
. O

In O
Italian O
it O
means O
caramel B-FOOD
, O
as O
in O
candy B-FOOD
, O
but O
the O
shape O
will O
remind O
most O
Americans O
of O
an O
elongated O
Tootsie B-FOOD
Roll I-FOOD
, O
with O
twists O
at O
either O
end O
of O
a O
drum O
that O
's O
filled O
with O
buffalo B-FOOD
ricotta I-FOOD
. O

Cameras O
come O
out O
because O
the O
dough B-FOOD
is O
striped O
, O
with O
black B-FOOD
sesame I-FOOD
- O
flour O
bands O
alternating O
with O
ordinary O
egg B-FOOD
pasta I-FOOD
. O

The O
sesame B-FOOD
barely O
registers O
; O
the O
fun O
of O
the O
dish O
is O
the O
sauce B-FOOD
, O
a O
peppered B-FOOD
, I-FOOD
pickled I-FOOD
cantaloupe O
that O
tastes O
like O
it O
's O
still O
percolating O
. O

But O
the O
dish O
that O
could O
be O
Don B-EST
Angie I-EST
's O
lasting O
contribution O
to O
the O
pasta B-FOOD
sciences O
is O
the O
garganelli B-DISH
with I-DISH
meatball I-DISH
ragu I-DISH
. O

The O
central O
problem O
of O
red B-FOOD
- O
sauce O
restaurants O
is O
this O
: O
Pasta B-FOOD
and O
meatballs B-FOOD
are O
always O
served O
together O
, O
but O
they O
remain O
stubbornly O
separate O
. O

Ms. O
Rito O
and O
Mr. O
Tacinelli O
have O
found O
a O
way O
out O
of O
this O
conundrum O
by O
crushing O
meatballs B-FOOD
into O
a O
tomato B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
guanciale O
ragu O
. O

It O
's O
not O
quite O
as O
simple O
as O
I O
've O
made O
it O
sound O
, O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
when O
you O
're O
eating O
it O
; O
you O
just O
think O
you O
're O
magically O
eating O
meatballs B-FOOD
and O
pasta B-FOOD
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

They O
've O
also O
tried O
to O
salvage O
chicken B-DISH
scarpariello I-DISH
, O
a O
dish O
that O
is O
almost O
always O
overcooked O
. O

Their O
solution O
is O
to O
make O
a O
kind O
of O
pie B-FOOD
with O
chicken B-FOOD
meat I-FOOD
pressed O
down O
into O
a O
kind O
of O
crust B-FOOD
made O
of O
sausage B-FOOD
. O

The O
flavors O
are O
accurate O
, O
and O
for O
once O
it O
's O
not O
dry O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
as O
engaging O
as O
other O
main O
courses O
, O
like O
the O
veal B-DISH
cutlet I-DISH
with O
speck B-FOOD
and O
pickled B-FOOD
mustard I-FOOD
seeds I-FOOD
, O
or O
the O
grilled B-DISH
fillet I-DISH
of I-DISH
orata I-DISH
next O
to O
herbed B-FOOD
fregola I-FOOD
, O
with O
buttermilk B-FOOD
as O
the O
sauce B-FOOD
. O

Reworking O
tiramisu B-DISH
almost O
never O
improves O
it O
, O
but O
as O
a O
change O
of O
pace O
I O
did O
like O
how O
the O
one O
at O
Don B-EST
Angie I-EST
shifted O
the O
emphasis O
from O
espresso B-FOOD
to O
bittersweet B-FOOD
cocoa I-FOOD
. O

There O
's O
a O
delicious O
, O
if O
more O
conventional O
, O
plate O
of O
tender O
, O
light O
zeppole B-DISH
with O
tangy O
whipped B-FOOD
robiola I-FOOD
under O
an O
Andy O
Warhol O
mop O
of O
spun B-FOOD
sugar I-FOOD
that O
people O
go O
wild O
for O
. O

I O
was O
charmed O
by O
a O
smaller O
, O
quieter O
dessert O
: O
a O
mochi B-DISH
cake I-DISH
stuffed O
with O
fior B-FOOD
di I-FOOD
latte I-FOOD
ice I-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
, O
with O
sea B-FOOD
salt I-FOOD
and O
a O
fragrant O
scribble O
of O
olive B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
. O

It O
's O
like O
eating O
a O
mozzarella B-FOOD
ball O
that O
wanted O
to O
become O
a O

Anthony O

an O
inside O

Do O

It O
was O
the O
part O
that O

from O
his O

a O
long O
essay O
about O
the O
unglamorous O

sometimes O
unsavory O
work O
of O
cooks O
and O
dishwashers O
that O
ran O
in O
The O
New O

their O
lives O
and O
their O
day O
- O
to O
- O
day O
work O
in O
concrete O

indelible O
detail O

When O
kitchens O
were O
being O
wrapped O
in O
a O
shimmering O
gauze O
of O
glamour O
, O
Mr. O
Bourdain O
got O
busy O
unwrapping O
them O
, O
revealing O
the O
injuries O
and O
addictions O
, O
low O
wages O
and O
high O
tempers O
that O
took O
a O
toll O
on O
workers O

Among O
other O
things O
, O
he O
was O
one O
of O
the O
first O
writers O
to O
tell O
the O

that O
many O

would O
cease O

without O
the O

of O

It O
was O
almost O
a O
casual O
aside O
, O
yet O
it O
suddenly O
opened O
new O
subjects O
to O
the O
purview O
of O

: O
immigration O

He O
identified O

, O
portraying O
himself O
as O

of O

The O
grunts O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
identified O
with O
him O
, O
not O
because O
of O
his O
contributions O
as O
a O
chef O
-- O
who O
can O
name O

but O
because O
he O
told O
the O
world O
what O
the O
work O
was O
really O
like O

And O
once O
he O
left O

behind O
for O
a O

He O
certainly O
took O
pleasure O

misogyny O

were O
overlooked O

the O

if O

this O
may O
be O
common O
for O
male O

, O
but O
they O
are O
not O

Mr. O

was O

-DOCSTART- O

At O
some O
fateful O
moment O
in O
the O
13th O
century O
when O
Kublai O
Khan O
was O
preparing O
to O
lead O
the O
Mongol O
hordes O
into O
battle O
, O
hunger O
struck O
. O

With O
no O
time O
to O
make O
a O
roast B-FOOD
or O
stew B-FOOD
, O
the O
legend O
goes O
, O
the O
Great O
Khan O
's O
chef O
carved O
very O
thin O
slices O
of O
raw B-FOOD
mutton I-FOOD
and O
plunged O
them O
into O
hot O
broth B-FOOD
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
. O

Besides O
serving O
as O
an O
inspiration O
to O
those O
of O
us O
who O
believe O
there O
is O
always O
time O
to O
eat O
, O
the O
chef O
's O
impromptu O
recipe O
is O
said O
to O
have O
given O
China B-LOC
its O
ancient O
and O
delicious O
hot B-FOOD
pot I-FOOD
tradition O
. O

Hot B-FOOD
pots I-FOOD
did O
not O
jump O
to O
Japan B-LOC
until O
shortly O
after O
World O
War O
II O
, O
when O
kelp B-FOOD
joined O
the O
broth B-FOOD
and O
the O
name O
was O
changed O
, O
onomatopoetically O
, O
to O
shabu B-FOOD
shabu I-FOOD
. O

But O
like O
hot B-FOOD
pots I-FOOD
in O
China B-LOC
, O
shabu B-FOOD
shabu I-FOOD
is O
a O
do O
- O
it O
- O
yourself O
bash O
where O
everybody O
around O
the O
table O
gets O
to O
dunk O
and O
swish O
the O
ingredients O
they O
like O
best O
. O

Chefs O
are O
not O
required O

Then O
on O
Delancey B-LOC
Street I-LOC
last O
fall O
, O
a O
new O
shabu B-FOOD
shabu I-FOOD
restaurant O
appeared O
where O
a O
chef O
standing O
behind O
a O
counter O
does O
all O
the O
cooking O
for O
no O
more O
than O
eight O
people O
at O
a O
time O
. O

Her O
name O
is O
Mako O
Okano O
. O

Out O
of O
a O
style O
of O
dining O
that O
has O
always O
been O
a O
big O
, O
informal O
free O
- O
for O
- O
all O
, O
she O
has O
built O
a O
quiet O
, O
refined O
, O
intimate O
spot O
called O
Shabushabu B-EST
Macoron I-EST
. O

Usually O
backed O
up O
by O
two O
other O
women O
, O
but O
occasionally O
working O
solo O
, O
Ms. O
Okano O
moves O
deliberately O
. O

She O
will O
gesture O
to O
the O
place O
mat O
, O
where O
the O
night O
's O
eight O
or O
10 O
courses O
are O
written O
out O
in O
Japanese O
, O
right O
to O
left O
, O
and O
then O
to O
another O
slip O
of O
paper O
with O
the O
same O
courses O
printed O
in O
English O
, O
again O
right O
to O
left O
. O

The O
price O
is O
$ O
128 O
. O

There O
are O
no O
choices O
to O
be O
made O
. O

Ms. O
Okano O
has O
modeled O
her O
restaurant O
on O
omakase B-TYPE
sushi I-TYPE
bars I-TYPE
, O
where O
the O
chef O
calls O
the O
tune O
. O

When O
I O
first O
arrived O
, O
I O
admit O
that O
I O
could O
n't O
see O
the O
point O
of O
having O
a O
chef O
do O
the O
cooking O
when O
I O
was O
perfectly O
able O
to O
do O
my O
own O
dunking O
and O
swishing O
. O

Ms. O
Okano O
quickly O
poured O
two O
or O
three O
mouthfuls O
of O
yeasty O
, O
warm O
unfiltered O
sake B-FOOD
into O
a O
little O
saucer O
. O

This O
arrived O
with O
a O
snack O
-- O
cured B-FOOD
salmon I-FOOD
and O
salmon B-FOOD
roe I-FOOD
seasoned O
with O
fermented B-FOOD
rice I-FOOD
-- O
that O
artfully O
underscored O
the O
sake B-FOOD
's O
flavor O
. O

Then O
she O
turned O
and O
quietly O
addressed O
a O
saute O
pan O
over O
the O
stove O
. O

When O
she O
turned O
around O
again O
she O
had O
cooked O
an O
omelet B-FOOD
and O
flicked O
it O
into O
a O
roll O
in O
the O
Japanese B-CUISINE
style O
. O

Served O
in O
a O
bowl O
of O
hot O
, O
clear O
dashi B-FOOD
, O
the O
egg B-FOOD
was O
as O
tender O
and O
delicate O
as O
its O
garnish O
, O
a O
tiny O
piece O
of O
mitsuba B-FOOD
stem I-FOOD
tied O
into O
a O
knot O
. O

Next O
she O
poached O
two O
pieces O
of O
abalone B-FOOD
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
each O
in O
abalone B-FOOD
broth I-FOOD
. O

One O
she O
dabbed O
with O
a O
small O
, O
intense O
blip O
of O
the O
Japanese B-CUISINE
spice B-FOOD
paste I-FOOD
yuzu B-FOOD
kosho I-FOOD
. O

Over O
the O
other O
she O
spooned O
a O
sauce B-FOOD
made O
from O
the O
abalone B-FOOD
's I-FOOD
liver O
. O

I O
ate O
them O
both O
, O
and O
was O
flooded O
first O
with O
pleasure O
then O
with O
embarrassment O
that O
I O
'd O
thought O
simmered O
food O
was O
n't O
worth O
a O
chef O
's O
time O
. O

By O
the O
time O
I O
'd O
eaten O
a O
small O
tongue O
of O
sea B-FOOD
urchin I-FOOD
combined O
with O
silky O
rags O
of O
yuba B-FOOD
still O
dripping O
with O
soy B-FOOD
milk I-FOOD
, O
I O
was O
on O
board O
for O
anything O
Ms. O
Okano O
wanted O
to O
cook O
. O

For O
some O
time O
the O
bubbles O
in O
an O
iron O
pot O
of O
dashi B-FOOD
set O
over O
a O
countertop O
burner O
had O
been O
getting O
bigger O
and O
faster O
. O

Thin O
strips O
of O
Wagyu B-FOOD
beef I-FOOD
, O
streaked O
with O
so O
much O
fat O
they O
looked O
like O
stained O
glass O
, O
were O
stretched O
out O
on O
black O
slate O
with O
pinkish O
bands O
of O
pork B-FOOD
belly I-FOOD
. O

Raw O
vegetables B-FOOD
-- O
cabbage B-FOOD
, O
lettuce B-FOOD
, O
enoki B-FOOD
and O
shiitake B-FOOD
mushrooms I-FOOD
, O
half O
a O
brussels B-FOOD
sprout I-FOOD
and O
a O
cherry B-FOOD
tomato I-FOOD
on O
a O
wooden O
spear O
-- O
waited O
on O
a O
nearby O
plate O
. O

Before O
I O
knew O
it O
she O
had O
cooked O
the O
first O
piece O
of O
beef B-FOOD
-- O
was O
it O
the O
A5 B-FOOD
from O
Miyazaki B-LOC
or O
the O
A4 B-FOOD
from O
Kagoshima B-LOC
? O

The O
flesh O
had O
twisted O
itself O
around O
, O
and O
now O
dusk O
- O
gray O
outer O
curls O
hid O
inner O
curves O
of O
faded O
pink O
. O

The O
flavors O
moved O
in O
rapid O
waves O
: O
first O
a O
few O
clinging O
, O
savory O
drops O
of O
dashi B-FOOD
, O
then O
some O
already O
- O
melted O
beef B-FOOD
fat I-FOOD
, O
followed O
by O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
lean O
meat B-FOOD
itself O
, O
sweet O
and O
refined O
. O

Finally O
came O
a O
second O
helping O
of O
fat B-FOOD
, O
freshly O
melted O
now O
. O

When O
Ms. O
Okano O
fished O
out O
a O
piece O
of O
beef B-FOOD
, O
she O
would O
suggest O
seasoning O
it O
with O
one O
or O
more O
of O
an O
almost O
comically O
large O
assortment O
of O
condiments B-FOOD
and O
purees B-FOOD
that O
she O
makes O
herself O
. O

She O
seemed O
to O
favor O
her O
ponzu B-FOOD
, O
and O
so O
do O
I O
; O
it O
's O
more O
radiant O
with O
yuzu B-FOOD
than O
any O
I O
've O
had O
before O
. O

I O
also O
liked O
the O
sweet B-FOOD
soy I-FOOD
once O
I O
learned O
to O
doctor O
it O
with O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
what O
Ms. O
Okano O
calls O
" O
gravy B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
, O
" O
a O
dark O
liquid O
that O
makes O
meat B-FOOD
taste O
meatier O
. O

Many O
dismal O
meals O
would O
be O
saved O
if O
I O
carried O
an O
eyedropper O
of O
gravy B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
around O
with O
me O
. O

Swabbing O
the O
pork B-FOOD
belly I-FOOD
in O
the O
sticky O
, O
thick O
sesame B-FOOD
paste I-FOOD
with O
toasted B-FOOD
sesame I-FOOD
seeds I-FOOD
produces O
an O
effect O
similar O
to O
, O
but O
more O
subtle O
than O
, O
the O
combination O
of O
peanut B-FOOD
butter I-FOOD
and O
bacon B-FOOD
. O

It O
's O
even O
better O
with O
a O
smear O
of O
salted B-FOOD
plum I-FOOD
, O
or O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
the O
yuzu B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
olive I-FOOD
oil O
sauce O
that O
seems O
to O
have O
jetted O
in O
from O
Italy B-LOC
. O

The O
vegetables B-FOOD
were O
spotless O
and O
fresh O
. O

A O
meal O
without O
them O
would O
be O
off O
kilter O
, O
perhaps O
to O
a O
degree O
that O
would O
cause O
grumbling O
from O
the O
digestive O
system O
, O
but O
on O
their O
own O
they O
are O
not O
a O
reason O
to O
go O
to O
Shabushabu B-EST
Macoron I-EST
. O

The O
chicken B-DISH
meatballs I-DISH
are O
, O
though O
. O

So O
are O
the O
green B-DISH
tea I-DISH
soba I-DISH
noodles I-DISH
that O
Ms. O
Okano O
somehow O
manages O
to O
cook O
in O
between O
everything O
else O
without O
seeming O
to O
leave O
the O
few O
square O
feet O
behind O
the O
counter O
. O

Soba B-FOOD
is O
not O

but O
it O
is O
something O
she O
has O
experience O
making O
from O
her O
time O
in O
the O
kitchen O
at O
Cocoron B-EST
, O
a O
soba B-TYPE
- O
ya O
across O
Delancey B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

When O
she O
began O
talking O
about O
her O
dream O
of O
opening O
what O
she O
hoped O
would O
be O
the O
world O
's O
first O
omakase B-TYPE

, O
Cocoron B-EST

When O
she O
came O
back O
from O
a O
dunk O
- O
and O
- O
swish O
tour O
of O
Japan B-LOC
, O
they O
signed O
on O
as O
her O
partners O
. O

At O
times O
, O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
Ms. O
Okano O
ca O
n't O
believe O
it O
all O
worked O
out O
. O

After O
she O
'd O
cooked O
me O
three O
nearly O
identical O
meals O
, O
I O
wondered O
if O
she O
'd O
still O
be O
as O
giddy O
a O
year O
from O
now O
. O

Will O
she O
be O
able O
to O
change O
the O
menu O
with O
the O
seasons O
to O
keep O
things O
interesting O
? O

Can O
she O
stash O
surprise O
ingredients O
below O
the O
counter O
for O
repeat O
customers O
, O
the O
way O
sushi B-FOOD
chefs O
do O
? O

None O
of O
these O
questions O
occurred O
to O
me O
the O
first O
two O
times O
I O
ate O
at O
her O
restaurant O
. O

I O
just O
sat O
there O
in O
something O
like O
a O
state O
of O
wonder O
while O
she O
cooked O
for O
me O
. O

This O
is O
, O
bizarrely O
, O
a O
rare O
experience O
at O
tasting B-TYPE
counters I-TYPE
, O
where O
chefs O
are O
often O
intent O
on O
intricacies O
of O
plating O
. O

The O
physical O
setting O
of O
Shabushabu B-EST
Macoron I-EST
strongly O
suggests O
a O
shoestring O
budget O
-- O
the O
paper O
towel O
roll O
in O
the O
restroom O
hangs O
from O
what O
may O
be O
an O
actual O
shoestring O
-- O
but O
sitting O
there O
while O
Ms. O
Okano O
stands O
a O
few O
inches O
away O
and O
makes O
your O
dinner O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
luxurious O
experiences O
this O

this O

unusually O

if O

you O

also O

why O
Legacy B-EST

seems O
eager O
to O
suggest O
that O
it O
has O
local O
roots O
-- O
so O
eager O
that O
it O
has O
essentially O
ginned O
up O
a O
history O
for O
itself O
that O
brings O
together O
sloppy O
research O
with O
a O
superficial O
tribute O
to O
black O

. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
combination O
that O
will O
appeal O
to O
everybody O
. O

Like O
the O

the O

run O
by O

the O

behind O
Pasquale B-EST

Charlie B-EST
Bird I-EST
. O

The O
menu O
, O
as O
it O
is O
in O
those O
two O
restaurants O
, O
is O
essentially O
Italian B-CUISINE
, O
but O
less O
rustic O
and O
more O
expensive O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
the O

charged O
more O
than O

much O
as O

for O
main O

( O

the O
ones O
at O
Pasquale B-EST

but O
not O
Charlie B-EST

, O
include O
service O
. O
) O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
for O
sure O
whether O
Ryan O
Hardy O
, O
the O
chef O
and O
one O
of O
the O
three O
partners O
, O
has O
upgraded O
to O
better O
purveyors O
, O
but O
I O
do O
know O
I O
was O
taken O
aback O
, O
often O
, O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
raw O
ingredients O
at O
Legacy B-EST
Records I-EST
. O

There O
was O
the O
raw B-FOOD
sea I-FOOD
scallop I-FOOD
, O
so O
intensely O
fresh O
that O
its O
slices O
clung O
together O
stickily O
; O
Mr. O
Hardy O
had O
dressed O
it O
with O
dots O
of O
yogurt B-FOOD
, O
tiny O
oval O
basil B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
, O
toasted B-FOOD
almonds I-FOOD
and O
tart O
little O
pink O
cells O
of O
finger B-FOOD
lime I-FOOD
. O

There O
was O
chilled O
Dungeness B-FOOD
crab I-FOOD
, O
a O
few O
pristine O
white O
chunks O
under O
sea B-FOOD
urchin I-FOOD
foam O
, O
to O
be O
spooned O
from O
a O
shot O
glass O
. O

And O
tiles O
of O
yellowfin B-FOOD
tuna I-FOOD
belly I-FOOD
, O
not O
as O
fatty O
as O
bluefin B-FOOD
but O
very O
rich O
all O
the O
same O
, O
under O
bits O
of O
salted B-FOOD
lemon I-FOOD
peel I-FOOD
and O
a O
splash O
of O
colatura B-FOOD
, O
the O
Italian B-CUISINE
fish B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
. O

Again O
with O
the O
main O
courses O
, O
I O
stopped O
and O
wondered O
: O
Where O
did O
Mr. O
Hardy O
find O
lamb B-FOOD
( O
with O
snap B-FOOD
peas I-FOOD
and O
smoked B-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
) O
that O
tasted O
as O
if O
it O
had O
never O
eaten O
anything O
but O
fresh O
herbs B-FOOD
? O

How O
did O
he O
find O
a O
rib B-FOOD
- O
eye O
that O
's O
so O
tender O
and O
deeply O
flavorful O
without O
being O
flabby O
? O

Mr. O
Hardy O
has O
been O
quick O
to O
make O
the O
most O
of O
what O
the O
market O
says O
is O
the O
first O
month O
of O
spring O
and O
the O
calendar O
says O
is O
the O
last O
. O

Creamy O
new O
- O
crop O
potatoes B-FOOD
deserve O
a O
little O
appreciation O
before O
they O
're O
sent O
off O
to O
root O
cellars O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Hardy O
built O
a O
fine O
appetizer O
around O
them O
with O
leggy O
broccoli B-FOOD
sprouts I-FOOD
and O
melting O
chunks O
of O
fresh O
mozzarella B-FOOD
spiked O
with O
anchovy B-FOOD
. O

Charred B-FOOD
snap I-FOOD
peas I-FOOD
made O
a O
tangy O
salad B-FOOD
together O
with O
ramps B-FOOD
in O
a O
peppery B-FOOD
buttermilk I-FOOD
dressing I-FOOD
. O

But O
sweet O
English B-FOOD
peas I-FOOD
were O
swallowed O
up O
by O
a O
too O
- O
sharp O
risotto B-FOOD
; O
seasoned O
with O
prosciutto B-FOOD
, O
the O
rice B-FOOD
took O
on O
more O
of O
the O
ham B-FOOD
's O
saltiness O
than O
its O
sweetness O
. O

Legacy B-EST
Records I-EST
does O
n't O
say O
anything O
particularly O
original O
, O
but O
it O
has O
a O
finesse O
that O
's O
new O
for O
this O
restaurant O
group O
. O

There O
's O
an O
exceptional O
plate O
of O
grilled B-DISH
pigeon I-DISH
, O
neatly O
carved O
and O
served O
with O
swooshes O
of O
nettle B-FOOD
puree I-FOOD
. O

It O
is O
at O
least O
as O
impressive O
as O
the O
dish O
that O
's O
becoming O
a O
breakout O
star O
for O
the O
restaurant O
: O
a O
duck B-DISH
breast I-DISH
, O
its O
skin O
rubbed O
with O
pepper B-FOOD
, O
chiles B-FOOD
, O
honey B-FOOD
and O
fennel B-FOOD
and O
then O
roasted O
until O
it O
has O
a O
deep O
, O
crusty O
bark O
that O
a O
Texas B-LOC
pitmaster O
would O
be O
proud O
of O
. O

Ordering O
wine B-FOOD
is O
an O
event O
in O
itself O
. O

Robert O
Bohr O
and O
Grant O
Reynolds O
, O
who O
are O
Mr. O
Hardy O
's O
partners O
and O
the O
resident O
wine B-FOOD
soothsayers O
, O
have O
seen O
to O
it O
that O
cultists O
can O
rub O
elbows O
with O
the O
Agraparts B-FOOD
, O
Raveneaus B-FOOD
and O
Gajas B-FOOD
, O
while O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
will O
still O
find O
a O
few O
bottles O
under O
$ O
100 O
from O
some O
of O
the O
most O
expensive O
arable O
land O
on O
earth O
. O

Oddly O
enough O
, O
the O
wine O
list O
makes O
less O
of O
an O
impression O
than O
the O
ones O
at O
Charlie B-EST
Bird I-EST
and O
Pasquale B-EST
Jones I-EST
, O
simply O
because O
you O
'd O
expect O
an O
ambitious O
cellar O
in O
a O
restaurant O
this O
expensive O
. O

Then O
again O
you O
might O
also O
expect O
a O
smart O
, O
artful O
dessert O
menu O
; O
if O
so O
, O
you O
're O
out O
of O
luck O
. O

There O
is O
ice B-DISH
cream I-DISH
with I-DISH
strawberries I-DISH
, O
a O
dark B-DISH
chocolate I-DISH
meringue I-DISH
and O
a O
selection O
of O
gelati B-FOOD
, O
served O
in O
a O
cone B-FOOD
; O
all O
perfectly O
pleasant O
, O
but O
there O
's O
more O
wit O
and O
creativity O
in O
the O
excellent O
cocktail B-FOOD
roster O
administered O
by O
Jeff O
Bell O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
there O
are O
people O
who O
are O
reluctant O
to O
go O
to O
Legacy B-EST
Records I-EST
because O
of O
how O
relentlessly O
noisy O
this O
team O

restaurants O
are O
. O

But O
they O
seem O
to O
have O
sent O
the O
acoustics O
to O
obedience O
school O
, O
because O
all O
the O
sound O

do O
what O
they O
're O
told O
: O
Conversations O
stay O
at O
their O
own O

while O
the O

stays O
in O

look O

out O

The O

on O
the O

near O
the O
top O
of O
the O

within O

of O
the O

Upstairs O
was O
a O

angular O

shadowy O
dining O
room O
with O
a O
few O

under O
a O

it O

where O
oxtails B-FOOD

goat B-FOOD
curry I-FOOD

the O

three O

that O
were O
almost O

it O

that O
about O
a O

of O
the O

limitations O
on O
capacity O
were O
obvious O
and O
because O
whatever O
was O
finished O
was O
bound O
to O
be O
both O
nuanced O
and O
powerful O
. O

The O
whole O
operation O
was O
one O
of O
those O
precarious O
marvels O
of O
adaptive O
survival O
, O
like O
a O
pine O
growing O
from O
a O
crack O
in O
the O
side O
of O
a O
cliff O
. O

So O
the O
outlook O
was O
grim O
when O
news O
came O
two O
summers O
ago O
that O
the O
structures O
housing O
the O
Islands B-EST
and O
another O
business O
were O
being O
torn O
down O
so O
a O
new O
apartment O
building O
could O
be O
constructed O
. O

This O
neighborhood O
and O
the O
ones O
to O
the O
south O
between O
Flatbush B-LOC
and O
Ralph B-LOC
Avenues I-LOC
owe O
much O
of O
their O
character O
to O
black- O
and O
immigrant O
- O
owned O
businesses O
, O
including O
a O
large O
swath O
of O
Caribbean B-CUISINE
restaurants O
such O
as O
the O
Islands B-EST
. O

With O
developers O
sniffing O
at O
this O
part O
of O
Brooklyn B-LOC
, O
many O
of O
them O
are O
at O
risk O
. O

Marilyn O
Reid O
, O
who O
owns O
the O
Islands B-EST
with O
Shuon O
Letchford O
, O
had O
other O
ideas O
. O

She O
had O
had O
other O
ideas O
since O
2001 O
, O
when O
she O
opened O
the O
restaurant O
. O

" O
We O
were O
always O
looking O
because O
we O
had O
outgrown O
it O
by O
the O
second O
day O
, O
" O
she O
said O
in O
a O
phone O
interview O
. O

" O
We O
knew O
. O
" O

Before O
closing O
the O
original O
space O
in O
March O
2017 O
, O
she O
and O
Ms. O
Letchford O
had O
found O
a O
much O
bigger O
one O
downhill O
on O
Washington B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
. O

Preparing O
it O
took O
a O
few O
months O
more O
than O
she O
had O
hoped O
, O
but O
the O
second O
incarnation O
of O
the O
Islands B-EST
has O
been O
up O
and O
running O
since O
January O
. O

[ O
Read O
about O
some O
of O
the O
best O
new O
restaurants O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
( O
for O
now O
) O
. O
] O

The O
new O
kitchen O
has O
two O
stoves O
and O
10 O
burners O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
what O
's O
available O
when O
I O
've O
gone O
has O
always O
been O
several O
dishes O
shy O
of O
the O
complete O
menu O
. O

The O
stewed B-DISH
okra I-DISH
with I-DISH
cod I-DISH
is O
especially O
hard O
to O
pin O
down O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
comfort O
of O
the O
bigger O
dining O
room O
and O
the O
table O
service O
, O
an O
impossibility O
in O
the O
first O
space O
, O
have O
encouraged O
me O
to O
branch O
out O
beyond O
my O
usual O
favorites O
. O

The O
Islands B-EST
is O
best O
known O
for O
long O
- O
simmered O
stews B-FOOD
but O
the O
kitchen O
also O
knows O
a O
thing O
or O
two O
about O
frying O
. O

The O
flattened O
fritters B-FOOD
of I-FOOD
salt I-FOOD
cod I-FOOD
seasoned O
with O
fresh O
hot B-FOOD
chiles I-FOOD
, O
known O
as O
stamp B-DISH
and I-DISH
go I-DISH
, O
were O
crunchy O
and O
golden O
. O

Some O
Caribbean B-CUISINE
cooks O
deep O
- O
fry O
fish B-FOOD
escovitch I-FOOD
to O
oblivion O
, O
on O
the O
theory O
that O
spicy B-FOOD
vinegar I-FOOD
heals O
all O
wounds O
. O

The O
escovitch B-FOOD
I O
had O
at O
the O
Islands B-EST
was O
a O
whole O
red B-FOOD
snapper I-FOOD
, O
obviously O
fresh O
and O
fried O
just O
until O
firm O
. O

The O
vinegar B-FOOD
dressing I-FOOD
, O
meanwhile O
, O
was O
seasoned O
with O
not O
just O
hot B-FOOD
chiles I-FOOD
but O
pickled B-FOOD
bell I-FOOD
peppers I-FOOD
, O
carrots B-FOOD
and O
cucumbers B-FOOD
, O
making O
this O
escovitch B-FOOD
more O
interesting O
than O
usual O
. O

From O
the O
old O
days O
, O
I O
knew O
the O
curried B-DISH
goat I-DISH
would O
be O
very O
tender O
and O
richly O
seasoned O
, O
although O
like O
most O
of O
the O
cooking O
at O
the O
Islands B-EST
, O
it O
was O
never O
scalp O
- O
piercingly O
spicy O
. O

Now O
I O
've O
found O
a O
new O
standby O
in O
the O
curried B-FOOD
vegetables I-FOOD
-- O
a O
very O
different O
thing O
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
the O
golden B-FOOD
raisins I-FOOD
, O
turmeric B-FOOD
and O
allspice B-FOOD
may O
do O
even O
more O
for O
cabbage B-FOOD
and O
carrots B-FOOD
than O
they O
do O
for O
goat B-FOOD
meat I-FOOD
. O

Barbecue B-DISH
chicken I-DISH
was O
ordered O
in O
a O
rush O
verging O
on O
panic O
because O
whatever O
I O
'd O
first O
wanted O
was O
n't O
ready O
yet O
. O

The O
sauce B-FOOD
is O
nothing O
like O
the O
ketchup B-FOOD
- O
based O
sludge O
I O
'd O
imagined O
. O

Made O
with O
raisins B-FOOD
and O
allspice B-FOOD
, O
it O
tastes O
more O
like O
a O
glaze B-FOOD
for O
a O
holiday B-FOOD
ham I-FOOD
, O
and O
it O
's O
lovely O
. O

I O
prefer O
it O
to O
the O
jerk B-DISH
chicken I-DISH
, O
which O
will O
sound O
like O
heresy O
to O
some O
customers O
. O

Like O
barbecue B-FOOD
, O
jerk B-FOOD
can O
describe O
either O
a O
sauce O
or O
a O
process O
, O
and O
the O
process O
needs O
to O
involve O
wood O
smoke O
. O

The O
Islands B-EST
bakes O
its O
jerk B-DISH
chicken I-DISH
in O
the O
oven O
, O
and O
while O
I O
like O
its O
sauce B-FOOD
, O
when O
I O
want O
jerk B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
I O
will O
cross O
Eastern B-LOC
Parkway I-LOC
and O
keep O
the O
windows O
down O
until O
I O
smell O
burning O
allspice B-FOOD
logs O
. O

But O
I O
have O
no O
quarrel O
with O
the O
jerk B-DISH
shrimp I-DISH
or O
leg B-DISH
of I-DISH
lamb I-DISH
at O
the O
Islands B-EST
-- O
there O
's O
no O
place O
to O
get O
an O
allspice B-FOOD
- O
smoked O
version O
of O
either O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O
. O

The O
lamb B-FOOD
is O
especially O
alluring O
, O
stuffed O
with O
jerk B-FOOD
spices I-FOOD
and O
slowly O
roasted O
until O
its O
outer O
crust O
falls O
, O
upon O
slicing O
, O
into O
a O
dark O
rubble O
that O
in O
New B-LOC
Orleans I-LOC
would O
be O
called O
debris O
. O

Rice B-DISH
and I-DISH
peas I-DISH
, O
fried B-DISH
plantains I-DISH
and O
stewed B-DISH
cabbage I-DISH
, O
slippery O
with O
coconut B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
, O
are O
all O
mandatory O
in O
my O
book O
. O

Others O
insist O
on O
baked B-DISH
macaroni I-DISH
and I-DISH
cheese I-DISH
, O
served O
in O
a O
brick O
the O
size O
of O
a O
pound O
of O
butter B-FOOD
. O

When O
I O
taste O
the O
bread B-FOOD
crumbs I-FOOD
on O
top O
, O
and O
wonder O
if O
they O
've O
been O
seasoned O
with O
dried B-FOOD
onions I-FOOD
, O
I O
think O
those O
people O
may O
have O
a O
point O
. O

All O
of O
this O
food O
is O
brought O
to O
the O
table O
on O
oval O
platters O
that O
could O
hold O
a O
small O
Thanksgiving B-FOOD
turkey I-FOOD
. O

Since O
opening O
in O
January O
, O
the O
new O
dining O
room O
has O
been O
embellished O
bit O
by O
bit O

The O
walls O
are O
painted O
in O
watermelon O

aquamarine O
. O

Small O
hurricane O
lamps O
decorate O
the O
tables O
. O

A O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
, O
plaid O
cloth O
napkins O
made O
their O
debut O
in O
the O
middle O
of O

Menus O

which O
used O
to O

The O

A O

In O
the O

is O
an O
excellent O
limeade B-DISH

with O
demerara B-FOOD
sugar I-FOOD
and O
a O
dark O
purple O

fruity O
sorrel B-DISH

which O
can O
give O
the O
impression O
it O

lightly O
spiked O

Credit O
for O
the O
food O
at O
the O
Islands B-EST
is O
shared O
. O

There O
are O
two O
chefs O
, O
Delroy O
Henry O
and O
Ronald O
Porter O

Most O
of O
the O
recipes O
, O
though O
, O
are O
Ms. O
Letchford O

, O
and O
she O
does O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
cooking O

Like O
Ms. O

, O
all O
of O
them O
were O
raised O
in O
Jamaica B-LOC
before O
moving O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
but O
only O
Ms. O
Letchford O
did O
any O
professional O

there O

Ms. O
Reid O
is O
often O
in O
the O
kitchen O
too O
. O

" O
I O
do O
the O
light O

, O
" O
she O
said O
. O

" O
I O
tend O
to O
stay O
with O
salads B-FOOD
, O
seafood B-FOOD
. O
" O

Is O
the O
food O
as O
good O
as O
before O
? O

I O
used O
to O
be O
impressed O
that O
anything O
at O
all O
could O
be O
cooked O
at O
the O
old O
Islands B-EST
. O

That O
so O
much O
of O
it O
was O
actively O
delicious O
seemed O
like O
a O
miracle O
. O

It O
's O
less O
astonishing O
now O
that O
the O
kitchen O
has O
10 O
burners O
and O
room O
to O
turn O
around O
. O

But O
I O
suspect O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
's O
changed O
is O
me O
. O

And O
when O
I O
'm O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
something O
miraculous O
, O
I O
'll O
just O
remind O
myself O
that O
the O
Islands B-EST
is O
still O
in O
business O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
stop O
gentrification O
, O
but O
sometimes O
you O
can O
fool O
it O
while O
it O
's O
looking O
the O
other O
way O

Remember O
sukiyaki B-FOOD
? O

The O
details O
were O
hazy O
in O
my O
mind O
until O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
, O
when O
a O
woman O
sheathed O
in O
a O
kimono O
carried O
a O
pot O
of O
it O
to O
my O
table O
at O
Restaurant B-EST
Nippon I-EST
on O
East B-LOC
52nd I-LOC

There O
it O
was O
: O
the O
onions B-FOOD
, O
shiitake B-FOOD
caps I-FOOD
, O
bok B-FOOD
choi I-FOOD
stems I-FOOD
, O
tofu B-FOOD
blocks O
and O
the O
frizzy O
mop O
of O
noodles B-FOOD
under O
a O
cloud O
of O
steam O
. O

The O
thin O
slices O
of O
beef B-FOOD
going O
from O
red O
to O
pale O
pink O
. O

The O
hot O
broth B-FOOD
that O
is O
based O
on O
soy B-FOOD
and O
mirin B-FOOD

but O
that O
strangely O
, O
magically O
tastes O
like O
French B-FOOD

The O
raw B-FOOD
egg I-FOOD
that O
, O
thanks O
to O
some O
long O

would O
have O
been O
unnecessary O
if O
I O
'd O
made O
myself O
a O
regular O
at O
Nippon B-EST
years O
ago O
. O

The O
restaurant O
opened O
in O
August O
1963 O

a O
few O
doors O
west O

using O

The O

in O

made O
its O
first O
regular O

outside O
Japan B-LOC
at O
Nippon B-EST
in O
1989 O
, O
when O
the O

yearslong O
campaign O

the O

allow O
importation O

has O
been O
the O

As O
sashimi B-FOOD

fanned O
out O
in O

it O
is O
lean O

very O

slightly O

Nippon B-EST
sends O
it O
out O
with O
chives B-FOOD

a O
spicy B-FOOD

which O
complement O
its O
quiet O

what O

called O
a O

If O

, O
among O
other O
things O
. O

Many O
firsts O
have O
been O
claimed O
by O
or O
on O
behalf O
of O
Nippon B-EST
. O

Some O
of O
them O
may O
be O
true O
. O

Did O
it O
have O
the O
first O
sushi B-TYPE
counter I-TYPE
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
? O

I O
am O
not O
convinced O
. O

In O
a O
1963 O
Times O
review O
, O
Craig O
Claiborne O
wrote O
that O
Nippon B-EST
had O
a O
tempura B-TYPE
counter I-TYPE
where O
sushi B-FOOD
, O
" O
the O
traditional O
service O
of O
raw B-FOOD
fish I-FOOD
, O
" O
was O
also O
available O
. O

Today O
the O
sushi B-FOOD
is O
respectable O
, O
if O
not O
on O
its O
own O
a O
reason O
to O
visit O
. O

Is O
it O
a O
fact O
that O
no O
other O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
restaurant O
was O
making O
soba B-DISH
noodles I-DISH
in O
1988 O
, O
when O
Nippon B-EST
began O
to O
do O
so O
? O

Certainly O
few O
places O
have O
gone O
to O
the O
same O
lengths O
in O
pursuit O
of O
soba B-FOOD
as O
Nippon B-EST
, O
which O
imported O
not O
just O
buckwheat B-FOOD
seeds I-FOOD
but O
also O
a O
buckwheat B-FOOD
farmer O
from O
Japan B-LOC
, O
and O
planted O
both O
in O
a O
field O
outside O
Montreal B-LOC
. O

( O
For O
years O
the O
farm O
also O
supplied O
a O
sister O
restaurant O
, O
Soba B-EST
Nippon I-EST
, O
now O
closed O
. O
) O

Restaurant B-EST
Nippon I-EST
's O
soba B-DISH
noodles I-DISH
are O
nutty O
, O
bouncy O
, O
springy O
, O
slightly O
rough O
and O
very O
good O
. O

I O
like O
them O
chilled O
, O
dunked O
in O
ponzu B-FOOD
. O

Against O
my O
better O
judgment O
I O
even O
like O
the O
odd O
, O
Americanized B-CUISINE
soba B-FOOD
salads I-FOOD
, O
with O
a O
pile O
of O
noodles B-FOOD
and O
meat B-FOOD
or O
tofu B-FOOD
on O
a O
platter O
with O
a O
fistful O
of O
lettuce B-FOOD
. O

The O
custom O
- O
farmed O
buckwheat B-FOOD
also O
goes O
into O
an O
astoundingly O
good O
thing O
called O
soba B-DISH
miso I-DISH
that O
comes O
smeared O
on O
a O
small O
wooden O
paddle O
. O

A O
black O
sludge O
of O
fermented B-FOOD
buckwheat I-FOOD
studded O
with O
buckwheat B-FOOD
kernels I-FOOD
, O
it O
looks O
like O
brownie B-FOOD
batter I-FOOD
and O
tastes O
a O
little O
like O
chocolate B-FOOD
, O
too O
, O
as O
well O
as O
roasted B-FOOD
nuts I-FOOD
and O
espresso B-FOOD
and O
cooked O
mushrooms B-FOOD
. O

Whether O
negimaki B-FOOD
was O
invented O
at O
Nippon B-EST
or O
simply O
made O
its O
first O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
appearance O
there O
, O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
see O
why O
tough O
beef B-FOOD
wrapped O
around O
undercooked O
scallions B-FOOD
captured O
America B-LOC
's O
imagination O
. O

More O
intriguing O
is O
another O
original O
, O
beef B-DISH
oroshi I-DISH
, O
essentially O
shabu B-FOOD
shabu I-FOOD
except O
that O
it O
is O
cooked O
offstage O
and O
you O
get O
nothing O
but O
meat B-FOOD
and O
broth B-FOOD
with O
some O
spicy O
grated O
daikon B-FOOD
. O

This O
is O
also O
the O
birthplace O
of O
agedashi B-DISH
mozzarella I-DISH
. O

If O
you O
have O
ever O
wondered O
what O
fried B-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
in O
dashi B-FOOD
would O
taste O
like O
, O
you O
will O
find O
the O
answer O
here O
. O

The O
backbone O
of O
the O
menu O
, O
though O
, O
is O
traditional O
Japanese B-CUISINE
food O
, O
nearly O
all O
of O
it O
good O
and O
some O
of O
it O
better O
than O
that O
. O

There O
is O
fluke B-FOOD
for O
those O
who O
wo O
n't O
pay O
up O
for O
fugu B-FOOD
, O
and O
it O
is O
just O
what O
you O
'd O
want O
it O
to O
be O
. O

Broiled B-DISH
eel I-DISH
over I-DISH
rice I-DISH
makes O
a O
wonderfully O
soothing O
meal O
. O

The O
kamonabe B-DISH
is O
a O
duck B-FOOD
hot I-FOOD
pot I-FOOD
cooked O
over O
a O
burner O
set O
on O
the O
table O
. O

The O
duck B-FOOD
may O
not O
be O
entirely O
tender O
, O
but O
it O
is O
flavorful O
. O

The O
broth B-FOOD
is O
a O
symphony O
. O

For O
scale O
, O
theatricality O
and O
deeply O
reassuring O
flavor O
, O
its O
only O
rival O
is O
the O
sukiyaki B-DISH
, O
but O
the O
kamonabe B-DISH
comes O
with O
a O
dividend O
: O
a O
bowl O
of O
rice B-FOOD
cooked O
in O
the O
leftover O
broth B-FOOD

a O
second O

Riad O
Nasr O
and O
Lee O
Hanson O
named O
their O
new O
restaurant O
after O
a O
David O
Johansen O
song O
from O
1978 O
, O
" O
Frenchette B-EST
. O
" O

The O
first O
line O
is O
, O
" O
You O
call O
that O
love O
in O
French O
, O
but O
it O
's O
just O
Frenchette O
, O
" O
and O
later O
when O
he O
rhymes O
that O
with O
" O
naturalette O
" O
and O
" O
leatherette O
" O
you O
know O
the O
suffix O
is O
n't O
diminutive O
, O
it O
's O
dismissive O
. O

The O
song O
is O
about O
what O
you O
do O
once O
you O
figure O
out O
that O
you O
're O
not O
going O
to O
get O
the O
real O
thing O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Johansen O
's O
answer O
is O
simple O
enough O
. O

" O
Let O
's O
just O
dance O
, O
" O
he O
sings O

Never O
mind O

it O

Since O
1997 O

them O
as O
the O
opening O

at O
Balthazar B-EST

a O

out O

their O
first O
without O
Mr. O
McNally O
, O
takes O
some O
liberties O
with O
the O
formula O

not O
enough O
to O
get O
them O
recognized O
as O
visionaries O
on O

Frenchette B-EST

: O
Never O

The O
restaurant O
is O
divided O
into O
two O
chambers O

In O
front O
and O
on O
display O
to O
the O
street O

a O
lounge O
with O

long O

If O

one O
, O
as O
many O
people O
are O
on O
any O
given O
night O
, O
it O
's O
purgatorial O
. O

The O
dining O
room O
is O
in O
back O
, O
behind O
a O
pair O
of O
arches O
and O
up O
a O
step O
so O
slight O
that O
its O
only O
conceivable O
purpose O
is O
to O
raise O
the O
insurance O
premiums O

every O
time O
I O
approached O
it O
a O
worried O
server O
materialized O
to O
tell O
me O
to O
look O
out O

The O
small O
tables O
are O
too O
small O
and O

big O
ones O
, O
encircled O
by O
red O

leather O

you O
enough O
space O
to O

out O
a O
map O
while O
you O
eat O
. O

The O
room O
is O
grandly O
scaled O
and O
conspicuously O
underdesigned O
, O
a O
simplification O
of O
the O
brasserie B-TYPE
archetype O
that O
does O
n't O
try O
to O
reproduce O
every O
chipped O
tile O
and O

It O

a O

outgrown O
illusions O

half O
the O

New B-LOC

by O
the O

been O
asked O
how O
to O
get O
a O
reservation O
at O
Frenchette B-EST
at O
an O
hour O
when O
an O
adult O
might O
reasonably O
be O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
dinner O

Even O

In O
the O

the O
menu O
rambles O
. O

It O
goes O
on O
too O
long O
; O
not O
everything O
on O
it O
is O
worth O
rambling O
about O
. O

But O
once O
you O
sort O
it O
out O
, O
it O
's O
full O
of O
dishes O
worth O
planning O
a O
night O
around O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
do O
n't O
look O
wildly O
impressive O
unless O
you O
know O
how O
they O
're O
made O
. O

For O
each O
order O
of O
brouillade B-DISH
, O
a O
pan O
of O
eggs B-FOOD
has O
to O
be O
stirred O
constantly O
over O
a O
small O
flame O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
until O
they O
look O
like O

( O
There O
's O
a O
reason O
you O
do O
n't O
see O
brouillade B-FOOD

many O
menus O

Dropped O
on O
top O
are O
a O
few O
excellent O
snails B-FOOD
in O
parsley B-FOOD
and O
garlic B-FOOD
, O
a O
buttery O
garnish O
for O
very O
buttery O
scrambled B-FOOD
eggs I-FOOD

Calf B-DISH
's I-DISH
liver O
was O
sweet O
and O
custardy O
, O
the O
goal O
in O
cooking O
it O
, O
and O
one O
that O
's O
not O
often O
reached O

Sweetbreads B-DISH
with O
creamy O
white O
insides O
were O
fried O
to O
a O
pale O
, O
crinkled O
gold O
, O
then O
served O
with O
a O
brown O
, O
French B-TYPE
, O
lovely O
and O
anachronistic O
sauce B-FOOD
made O
from O
veal B-FOOD
jus I-FOOD
and O
crayfish B-FOOD
. O

Lobster B-FOOD
was O
roasted O
on O
a O
rotisserie O
, O
sending O
some O
of O
the O
shell O
's O
flavor O
into O
the O
meat B-FOOD
, O
which O
was O
then O
given O
a O
very O
luxurious O
bath O
in O
curry B-FOOD
butter I-FOOD
. O

The O
entire O
roast B-DISH
chicken I-DISH
is O
juicy O
without O
tasting O
of O
brine O
, O
a O
rare O
thing O
these O
days O
. O

Hidden O
under O
the O
drumsticks B-FOOD
and O
thighs B-FOOD
are O
rafts O
of O
baguette B-FOOD
that O
sat O
under O
the O
rotisserie O
, O
imbibing O
every O
drop O
that O
fell O
from O
the O
bird O
. O

Some O
diners O
might O
say O
bread B-FOOD
wet O
with O
drippings B-FOOD
is O
too O
homespun O
for O
a O
dish O
that O
costs O
$ O
68 O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
're O
talking O
about O
. O

The O
menu O
is O
full O
of O
things O
that O
take O
years O
of O
practice O
to O
get O
right O
. O

Duck B-DISH
breast I-DISH
with O
a O
side O
of O
fries B-FOOD
sounds O
ridiculously O
simple O
, O
but O
look O
at O
the O
crackle O
on O
that O
duck B-FOOD
skin I-FOOD
, O
and O
listen O
to O
that O
echoing O
crunch O
on O
the O
fries B-FOOD

If O
these O
chefs O
learned O
anything O
from O
Mr. O
McNally O
, O
it O
's O
that O
people O
will O
overlook O
many O
lapses O
if O
you O
feed O
them O
great O
French B-FOOD
fries I-FOOD
. O

At O
Frenchette B-EST
, O
they O
overlook O
the O
peculiar O
steak O
knife O
brought O
out O
with O
the O
duck B-FOOD
; O
its O
sharp O
side O
is O
straight O
and O
its O
dull O
side O
is O
curved O
, O
and O
everybody O
who O
picks O
one O
up O
makes O
a O
joke O
about O
slicing O
open O
a O
finger O
. O

That O
would O
be O
one O
way O
to O
turn O
tables O
faster O
, O
but O
I O
never O
saw O
any O
casualties O

Not O
every O

who O
has O
become O
infatuated O
with O
these O
labels O
knows O
where O
to O
find O
the O
good O

he O
does O

This O
means O
, O

that O
you O
will O
probably O
not O
end O
up O
drinking O
what O
you O

There O

even O

You O

Mr. O

Until O
the O
new O
Una B-EST
Pizza I-EST
Napoletana I-EST
came O
along O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
it O
was O
possible O
for O
a O
restaurant O
to O
fight O
itself O
to O
a O
draw O
. O

In O
name O
at O
least O
, O
this O
is O
the O
fourth O
incarnation O
of O
the O
pizzeria B-TYPE
that O
Anthony O
Mangieri O
founded O
in O
1996 O
in O
Point B-LOC
Pleasant I-LOC
Beach I-LOC
, I-LOC
N.J. O

He O
has O
never O
run O
more O
than O
one O
Una B-EST
Pizza I-EST
Napoletana I-EST
at O
a O
time O
; O
each O
time O
he O
moves O
to O
a O
new O
location O
, O
he O
closes O
the O
old O
one O
. O

In O
the O
East B-LOC
Village I-LOC
( O
2004 O
- O
9 O
) O
and O
San B-LOC
Francisco I-LOC
( O
2010 O
- O
17 O
) O
, O
he O
essentially O
stuck O
to O
the O
routine O
he O
had O
established O
in O
New B-LOC
Jersey I-LOC
. O

At O
the O
two O
- O
month O
- O
old O
location O
on O
the O
Lower B-LOC
East I-LOC
Side I-LOC
, O
though O
, O
he O
is O
in O
business O
with O
two O
chefs O
, O
Jeremiah O
Stone O
and O
Fabian O
von O
Hauske O
Valtierra O
, O
whose O
sensibilities O
are O
wildly O
different O
from O
his O
own O
. O

Their O
two O
other O
restaurants O
, O
Wildair B-EST
and O
Contra B-EST
, O
are O
very O
contemporary O
and O
European B-CUISINE
in O
outlook O
. O

A O
meal O
at O
either O
one O
makes O
it O
obvious O
that O
Mr. O
Stone O
and O
Mr. O
von O
Hauske O
have O
carefully O
studied O
Copenhagen B-LOC
's O
foremost O
exponents O
of O
fermentation O
and O
foraging O
. O

Nothing O
about O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
's O
rigorously O
traditional O
pizza B-FOOD
indicates O
that O
he O
could O
find O
Copenhagen B-LOC
on O
a O
map O
. O

The O
three O
of O
them O
do O
have O
common O
traits O
. O

They O
take O
their O
cooking O
extremely O
seriously O
, O
favor O
simplicity O
and O
are O
n't O
interested O
in O
easy O
ways O
out O
. O

So O
their O
collaboration O
-- O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
is O
the O
pizza B-FOOD
guy O
, O
of O
course O
, O
while O
his O
new O
partners O
handle O
appetizers O
, O
desserts O
and O
drinks O
-- O
might O
not O
be O
doomed O
, O
but O
it O
is O
n't O
exactly O
off O
to O
a O
promising O
start O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
n't O
the O
common O
one O
of O
strengths O
in O
one O
area O
undermined O
by O
bad O
performance O
in O
others O
. O

Una B-EST
Pizza I-EST
Napoletana I-EST
is O
almost O
all O
strengths O
, O
but O
they O
're O
at O
war O
with O
one O
another O
. O

Mr. O
Mangieri O
is O
a O
purist O
's O
purist O
. O

His O
dough B-FOOD
runs O
on O
wild B-FOOD
yeast I-FOOD
. O

For O
each O
batch O
, O
he O
mixes O
a O
lump O
of O
starter B-FOOD
into O
Sicilian B-FOOD
sea I-FOOD
salt I-FOOD
, O
finely O
ground O
Italian B-FOOD
flour I-FOOD
and O
water B-FOOD
. O

With O
this O
he O
makes O
a O
crust B-FOOD
that O
is O
delicious O
on O
its O
own O
, O
a O
minimum O
requirement O
for O
great O
pizza B-FOOD
. O

He O
makes O
pies B-FOOD
in O
only O
one O
size O
, O
a O
wheel O
about O
12 O
inches O
across O
. O

There O
are O
five O
on O
the O
menu O
most O
nights O
. O

None O
are O
topped O
with O
more O
than O
four O
ingredients O
, O
or O
six O
if O
you O
count O
oil B-FOOD
and O
salt B-FOOD
. O

On O
Friday O
and O
Saturday O
nights O
a O
sixth O
, O
more O
complicated O
pizza B-FOOD
is O
offered O
. O

Requests O
for O
substitutions O
or O
added O
toppings O
are O
not O
entertained O
on O
any O
night O
. O

There O
is O
no O
point O
asking O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
to O
put O
pepperoni B-FOOD
on O
a O
margherita B-FOOD
or O
Buffalo B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
and O
blue B-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
on O
a O
marinara B-FOOD
. O

You O
would O
have O
better O
luck O
persuading O
the O
driver O
of O
the O
M5 O
bus O
to O
pop O
a O
wheelie O
on O
Fifth B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
. O

The O
pies B-FOOD
are O
at O
least O
as O
extraordinary O
as O
the O
ones O
he O
used O
to O
make O
in O
the O
East B-LOC
Village I-LOC
. O

They O
may O
be O
better O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
remember O
the O
imported O
buffalo B-FOOD
mozzarella I-FOOD
's O
giving O
the O
pies B-FOOD
the O
flavor O
of O
melted O
cultured B-FOOD
butter I-FOOD
back O
then O
, O
the O
way O
it O
does O
now O
. O

And O
did O
the O
tomato B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
-- O
pulp B-FOOD
, O
really O
-- O
always O
have O
the O
same O
natural O
, O
sun O
- O
ripened O
sweetness O
? O

Especially O
on O
the O
marinara B-FOOD
, O
unobscured O
by O
cheese B-FOOD
and O
seasoned O
only O
with O
dried B-FOOD
oregano I-FOOD
, O
fresh O
basil B-FOOD
and O
raw O
garlic B-FOOD
, O
it O
's O
almost O
hypnotic O
. O

The O
Concetta B-DISH
pie I-DISH
, O
which O
has O
four O
varieties O
of O
tomato B-FOOD
treated O
four O
separate O
ways O
, O
probably O
would O
have O
been O
beyond O
his O
abilities O
as O
a O
chef O
in O
the O
Jersey B-LOC
Shore I-LOC
days O
. O

He O
makes O
it O
only O
on O
Fridays O
, O
which O
is O
too O
bad O
, O
because O
it O
's O
great O
. O

The O
everyday O
pie B-FOOD
called O
the O
Filetti B-DISH
, O
made O
with O
buffalo B-FOOD
mozzarella I-FOOD
and O
ripe O
red O
cherry B-FOOD
tomatoes I-FOOD
, O
manages O
to O
be O
surprising O
while O
sticking O
to O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
's O
strict O
principles O
. O

It O
's O
a O
personal O
creed O
that O
achieves O
transcendence O
-- O
his O
" O
My O
Way O
, O
" O
to O
put O
it O
in O
New B-LOC
Jersey I-LOC
terms O
. O

I O
ate O
one O
non O
- O
transcendent O
pie B-FOOD
at O
the O
new O
Una B-EST
Pizza I-EST
Napoletana I-EST
, O
a O
Bianco B-DISH
, O
which O
is O
topped O
with O
buffalo B-FOOD
mozzarella I-FOOD
, O
raw O
garlic B-FOOD
and O
basil B-FOOD
. O

It O
was O
excellent O
the O
next O
time O
I O
had O
it O
, O
and O
I O
immediately O
knew O
what O
had O
been O
missing O
: O
salt B-FOOD
. O

All O
the O
pies B-FOOD
are O
$ O
25 O
. O

That O
is O
a O
lot O
for O
pizza B-FOOD
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
it O
is O
only O
about O
$ O
2.50 O
more O
than O
what O
Mr. O
Mangieri O
charged O
when O
he O
first O
came O
to O
Manhattan B-LOC
in O
2004 O
, O
once O
you O
adjust O
for O
inflation O
. O

Then O
again O
, O
people O
said O
he O
charged O
a O
lot O
for O
pizza B-FOOD
in O
2004 O
. O

Mr. O
Mangieri O
and O
his O
wood O
- O
fueled O
oven O
are O
located O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
dining O
room O
, O
enclosed O
by O
glass O
on O
three O
sides O
. O

No O
doubt O
this O
helps O
keep O
the O
wood O
fire O
from O
wilting O
the O
customers O
like O
basil B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
, O
but O
it O
's O
hard O
not O
to O
see O
it O
as O
a O
metaphor O
for O
the O
restaurant O
. O

Mr. O
Mangieri O
's O
pizzas B-FOOD
leave O
the O
glass O
box O
, O
but O
his O
sensibility O
does O
n't O
. O

Mr. O
Stone O
and O
Mr. O
von O
Hauske O
have O
put O
their O
own O
point O
of O
view O
on O
everything O
else O
, O
and O
it O
's O
not O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
a O
pizzeria B-TYPE
. O

Everybody O
knows O
how O
to O
eat O
in O
a O
pizzeria B-TYPE
; O
most O
of O
us O
have O
been O
doing O
it O
since O
we O
were O
kids O
. O

The O
choices O
are O
few O
and O
relatively O
predictable O
. O

Even O
when O
the O
pizzas B-FOOD
are O
topped O
with O
weird O
stuff O
, O
you O
basically O
know O
what O
you O
're O
getting O
. O

At O
the O
new O
Una B-EST
Pizza I-EST
Napoletana I-EST
, O
only O
the O
pizzas B-FOOD
are O
predictable O
. O

What O
are O
bland O
chunks O
of O
white B-FOOD
asparagus I-FOOD
under O
a O
yellow O
powder O
of O
cured B-FOOD
egg I-FOOD
yolk I-FOOD
and O
bottarga B-FOOD
doing O
here O
? O

Not O
making O
new O
friends O
, O
I O
promise O
you O
. O

There O
's O
a O
fine O
, O
tender O
panna B-DISH
cotta I-DISH
with O
fresh O
fruit B-FOOD
for O
dessert O
. O

One O
night O
the O
strawberry B-FOOD
syrup I-FOOD
spooned O
over O
it O
was O
essentially O
strawberry B-FOOD
vinegar I-FOOD
; O
on O
another O
night O
, O
its O
sweet O
- O
sour O
ratio O
was O
back O
in O
alignment O
. O

The O
other O
desserts O
I O
tried O
-- O
a O
bittersweet O
tiramisu B-DISH
with O
a O
welcome O
crackle O
of O
caramel B-FOOD
hidden O
in O
its O
layers O
, O
and O
some O
pure O
- O
tasting O
, O
impossibly O
smooth O
, O
eggless O
ice B-FOOD
creams I-FOOD
, O
including O
a O
pistachio B-FOOD
flavor O
that O
has O
to O
be O
tasted O
to O
be O
believed O
-- O
won O
me O
over O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

None O
of O
the O
other O
appetizers O
were O
as O
charmless O
as O
the O
white B-FOOD
asparagus I-FOOD
. O

A O
freshly O
shucked O
sea B-FOOD
scallop I-FOOD
seasoned O
with O
translucent O
strips O
of O
lemon B-FOOD
peel I-FOOD
and O
individual O
dots O
of O
couscous B-FOOD
was O
exceptional O
. O

And O
raw B-FOOD
lobster I-FOOD
surrounded O
by O
chickpeas B-FOOD
was O
wonderfully O
jittery O
with O
an O
Italian B-CUISINE
citrus B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
chile O
paste O
. O

But O
the O
chefs O
serve O
it O
in O
a O
form O
-- O
a O
chopped O
mass O
of O
unidentifiable O
goo O
-- O
that O
ca O
n't O
help O
but O
look O
off O
- O
putting O
. O

That O
dish O
would O
fit O
right O
in O
at O
Wildair B-EST
; O
here O
, O
among O
the O
tomatoes B-FOOD
and O
mozzarella B-FOOD
, O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
trying O
too O
hard O
. O

The O
same O
goes O
for O
the O
wine O
list O
. O

As O
they O
have O
done O
in O
their O
other O
places O
, O
Mr. O
Stone O
and O
Mr. O
von O
Hauske O
focus O
on O
natural O
wines B-FOOD
. O

These O
wines B-FOOD
can O
be O
mercurial O
, O
and O
the O
way O
the O
list O
is O
written O
only O
adds O
to O
the O
confusion O
. O

Almost O
no O
varietals O
are O
named O
, O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
tell O
much O
from O
the O
Italian B-CUISINE
regions O
, O
which O
include O
such O
major O
hubs O
as O
Irpinia B-LOC
and O
Solicchiata B-LOC
. O

When O
, O
helplessly O
, O
you O
accept O
a O
server O
's O
offer O
of O
assistance O
, O
you O
'll O
be O
asked O
what O
you O
intend O
to O
eat O
with O
your O
wine B-FOOD
. O

Are O
there O
any O
people O
other O
than O
sommeliers O
who O
want O
to O
talk O
at O
length O
about O
pairing O
particular O
wines B-FOOD
with O
particular O
pizzas B-FOOD
? O

I O
've O
never O
met O
them O
and O
if O
I O
do O
, O
I O
'm O
sending O
them O
off O
to O
be O
deprogrammed O
. O

Discussing O
the O
list O
, O
tasting O
a O
few O
samples O
, O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
that O
fits O
your O
idea O
of O
a O
good O
pizza B-FOOD
wine B-FOOD
( O
yes O
, O
for O
some O
reason O
there O
are O
wines B-FOOD
on O
the O
brief O
list O
that O
do O
n't O
taste O
especially O
good O
with O
any O
pizza B-FOOD
) O
-- O
all O
this O
slows O
down O
the O
pace O
, O
which O
is O
n't O
especially O
brisk O
to O
begin O
with O
. O

By O
the O
end O
of O
the O
night O
, O
your O
meal O
can O
last O
twice O
as O
long O
and O
cost O
twice O
as O
much O
as O
it O
would O
at O
almost O
any O
other O
pizzeria B-TYPE

was O

that O
Mr. O

there O
has O
been O

as O

French B-CUISINE
as O
it O

then O
I O
do O

think O
a O

as O
good O
as O

By O

The O
idea O
is O
for O
Ko B-EST

to O
use O

our O

are O
auditioned O

refined O
before O

graduate O

Ko B-EST

which O
I O
gave O
three O
stars O
in O

Most O

, O
at O
least O
the O
ones O
that O
change O
over O
time O
, O
are O
works O
in O
progress O
, O
but O
few O
make O
that O
explicit O
the O
way O
the O
one O
at O
Ko B-EST

bar B-TYPE
does O
. O

The O
cynical O
way O
to O
look O
at O
this O
is O
that O
bar B-TYPE
customers O
are O
paying O
to O
serve O
as O
lab O

heavy O
as O
at O

still O
proclaimed O

" O
We O
do O
not O
serve O
vegetarian B-DIET

friendly O
items O
. O
" O

Among O
the O
more O
substantial O
dishes O
that O
night O
was O
a O
mixed B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
meat O
sausage O
stuffed O
into O
a O
chicken B-FOOD
neck I-FOOD
and O
grilled O
. O

One O
end O
of O
the O
neck B-FOOD
was O
open O
. O

The O
other O
was O
still O
attached O
to O
the O
chicken B-FOOD
's I-FOOD
head O
. O

It O
was O
a O
sensational O
sausage B-FOOD
, O
but O
it O
did O
nothing O
to O
make O

I O

into O

and O
a O
Saumur B-FOOD
from O
Romain B-EST
Guiberteau I-EST
whose O
self O
- O
assurance O
I O
envied O
. O

These O
specials O
can O
cost O
twice O
as O
much O
as O
the O
regular O
by O
- O
the O
- O
glass O
pours O
, O
which O
tend O
to O
fall O
between O
$ O
15 O
and O
$ O
25 O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
figure O
out O
why O
the O
wine O
- O
geek O
crowd O
does O
n't O
bring O
tents O
and O
sleeping O
bags O
to O
camp O
out O
at O
Ko B-EST
's O
bar B-TYPE
. O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
understand O
why O
the O
place O
is O
almost O
never O
crowded O
, O
despite O
getting O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
press O
after O
it O
opened O
. O

The O
experimental O
nature O
of O
the O
menu O
ca O
n't O
be O
keeping O
people O
away O
; O
people O
expect O
that O
from O
Momofuku B-EST
restaurants O
. O

The O
only O
dish O
that O
I O
thought O
was O
n't O
totally O
successful O
was O
the O
fried B-DISH
zucchini I-DISH
made O
in O
the O
style O
of O
the O
fried B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
, O
and O
I O
was O
still O
glad O
I O
tried O
it O
. O

The O
prices O
are O
all O
over O
the O
place O
, O
but O
a O
meal O
here O
does O
n't O
need O
to O
be O
expensive O
. O

While O
you O
are O
welcome O
to O
spend O
$ O
100 O
on O
a O
sourdough B-FOOD
crepe I-FOOD
with O
50 O
grams O
of O
white B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
sturgeon O
caviar O
, O
you O
can O
just O
get O
the O
crepe B-FOOD
alone O
for O
$ O
8 O
. O

It O
is O
excellent O
: O
shiny O
with O
tangy O
cave O
- O
age O
butter B-FOOD
, O
speckled O
with O
oregano B-FOOD
cinders O
and O
crunchy O
from O
a O
pass O
over O
hot O
Japanese O
charcoal O
. O

The O
chicken B-DISH
, O
meanwhile O
, O
is O
$ O
7 O
a O
piece O
. O

The O
only O
reason O
I O
can O
think O
of O
for O
the O
empty O
seats O
is O
that O
the O
place O
is O
so O
hard O
to O
sum O
up O
. O

to O

what O

a O

, O
a O
helping O
of O

not O

you O
can O

first O
and O

second O
and O
tell O
yourself O
you O

eating O
like O

Alternatively O
, O
you O
might O
go O
with O
the O
main O
courses O
marked O
" O

Tavola O

" O

For O
once O
these O
plates O
really O
are O
meant O
for O
sharing O
: O
a O
substantial O
stack O
of O
spiced B-DISH
and I-DISH
roasted I-DISH
baby I-DISH
- I-DISH
back O
ribs O
under O
a O
warm O

or O
a O
spread O

rib I-FOOD

eye O
slices O
served O
with O
a O
separate O
plate O
of O
" O
Tuscan B-DISH
fries I-DISH
, O
" O
distinguishable O
from O
the O
regular O
kind O
by O
their O
fried B-FOOD
rosemary I-FOOD
needles I-FOOD
. O

Those O
fries B-FOOD
may O
be O
awesomely O
browned O
one O
week O
but O
ghostly O
and O
uncrisp O
the O
next O
. O

The O
tagliolini B-FOOD
cooked O
in O
the O
cacciucco B-FOOD
broth I-FOOD
as O
a O
second O
course O
after O
all O
the O
seafood B-FOOD
has O
been O
eaten O
might O
be O
60 O
seconds O
away O
from O
being O
al O

. O

I O
am O
not O
enthusiastic O
about O
the O
slightly O
tough O
squid B-FOOD
in O
moist O
bread B-FOOD
crumbs I-FOOD
, O
baked O
rather O
than O
fried O
, O
although O
the O
dish O
has O
a O
following O
at O
Mr. O
Luongo O

other O
restaurant O
, O
Morso B-EST
, O
next O
to O
the O
Ed B-LOC
Koch I-LOC
Queensboro I-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
. O

The O
souffles B-FOOD
that O
the O
servers O
try O
to O
sell O
halfway O
through O
the O
meal O
can O
be O
a O
little O
soupy O
. O

But O
the O
blueberry B-DISH
crostata I-DISH
is O
a O
genuine O
pleasure O
, O
its O
crust B-FOOD
likably O
sweet O
and O
tender O
. O

And O
you O
'll O
appreciate O
the O
clean O
, O
bright O
flavors O
of O
a O
shot O
of O
Aperol B-FOOD
dumped O
over O
grapefruit B-FOOD
granita I-FOOD

OF O
laid O
- O
back O
restaurants O
where O
you O
can O
enjoy O
a O
pleasant O
and O
unpretentious O
summer O
meal O
, O
have O

been O
to O
Yves B-EST
? O

It O
opened O
without O
much O
of O
a O

about O
two O
years O
ago O
, O
despite O
occupying O
a O
handsome O
, O
spare O

room O
whose O
white O
interior O
makes O
the O
most O
of O
the O
afternoon O
sunlight O
that O
hits O
its O
TriBeCa B-LOC
corner O
, O
opposite O
the O
restaurant O
Locanda B-EST
Verde I-EST
. O

I O
missed O
the O
original O
chef O
's O
tenure O
, O
but O
lately O
I O
've O
been O
intrigued O
by O
the O
cooking O
of O
Alex O
Baker O
, O
who O
took O
over O
in O
February O
. O

She O
is O
Paris B-LOC
- O
trained O
, O
having O
gone O
to O
culinary O
school O
and O
worked O
at O
Spring B-EST
and O
Le B-EST
Chateaubriand I-EST
there O
, O
before O
coming O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
to O
help O
open O
Rebelle B-EST
in O
2015 O
. O

At O
Yves B-EST
, O
she O
interprets O
French B-CUISINE
food O
with O
an O
appealingly O
relaxed O
, O
seasonal O
attitude O
. O

In O
early O
June O
she O
brought O
little O
bright O
- O
green O
favas B-FOOD
and O
sticks O
of O
asparagus B-FOOD
together O
with O
fresh B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
herb O
pappardelle O
, O
and O
if O
you O
're O
wondering O
what O
makes O
that O
French B-CUISINE
, O
the O
answer O
is O
a O
pistou B-FOOD
loaded O
with O
tarragon B-FOOD
and O
chervil B-FOOD
. O

There O
was O
also O
a O
reassuringly O
gentle O
navarin B-DISH
of I-DISH
lamb I-DISH
, O
with O
a O
small O
spring O
garden O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
customary O
carrots B-FOOD
and O
potatoes B-FOOD
: O
grilled B-FOOD
baby I-FOOD
leeks I-FOOD
and O
asparagus B-FOOD
stalks I-FOOD
, O
and O
tender O
chard B-FOOD
stems I-FOOD
. O

Pan B-DISH
- I-DISH
fried I-DISH
steelhead O
trout O
is O
on O
the O
menu O
now O
, O
with O
a O
smooth O
, O
pale O
- O
green O
sauce B-FOOD
of O
cucumbers B-FOOD
, O
melons B-FOOD
and O
avocados B-FOOD
pooling O
beneath O
a O
jumble O
of O
warm O
young O
cucumbers B-FOOD
. O

So O
is O
a O
side O
dish O
of O
recently O
picked O
pole B-FOOD
beans I-FOOD
and O

beans I-FOOD
charred O

and O
dressed O
with O

almond O
vinaigrette O
. O

As O
interpreted O
by O
Ms. O
Baker O
, O
mussels B-DISH
Provencal I-DISH
are O
not O
the O
usual O
mound O
of O
black O
shells O
in O
thin O
pink O
liquid O
with O
a O
few O
slices O
of O
baguette B-FOOD
; O
the O
shells O
are O
gone O
, O
the O
mussels B-FOOD
are O
good O
fat O
ones O
and O
their O
sauce B-FOOD
is O
more O
concentrated O
, O
augmented O
with O
tomato B-FOOD
paste I-FOOD
and O
roasted B-FOOD
cherry I-FOOD
tomatoes I-FOOD
and O
garnished O
with O
thick O
- O
crusted O
cubes O
of O
toasted B-FOOD
bread I-FOOD
. O

The O
snails B-FOOD
are O
more O
traditional O
, O
parsley B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
garlic O
butter O
sloshing O
around O
in O
their O
shells O
. O

If O
these O
land O
snails B-FOOD
wondered O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
on O
a O
bed O
of O
seaweed B-FOOD
, O
they O
did O
n't O
show O
it O
. O

There O
is O
some O
unevenness O
in O
the O
kitchen O
to O
be O
worked O
out O
. O

The O
fluke B-DISH
meuniere I-DISH
may O
be O
sauteed O
to O
a O
textbook O
golden O
crackle O
, O
or O
it O
could O
arrive O
looking O
as O
pale O
as O
a O
fish B-FOOD
belly O
. O

The O
country B-DISH
ham I-DISH
sandwich I-DISH
could O
use O
bread B-FOOD
that O
's O
easier O
to O
chew O
than O
the O
crust O
- O
armored O
baguettes B-FOOD
from O
Bien B-EST
Cuit I-EST
. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
large O
, O
and O
service O
tends O
to O
arrive O
in O
rapid O
bursts O
separated O
by O
long O
pauses O
. O

The O
wine O
list O
is O
very O
lopsided O
in O
favor O
of O
three O
- O
figure O
bottles O
, O
an O
irritating O
move O
for O
a O
fairly O
casual O
spot O
. O

But O
Ms. O
Baker O
seems O
to O
be O
making O
the O
best O
of O
it O
. O

It O
's O
hard O
to O
be O
cross O
with O
a O
restaurant O
that O
makes O
its O
own O
boursin B-FOOD
and O
brings O
it O
out O
in O
a O
dish O
so O
big O
I O
could O
never O
manage O
to O
finish O
it O
, O
even O
with O
a O
stack O
of O
toasted O
baguette B-FOOD
to O
smear O
it O
on O
. O

Mr. O
Robuchon O
's O
first O
restaurant O
, O
Jamin B-EST
, O
was O
given O
one O
Michelin O
star O
in O
its O
first O
year O
. O

It O
got O
another O
in O
its O
second O
, O
and O
the O
next O
year O
it O
climbed O
to O
the O
top O
step O
, O
a O
three O
- O
star O
ranking O
. O

Mr. O
Robuchon O
was O
still O
in O
his O
late O
30s O
. O

What O
could O
he O
do O
for O
his O
next O
trick O
? O

There O
were O
new O
dishes O
to O
invent O
, O
new O
honors O
to O
win O
, O
new O
employees O
to O
terrify O
. O

The O
chef O
Eric O
Ripert O
, O
who O
was O
one O
of O
them O
, O
has O
said O
that O
he O
still O
has O
nightmares O
about O
covering O
plates O
with O
the O
precisely O
sized O
and O
spaced O
dots O
of O
sauce O
that O
were O
a O
Jamin B-EST
signature O
. O

Playing O
the O
kitchen O
tyrant O
, O
regularly O
berating O
young O
cooks O
for O
mistakes O
nobody O
else O
would O
notice O
, O
Mr. O
Robuchon O
embodied O
the O
old O
order O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
this O
boot O
- O
camp O
style O
of O
running O
a O
kitchen O
was O
state O
of O
the O
art O
. O

But O
it O
had O
already O
come O
to O
seem O
counterproductive O
, O
disrespectful O
and O
unprofessional O
long O
before O
his O
death O
. O

In O
retrospect O
, O
the O
internal O
forces O
that O
he O
gave O
vent O
to O
when O
he O
screamed O
at O
his O
cooks O
must O
have O
also O
tormented O
Mr. O
Robuchon O
. O

For O
most O
of O
his O
career O
he O
was O
restless O
, O
unsatisfied O
. O

At O
51 O
, O
he O
tried O
to O
retire O
; O
of O
course O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
last O
. O

In O
2003 O
he O
returned O
, O
and O
this O
time O
he O
seemed O
determined O
not O
to O
give O
the O
Michelin O
inspectors O
what O
they O
wanted O
. O

L'Atelier B-EST
de I-EST
Joel I-EST
Robuchon I-EST
, O
his O
comeback O
, O
was O
staged O
in O
a O
former O
sushi B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
in O
Paris B-LOC
. O

He O
retained O
the O
basic O
setup O
. O

Diners O
sat O
at O
a O
counter O
, O
and O
rather O
than O
nigiri B-FOOD
and O
maki B-FOOD
, O
they O
ate O
his O
spoonable O
pommes B-FOOD
purees I-FOOD
and O
langoustines B-FOOD
fried O
inside O
a O
single O
leaf O
of O
paper O
- O
thin O
pastry B-FOOD
. O

There O
were O
no O
tablecloths O
, O
no O
chandeliers O
, O
no O
elaborately O
carved O
and O
upholstered O
chairs O
that O
might O
have O
come O
from O
a O
garage O
sale O
at O
Versailles B-LOC
. O

Food O
was O
cooked O
behind O
the O
counter O
by O
chefs O
dressed O
in O
the O
same O
black O
tunics O
the O
servers O
wore O
. O

Sometimes O
the O
chefs O
even O
placed O
the O
dish O
in O
front O
of O
the O
diner O
. O

The O
French O
daily O
Le O
Figaro O
summed O
up O
the O
general O
reaction O
when O
it O
proclaimed O
, O
" O
C'est O
une O
revolution O
! O
" O

If O
you O
think O
the O
Figaro O
was O
overreacting O
, O
it O
's O
because O
the O
revolution O
succeeded O
. O

Today O
, O
expensive O
dining O
is O
more O
likely O
to O
mean O
stools O
and O
a O
counter O
than O
dining O
tables O
on O
a O
sea O
of O
carpeting O
. O

The O
trappings O
that O
Mr. O
Robuchon O
stripped O
away O
-- O
the O
linens O
, O
the O
large O
dining O
rooms O
, O
the O
kitchens O
kept O
out O
of O
sight O
-- O
were O
not O
just O
costly O
to O
maintain O
but O
, O
by O
that O
point O
, O
increasingly O
off O
- O
putting O
, O
especially O
to O
younger O
diners O
. O

Today O
we O
do O
n't O
expect O
-- O
or O
even O
want O
-- O
carpeted O
, O
hushed O
spaces O
when O
we O
go O
out O
for O
meticulously O
prepared O
food O
. O

Mr. O
Robuchon O
was O
not O
the O
only O
chef O
of O
that O
era O
hoping O
to O
add O
to O
the O
restaurant O
experience O
by O
means O
of O
subtraction O
. O

In O
the O
same O
year O
, O
Paul O
Kahan O
and O
Donnie O
Madia O
opened O
Avec B-EST
in O
Chicago B-LOC
, O
a O
long O
skinny O
restaurant O
dominated O
by O
its O
counter O
. O

Sitting O
on O
a O
bar O
stool O
was O
synonymous O
with O
eating O
at O
the O
chef O
David O
Chang O
's O
Momofuku B-EST
restaurants O
in O
the O
first O
few O
years O
of O
his O
career O

from O

Flynn O
McGarry O
arrived O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
three O
years O
ago O
as O
the O
chef O
of O
a O
pop B-TYPE
- I-TYPE
up O
restaurant O
, O
Eureka B-EST
. O

He O
was O
16 O
at O
the O
time O
, O
but O
he O
'd O
been O
charging O
money O
for O
tasting O
menus O
since O
he O
was O
13 O
, O
running O
an O
early O
version O
of O
Eureka B-EST
in O
his O
mother O
's O
house O
in O
the O
San B-LOC
Fernando I-LOC
Valley I-LOC
in O
California B-LOC
. O

Earlier O
this O
year O
he O
opened O
a O
restaurant O
on O
the O
Lower B-LOC
East I-LOC
Side I-LOC
that O
is O
meant O
to O
be O
permanent O
, O
or O
as O
permanent O
as O
any O
business O
venture O
in O
Manhattan B-LOC
can O
be O
. O

This O
one O
is O
called O
Gem B-EST
, O
which O
if O
nothing O
else O
proves O
he O
's O
better O
at O
choosing O
names O
now O
that O
he O
's O
19 O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
yet O
seen O
the O
new O
documentary O
about O
him O
, O
" O
Chef O
Flynn O
, O
" O
but O
over O
the O
past O
six O
years O
my O
media O
diet O
has O
not O
been O
lacking O
in O
news O
about O
Mr. O
McGarry O
's O
productive O
adolescent O
years O
. O

I O
first O
learned O
about O
him O
from O
a O
brief O
New O
Yorker O
piece O
written O
when O
he O
was O
13 O
, O
by O
which O
time O
he O
had O
made O
many O
of O
the O
recipes O
in O
" O
The O
French O
Laundry O
Cookbook O
" O
and O
cooked O
for O
a O
week O
at O
Eleven B-EST
Madison I-EST
Park I-EST
. O

He O
was O
working O
several O
days O
a O
week O
in O
a O
Los B-LOC
Angeles I-LOC
restaurant O
and O
had O
apprenticed O
at O
Next B-EST
and O
Alinea B-EST
by O
15 O
, O
when O
he O
was O
the O
subject O
of O
a O
Times O
Magazine O
article O
. O

When O
he O
moved O
himself O
and O
his O
pop B-TYPE
- O
up O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
at O
16 O
, O
I O
read O
that O
his O
cooking O
was O
influenced O
by O
his O
time O
in O
the O
kitchens O
of O
Maaemo B-EST
in O
Norway B-LOC
and O
Geranium B-EST
in O
Denmark B-LOC
. O

Still O
, O
as O
I O
walked O
into O
Gem B-EST
the O
first O
time O
I O
was O
wondering O
, O
at O
some O
level O
, O
whether O
everyone O
had O
been O
too O
polite O
to O
tell O
him O
that O
his O
brownies B-FOOD
needed O
more O
time O
in O
the O
oven O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
answer O
to O
that O
before O
you O
buy O
advance O
tickets O
for O
the O
eight- O
to O
12 O
- O
course O
meal O
at O
$ O
155 O
a O
person O
, O
the O
only O
way O
to O
reserve O
a O
seat O
. O

But O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
more O
than O
a O
few O
minutes O
at O
Gem B-EST
to O
see O
that O
the O
adults O
were O
n't O
just O
humoring O
Mr. O
McGarry O
. O

His O
cooking O
is O
nuanced O
, O
his O
plating O
is O
often O
lyrical O
and O
the O
flavors O
, O
at O
least O
this O
spring O
and O
summer O
, O
have O
been O
delicate O
, O
subtle O
and O
very O
fresh O
. O

The O
vegetables B-FOOD
and O
fruits B-FOOD
he O
uses O
in O
profusion O
look O
and O
taste O
as O
if O
they O
had O
dropped O
off O
the O
vine O
right O
on O
to O
the O
hand O
- O
spun O
, O
earth O
- O
toned O
ceramic O
dishes O
. O

My O
favorite O
Gem B-EST
dish O
so O
far O
, O
delicate O
and O
self O
- O
assured O
, O
was O
a O
morsel O
or O
two O
of O
grilled B-DISH
king I-DISH
crab I-DISH
legs I-DISH
lightly O
glazed O
with O
rose B-FOOD
petal I-FOOD
miso I-FOOD
and O
set O
beside O
soft O
chamomile B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
scented O
potatoes O
for O
ballast O
, O
red O
currants B-FOOD
for O
zing O
and O
some O
fluttering O
rose B-FOOD
petals I-FOOD
on O
top O
for O
the O
heck O
of O
it O
. O

A O
close O
rival O
was O
the O
chilled O
bowl O
of O
barely O
vinegared B-DISH
mackerel I-DISH
interwoven O
with O
grilled B-FOOD
cucumbers I-FOOD
, O
sliced O
plums B-FOOD
and O
salty O
red O
dabs O
of O
mashed O
fermented B-FOOD
plums I-FOOD
. O

The O
harmonies O
were O
right O
on O
key O
, O
with O
a O
Japanese B-CUISINE
mood O
that O
did O
n't O
cross O
the O
line O
into O
outright O
imitation O
. O

White B-FOOD
asparagus I-FOOD
, O
an O
ingredient O
that O
seems O
to O
flummox O
some O
American B-CUISINE
kitchens O
, O
was O
subjected O
to O
a O
wonderful O
treatment O
, O
patiently O
browned O
and O
basted O
in O
butter B-FOOD
, O
then O
finished O
with O
a O
reduced B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
jus I-FOOD
that O
had O
a O
glimmer O
of O
vadouvan B-FOOD
in O
it O
somewhere O
. O

Strewing O
the O
plate O
with O
tender O
, O
pale O
- O
green O
pine B-FOOD
needles I-FOOD
seemed O
like O
an O
affectation O
at O
first O
, O
but O
their O
flavor O
lifted O
and O
brightened O
the O
whole O
package O
. O

Mr. O
McGarry O
does O
fine O
work O
with O
deeper O
flavors O
, O
too O
. O

Each O
menu O
crescendos O
in O
a O
complicated O
, O
multicomponent O
spread O
, O
and O
the O
best O
of O
these O
featured O
lamb B-FOOD
: O
barbecue B-DISH
ribs I-DISH
rubbed O
with O
cracked O
coriander B-FOOD
seeds I-FOOD
and O
XO B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
, O
plus O
a O
skewered B-DISH
grilled I-DISH
lamb I-DISH
kebab I-DISH
and O
a O
tomato B-DISH
salad I-DISH
. O

Another O
night O
built O
up O
to O
an O
exhibition O
of O
squab B-FOOD
. O

A O
leg B-FOOD
, O
perfectly O
cooked O
and O
sweetened O
by O
a O
maple B-FOOD
jus I-FOOD
, O
was O
very O
good O
, O
but O
the O
high O
point O
was O
a O
very O
thin O
and O
hearty O
rye B-FOOD
cracker I-FOOD
spread O
with O
squab B-FOOD
liver I-FOOD
, O
cherries B-FOOD
and O
pickled B-FOOD
ramps I-FOOD
; O
the O
fruit B-FOOD
's O
bright O
notes O
were O
played O
off O
against O
earthier O
ones O
so O
skillfully O
they O
almost O
shimmered O
. O

Back O
in O
the O
family O
home O
, O
and O
at O
the O
Eureka B-EST
pop B-TYPE
- O
up O
, O
Mr. O
McGarry O
used O
to O
make O
everything O
himself O
. O

Now O
he O
works O
alongside O
two O
cooks O
, O
bringing O
the O
kitchen O
team O
at O
Gem B-EST
to O
the O
same O
size O
as O
that O
of O
my O
neighborhood O
slice B-TYPE
joint I-TYPE
. O

Some O
small O
defeats O
could O
be O
attributed O
to O
Mr. O
McGarry O
's O
lack O
of O
experience O
with O
weather O
patterns O
in O
the O
Northeast B-LOC
. O

A O
warm O
beet B-FOOD
, O
languorously O
braised O
in O
smoked B-FOOD
beet I-FOOD
juice I-FOOD
until O
it O
is O
soft O
and O
sticky O
like O
salt B-FOOD
water I-FOOD
taffy I-FOOD
and O
then O
basted O
with O
a O
beet B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
based I-FOOD
bordelaise O
sauce O
, O
was O
impressive O
in O
June O
. O

In O
July O
's O
heat O
wave O
it O
was O
as O
welcome O
as O
a O
space O
heater O
. O

And O
maybe O
he O
would O
n't O
have O
served O
starchy O
grilled B-FOOD
peas I-FOOD
if O
he O
'd O
known O
how O
quickly O
the O
summer O
sun O
can O
make O
them O
tough O
. O

By O
the O
way O
, O
Mr. O
McGarry O
does O
n't O
make O
brownies B-FOOD
, O
at O
least O
not O
at O
Gem B-EST
. O

Dessert O
after O
each O
of O
my O
three O
meals O
was O
more O
or O
less O
the O
same O
thing O
: O
bowls O
of O
ripe O
berries B-FOOD
, O
served O
one O
night O
with O
whipped B-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
infused O
with O
chamomile B-FOOD
and O
rose B-FOOD
hips I-FOOD
and O
another O
time O
with O
bay B-FOOD
leaf I-FOOD
and O
bee B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
pollen I-FOOD
ice O
creams O
. O

You O
could O
n't O
ask O
for O
a O
more O
refreshing O
course O
on O
a O
hot O
summer O
night O
, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
it O
's O
clear O
that O
he O
has O
room O
to O
grow O
as O
a O
pastry O
chef O
. O

Dessert O
is O
served O
on O
low O
coffee O
tables O
in O
a O
loungey O
space O
called O
the O
Living B-EST
Room I-EST
, O
which O
by O
day O
doubles O
as O
a O
cafe B-TYPE
selling O
pastries B-FOOD
and O
sandwiches B-FOOD
on O
housemade O
bread B-FOOD
. O

Rousting O
diners O
from O
their O
tables O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
( O
called O
, O
aptly O
enough O
, O
the O
Dining B-EST
Room I-EST
) O
, O
probably O
seemed O
like O
a O
good O
idea O
on O
paper O
, O
but O
in O
reality O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
silly O
. O

It O
's O
one O
of O
several O
hiccups O
that O
keep O
a O
meal O
at O
Gem B-EST
from O
gliding O
smoothly O
along O
. O

Servers O
may O
shoot O
their O
cuffs O
before O
fiddling O
with O
some O
small O
detail O
of O
the O
table O
setting O
, O
a O
fussiness O
that O
is O
not O
in O
keeping O
with O
the O
graceful O
, O
relaxed O
tone O
of O
the O
cooking O
. O

Wine O
glasses O
could O
sit O
empty O
for O
long O
stretches O
and O
the O
wines B-FOOD
themselves O
, O
both O
whites B-FOOD
and O
reds B-FOOD
, O
were O
almost O
always O
too O
warm O
. O

That O
Mr. O
Flynn O
is O
more O
polished O
as O
a O
chef O
than O
a O
restaurateur O
is O
understandable O
. O

He O
may O
need O
a O
more O
experienced O
partner O
to O
straighten O
out O
the O
dining O
room O
, O
and O
to O
help O
him O
edit O
the O
menus O
, O
too O
. O

With O
each O
meal O
, O
I O
had O
the O
sense O
there O
were O
at O
least O
two O
superfluous O
courses O
, O
and O
occasionally O
Mr. O
McGarry O
seems O
to O
be O
straining O
as O
he O
reaches O
for O
the O
sort O
of O
razzle O
- O
dazzle O
you O
'd O
get O
at O
Alinea B-EST

Eleven B-EST
Madison I-EST

to O
make O
you O
wish O
Mr. O
McGarry O
had O
eaten O
more O
tacos B-FOOD
before O
he O
left O
California O

At O
times O
Mr. O
McGarry O
seems O
like O
a O
creative O
- O
writing O
student O
who O
fills O
his O
pages O
with O
footnotes O
because O
David O
Foster O
Wallace O
did O
it O
. O

It O
's O
too O
bad O
that O
he O
came O
of O
age O
in O
an O
era O
when O
many O
people O
believe O
that O
tasting O
menus O
are O
the O
highest O
form O
of O
kitchen O
artistry O
. O

Like O
the O
style O
of O
" O
Infinite O
Jest O
, O
" O
those O
menus O
have O
to O
be O
the O
result O
of O
ideas O
that O

contained O
any O
other O
way O
; O
they O
're O
not O
a O
blank O
space O
to O
be O
filled O
in O
. O

Mr. O
McGarry O
obviously O
learned O
a O
lot O
from O
his O
mentors O
, O
but O
he O
can O
cook O
in O
his O
own O
voice O
now O
, O
and O
it O
may O
be O
time O
to O
leave O
his O
idols O
behind O

On O
the O

It O
may O

the O

after O

Mr. O

The O

stay O

the O
question O
was O
not O
just O
whether O
you O

whether O
you O
felt O

encapsulated O
for O
me O
in O
two O
brief O
scenes O
from O
my O
recent O
meals O
at O
Nobu B-EST
Downtown I-EST
and O
Nobu B-EST
Fifty I-EST
Seven I-EST
. O

The O
first O
episode O
took O
place O
while O
I O
was O
sitting O
at O
the O
sushi B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
of O
Nobu B-EST
Downtown I-EST
. O

This O
location O
, O
inside O
the O
old O
AT&T O
tower O
on O
Lower B-LOC
Broadway I-LOC
, O
is O
theoretically O
the O
successor O
to O
the O
first O
Nobu B-EST
; O
it O
opened O
last O
year O
a O
few O
weeks O
after O
the O
original O
closed O
. O

The O
sushi B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
was O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
TriBeCa B-LOC
restaurant O
. O

The O
chefs O
behind O
it O
prepared O
or O
touched O
at O
least O
half O
the O
food O
, O
and O
seats O
there O
were O
so O
coveted O
that O
during O
the O
1990s O
, O
when O
even O
celebrities O
complained O
about O
how O
hard O
it O
was O
to O
get O
in O
, O
a O
mostly O
sushi B-TYPE
restaurant I-TYPE
called O
Next B-EST
Door I-EST
Nobu I-EST
was O
opened O
simply O
to O
contain O
the O
overflow O
. O

( O
It O
closed O
last O
year O
, O
too O
, O
and O
wo O
n't O
be O
replaced O
. O
) O

At O
Nobu B-EST
Downtown I-EST
, O
the O
upstairs O
sushi O
counter O
is O
on O
the O
far O
side O
of O
the O
cocktail O
bar O
that O
the O
design O
firm O
Rockwell O
Group O
slipped O
in O
among O
the O
enormous O
fluted O
limestone O
columns O
that O
fill O
the O
building O
's O
ground O
floor O
like O
a O
petrified O
forest O
. O

I O
had O
just O
eaten O
a O
piece O
of O
Japanese B-CUISINE
scallop B-DISH
sushi I-DISH
with O
a O
dangerous O
streak O
of O
wasabi B-FOOD
when O
an O
animated O
group O
of O
four O
new O
arrivals O
appeared O
next O
to O
me O
. O

The O
sushi O
chefs O
eyed O
them O
warily O
, O
because O
they O
appeared O
to O
intend O
to O
cluster O
around O
a O
single O
stool O
, O
the O
way O
people O
do O
at O
a O
bar O
. O

Soon O
it O
became O
apparent O
that O
they O
thought O
they O
were O
at O
the O
bar O
. O

But O
the O
people O
they O
mistook O
for O
bartenders O
were O
all O
busy O
slicing O
raw O
fish B-FOOD
, O
so O
eventually O
the O
group O
moved O
on O
to O
look O
for O
somebody O
to O
make O
them O
a O
drink O
. O

Moments O
like O
this O
did O
n't O
tend O
to O
happen O
at O
the O
original O
Nobu B-EST
, O
but O
they O
do O
bring O
Nobu B-EST
Downtown I-EST
in O
line O
with O
Nobu B-EST
Fifty I-EST
Seven I-EST
. O

In O
business O
on O
57th B-LOC
Street I-LOC
since O
2005 O
, O
Nobu B-EST
Fifty I-EST
Seven I-EST
is O
another O
two O
- O
story O
proposition O
. O

Between O
5 O
and O
7 O
p.m. O
its O
ground O
- O
floor O
lounge O
acts O
on O
young O
Midtown B-LOC
professionals O
like O
the O
fishing O
nets O
evoked O
by O
Rockwell O
Group O
's O
design O
. O

At O
the O
time O
the O
second O
scene O
took O
place O
, O
the O
bartenders O
looked O
as O
if O
they O
were O
struggling O
not O
to O
get O
caught O
. O

My O
cocktail O
, O
a O
Negroni B-DISH
- O
esque O
thing O
with O
sake B-FOOD
in O
it O
that O
was O
ferried O
to O
my O
upstairs O
table O
from O
the O
downstairs O
bar O
, O
was O
neither O
shaken O
nor O
stirred O
; O
it O
was O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
almost O
hot O
. O

While O
I O
was O
waiting O
for O
the O
cocktail O
to O
be O
cooled O
by O
its O
single O
ice O
cube O
, O
a O
server O
was O
struggling O
to O
open O
a O
bottle O
of O
Champagne B-FOOD
for O
a O
table O
of O
at O
least O
10 O
men O
next O
to O
me O
. O

When O
the O
cork O
came O
out O
, O
he O
managed O
to O
spray O
the O
room O
in O
a O
manner O
usually O
seen O
in O
the O
Super O
Bowl O
champions O
' O
locker O
room O
. O

Everybody O
nearby O
got O
a O
little O
wet O
, O
including O
me O
and O
my O
guests O
, O
but O
nobody O
seemed O
to O
notice O
. O

Servers O
at O
both O
addresses O
have O
the O
brisk O
, O
well O
- O
drilled O
, O
impersonal O
and O
slightly O
numbed O
quality O
that O
comes O
of O
waiting O
on O
hundreds O
of O
people O
a O
day O
. O

At O
Nobu B-EST
Fifty I-EST
- O
Seven O
, O
one O
told O
me O
, O
" O
Our O
menu O
is O
kaiseki O
style O
, O
so O
it O
's O
like O
tapas O
. O

Everything O
is O
meant O
for O
sharing O
. O
" O

I O
must O
have O
looked O
confused O
because O
he O
added O
, O
" O
Some O
dishes O
are O
going O
to O
be O
bigger O
than O
others O
. O

Nobu B-EST
Fifty I-EST
- O
Seven O
was O
given O
three O
stars O
in O
its O
last O
New O
York O
Times O
review O
, O
by O
Frank O
Bruni O
in O
2005 O
. O

That O
's O
what O
Ruth O
Reichl O
gave O
the O
original O
in O
1995 O
. O

After O
three O
recent O
visits O
to O
each O
location O
, O
I O
decided O
that O
, O
apart O
from O
minor O
menu O
variations O
, O
any O
qualitative O
difference O
in O
the O
food O
between O
the O
two O
branches O
is O
too O
subtle O
for O
me O
to O
make O
out O
. O

The O
chefs O
uptown O
are O
Taku O
Sato O
and O
Matt O
Hoyle O
. O

Downtown O
was O
led O
by O
Ricky O
Estrellado O
and O
Ryo O
Hasegawa O
until O
June O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Estrellado O
died O
suddenly O
. O

His O
successor O
has O
not O
been O
named O
. O

Both O
kitchens O
are O
models O
of O
superior O
ingredient O
shopping O
and O
consistent O
performance O
. O

When O
those O
classic O
Nobu B-EST
dishes O
appear O
, O
they O
will O
be O
exactly O
like O
the O
last O
time O
you O
had O
them O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
mayo B-DISH
- I-DISH
bathed I-DISH
fried O
shrimp O
, O
that O
may O
not O
be O
an O
entirely O
good O
thing O
. O

And O
I O
still O
think O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
caviar B-FOOD
that O
crowns O
tuna B-FOOD
, O
or O
salmon B-FOOD
, O
or O
yellowtail B-FOOD
tartare I-FOOD
gets O
elbowed O
out O
of O
the O
way O
by O
the O
wasabi B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
soy O
sauce O
. O

But O
the O
tiradito B-DISH
, O
slices O
of O
yellowtail B-FOOD
squirted O
with O
lemon B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
yuzu I-FOOD
juice I-FOOD
, O
then O
dotted O
with O
pureed B-FOOD
rocoto I-FOOD
pepper I-FOOD
, O
is O
always O
wonderfully O
bracing O
. O

The O
candylike O
black B-DISH
cod I-DISH
is O
as O
hard O
to O
deny O
as O
ever O
, O
even O
if O
the O
extra O
sweetening O
Mr. O
Matsuhisa O
gives O
this O
traditional O
Japanese B-CUISINE
dish O
strikes O
me O
as O
somewhat O
shameless O
. O

The O
sashimi B-DISH
salad I-DISH
and O
the O
lobster B-DISH
shiitake I-DISH
salads I-DISH
are O
both O
better O
than O
any O
salad B-FOOD
from O
a O
global O
chain O
has O
the O
right O
to O
be O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
who O
orders O
the O
dishes O
marked O
Nobu O
Now O
, O
but O
I O
tried O
a O
few O
. O

Umami B-DISH
Chilean I-DISH
sea I-DISH
bass I-DISH
: O
not O
worth O
it O
, O
even O
for O
the O
slightly O
exotic O
return O
of O
a O
fish B-FOOD
that O
has O
n't O
been O
seen O
much O
since O
the O
' O
90s O
. O

Kumamoto B-DISH
shooters I-DISH
: O
a O
thrilling O
series O
of O
flavors O
that O
will O
recall O
the O
way O
you O
felt O
the O
first O
time O
you O
ate O
at O
Nobu B-EST
. O

Michele O
Goldsmith O
's O
desserts O
, O
served O
both O
uptown O
and O
downtown O
, O
are O
modern O
and O
playful O
and O
do O
n't O
try O
too O
hard O
to O
follow O
the O
theme O
, O
whatever O
that O
is O
. O

Over O
the O
years O
, O
the O
Hudson B-LOC
Street I-LOC
Nobu B-EST
became O
something O
unusual O
, O
a O
restaurant O
that O
could O
serve O
tourists O
and O
families O
from O
around O
the O
corner O
with O
equal O
aplomb O
. O

But O
a O
meal O
at O
Nobu B-EST
is O
still O
among O
the O
best O
, O
although O
not O
the O
cheapest O
, O
ways O
to O
introduce O
children O
to O
raw O
fish B-FOOD
. O

And O
sitting O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
can O
still O
provide O
the O
intimacy O
that O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
place O
lacks O
. O

The O
chefs O
behind O
the O
counter O
may O
not O
draw O
the O
kinmedai O
cultists O
who O
flock O
to O
Sushi B-EST
Zo I-EST
or O
Sushi B-EST
Ginza I-EST
Onodera I-EST
, O
but O
they O
know O
what O
they O
're O
doing O
, O
and O
they O
light O
up O
when O
they O
get O
a O
customer O
who O
can O
tell O

Considering O
the O
history O
, O
the O
influence O
, O
the O
depth O
and O
the O
sophistication O
of O
Iranian B-CUISINE
food O
, O
it O
has O
always O
seemed O
unfair O
that O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
has O
so O
few O
places O
to O
eat O
it O
. O

Unfair O
to O
the O
cuisine O
and O
unfair O
to O
would O
- O
be O
eaters O
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
symbol O
for O
the O
state O
of O
the O
cuisine O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
, O
Taste B-EST
of I-EST
Persia I-EST
NYC I-EST
will O
fit O
the O
bill O
. O

Until O
recently O
I O
might O
have O
called O
it O
the O
city O
's O
most O
promising O
Iranian B-CUISINE
kitchen O
, O
if O
the O
word O
kitchen O
were O
n't O
such O
a O
stretch O
. O

Taste B-EST
of I-EST
Persia I-EST
is O
a O
takeout O
operation O
squeezed O
into O
the O
front O
window O
of O
a O
Chelsea B-LOC
pizzeria B-TYPE
, O
except O
during O
the O
two O
months O
when O
fire O
damage O
forced O
it O
to O
take O
up O
temporary O
residence O
in O
a O
holiday O
market O
. O

It O
does O
show O
off O
some O
of O
the O
pleasures O
of O
the O
Iranian O
table O
, O
but O
not O
the O
table O
itself O
. O

So O
a O
new O
Brooklyn B-LOC
restaurant O
called O
Sofreh B-EST
, O
which O
joined O
the O
Iranian B-CUISINE
ranks O
in O
June O
, O
would O
have O
caused O
a O
stir O
even O
if O
the O
cooking O
were O
n't O
quite O
as O
good O
as O
it O
is O
. O

The O
dining O
room O
is O
spare O
and O
modern O
, O
with O
exposed O
rafters O
, O
molded O
plywood O
chairs O
and O
shades O
of O
soft O
white O

You O
have O
to O
look O
carefully O
to O
see O
the O
breaks O
with O
garden O
- O
variety O
minimalism O
, O
like O
the O
echoes O
of O
medieval O
arches O
behind O
the O
bar O
and O
the O
Persian O
calligraphy O
carved O
into O
the O
plaster O
in O
the O
back O
, O
where O
a O
small O
deck O
hangs O
above O
a O
garden O
. O

Minimalism O
surrenders O
entirely O
in O
the O
bathroom O
, O
papered O
in O
a O
pulpy O
collage O
of O
posters O
from O
pre O

revolutionary O
Iranian O

. O

All O
summer O

Iranian O
expats O
and O
hopeful O
fans O
of O

cuisine O
have O
been O
filing O

armed O
with O
questions O
: O
Does O
the O
saffron B-DISH
rice I-DISH
stand O
high O

in O
the O
dimpled O

familiar O
from O
restaurants O
that O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
Iran B-LOC

Maybe O
just O
a O
bit O
, O
but O
Sofreh B-EST

version O
stands O
out O
for O
its O
intriguing O
sauce B-FOOD

And O
while O
the O
Shiraz B-DISH
salad I-DISH
is O
n't O
chopped O
to O
fine O
bits O
in O
the O
traditional O
way O
that O
makes O
it O
something O
like O
Iran B-LOC

answer O
to O
pico B-DISH

its O
sour O
purple O
flecks O
of O

distinguish O
it O
from O
the O

of O

. O

The O
menu O
is O
fairly O
concise O
, O
and O
occasionally O
I O
wished O
that O
it O
plunged O
into O
tradition O
with O
less O
restraint O

For O
a O

called O

the O

hypnotically O

Still O
, O
a O

not O
the O

I O
sat O

Mr. O

alone O

as O
he O
usually O
is O
even O
when O
customers O
occupy O
all O
12 O

Although O

work O
in O

the O

essentially O
a O
one O

man O
show O

In O
the O
broad O
view O

having O
the O

In O
the O
year O

Mr. O

took O
over O
the O

at O
first O
his O
work O

up O

in O
June O
the O
owner O
, O
Idan O
Elkon O

announced O
that O
he O
'd O
put O
a O
ring O
on O
it O

made O
the O
arrangement O
permanent O

he O
has O
firmly O
placed O
it O

the O

On O
the O
basis O

Mr. O
Wilcox O
, O
who O
grew O
up O
in O
Virginia B-LOC

cooked O
at O
a O
kaiseki B-TYPE
restaurant O
in O
Kyoto B-LOC
called O
Kikunoi O
for O
seven O
years O

spent O

a O

parlor I-TYPE
in O
the O
Ginza B-LOC

You O
might O
think O
of O
this O
as O
the O
equivalent O

earning O
a O

by O

Ph.D. O

Japanese B-CUISINE

and O
one O
side O
benefit O
of O
a O
meal O

Mr. O
Wilcox O
is O
the O
chance O
to O
hear O
what O
he O
learned O

Show O
some O

you O
could O
get O
a O

On O
this O
August O
night O

I O
was O
about O
to O
get O
a O
two O
- O
hour O
schooling O
on O
the O
pleasures O
of O
summer O
sushi B-FOOD

Mr. O
Wilcox O
's O
opening O
move O
was O
a O
squiggle O
of O
what O
looked O
like O
short O
, O
thick O
noodles B-FOOD
and O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
lengths O
of O
chilled O
eggplant B-FOOD
; O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
had O
given O
them O
a O
cool O
bath O
in O
the O
light O
sauce B-FOOD
in O
which O
icy O
coils O
of O
somen B-FOOD
noodles I-FOOD
are O
dipped O
in O
summer O
. O

Laid O
over O
the O
top O
were O
two O
tongues O
of O
bafun B-FOOD
sea I-FOOD
urchin I-FOOD
, O
a O
species O
with O
the O
color O
of O
a O
nearly O
ripe O
persimmon B-FOOD
. O

With O
one O
dish O
, O
he O
had O
shooed O
away O
the O
heat O
outside O
, O
shown O
off O
the O
uncanny O
harmony O
of O
urchin B-FOOD
and O
eggplant B-FOOD
, O
and O
introduced O
a O
minor O
theme O
of O
the O
night O
, O
the O
summer O
urchin O
harvest O
in O
Japan B-LOC
. O

This O
overture O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
lifted O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
machete O
. O

This O
was O
a O
hamo O
knife O
, O
a O
heavy O
swath O
of O
sharp O
steel O
that O
can O
reduce O
the O
daggertooth B-FOOD
pike I-FOOD
conger I-FOOD
's O
dozens O
of O
tiny O
bones O
to O
edible O
smithereens O
; O
before O
the O
first O
one O
was O
forged O
in O
the O
19th O
century O
, O
he O
explained O
, O
the O
eel B-FOOD
had O
to O
be O
fully O
cooked O
and O
separated O
from O
its O
skeleton O
. O

This O
hamo B-FOOD
would O
be O
quickly O
scorched O
on O
one O
side O
and O
served O
with O
a O
lick O
of O
wasabi B-FOOD
and O
pureed B-FOOD
salt I-FOOD
- I-FOOD
cured O
plums O
thinned O
with O
dashi B-FOOD
. O

Sashimi B-FOOD
came O
next O
in O
the O
form O
of O
shioko B-FOOD
, O
or O
kanpachi B-FOOD
caught O
when O
it O
is O
young O
and O
its O
flavor O
is O
leaner O
and O
softer O
than O
it O
will O
get O
later O
in O
the O
year O
. O

This O
was O
followed O
by O
a O
local O
fish B-FOOD
that O
in O
the O
spring O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
had O
told O
me O
he O
did O
n't O
like O
, O
striped B-FOOD
bass I-FOOD
. O

He O
had O
been O
working O
with O
it O
, O
though O
, O
salting O
it O
overnight O
and O
then O
grilling O
it O
until O
the O
skin O
crackled O
. O

Now O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
striped B-FOOD
bass I-FOOD
cooked O
any O
other O
way O
. O

After O
this O
was O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
's O
nod O
to O
the O
kaiseki B-CUISINE
tradition O
known O
as O
takiawase O
, O
a O
plate O
of O
simmered O
vegetables B-FOOD
and O
, O
in O
this O
case O
, O
seafood B-FOOD
: O
a O
small O
potato B-FOOD
, O
some O
Japanese B-FOOD
eggplant I-FOOD
, O
a O
crisp O
pink O
ginger B-FOOD
shoot I-FOOD
and O
the O
most O
flavorful O
piece O
of O
octopus B-FOOD
I O
have O
ever O
put O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

After O
my O
first O
meal O
at O
Shoji B-EST
I O
learned O
to O
hope O
that O
chawan B-DISH
mushi I-DISH
, O
a O
bowl O
of O
steaming O
- O
hot O
tofu B-FOOD
custard I-FOOD
, O
was O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

In O
spring O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
made O
it O
with O
spot B-FOOD
prawns I-FOOD
, O
but O
tonight O
, O
in O
homage O
to O
clambake O
season O
, O
he O
was O
serving O
lobster B-DISH
chawan I-DISH
mushi I-DISH
. O

To O
this O
point O
, O
the O
menu O
had O
faithfully O
followed O
kaiseki B-TYPE
's O
ritualized O
sequence O
of O
courses O
and O
its O
stopwatch O
- O
precise O
attention O
to O
seasonality O
. O

It O
was O
about O
to O
veer O
in O
a O
different O
direction O
, O
but O
it O
was O
enough O
to O
suggest O
that O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
could O
open O
a O
kaiseki B-TYPE
restaurant O
that O
would O
set O
a O
new O
standard O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
the O
city O
would O
support O
it O
, O
but O
it O
would O
be O
spectacular O
while O
it O
lasted O
. O

The O
different O
direction O
, O
of O
course O
, O
was O
sushi B-FOOD
. O

Accounting O
for O
just O
about O
half O
the O
Shoji B-EST
menu O
, O
the O
sushi B-FOOD
portion O
is O
briefer O
and O
offers O
less O
variety O
than O
the O
full O
monty O
at O
, O
say O
, O
Sushi B-EST
Amane I-EST
or O
Ginza B-EST
Sushi I-EST
Onodera I-EST
. O

But O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
any O
competitor O
outflanks O
Shoji B-EST
on O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
seafood B-FOOD
it O
does O
serve O
, O
or O
in O
the O
timeliness O
with O
which O
it O
serves O
up O
exactly O
the O
specimens O
most O
worth O
tracking O
down O
at O
any O
given O
moment O
. O

In O
spring O
, O
when O
bioluminescent O
firefly B-FOOD
squid I-FOOD
are O
spawning O
in O
Japanese O
bays O
, O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
gets O
them O
. O

In O
August O
, O
when O
cuttlefish B-FOOD
are O
thumbnail O
size O
, O
unbelievably O
smooth O
and O
as O
meltingly O
soft O
as O
the O
thinnest O
sheet O
of O
nova B-FOOD
at O
Russ B-EST
& I-EST
Daughters I-EST
, O
he O
will O
lay O
three O
of O
those O
over O
a O
single O
finger O
of O
rice B-FOOD
. O

He O
tracks O
bluefin B-FOOD
that O
has O
been O
caught O
from O
healthy O
stocks O
, O
like O
the O
o B-FOOD
- O
toro O
from O
Ireland B-LOC
that O
he O
served O
last O
spring O
and O
that O
was O
so O
seductive O
it O
could O
have O
been O
captioned O
" O
the O
guy O
she O
told O
you O
not O
to O
worry O
about O
. O
" O

While O
in O
Japan B-LOC
, O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
learned O
to O
make O
fresh O
ikura B-FOOD
from O
sacs O
of O
salmon B-FOOD
roe I-FOOD
, O
a O
slow O
process O
that O
requires O
massaging O
the O
eggs B-FOOD
apart O
by O
hand O
in O
many O
changes O
of O
water O
. O

Normally O
the O
roe B-FOOD
is O
then O
heavily O
cured O
with O
sugar B-FOOD
and O
salt B-FOOD
, O
but O
the O
roe B-FOOD
he O
was O
serving O
last O
month O
was O
very O
lightly O
seasoned O
before O
being O
spooned O
into O
a O
shot O
glass O
and O
served O
as O
is O
-- O
sticky O
, O
fatty O
, O
sweet O
and O
fresh O
. O

After O
the O
last O
piece O
of O
fish B-FOOD
, O
the O
kaiseki O
format O
kicks O
in O
again O
with O
a O
soup B-FOOD
, O
which O
may O
be O
as O
simple O
as O
a O
classic O
bowl O
of O
miso B-FOOD
or O
may O
break O
with O
tradition O
, O
like O
the O
extraordinary O
corn B-DISH
soup I-DISH
I O
ate O
in O
August O
. O

There O
will O
be O
something O
cold O
and O
refreshing O
, O
maybe O
a O
granita B-DISH
made O
from O
ginger B-FOOD
or O
matcha B-FOOD
, O
and O
finally O
a O
more O
substantial O
dessert O
. O

Sometimes O
this O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
tart O
with O
seasonal O
fruit B-FOOD
-- O
candied B-DISH
kumquats I-DISH
, O
maybe O
, O
or O
white B-DISH
peaches I-DISH
and I-DISH
blueberries I-DISH
-- O
arranged O
in O
a O
mochi B-FOOD
wafer I-FOOD
called O
monaka B-FOOD
. O

For O
all O
this O
the O
charge O
is O
$ O
252 O
, O
service O
included O
. O

A O
shorter O
menu O
is O
available O
at O
$ O
190 O
, O
or O
a O
longer O
one O
at O
$ O
295 O
, O
again O
with O
service O
included O
. O

That O
service O
is O
somewhat O
minimal O
; O
lately O
it O
has O
meant O
a O
single O
employee O
assiduously O
refilling O
water O
glasses O
and O
taking O
orders O
from O
a O
drinks O
list O
whose O
cheapest O
item O
is O
a O
$ O
12 O
bottle O
of O
beer O
. O

Could O
my O
server O
have O
been O
more O
adept O
at O
deciphering O
the O
wines B-FOOD
, O
sakes B-FOOD
, O
shochus B-FOOD
and O
Haitian B-FOOD
rums I-FOOD
Mr. O
Elkon O
and O
Mr. O
Wilcox O
have O
put O
together O
? O

Perhaps O
, O
but O
I O
would O
n't O
necessarily O
want O
the O
scene O
cluttered O
by O
a O

Sometimes O
when O
I O
am O
waiting O
, O
and O
waiting O
, O
for O
a O
barista O
to O
steam O
milk B-FOOD
for O
my O
cortado B-FOOD
, O
I O
like O
to O
pass O
the O
time O
by O
imagining O
what O
life O
would O
be O
like O
if O
Howard O
Schultz O
had O
boarded O
the O
wrong O
plane O
in O
1981 O
and O
flown O
to O
Penang B-LOC
instead O
of O

. O

Starbucks B-EST
, O
the O
company O
he O
joined O
after O
that O
trip O
and O
would O
eventually O
lead O
, O
might O
teach O
its O
employees O
the O
fine O
arts O
of O
Malaysian B-CUISINE
kopi B-FOOD
, O
brewed O
by O
pouring O
hot O
water B-FOOD
over O
grounds B-FOOD
in O
the O
bottom O
of O
a O
sock O

rather O
than O
show O
them O
how O

operate O
an O
espresso O
machine O
. O

Instead O
of O
white B-DISH
- I-DISH
chocolate I-DISH
mocha O
lattes O
, O
we O
would O
drink O
bek B-DISH
- O

white B-FOOD
coffee I-FOOD

brewed O
from O
beans B-FOOD
that O
are O
lightly O
roasted O
in O
palm B-FOOD

would O
just O
be O

C O
kosong O
, O
or O
strong O
black B-FOOD
coffee I-FOOD

unsweetened B-FOOD
condensed I-FOOD

, O
would O
have O
entered O
the O
American O

along O
with O
kopi B-DISH
tarik I-DISH
, O
the O
same O
drink O
made O
with O

There O
would O
be O
no O

drew O
swans O

elephants O
in O

froth I-FOOD
, O

in O

we O

the O

it O

In O
other O
words O

the O

A O
typical O
Malaysian B-CUISINE
kopitiam B-TYPE
is O
a O
ramshackle O
hangout O
where O
people O
drop O
in O
to O
read O
the O
morning O
paper O

grab O
breakfast O

catch O
up O
on O
neighborhood O

do O
all O
the O
other O
things O
that O
classically O
accompany O
a O
cup O
of O
tea B-FOOD

coffee B-FOOD

Something O
of O
that O

pervades O

Kopitiam B-EST

reviewed O
by O
Ligaya O
Mishan O
in O
a O
2015 O
Hungry O
City O
column O
, O
was O
situated O
around O
the O
corner O
on O
Canal B-LOC
Street I-LOC

had O
just O
four O
seats O
at O
a O
single O
counter O

In O
June O
, O
Ms. O
Pang O
and O
her O
new O
business O
partner O
, O
Moonlynn O
Tsai O
, O
relocated O
to O
a O
larger O
, O
if O
still O
fairly O
intimate O
, O
space O
a O
few O

the O

You O
order O
at O
the O

on O
a O
metal O
stand O
, O
a O
kind O
of O

If O

show O
up O

to O
come O
by O

the O
room O
has O
a O
languid O

you O
could O
get O
just O
a O
cup O
of O
bek B-DISH

kopi O
and O
linger O
over O
it O
with O
a O

You O
will O
probably O
want O
more O

a O
particular O
favorite O
at O
breakfast O

I O
do O

another O
kitchen O

the O

of O
coconut B-FOOD

infuse O
the O

elegantly O

or O
where O
the O
tiny O

fish I-FOOD
, O
which O
Kopitiam B-EST
fries O
with O
peanuts B-FOOD
, O
form O
a O
caramelized O
crust B-FOOD
that O
erases O
the O
distinction O
between O
sweet O
and O
savory O
. O

Or O
your O
breakfast O
could O
be O
a O
bowl O
of O
two O
eggs B-FOOD
boiled O
just O
long O
enough O
to O
turn O
the O
whites O
opaque O
while O
leaving O
the O
yolks B-FOOD
free O
to O
billow O
into O
mushroom B-FOOD
- I-FOOD

the O

on O
the O

enough O

eye I-FOOD
chiles O

Rice B-FOOD
vermicelli I-FOOD
can O
be O
added O

too O
, O
but O
the O
soup B-FOOD
is O
easier O
to O
appreciate O
in O
pure O
liquid O

For O
mornings O
when O
nothing O
but O
a O
cannonball O
dive O
into O

Any O
of O
these O
could O
make O
a O
small O
meal O

But O
one O
of O
the O
most O
inviting O
aspects O
of O
Kopitiam B-EST
is O
Ms. O
Pang O
's O
fidelity O
to O
the O
Malaysian O
love O
of O

leaf O
sauce O
-- O
any O
of O
them O
makes O
a O
fine O
appetizer O
, O
but O
each O
could O
just O
as O
easily O
be O
the O
entire O
goal O
of O
a O
between O
- O
meals O
stop O
at O
Kopitiam B-EST
. O

For O
that O
matter O
, O
so O
could O
the O
small O

like O

or O

- O
made O
coconut B-FOOD

. O

Ms. O
Pang O
is O
devoted O
to O
cakes B-FOOD
as O
well O
. O

You O
get O
the O
sense O
that O
if O
it O
were O
physically O
possible O
, O
she O
'd O
bake O
every O
cake B-FOOD
she O
knows O
every O
day O
, O
but O
she O
settles O
for O
one O
or O
two O
in O
an O
unpredictable O
rotation O
. O

You O
may O
find O
the O
caramel B-DISH
- I-DISH
brown I-DISH
honeycomb O
cake O
, O
with O
its O
intriguing O
structure O
of O
hollow O
vertical O
columns O
at O
the O
bottom O
, O
or O
you O
may O
find O
her O
coconut B-DISH
cake I-DISH
, O
or O
there O
may O
be O
some O
fresh O
surprise O
. O

Snacks O
and O
sweets O
tend O
to O
get O
edged O
out O
of O
the O
spotlight O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
restaurants O
, O
where O
there O
's O
always O
pressure O
to O
order O
something O
big O
. O

This O
is O
, O
after O
all O
, O
a O
city O
that O
turned O
the O
casual O
tapas B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
into O
the O
peculiar O
genre O
known O
as O
the O
tapas B-TYPE
restaurant I-TYPE
. O

There O
is O
no O
such O
pressure O
inside O
Kopitiam B-EST
, O
at O
least O
on O
weekdays O
. O

Weekend O
brunch O
is O
another O
story O
, O
as O
it O
often O
is O
. O

The O
menu O
is O
the O
same O
, O
but O
the O
crowds O
thicken O
. O

A O
sign O
- O
in O
sheet O
is O
kept O
outside O
the O
door O
, O
next O
to O
the O
pink O
pay O
phone O
( O
25 O
cents O
; O
it O
works O
) O
, O
and O
hopeful O
customers O
sit O
on O
ceramic O
garden O
stools O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
stoop O
listening O
for O
their O
names O
. O

When O
you O
're O
finally O
called O
, O
you O
may O
feel O
silly O
getting O
nothing O
more O
than O
tannic B-DISH
milky I-DISH
tea I-DISH
and O
a O
bundle O
of O
blue B-DISH
sticky I-DISH
rice I-DISH
. O

And O
when O
demand O
peaks O
, O
chaos O
can O
creep O
in O
, O
suggesting O
that O
Kopitiam B-EST
is O
still O
figuring O
out O
the O
mechanics O
of O
its O
larger O
space O
. O

Servers O
may O
pop O
by O
anxiously O
to O
ask O
, O
" O
Did O
you O
get O
all O
your O
food O
? O
" O
and O
the O
answer O
may O
be O
no O
. O

Drink O
orders O
may O
stack O
up O
. O

Once O
the O
white B-DISH
coffee I-DISH
was O
off O
the O
menu O
; O
another O
time O
, O
no O
coffee B-FOOD
at O
all O
was O
being O
poured O
; O
and O
for O
a O
short O
time O
one O
day O
, O
both O
coffee B-FOOD
and O
tea B-FOOD
were O
unavailable O
, O
an O
awkward O
state O
of O
affairs O
for O
a O
coffee B-TYPE
and I-TYPE
tea I-TYPE
parlor I-TYPE
. O

Even O
with O
a O
backlog O
of O
tickets O
, O
though O
, O
the O
food O
trickling O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
is O
almost O
unfailingly O
terrific O
. O

Maybe O
the O
stir B-DISH
- I-DISH
fried I-DISH
duck O
tongues O
I O
ate O
last O
time O
could O
have O
slid O
from O
their O
cartilaginous O
framework O
more O
easily O
. O

Then O
again O
, O
maybe O
I O
was O
n't O
in O
the O
right O
mood O
for O
duck B-FOOD
tongues I-FOOD

During O
the O
five O
years O
Village B-EST
Cafe I-EST
has O
been O
open O
, O
I O
must O
have O
driven O
the O
length O
of O
Coney B-LOC
Island I-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
a O
dozen O
times O
without O
noticing O
it O
. O

At O
best O
I O
might O
have O
spotted O
the O
tiny O
parking O
lot O
in O
Midwood B-LOC
, O
with O
tattered O
red O
, O
blue O
and O
silver O
streamers O
flapping O
over O
its O
10 O
or O
so O
spaces O
, O
giving O
it O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
world O
's O
smallest O
used O
- O
car O
dealership O
. O

In O
the O
back O
is O
a O
wide O
, O
single O
- O
story O
structure O
that O
looks O
like O
the O
trailer O
office O
where O
you O
would O
sit O
down O
to O
discuss O
loan O
options O
with O
Marty O
from O
financing O
. O

But O
that O
building O
is O
an O
Azerbaijani B-CUISINE
restaurant O
that O
stands O
out O
among O
the O
dining O
outposts O
of O
former O
Soviet B-LOC
republics I-LOC
that O
stretch O
north O
from O
Brighton B-LOC
Beach I-LOC
, O
and O
each O
time O
I O
've O
gone O
inside O
I O
was O
given O
not O
a O
credit O
check O
, O
but O
a O
test O
of O
my O
appetite O
's O
limits O
. O

This O
is O
not O
just O
because O
almost O
every O
platter O
of O
food O
that O
leaves O
the O
kitchen O
at O
Village B-EST
Cafe I-EST
seems O
intended O
to O
feed O
an O
actual O
village O
. O

I O
run O
into O
trouble O
because O
there O
are O
so O
many O
things O
I O
want O
to O
order O
and O
so O
few O
things O
I O
am O
willing O
to O
leave O
on O
the O
table O
as O
the O
meal O
winds O
down O
. O

There O
will O
never O
be O
a O
time O
when O
I O
go O
to O
Village B-EST
Cafe I-EST
and O
decide O
not O
to O
have O
at O
least O
one O
qutab B-DISH
, O
if O
not O
all O
three O
. O

The O
menu O
gives O
the O
name O
of O
this O
delicate O
Azerbaijani B-CUISINE
flatbread B-FOOD
, O
the O
diameter O
of O
a O
pita B-FOOD
but O
thinner O
, O
as O
kutaby B-FOOD
. O

Either O
way O
, O
it O
is O
very O
good O
when O
stuffed O
with O
minced B-FOOD
, I-FOOD
quietly I-FOOD
spiced I-FOOD
chicken O
or O
lamb B-FOOD
. O

It O
is O
exceptional O
when O
filled O
with O
greens B-FOOD
: O
spinach B-FOOD
, O
scallions B-FOOD
, O
and O
dill B-FOOD
and O
cilantro B-FOOD
, O
two O
fresh O
herbs O
that O
turn O
up O
again O
and O
again O
in O
Azerbaijani B-CUISINE
cooking O
. O

I O
will O
always O
want O
the O
crimped B-DISH
dumplings I-DISH
, O
the O
size O
and O
shape O
of O
chicken B-FOOD
drumettes I-FOOD
, O
that O
the O
English B-CUISINE
menu O
calls O
ravioli B-DISH
and O
the O
servers O
call O
pelmeni B-DISH
. O

Filled O
with O
chicken B-FOOD
or O
lamb B-FOOD
, O
these O
dumplings B-FOOD
can O
be O
boiled O
, O
but O
the O
urge O
to O
ask O
for O
them O
fried O
is O
overwhelming O
, O
and O
the O
fried O
ones O
are O
better O
dunked O
in O
the O
tomato B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
pepper O
sauce O
that O
I O
would O
call O
salsa B-FOOD
if O
I O
were O
not O
in O
an O
Azerbaijani B-CUISINE
restaurant O
. O

There O
will O
be O
liver B-FOOD
on O
my O
table O
, O
too O

it O

Turkish B-CUISINE
style O

little O
fried O
cubes O
under O
a O
tart O
purple O
dusting O
of O
ground B-FOOD
sumac I-FOOD

Or O
the O

be O
added O
to O

Whether O
I O
will O
eat O
guru B-DISH
hingal I-DISH
will O
depend O
on O
how O
far O
in O
advance O
I O
've O
planned O
my O
meal O
, O
because O
it O
generally O
has O
to O
be O
ordered O
a O
day O

. O

It O
is O
a O
noodle B-FOOD

: O
very O
thin O

wide O

under O
a O

and I-FOOD
ground I-FOOD
lamb I-FOOD
fried O
in O
its O
own O
fat O
until O
it O
is O
magnificently O
crunchy O
. O

If O
you O
poured O
chile B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
over O
guru B-DISH
hingal I-DISH
, O
it O
would O
taste O
Sichuanese B-CUISINE
; O
stew O
the O
lamb B-FOOD
with O
tomatoes B-FOOD
and O
you O
could O
mistake O
the O
sauce O
for O
Bolognese B-CUISINE
. O

But O
it O
's O
from O
Azerbaijan B-LOC
, O
and O
it O
's O
good O
with O
yogurt B-FOOD
. O

And O
I O
will O
have O
soup B-FOOD
, O
even O
if O
nobody O
else O
does O
, O
because O
Village B-EST

The O

too O
, O
if O
you O
can O
get O
over O
some O

The O
menu O
was O
evidently O
written O

The O

But O
really O
, O
the O
best O
place O
to O
go O
once O
all O
the O

have O
been O
polished O
off O
is O
the O

The O
quail B-DISH

The O
grilled B-DISH

begin O

end O
with O
blistered B-FOOD

blame O
Mr. O

for O
not O
wanting O
to O
open O
a O

A O

there O

At O
their O

fleshed O
out O

The O

you O
see O

idea O
of O
tying O
the O
restaurant O
to O
the O
history O
of O
Life O
magazine O
, O
which O
was O
once O
published O
in O
the O

building O
, O
and O
to O
Henry O
Luce O
, O
who O
bought O
it O
in O
1936 O
, O
then O
radically O
remade O
it O
and O
moved O
it O
to O
other O
quarters O
. O

This O
concept O
was O
so O
wispy O
that O
Henry B-EST
's O
first O
chef O
, O
Michael O
Vignola O
, O
resorted O
to O
an O

Just O
how O
vast O
Mr. O
Johnson O
's O
scope O
has O
become O
will O
be O
clear O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
appetizer O

( O
Here O
I O
am O
assuming O
that O
you O
have O
chosen O
a O
traditional O

than O
eating O
all O

this O

dotted O
with O
a O

piri O

is O
less O

you O

this O

of O

The O
spinach B-FOOD

is O
a O
little O
joyless O
, O
but O
the O
inky O
puree O
of O
eggplant B-FOOD
sweetened O
with O
dates B-FOOD
is O
a O
terrific O
idea O
. O

Why O
Mr. O
Johnson O
puts O
a O
fried B-FOOD
egg I-FOOD
on O
the O
roti B-FOOD
is O
unclear O
. O

When O
your O
meal O
at O
Henry B-EST

over O

you O
may O
wish O
you O
had O

While O
it O

going O
on O

, O
you O
generally O
flow O
with O
the O
inner O

Generally O

not O

I O
believe O

of O

that O

You O
could O
say O
the O
same O
about O
the O
intensely O
herb O
- O
scented O
seafood B-FOOD
broth I-FOOD
in O
a O
seafood B-DISH
boil I-DISH
that O
Mr. O
Johnson O
calls O
the O
Afropot B-DISH
; O
the O
clams B-FOOD
and O
king B-FOOD
crab I-FOOD
legs I-FOOD
were O
very O
good O
, O
but O
the O
prawns B-FOOD
were O
unappealingly O
soft O
and O
the O
mussels B-FOOD
not O
quite O
fleshy O
enough O
. O

The O
cooking O
, O
though O
, O
has O
been O
getting O
tighter O
over O
the O
past O
month O
, O
picking O
up O
from O
a O
first O
and O
somewhat O
droopy O
meal O
on O
a O
night O
when O
Mr. O
Johnson O
was O
not O
in O
the O
kitchen O
. O

Tamarind B-DISH
jerk I-DISH
chicken I-DISH
had O
no O
spice O
to O
speak O
of O
. O

A O
parcel O
of O
rice B-FOOD
supposedly O
inspired O
by O
Dominican B-DISH
concon I-DISH
had O
as O
much O
crunch O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
left O
out O
on O
the O
counter O
overnight O
, O
and O
the O
eggplant B-FOOD
curry I-FOOD
ladled O
over O
it O
tasted O
more O
like O
a O
halfheartedly O
seasoned O
tomato B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
. O

The O
second O
time O
I O
tried O
it O
, O
the O
rice B-FOOD
had O
a O
golden O
crackle O
and O
the O
curry B-FOOD
was O
worth O
paying O
attention O
to O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
seared B-DISH
scallops I-DISH
in O
a O
remarkably O
good O
hominy B-FOOD
broth I-FOOD
with O
cilantro B-FOOD
pistou I-FOOD
, O
those O
bone B-DISH
- I-DISH
in O
ribs O
are O
the O
most O
rewarding O
main O
course O
. O

The O
rewards O
are O
not O
so O
much O
the O
short B-DISH
ribs I-DISH
themselves O
, O
though O
they O
are O
flavorful O
and O
tender O
; O
the O
thrill O
of O
the O
dish O
is O
in O
the O
battery O
of O
little O
sides O
like O
stir B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
fried O
millet O
, O
spiced B-FOOD
black I-FOOD
beans I-FOOD
and O
a O
hoisin B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
I O
wanted O
to O
take O
home O
to O
keep O
on O
hand O
for O
Chinese B-CUISINE
- O
food O
emergencies O
. O

I O
also O
thought O
about O
pocketing O
a O
Foie B-DISH
Crispy I-DISH
Treat I-DISH
, O
and O
I O
would O
have O
gotten O
away O
with O
it O
because O
everybody O
else O
at O
the O
table O
thought O
they O
were O
too O
weird O
. O

Weird O
they O
are O
, O
but O
interesting O
, O
too O
. O

Maybe O
you O
'd O
be O
happier O
with O
the O
sweet B-DISH
potato I-DISH
pie I-DISH
in O
a O
crisp O
butter B-FOOD
crust I-FOOD
, O
very O
old O
school O
apart O
from O
the O
purple B-FOOD
yam I-FOOD
in O
the O
filling O
. O

True O
, O
at O
some O
point O
in O
your O
meal O
a O
hotel O
guest O
may O
decide O
to O
march O
through O
the O
dining O
room O
with O
a O
full O
set O
of O
luggage O
. O

But O
under O
Mr. O
Johnson O
, O
Henry B-EST
is O
under O
no O
risk O
of O
being O
capsized O
by O
that O
kind O
of O
distraction O
. O

He O
has O
pulled O
the O
restaurant O
back O
from O
the O
edge O
of O
failure O
, O
and O
that O
's O
a O
rare O
trick O

the O
New B-LOC

pizza B-FOOD

the O

aspects O

product O

on O

It O
is O
as O
if O
Frank O

The O

the O

of O
what O
Mama B-EST

Too O
calls O
the O
" O

" O
is O
brown O
, O
more O
rough O

baked O

ferocious O

You O
could O
tear O
it O
off O

enjoy O
it O
on O
its O
own O
, O
or O
maybe O
with O
butter B-FOOD
or O
olive B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
, O
just O
as O
you O
can O
with O
the O
best O
Neapolitans B-DISH

Yet O
the O
flat O
layer O
of O
crust B-FOOD
on O
the O
bottom O
is O
firm O

without O

you O
can O
hold O
it O

by O
the O

it O
will O
stay O
flat O
and O

As O
they O
do O
at O
Totonno B-EST

and O
some O
other O
brick O

oven O
pizzerias B-TYPE
, O
Mr. O
Tuttolomondo O
lays O
the O
cheese B-FOOD
down O
before O
the O
sauce B-FOOD
. O

Rather O
than O
drippy O
, O
milky O
discs O
of O
fresh B-FOOD
mozzarella I-FOOD
, O
though O
, O
he O
covers O
the O
raw B-FOOD
dough I-FOOD
( O
after O
priming O
it O
with O
olive B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
) O
in O

that O
the O

. O

Over O
this O
, O
he O
ladles O
a O
few O
blots O
of O
tomato B-FOOD
pulp I-FOOD
. O

This O
helps O
the O
crust B-FOOD
to O
bake O
through O
without O
getting O
soggy O
, O
keeps O
the O
cheese B-FOOD
from O
sliding O
off O
the O
crust B-FOOD
, O
and O
most O
of O
all O
lets O
you O
taste O
the O
tomatoes B-FOOD
, O
which O
are O
very O
good O
. O

You O
could O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
think O
of O
the O
house O
slice O
as O
a O
white B-DISH
pizza I-DISH
with I-DISH
tomato I-DISH

After O
the O

out O

sprinkles O
it O
with O
grated O

you O

you O

the O

Tuttolomondo O
does O
not O
fetishize O
the O
past O
. O

Perhaps O
this O
is O
because O
he O
lived O
it O
. O

For O
almost O
60 O
years O
his O
family O
has O
owned O
a O
series O
of O
old O
- O
school O
slice B-TYPE
joints I-TYPE
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

The O
current O
incarnation O
is O
literally O
on O
a O
street O
corner O
, O
at O
the O
intersection O
of O
106th B-LOC
Street I-LOC
and I-LOC
Amsterdam I-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
. O

It O
is O
called O
Mama B-EST
's I-EST
Pizza O
. O

He O
did O
n't O
open O
Mama B-EST
's I-EST
Too O
a O
block O
away O
to O
outdo O
his O
parents O
; O
he O
's O
bringing O
their O
product O
into O
a O
new O
era O
. O

If O
the O
neoclassicists O
are O
like O
the O
folk O
revivalists O
who O
collected O
old O
acoustic O
78s O
, O
he O
is O
Dylan O
at O
the O
Newport O
Folk O
Festival O
in O
1965 O
. O

When O
Mama B-EST
's I-EST
Too O
opened O
in O
December O
, O
it O
also O
served O
housemade O
pasta O
. O

It O
's O
still O
on O
the O
menu O
board O
that O
hangs O
on O
one O
wall O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Tuttolomondo O
has O
stopped O
serving O
it O
to O
concentrate O
on O
pizza B-FOOD
. O

Besides O
the O
house B-DISH
slice I-DISH
, O
he O
also O
makes O
squares O
that O
he O
sees O
as O
a O
marriage O
of O
rectangular O
Sicilian B-FOOD
pizza I-FOOD
with O
Roman B-CUISINE
pizza B-FOOD
al I-FOOD
taglio I-FOOD
. O

The O
crust B-FOOD
is O
much O
taller O
than O
the O
Roman O
style O
, O
and O
taller O
than O
some O
Sicilians O
, O
too O
, O
but O
it O
is O
airy O
and O
chewy O
. O

On O
the O
bottom O
it O
has O
the O
bronze O
color O
, O
the O
cratered O
surface O
and O
the O
pan O
- O
fried O
crunch O
of O
the O
bread B-FOOD
on O
a O
grilled B-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
sandwich I-FOOD
. O

The O
edges O
, O
where O
the O
dough B-FOOD
meets O
the O
pan O
, O
have O
a O
gold O
fringe O
of O
browned O
cheese O
, O
known O
among O
students O
of O
pizza O
styles O
as O
a O
" O
frico O
crust O
. O
" O

This O
fringe O
is O
, O
of O
course O
, O
crunchy O
and O
delicious O
. O

The O
most O
impressive O
square O
is O
, O
I O
think O
, O
the O
pepperoni B-FOOD
. O

Unlike O
most O
of O
the O
others O
, O
it O
incorporates O
tomato B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
. O

The O
mozzarella B-FOOD
is O
baked O
until O
it O
begins O
to O
brown O
. O

The O
pepperoni B-FOOD
slices O
are O
small O
and O
concave O
, O
like O
contact O
lenses O
made O
of O
meat O
. O

Crunchy O
around O
the O
rims O
, O
these O
little O
cups O
are O
half O
- O
filled O
with O
spicy O
red O
oil O
. O

It O
may O
sound O
as O
if O
I O
approached O
this O
slice O
with O
cool O
, O
analytical O
detachment O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
I O
ripped O
into O
it O
like O
a O
pack O
of O
hyenas O
. O

The O
other O
squares O
tend O
to O
be O
white B-FOOD
pies I-FOOD
with I-FOOD
toppings I-FOOD
. O

Again O
, O
tomato B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
is O
one O
of O
the O
toppings O
. O

In O
one O
case O
it O
's O
a O
thick O
and O
creamy O
layer O
of O
vodka B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
, O
one O
of O
the O
ideas O
that O
separates O
Mama B-EST
's I-EST
Too O
from O
the O
neoclassicists O
. O

Mr. O
Tuttolomondo O
also O
makes O
a O
cacio B-DISH
e I-DISH
pepe I-DISH
Sicilian I-DISH
pie I-DISH
, O
essentially O
a O
four B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
cheese O
pizza O
in O
which O
one O
of O
the O
cheeses B-FOOD
is O
pecorino B-FOOD
; O
the O
whole O
slice O
hums O
with O
black B-FOOD
pepper I-FOOD
. O

The O
square O
topped O
with O
Gorgonzola B-FOOD
dolce I-FOOD
and O
pears B-FOOD
works O
in O
a O
way O
that O
combination O
often O
does O
n't O
, O
although O
half O
a O
slice O
was O
enough O
for O
me O
. O

The O
shop O
is O
small O
, O
and O
if O
you O
sit O
at O
one O
of O
the O
handful O
of O
red O
counter O
stools O
you O
will O
share O
the O
small O
tiled O
floor O
up O
front O
with O
neighbors O
waiting O
for O
takeout O
and O
delivery O
guys O
. O

There O
are O
no O
vintage O
soda O
refrigerators O
or O
letterboard O
signs O
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
small O
photograph O
of O
Robert O
De O
Niro O
eating O
pizza B-FOOD
and O
a O
much O
bigger O

Travolta O

" O
Saturday O
Night O
Fever O
, O
" O
biting O
into O
his O
double O

. O

The O
picture O
is O
in O
black O
and O
white O
except O
for O
the O
pizza B-FOOD
. O

Tinted O
orange O
and O
red O

it O
glows O
like O

Almost O
everybody O
is O
calling O
Misi B-EST
, O
the O
latest O
endeavor O
from O
the O
chef O
Missy O
Robbins O
, O
a O
pasta B-TYPE
restaurant I-TYPE
. O

That O
's O
not O
quite O
right O
. O

Yes O
, O
Ms. O
Robbins O
has O
given O
half O
of O
her O
menu O
over O
to O
long O
noodles B-FOOD
and O
short O
ones O
; O
strands O
of O
linguine B-FOOD
with O
chopped O
garlic B-FOOD
and O
a O
double O
dose O
of O
fish B-FOOD
in O
the O
form O
of O
chopped O
anchovies B-FOOD
and O
drizzled O
colatura B-FOOD
; O
circles O
filled O
with O
ricotta B-FOOD
whipped O
until O
it O
is O
as O
soft O
as O
cream B-FOOD
; O
pinched O
rings O
of O
tortelli B-FOOD
stuffed O
with O
mascarpone B-FOOD
and O
spinach B-FOOD
; O
the O
deeply O
ridged O
Sardinian B-CUISINE
shells O
known O
as O
malloreddus B-FOOD
; O
and O
other O
Italian B-CUISINE
marvels O
of O
starch O
formation O
. O

True O
, O
anybody O
who O
has O
been O
to O
Ms. O
Robbins O
's O
other O
restaurant O
, O
Lilia B-EST
, O
also O
located O
in O
Williamsburg B-LOC
, I-LOC
Brooklyn O
, O
knows O
that O
the O
pasta B-FOOD
there O
reliably O
steals O
the O
show O
from O
everything O
else O
on O
the O
table O
. O

When O
those O
people O
show O
up O
at O
Misi B-EST
, O
odds O
are O
good O
that O
they O
will O
not O
have O
chosen O
that O
day O
to O
start O
a O
keto B-DIET
diet O
. O

Moreover O
, O
Misi B-EST
has O
a O
greater O
variety O
of O
pasta B-FOOD
than O
Lilia B-EST
, O
so O
many O
that O
the O
architecture O
makes O
space O
for O
them O
. O

Misi B-EST
is O
across O
the O
street O
from O
the O
old O
Domino B-LOC
refinery I-LOC
on O
the O
East B-LOC
River I-LOC
, O
where O
the O
cranes O
used O
to O
unload O
sugar B-FOOD
from O
barges O
in O
the O
open O
air O
so O
that O
on O
days O
when O
the O
wind O
was O
right O
you O
could O
taste O
it O
on O
your O
tongue O
a O
mile O
away O
. O

Next O
to O
the O
dining O
room O
, O
facing O
the O
factory O
's O
remains O
, O
is O
a O
separate O
, O
glassed O
- O
in O
workshop O
where O
the O
temperature O
and O
humidity O
are O
kept O
at O
consistent O
dough B-FOOD
- O
friendly O
levels O
. O

There O
, O
the O
long O
noodles B-FOOD
, O
etc O
. O
, O
are O
rolled O
out O
and O
cut O
long O
before O
5:30 O
each O
night O
, O
when O
Misi B-EST
's O
front O
door O
is O
unlocked O
and O
the O
crowd O
waiting O
in O
line O
for O
walk O
- O
in O
seats O
begins O
to O
snake O
eagerly O
forward O
. O

And O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
if O
you O
watch O
Ms. O
Robbins O
and O
her O
kitchen O
crew O
at O
the O
end O
of O
one O
of O
two O
long O
dining O
counters O
, O
you O
'll O
see O
the O
same O
quick O
motion O
over O
and O
over O
: O
an O
almost O
surreptitiously O
quick O
trip O
of O
hand O
to O
mouth O
, O
a O
sharp O
bite O
and O
an O
appraising O
chew O
to O
decide O
if O
that O
batch O
of O
pasta B-FOOD
is O
ready O
to O
be O
pulled O
from O
the O
water O
. O

Some O
chefs O
show O
their O
mastery O
over O
pasta B-FOOD
by O
pressing O
it O
thinner O
than O
a O
screen O
protector O
for O
an O
iPhone O
. O

Ms. O
Robbins O
likes O
hers O
to O
have O
body O
and O
heft O
, O
and O
the O
chew O
test O
is O
the O
most O
reliable O
way O
to O
tell O
when O
thick O
pasta B-FOOD
like O
that O
is O
ready O
. O

You O
are O
very O
unlikely O
to O
get O
a O
piece O
that O
is O
undercooked O
at O
its O
core O
, O
or O
one O
that O
does O
n't O
fight O
back O
enough O
to O
let O
you O
know O
it O
is O
still O
alive O
. O

You O
get O
this O
just O
- O
in O
- O
between O
texture O
in O
the O
stubs O
of O
mezze B-FOOD
rigatoni I-FOOD
with O
a O
simple O
, O
glossy O
, O
ripe O
tomato B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
that O
's O
been O
stewed O
with O
whole O
garlic B-FOOD
cloves I-FOOD
-- O
30 O
to O
a O
batch O
, O
according O
to O
the O
menu O
. O

You O
get O
it O
again O
in O
the O
corzetti B-FOOD
, O
discs O
about O
the O
diameter O
of O
a O
Red B-FOOD
Bull I-FOOD
can O
that O
are O
pressed O
with O
a O
wooden O
stamp O
to O
give O
them O
a O
target O
pattern O
. O

In O
October O
, O
Misi B-EST
served O
these O
ridged O
coins O
with O
another O
tomato B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
, O
this O
one O
barely O
cooked O
, O
just O
some O
Sungold B-FOOD
tomatoes I-FOOD
warmed O
until O
they O
broke O
open O
and O
their O
yellow O
pulp B-FOOD
spilled O
out O
. O

Fresh O
basil B-FOOD
, O
thyme B-FOOD
and O
chervil B-FOOD
were O
scattered O
over O
the O
top O
, O
as O
good O
an O
illustration O
as O
any O
of O
how O
Ms. O
Robbins O
makes O
her O
food O
stand O
out O
without O
deviating O
from O
an O
Italian B-CUISINE
reliance O
on O
simple O
, O
unmanipulated O
ingredients O
. O

But O
to O
call O
Misi B-EST
a O
pasta B-FOOD
restaurant I-FOOD
would O
be O
to O
overlook O
its O
highly O
impressive O
work O
with O
vegetables B-FOOD
. O

They O
are O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
menu O
's O
other O
half O
, O
sneakily O
headlined O
" O
antipasti O
. O
" O

This O
is O
where O
you O
will O
find O
a O
globe B-FOOD
eggplant I-FOOD
roasted O
until O
it O
is O
as O
soft O
and O
easy O
to O
spread O
as O
cream B-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
; O
the O
cut O
surfaces O
are O
dressed O
with O
Calabrian B-FOOD
chiles I-FOOD
, O
and O
the O
taste O
of O
lemon B-FOOD
juice I-FOOD
seems O
to O
have O
found O
its O
way O
to O
the O
center O
of O
the O
eggplant B-FOOD
. O

There O
are O
fleshy O
and O
firm O
chanterelles B-FOOD
, O
too O
, O
lightly O
pickled O
and O
preserved O
in O
olive B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
until O
they O
're O
brought O
to O
the O
table O
crisscrossed O
with O
rosemary B-FOOD
needles I-FOOD
. O

Grilled B-FOOD
runner I-FOOD
beans I-FOOD
with O
garlic B-FOOD
and O
chiles B-FOOD
have O
been O
around O
lately O
, O
too O
, O
in O
a O
big O
heap O
that O
I O
would O
have O
enjoyed O
more O
if O
a O
few O
stringy O
, O
leathery O
beans O
had O
not O
gotten O
past O
the O
inspectors O
in O
the O
kitchen O
. O

Like O
the O
pastas B-FOOD
, O
Misi B-EST
's O
vegetables B-FOOD
tend O
to O
bring O
together O
only O
a O
few O
ingredients O
, O
often O
applied O
in O
ways O
you O
do O
n't O
quite O
expect O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
else O
you O
will O
taste O
pistachios B-FOOD
and O
anchovies B-FOOD
combined O
with O
skinny O
, O
leaf O
- O
bud O
- O
green O
leeks B-FOOD
marinated O
in O
vinegar B-FOOD
, O
or O
a O
kind O
of O
panzanella B-FOOD
made O
with O
grilled B-FOOD
bread I-FOOD
, O
capers B-FOOD
, O
fresh O
oregano B-FOOD
and O
chunks O
of O
zucchini B-FOOD
that O
are O
still O
tender O
after O
a O
quick O
poaching O
in O
olive B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
. O

And O
though O
the O
gently O
roasted B-FOOD
tomatoes I-FOOD
wo O
n't O
come O
back O
to O
the O
menu O
until O
next O
summer O
, O
you O
can O
try O
imagining O
how O
their O
dusting O
of O
fennel B-FOOD
seeds I-FOOD
and O
cracked O
coriander B-FOOD
seeds I-FOOD
responds O
to O
a O
last O
- O
minute O
squirt O
of O
spicy B-FOOD
honey I-FOOD
. O

There O
are O
enough O
of O
these O
vegetables B-FOOD
, O
and O
enough O
meatless B-DIET
pastas B-FOOD
, O
that O
a O
vegetarian B-DIET
could O
eat O
extremely O
well O
at O
Misi B-EST
just O
by O
watching O
out O
for O
things O
like O
bottarga B-FOOD
and O
staying O
away O
entirely O
from O
the O
creamy O
pork B-FOOD
sugo I-FOOD
tossed O
with O
strangozzi B-FOOD
. O

( O
Meat B-FOOD
eaters O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
may O
find O
the O
sugo B-FOOD
helps O
restore O
chafed O
nerves O
. O
) O

Although O
Misi B-EST
does O
n't O
let O
its O
kitchen O
range O
as O
widely O
as O
Lilia B-EST
's O
, O
it O
is O
a O
more O
successful O
restaurant O
in O
several O
ways O
. O

The O
menu O
has O
been O
distilled O
down O
to O
essentials O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
enterprise O
seems O
more O
carefully O
thought O
through O
. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
on O
the O
ground O
floor O
of O
a O
new O
apartment O
building O
by O
SHoP O
Architects O
, O
who O
chose O
to O
leave O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
middle O
that O
you O
could O
fly O
a O
helicopter O
through O
. O

The O
developer O
, O
Two O
Trees O
, O
recruited O
Ms. O
Robbins O
and O
her O
business O
partner O
, O
Sean O
Feeney O
, O
and O
gave O
them O
a O
chance O
to O
build O
the O
virgin O
space O
to O
their O
needs O
. O

The O
acoustics O
are O
better O
than O
at O
Lilia B-EST
, O
and O
traffic O
between O
tables O
flows O
more O
smoothly O
. O

The O
interior O
is O
unusually O
good O
, O
with O
narrow O
horizontal O
wall O
tiles O
in O
white O
and O
nooks O
for O
stacked O
plates O
that O
make O
them O
part O
of O
the O
decor O
. O

As O
at O
Lilia B-EST
, O
the O
wine O
list O
practically O
begs O
you O
to O
take O
something O
new O
for O
a O
whirl O
: O
a O
catarratto B-FOOD
from O
Sicily B-LOC
, O
a O
Corsican B-FOOD
niellucciu I-FOOD
, O
or O
a O
croatina B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
ughetta O
blend O
from O
Lombardy B-LOC
softened O
with O
some O
uva B-FOOD
rara I-FOOD
. O

Of O
course O
, O
you O
could O
stick O
to O
a O
$ O
45 O
Lambrusco B-DISH
, O
or O
get O
a O
$ O
250 O
Champagne B-DISH
from I-DISH
David I-DISH
Leclapart I-DISH
, O
after O
which O
you O
can O
try O
flying O
through O
the O
hole O
in O
the O
building O
yourself O
. O

If O
we O
are O
striving O
for O
total O
accuracy O
, O
though O
, O
we O
need O
to O
call O
Misi B-EST
a O
pasta B-TYPE
- I-TYPE
vegetables O
- O
and O
- O
gelato O
restaurant O
. O

Its O
gelato B-FOOD
is O
made O
in O
house O
; O
there O
are O
about O
six O
kinds O
at O
any O
given O
moment O
. O

The O
flavors O
open O
up O
right O
away O
, O
in O
part O
because O
Misi B-EST
serves O
them O
just O
below O
the O
melting O
point O
and O
in O
part O
because O
the O
ingredients O
are O
used O
prodigally O
. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
almonds B-FOOD
in O
the O
almond B-FOOD
, O
and O
the O
espresso B-FOOD
could O
keep O
you O
up O
an O
extra O
hour O
. O

But O
even O
the O
unflavored O
fior B-FOOD
di I-FOOD
latte I-FOOD
, O
made O
with O
milk B-FOOD
, O
cream B-FOOD
and O
sugar B-FOOD
, O
comes O
at O
you O
in O
a O
rush O
. O

There O
are O
no O
desserts O
other O
than O
gelato B-FOOD
. O

The O
only O
decision O
to O
make O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O

Something O
has O
been O
missing O
from O
New B-LOC

current O

I O
was O

what O
it O

at O
Adda B-EST
Indian I-EST

Modernization O
is O
the O
theme O

many O
of O
the O
Indian B-CUISINE
restaurants O
that O
have O
taken O
root O
around O
the O
city O

New B-LOC

n't O
seen O
nearly O

many O
recently O
opened O
restaurants O
devoted O
to O
the O
pure O

original O
stuff O
that O
is O
getting O

There O
is O
a O
problem O

really O

And O
for O
anyone O
who O
truly O
loves O
Indian B-CUISINE
cooking O
, O
there O
is O
a O
more O
pressing O
problem O
of O
missing O
flavor O

Five O

of O

tandoori B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
, O
no O
matter O
how O
evenly O
spaced O
those O
dots O
are O

I O
had O
n't O
given O
much O
thought O
to O
either O
problem O
, O
to O
tell O
the O
truth O
, O
until O
I O
made O
it O
to O
the O
out O
- O
of O
- O
the O
- O
way O
patch O
of O
Long B-LOC
Island I-LOC
City I-LOC
where O
Adda B-EST
Indian I-EST
Canteen I-EST
operates O
. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
part O
of O
that O
neighborhood O
where O
high O
- O
rise O
apartments O
grow O
overnight O
and O
Amazon O
will O
soon O
tiptoe O
in O
with O
25,000 O
employees O

Adda B-EST
is O
east O
of O
all O
that O
, O
under O
a O
National O
Guard O
recruiting O
office O
, O
surrounded O
by O
a O
thicket O
of O
railroad O
tracks O
and O
highway O
overpasses O

Unless O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
it O
, O
you O
are O
not O
likely O
to O
end O
up O
in O
the O
small O
dining O
room O
, O
in O
which O
Indian O
tabloids O
have O
been O
upcycled O
as O
wallpaper O
. O

Once O
I O
'd O
found O
it O
, O
one O
of O
the O
first O
things O
I O
ate O
was O
the O
kaleji B-DISH
masala I-DISH
, O
chicken B-FOOD
livers I-FOOD
in O
a O
dark O
gravy B-FOOD
seasoned O
with O
fresh O
ginger B-FOOD
and O
garam B-FOOD
masala I-FOOD
. O

Right O
away O
I O
realized O
that O
this O
was O
the O
kind O
of O
Indian B-CUISINE
food O
the O
city O
has O
been O
hungry O
for O
, O
or O
at O
least O
the O
kind O
that O
I O
'd O
been O
hungry O
for O
: O
made O
with O
care O
but O
no O
pretense O
; O
seasoned O
for O
people O
who O
love O
the O
interplay O
of O
spices O
; O
presented O
without O
apology O
in O
all O
its O
brown O
, O
lumpy O
glory O
; O
and O
complex O
in O
ways O
that O
demand O
full O
attention O
. O

Adda B-EST

The O
two O
men O
already O
run O
Rahi B-EST
, O
in O
Greenwich B-LOC
Village I-LOC
, O
perhaps O
the O
best O
of O
the O
casual O
, O
modernizing O
Indian B-CUISINE
restaurants O
, O
where O
Mr. O
Pandya O
serves O
original O
notions O
like O
tandoori B-DISH
skate I-DISH
and O
sends O
almost O
everything O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
decorated O
with O
edible B-FOOD
flowers I-FOOD
. O

They O
've O
taken O
another O
angle O
at O
Adda B-EST
, O
mining O
family O
recipes O
and O
the O
lessons O
Mr. O
Pandya O
absorbed O
from O
civilian O
cooks O
around O
India B-LOC
. O

The O
menu O
travels O
beyond O
the O
standard O
north B-CUISINE
Indian I-CUISINE
dishes O
most O
New O
Yorkers O
already O
know O
, O
but O
even O
those O
dishes O
, O
when O
they O
appear O
, O
are O
prepared O
so O
emphatically O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
resemble O
anything O
else O
in O
town O
. O

Adda B-EST
is O
a O
lusty O
, O
full O
- O
throated O
defense O
of O
traditional O
cooking O

Saag B-DISH
paneer I-DISH

coltishly O
energetic O
at O
Adda B-EST

The O
cheese B-FOOD
is O
made O
in O
the O
kitchen O
, O
and O
it O
's O
gorgeously O
soft O
, O
while O
the O

is O
a O
tart O

peppery O
mix O
of O
wilted O
arugula B-FOOD
, O
sorrel B-FOOD

Mr. O
Pandya O
does O
very O
well O
by O
the O
class O
of O
sidewalk O
treats O
called O
chaat B-FOOD
. O

Each O
delivers O
the O
messy O
riot O
you O
'd O
hope O
for O
, O
busy O
with O
crunchy O
hieroglyphs O
of O
fried B-FOOD
noodles I-FOOD
and O
splattered O
with O
yogurt B-FOOD
and O
tamarind B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
. O

One O
chaat B-FOOD
is O
anchored O
by O
a O
big O
kale B-FOOD
fritter I-FOOD
, O
another O
by O
several O
smaller O
chips O
of O
battered B-FOOD
, I-FOOD
spiced I-FOOD
lentil I-FOOD
cakes O
, O
and O
a O
third O
by O
fried B-FOOD
smashed I-FOOD
potatoes I-FOOD
and O
chickpeas B-FOOD
. O

But O
discerning O
chaat B-FOOD
lovers O
should O
probably O
go O
directly O
to O
the O
dahi B-FOOD
batata I-FOOD
puri I-FOOD
, O
soft O
potato B-FOOD
packed O
into O
hollow O
globes O
of O
fried B-FOOD
dough I-FOOD
that O
you O
can O
pick O
up O
and O
eat O
with O
your O
fingers O
, O
like O
chocolates B-FOOD
. O

Anything O
that O
passes O
through O
Adda B-EST
's O
tandoor O
is O
worth O
investigating O
. O

kebabs I-DISH

about O

to O
a O

After O
tasting O
it O

I O

ready O
to O

He O
was O
enthusiastic O
about O
almost O
everything O

as O
it O
turned O
out O

the O
service O
at O
Adda B-EST
is O
nothing O
if O
not O
eager O
to O
talk O
up O
the O
food O

It O
was O

in O
fact O

one O
of O
the O
fiercest O
biryanis B-FOOD
I O
've O
ever O
met O

the O

that O
I O
could O
taste O
the O

crisp O

Few O
things O
on O
the O
menu O
are O
quite O
as O
chile B-FOOD
- O
drenched O
as O
the O
biryani B-FOOD
, O
but O
Mr. O
Pandya O
definitely O
favors O
India B-LOC
's O
more O
intense O
flavors O

Adda B-EST

It O

you O
get O
it O
on O
a O
night O
when O
the O
prawns B-FOOD
are O
firm O
and O
not O
spongy O
. O
) O

And O
while O
Adda B-EST
does O
serve O
some O
vegetables B-FOOD
, O
it O
would O
not O
make O
my O
list O
of O
the O
20 O
best O

Indian B-CUISINE
restaurants O

It O

how O
good O
Delhi B-DISH

if O

believe O
that O

chunks O
of O
lamb B-FOOD

with O
spiced B-FOOD
minced I-FOOD
lamb I-FOOD
, O
is O
not O
redundant O
but O
luxurious O
. O

And O
Adda B-EST
is O
the O
first O
restaurant O
I O
'd O
tell O
you O
about O
if O
you O
woke O
up O
one O
morning O
hungry O
for O
bheja B-DISH
fry I-DISH
, O
goat B-FOOD
brains I-FOOD
cooked O
with O
onions B-FOOD
, O
ginger B-FOOD
and O
a O
considerable O
number O
of O
fresh O
green B-FOOD
chiles I-FOOD

" O
Like O
soft O
scrambled B-FOOD
eggs I-FOOD
, O
" O
our O
server O
said O
, O
accurately O
. O

I O
might O
point O
out O
that O
a O
typical O
Indian B-CUISINE
bheja B-FOOD
fry I-FOOD
is O
drier O
, O
with O
a O
higher O
ratio O
of O
brains B-FOOD
to O
sauce B-FOOD
. O

But O
I O
would O
not O
necessarily O
mean O
that O
as O
a O
complaint O

modern B-CUISINE

lasted O
about O

my O

if O
it O
is O
anything O
to O
go O
by O

a O
fisherie B-TYPE

a O
seafood B-FOOD

more O

At O
times O
Saint B-EST
Julivert I-EST
reminds O
me O
of O
Cal B-EST
Pep I-EST
, O
in O
Barcelona B-LOC
, I-LOC
Spain O
, O
whose O
plain O
, O
cramped O
counter O
looks O
like O
the O
last O
place O
in O
the O
world O
where O
you O
are O
going O
to O
have O
an O
epiphany O
of O
the O
taste O
buds O
, O
right O
up O
until O
the O
moment O
the O
txipirones B-FOOD
and O
thumbtack O
- O
size O
clams B-FOOD
knock O
you O
off O
your O
barstool O
. O

Like O
Cal B-EST
Pep I-EST
, O
and O
unlike O
nearly O
every O
other O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
restaurant O
, O
Saint B-EST
Julivert I-EST
serves O
gooseneck B-FOOD
barnacles I-FOOD
when O
they O
're O
available O
, O
boiling O
them O
with O
bay B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
and O
salt B-FOOD
and O
mounding O
them O
on O
a O
cloth O
napkin O
before O
they O
cool O
so O
that O
when O
you O
twist O
the O
wrinkled O
sheath O
of O
skin O
away O
from O
the O
sweet O
, O
edible O
meat B-FOOD
inside O
there O
is O
a O
good O
chance O
somebody O
in O
the O
vicinity O
will O
get O
hit O
with O
a O
squirt O
of O
hot O
barnacle O
juice O
. O

Mostly O
, O
though O
, O
any O
Spanish B-CUISINE
- O
ness O
in O
Saint B-EST
Julivert I-EST
has O
more O
to O
do O
with O
its O
spirit O
than O
its O
recipes O
, O
which O
come O
from O
all O
over O
: O
the O
deep O
- O
fried O
Puerto B-CUISINE
Rican I-CUISINE
cylinders O
of O
cornmeal B-FOOD
known O
as O
sorrullitos B-FOOD
; O
a O
kanpachi B-FOOD
collar I-FOOD
whose O
juicy O
meat B-FOOD
is O
shockingly O
white O
under O
a O
black O
rub O
of O
jerk B-FOOD
spices I-FOOD
; O
tender O
slices O
of O
warm O
beef B-FOOD
tenderloin I-FOOD
on O
a O
fist O
- O
size O
roll B-FOOD
, O
known O
in O
Portugal B-LOC
as O
a O
prego B-FOOD
sandwich I-FOOD
. O

There O
is O
also O
the O
crispy B-DISH
tuna I-DISH
bake I-DISH
, O
a O
peculiarly O
satisfying O
hybrid O
that O
crosses O
a O
tuna B-FOOD
noodle I-FOOD
casserole I-FOOD
by O
way O
of O
India B-LOC
with O
fideua B-FOOD
, O
the O
Spanish B-CUISINE
dish O
that O
treats O
pasta B-FOOD
like O
the O
rice B-FOOD
in O
paella B-FOOD
. O

The O
noodles B-FOOD
, O
short O
ridged O
tubes O
, O
are O
toasted O
and O
cooked O
with O
oil B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
cured O
tuna O
in O
a O
tomato B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
that O
is O
seasoned O
with O
turmeric B-FOOD
and O
curry B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
. O

It O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
fearless O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
filling O
, O
dishes O
on O
a O
menu O
that O
could O
use O
a O
little O
more O
of O
both O
qualities O
. O

Although O
Saint B-EST
Julivert I-EST
works O
with O
exceptional O
seafood B-FOOD
, O
and O
treats O
it O
with O
the O
care O
that O
fans O
of O
Ms. O
Raij O
and O
Mr. O
Montero O
have O
come O
to O
expect O
, O
the O
menu O
plays O
it O
safe O
more O
often O
than O
it O
should O
. O

Like O
all O
of O
the O
couple O
's O
restaurants O
, O
Saint B-EST
Julivert I-EST
toggles O
between O
innovation O
and O
tradition O
. O

But O
the O
other O
places O
explore O
Spanish B-CUISINE
cuisine O
, O
so O
when O
they O
toss O
off O
a O
straight O
- O
ahead O
classic O
like O
patatas B-FOOD
bravas I-FOOD
, O
there O
's O
a O
reason O
. O

When O
Saint B-EST
Julivert I-EST
serves O
fluke B-DISH
ceviche I-DISH
or O
a O
crab B-DISH
and I-DISH
avocado I-DISH
salad I-DISH
dressed O
with O
yuzu B-FOOD
juice I-FOOD
and O
trout B-FOOD
roe I-FOOD
, O
it O
can O
seem O
to O
be O
grasping O
at O
ideas O
that O
other O
restaurants O
are O
already O
doing O
-- O
even O
when O
Saint B-EST
Julivert I-EST
does O
them O
better O
. O

The O
sauteed B-DISH
skate I-DISH
splashed O
with O
Manzanilla B-FOOD
could O
not O
be O
fresher O
or O
more O
skillfully O
browned O
, O
but O
do O
the O
garlic B-FOOD
chips I-FOOD
and O
sliced O
dried B-FOOD
chiles I-FOOD
on O
top O
make O
this O
version O
of O
a O
well O
- O
known O
standard O
one O
I O
'll O
remember O
a O
month O
from O
now O
? O

Maybe O
not O
, O
although O
at O
the O
time O
I O
was O
very O
happy O
to O
have O
it O
, O
not O
least O
because O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
things O
on O
the O
menu O
the O
size O
of O
a O
standard O
main O
course O
. O

Even O
if O
you O
're O
an O
old O
hand O
at O
navigating O
the O
shallow O
waters O
of O
small O
plates O
, O
it O
can O
be O
unnervingly O
easy O
to O
spend O
more O
than O
$ O
100 O
on O
food O
and O
drinks O
at O
Saint B-EST
Julivert I-EST
and O
still O
wonder O
whether O
you O
've O
actually O
had O
dinner O
. O

Seafood B-FOOD
this O
good O
is O
expensive O
, O
but O
the O
menu O
does O
n't O
stray O
very O
far O
above O
$ O
20 O
; O
the O
result O
is O
that O
portions O
can O
seem O
somewhat O
airy O
. O

When O
there O
's O
an O
inexpensive O
opportunity O
to O
pad O
out O
a O
dish O
, O
Saint B-EST
Julivert I-EST
does O
n't O
always O
take O
it O
. O

I O
understand O
why O
I O
ca O
n't O
have O
more O
than O
three O
excellent O
wild B-FOOD
shrimp I-FOOD
in O
a O
$ O
21 O
bowl O
of O
red B-DISH
pozole I-DISH
, O
but O
could O
n't O
there O
be O
more O
than O
a O
spoonful O
of O
hominy B-FOOD
kernels O
? O

Saltines B-FOOD
fried O
in O
canola B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
are O
served O
with O
the O
ceviche B-FOOD
and O
with O
a O
cold O
and O
highly O
appealing O
bowl O
of O
pickled B-FOOD
shrimp I-FOOD
under O
pink O
pickled B-FOOD
onions I-FOOD
; O
grilled B-FOOD
bread I-FOOD
slices I-FOOD
accompany O
the O
mackerel B-FOOD
whipped O
into O
a O
hummus B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
like I-FOOD
orange O
spread O
with O
piri B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
piri O
oil O
. O

Still O
, O
each O
time O
I O
went O
, O
somebody O
at O
my O
table O
asked O
for O
more O
bread B-FOOD
. O

None O
of O
Saint B-EST
Julivert I-EST
's O
issues O
are O
insoluble O
. O

The O
lighting O
could O
be O
warmed O
up O
so O
the O
room O
looks O
less O
like O
an O
aquarium O
. O

A O
few O
more O
dishes O
you O
wo O
n't O
see O
anywhere O
else O
, O
like O
the O
tuna B-DISH
bake I-DISH
, O
would O
make O
it O
harder O
to O
resist O
. O

Another O
two O
or O
three O
large O
plates O
would O
make O
it O
a O
place O
you O
think O
of O
when O
you O
're O
hungry O
. O

The O
excellent O
$ O
19 O
prego B-DISH
sandwich I-DISH
is O
more O
snack O
than O
dinner O
, O
until O
you O
pay O
another O
$ O
7 O
to O
have O
fried B-DISH
oysters I-DISH
tucked O
into O
the O
roll B-FOOD
beside O
the O
beef B-FOOD
, O
making O
it O
into O
a O
kind O
of O
crunchy O
carpetbagger O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
that O
's O
worth O
doing O
even O
if O
you O
're O
not O
hungry O

There O

case O
to O

for O
not O
reviewing O
the O

Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
Restaurant I-EST
at O
all O
but O
just O
leaving O
it O
on O
the O
slush O
pile O
, O
and O
that O
case O
can O
be O
found O
in O
court O
records O
involving O
Julian O
Niccolini O
. O

Mr. O
Niccolini O
has O
operated O
the O
restaurant O
with O
Alex O
von O
Bidder O
since O
the O
mid-1990s O
, O
first O
at O
its O
original O
home O
in O
the O
Seagram B-LOC
Building I-LOC
and O
now O
, O
after O
a O
two O
- O
year O
hiatus O
, O
in O
a O
smaller O
berth O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
Park B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
. O

Over O
that O
time O
, O
he O
has O
frequently O
been O
celebrated O
for O
his O
charm O
. O

Less O
frequently O
, O
he O
has O
been O
a O
defendant O
in O
civil O
and O
criminal O
actions O
arising O
from O
things O
he O
was O
accused O
of O
having O
done O
to O
women O
inside O
the O
restaurant O
. O

In O
1991 O
, O
one O
of O
his O
waitresses O
sued O
Mr. O
Niccolini O
and O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
, O
citing O
sexual O
harassment O
. O

She O
claimed O
that O
for O
more O
than O
three O
years O
he O
had O
repeatedly O
rubbed O
up O
against O
her O
, O
told O
her O
in O
vulgar O
terms O
about O
his O
sexual O
urges O
and O
called O
her O
" O
slut O
, O
" O
" O
lesbian O
" O
and O
other O
things O
. O

Mr. O
Niccolini O
denied O
the O
charges O
. O

In O
2014 O
, O
a O
former O
assistant O
manager O
filed O
suit O
against O
Mr. O
Niccolini O
, O
Mr. O
von O
Bidder O
and O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
, O
alleging O
discrimination O
. O

The O
ex O
- O
manager O
said O
that O
after O
she O
returned O
from O
a O
maternity O
leave O
, O
the O
restaurant O
made O
it O
difficult O
for O
her O
to O
pump O
breast O
milk O
during O
work O
hours O
and O
, O
about O
three O
months O
later O
, O
fired O
her O
and O
replaced O
her O
with O
a O
man O
. O

In O
a O
response O
filed O
with O
the O
court O
, O
the O
defendants O
denied O
the O
allegations O
. O

Both O
suits O
were O
settled O
under O
terms O
that O
have O
not O
been O
divulged O
. O

In O
2015 O
, O
Mr. O
Niccolini O
was O
arrested O
on O
a O
felony O
charge O
of O
sexual O
abuse O
. O

According O
to O
a O
prosecutor O
, O
he O
had O
attacked O
a O
woman O
at O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
bar O
" O
with O
such O
force O
that O
he O
ripped O
her O
bra O
open O
and O
caused O
significant O
scratch O
marks O
on O
her O
back O
and O
bruising O
on O
her O
hip O
. O
" O

After O
pleading O
guilty O
the O
following O
year O
to O
a O
reduced O
charge O
of O
misdemeanor O
assault O
, O
Mr. O
Niccolini O
was O
given O
a O
" O
conditional O
discharge O
, O
" O
avoiding O
jail O
. O

I O
know O
people O
who O
will O
never O
eat O
at O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
because O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
give O
Mr. O
Niccolini O
their O
money O
. O

I O
understand O
this O
. O

I O
also O
know O
people O
in O
the O
food O
media O
who O
think O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
should O
not O
get O
any O
coverage O
as O
long O
as O
Mr. O
Niccolini O
owns O
a O
piece O
of O
it O
. O

I O
understand O
this O
, O
too O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
my O
view O
. O

[ O
Julian O
Niccolini O
has O
since O
been O
forced O
to O
resign O
from O
the O
restaurant O
. O
] O

Their O
stance O
rests O
, O
I O
think O
, O
on O
the O
idea O
that O
writing O
about O
powerful O
men O
who O
have O
been O
accused O
of O
abusing O
women O
amounts O
to O
condoning O
the O
abuse O
and O
helping O
the O
abusers O
stay O
in O
power O
. O

While O
it O
's O
true O
that O
media O
attention O
is O
often O
like O
oxygen O
to O
restaurants O
, O
critics O
have O
the O
power O
to O
tell O
a O
story O
other O
than O
the O
one O
the O
restaurant O
is O
pushing O
. O

Even O
when O
we O
're O
not O
writing O
a O
pan O
, O
a O
fair O
assessment O
often O
requires O
weaving O
shining O
threads O
with O
ugly O
ones O
. O

The O
ugliest O
threads O
at O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
happen O
to O
be O
ugly O
enough O
to O
make O
many O
people O
stay O
away O
. O

But O
there O
is O
beauty O
in O
the O
fabric O
, O
too O
. O

The O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
has O
been O
a O
significant O
force O
in O
dining O
: O
a O
pioneer O
in O
championing O
American B-CUISINE
ingredients O
and O
wine B-FOOD
; O
an O
innovator O
in O
bringing O
contemporary O
design O
into O
the O
restaurant O
world O
; O
a O
cultivator O
of O
an O
eclectic O
scene O
that O
treated O
political O
power O
, O
financial O
success O
and O
creative O
talent O
as O
coequal O
branches O
of O
a O
high O
society O
that O
was O
peculiar O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
. O

Most O
of O
this O
happened O
some O
time O
ago O
. O

In O
its O
last O
years O
in O
the O
Seagram B-LOC
Building I-LOC
, O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
had O
become O
a O
shabby O
but O
lovely O
museum O
of O
midcentury O
architecture O
and O
design O
, O
with O
martinis B-FOOD
that O
I O
did O
n't O
mind O
overpaying O
for O
and O
food O
that O
I O
did O
. O

I O
was O
curious O
about O
its O
new O
incarnation O
, O
which O
opened O
in O
August O
, O
and O
curiosity O
is O
as O
good O
a O
reason O
as O
any O
for O
a O
critic O
to O
swing O
into O
action O
. O

If O
I O
were O
writing O
the O
next O
chapter O
in O
a O
long O
history O
, O
I O
'd O
mention O
how O
gracefully O
Diego O
Garcia O
has O
grown O
into O
his O
new O
job O
as O
the O
restaurant O
's O
chef O
. O

I O
enjoyed O
Mr. O
Garcia O
's O
fish B-TYPE
cookery I-TYPE
at O
his O
last O
restaurant O
, O
a O
small O
, O
bare O
- O
bones O
place O
in O
Hell B-LOC
's I-LOC
Kitchen O
called O
Gloria B-EST
, O
but O
he O
seemed O
limited O
by O
the O
kitchen O
's O
size O
. O

He O
works O
on O
a O
grander O
scale O
now O
, O
with O
more O
expensive O
ingredients O
and O
more O
delicate O
treatments O
that O
still O
betray O
his O
creative O
streak O
. O

He O
roasts O
duck B-FOOD
because O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
is O
famous O
for O
it O
, O
and O
makes O
fresh O
pasta B-FOOD
and O
risotto B-FOOD
because O
the O
captains O
in O
their O
black O
jackets O
need O
some O
place O
to O
shave O
all O
those O
white B-FOOD
truffles I-FOOD
. O

For O
all O
intents O
and O
purposes O
, O
though O
, O
he O
has O
turned O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
into O
a O
seafood B-TYPE
restaurant I-TYPE
, O
and O
a O
very O
good O
one O
. O

It O
's O
not O
hard O
to O
believe O
he O
was O
once O
a O
sous O
- O
chef O
at O
Le B-EST
Bernardin I-EST
when O
you O
taste O
, O
say O
, O
the O
raw B-FOOD
scallop I-FOOD
slivers O
in O
citrus B-FOOD
juices I-FOOD
, O
elegantly O
equipped O
with O
tart O
apple B-FOOD
and O
caviar B-FOOD
, O
or O
the O
intensely O
smooth O
chowder B-FOOD
of O
tiny O

just O
- O
cooked O
clams B-FOOD
in O
a O
New B-LOC
England I-LOC
- O
style O
cream B-FOOD
broth I-FOOD
that O
's O
pale O
yellow O
with O
butterfat B-FOOD
. O

He O
knows O
when O
to O
show O
restraint O
and O
when O
to O
go O
all O
in O
, O
taking O
sea B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
urchin O

that O
are O
already O
head O
- O
spinningly O
rich O
and O
draping O
lobes O
of O
sea B-FOOD
urchin I-FOOD
over O
them O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
cooking O
is O
boring O
in O
the O
right O
way O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
surprises O

I O
did O

almost O
a O
warm O
confit O
. O

Other O
dishes O
were O
boring O
in O
the O
usual O
sense O
. O

The O
mustard B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
poured O
around O
the O
golden O
crab B-FOOD
cake I-FOOD
tasted O
like O
cream B-FOOD
that O
was O
shown O
a O
picture O
of O
a O
mustard B-FOOD
jar O
. O

The O
chapter O
would O
also O
depict O
the O
return O
of O
Bill O
Yosses O
. O

Anybody O
who O
ate O
his O
desserts O
before O
he O
disappeared O
into O
the O
White O
House O
wo O
n't O
be O
surprised O
by O
how O
good O
they O

They O
do O
have O
a O
slight O
Rip O

quality O
, O
suggesting O
that O
Mr. O
Yosses O
allowed O
several O
new O
waves O
in O
pastry B-FOOD
to O
pass O
him O
by O
, O
but O
that O
's O
no O
criticism O
. O

He O
makes O
a O
better O
baba B-FOOD
au I-FOOD
rhum I-FOOD
than O
almost O
anyone O
in O
town O
, O
his O
chocolate B-FOOD
tart I-FOOD
with O
a O
salted O
stripe O
of O
caramel B-FOOD
is O
both O
powerful O
and O
precise O
, O
and O
his O
hazelnut B-FOOD
financier I-FOOD
balanced O
over O
roasted B-FOOD
pears I-FOOD
is O
more O
delicious O
than O
almost O
any O
almond B-FOOD
financier I-FOOD
you O
can O
find O
. O

He O
has O
even O
improved O
the O
restaurant O
's O
signature O
, O
the O
Kate O
Pierson O
beehive O
of O
cotton B-FOOD
candy I-FOOD
that O
sails O
out O

( O
Apparently O
I O
've O
joined O
that O
club O

) O

This O
being O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
, O
the O
history O
would O
have O
to O
mention O
the O
new O
restaurant O
's O
interior O
. O

It O
reminded O
me O
of O
the O
old O
Philip O
Johnson O
dining O
rooms O
without O
making O
me O
sad O
to O
be O
here O
instead O
of O
there O
, O
a O
trick O
I O
had O
thought O
was O
impossible O
. O

The O
bronze O
bead O
curtains O
have O
transformed O
into O
strings O
of O
gilded O
glass O
baubles O
; O
the O
flatware O
and O
glasses O
pay O
homage O
to O
the O
vintage O
designs O
used O
at O
the O
original O
restaurant O
; O
and O
the O
bar O
is O
once O
again O
a O
four O
- O
sided O
island O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
lounge O
. O

For O
the O
first O
time O
you O
can O
eat O
a O
real O
meal O
there O
, O
while O
you O
watch O
the O
Grand B-LOC
Central I-LOC
- O
bound O
commuters O
outside O
and O
the O
cotton B-FOOD
candy I-FOOD
- O
bound O
regulars O
inside O
, O
generally O
a O
mature O
group O
in O
tightly O
knotted O
ties O
or O
heels O
that O
echo O
down O
the O
corridor O
to O
the O
dining O
room O
like O
the O
ticking O
of O
a O
grandfather O
clock O
. O

All O
of O
this O
and O
a O
generous O
budget O
( O
the O
prices O
are O
as O
exclusionary O
as O
ever O
) O
could O
make O
for O
a O
few O
hours O

The O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
offers O
an O
escape O
from O
the O
outside O
world O
. O

Escaping O
from O
what O
's O
inside O
, O
however O
, O
takes O
a O
mental O
effort O
that O
is O
beyond O
me O
and O
will O
probably O
be O
beyond O
many O
others O
as O
well O
, O
whether O
Mr. O
Niccolini O
is O
in O
sight O
or O
not O
. O

During O
my O
three O
meals O
, O
I O
never O
saw O
him O
. O

Restaurants O
, O
even O
grand O
ones O
like O
the O
Four B-EST
Seasons I-EST
, O
are O
intimate O
places O
; O
eating O
is O
an O
act O
that O
requires O
trust O
and O
a O
sense O
of O
safety O
. O

We O
want O
to O
get O
up O
from O
the O
table O
feeling O
restored O
on O
all O
fronts O
except O
the O
financial O
one O
. O

Mr. O
Niccolini O
's O
actions O
have O
done O
serious O
damage O
to O
his O
power O
to O
provide O
that O
feeling O
, O
even O
as O
he O
and O
Mr. O
von O
Bidder O
have O
made O
the O
restaurant O
better O
than O
it O
has O
been O
in O
years O
. O

This O

not O

Something O

at O

At O

the O

that O

This O
is O
more O
than O
can O
be O
said O
for O
the O
potato B-FOOD
chips I-FOOD

They O

The O
tartare B-FOOD

by O

is O
seasoned O
with O

which O
is O
not O

two O
people O
, O
both O
of O

the O

All O

It O

a O

you O

pick O
up O

before O
you O
realized O
that O
somebody O
had O
dumped O
the O
warm O

a O

it O

The O

seemed O
eager O
to O
oblige O
, O
but O
gave O
the O
impression O
of O
struggling O
in O
the O
face O
of O
unseen O
enemies O
. O

One O
night O
, O
asked O
" O
Still B-FOOD
or O
sparkling B-FOOD
? O
, O
" O
I O
chose O
the O
sparkling B-FOOD
water I-FOOD
. O

My O
server O
began O
to O
walk O
away O
, O
then O
turned O
on O
his O
heel O
and O
said O
, O
" O
I O
'm O
sorry O
, O
we O
're O
all O
out O
of O

" O

" O
That O

" O
I O

" O
he O
said O

" O
We O

have O
any O
draft B-FOOD

" O

After O
the O

I O
asked O
him O
for O
the O
Chocolate B-DISH
Bluebird I-DISH
. O

" O
That O
is O
our O
signature O

, O
" O
he O
said O

I O

I O
had O
read O
that O
this O

a O

he O
said O

His O
courtesy O
went O
a O

way O

Ultimately O

I O
preferred O
the O

of O

Looking O

Its O

rather O

Veselka B-EST

It O
was O
the O
start O

The O
purpose O

For O
the O

reason O

that O

not O

This O

why O

David O

have O
to O
wonder O
if O
he O
was O
being O
subversive O
when O
he O
decided O
to O
install O

Mr. O

close O

of O
the O

assigns O
high O

to O
the O

of O
some O
cultures O
and O
devalues O
the O

One O
of O
his O
greatest O
hits O
is O
a O
riff O
about O

who O
complain O
about O
$ O
17 O

paying O

If O
he O
has O
a O
routine O
about O
vertical B-TYPE

I O
've O
never O
heard O
it O
, O
but O
surely O
he O
is O
alive O
to O
the O
associations O

conjure O

from O

make O
more O

In O
the O
weeks O
after O
its O

on O
Halloween O
, O
the O

were O
worthy O
of O
the O

be O
piled O
over O
a O
bowl O
of O
rice B-FOOD
, O
but O
the O
bread B-FOOD
is O
really O
very O
good O
. O

A O
close O
relative O
of O
the O
flatbread B-FOOD
Mr. O
Chang O
's O
crew O
originated O
at O
Majordomo B-EST
in O
Los B-LOC
Angeles I-LOC
, O
it O
is O
perceptibly O
tangy O
and O
salted O
, O
without O
being O
salty O
. O

A O
couple O
of O
condiments B-FOOD
-- O
including O
habanero B-FOOD
salsa I-FOOD
and O
the O
brick O
- O
red O
Ssam B-FOOD
Sauce I-FOOD
used O
, O
in O
various O
iterations O
, O
to O
italicize O
Noodle B-EST
Bar I-EST
's O
pork B-DISH
buns I-DISH
and O
a O
hundred O
other O
creations O
in O
Mr. O
Chang O
's O
Momofuku B-EST
restaurant O
group O
-- O
are O
kept O
out O
on O
a O
counter O
alongside O
the O
moist O
towelettes O
. O

But O
they O
're O
hard O
to O
apply O
once O
a O
U B-DISH
has O
been O
rolled O
. O

What O
I O
did O
want O
was O
a O
spoonful O
or O
two O
of O
raw B-FOOD
white I-FOOD
onions I-FOOD
, O
some O
chopped O
cucumber B-FOOD
, O
maybe O
parsley B-FOOD
or O
cilantro B-FOOD
-- O
the O
kind O
of O
simple O
salad B-FOOD
that O
is O
almost O
always O
lobbed O
into O
a O
shawarma B-FOOD
or O
a O
doner B-FOOD
kebab I-FOOD
. O

Both O
the O
chicken B-FOOD
and O
pork B-FOOD
are O
slightly O
sweet O
, O
and O
could O
use O
a O
lift O
. O

The O
lunch O
menu O
also O
has O
two O
dips B-FOOD
-- O
a O
darkly O
fascinating O
, O
spicy B-DISH
eggplant I-DISH
spread I-DISH
, O
or O
whipped B-DISH
chickpeas I-DISH
whose O
sharp O
, O
pecorino B-FOOD
- O
like O
flavor O
betrays O
the O
presence O
of O
Hozon B-FOOD
, O
the O
fermented B-FOOD
chickpea I-FOOD
paste I-FOOD
invented O
in O
a O
Momofuku B-DISH
laboratory O
. O

They O
are O
alluring O
enough O
, O
but O
the O
real O
reason O
to O
order O
them O
is O
the O
bread B-FOOD
, O
puffier O
and O
softer O
than O
the O
one O
that O
wraps O
the O
U. B-DISH
A O
smaller O
version O
of O
this O
, O
maybe O
five O
inches O
across O
, O
is O
folded O
in O
half O
like O
a O
taco B-FOOD
to O
make O
a O
" O
mini B-DISH
, O
" O
which O
replaces O
the O
U B-DISH
at O
breakfast O
. O

It O
is O
no O
great O
shock O
that O
this O
bread B-FOOD
works O
nicely O
with O
smoked B-FOOD
salmon I-FOOD
and O
scallion B-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
blended O
with O
just O
enough O
soy B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
to O
make O
it O
arguably O
Asian O
. O

It O
is O
more O
flavorful O
than O
a O
bagel B-FOOD
and O
better O
at O
holding O
everything O
together O
. O

But O
it O
is O
somewhat O
surprising O
how O
delicious O
a O
freshly O
griddled B-DISH
mini I-DISH
is O
with O
caper B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
scallion I-FOOD
cream O
cheese O
, O
salted B-FOOD
cucumber I-FOOD
, O
tomato B-FOOD
and O
fresh O
dill B-FOOD
inside O
. O

The O
whole O
thing O
tastes O
alive O
in O
a O
way O
that O
a O
bagel B-FOOD
with O
a O
schmear O
of O
veggie B-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
never O
will O
. O

I O
've O
saved O
the O
breakfast B-DISH
mini I-DISH
with I-DISH
mortadella I-DISH
for O
last O
, O
although O
it O
's O
been O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
most O
rapt O
online O
attention O
. O

Building O
logs O
of O
mortadella B-FOOD
layered O
with O
lardo B-FOOD
and O
roasting O
them O
on O
spits O
is O
exactly O
the O
sort O
of O
thing O
the O
Momofuku B-DISH
group O
was O
put O
on O
this O
earth O
to O
do O
. O

I O
am O
glad O
this O
revolving O
meat B-FOOD
torpedo O
exists O
. O

I O
respect O
Bang B-EST
Bar I-EST
's O
cooks O
-- O
this O
collaborative O
effort O
has O
no O
chef O
, O
Mr. O
Chang O
said O
in O
a O
phone O
interview O
-- O
for O
realizing O
that O
the O
proper O
garnish O
for O
caramelized B-FOOD
mortadella I-FOOD
shavings O
is O
a O
slice O
of O
yellow B-FOOD
American I-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
and O
hot B-FOOD
mustard I-FOOD
. O

I O
appreciate O
the O
respect O
the O
sandwich B-FOOD
pays O
to O
both O
fried B-FOOD
baloney I-FOOD
and O
Taylor B-FOOD
Ham I-FOOD
. O

And O
if O
I O
were O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
turning O
up O
at O
Columbus B-LOC
Circle I-LOC
with O
a O
hangover O
in O
the O
mornings O
, O
I O
would O
probably O
become O
a O
regular O
consumer O
of O
mortadella B-DISH
minis I-DISH
with O
Ssam B-FOOD
Sauce I-FOOD
. O

With O
a O
clear O
head O
and O
stomach O
, O
though O
, O
the O
saltiness O
can O
be O
a O
little O
too O
bracing O
. O

At O
either O
meal O
, O
Bang B-EST
Bar I-EST
offers O
a O
cinnamon B-FOOD
roll I-FOOD
modeled O
on O
the O
kkwabaegi B-FOOD
, O
the O
twisted O
Korean B-CUISINE
doughnut B-FOOD
stick I-FOOD
. O

It O
is O
baked O
rather O
than O
fried O
, O
making O
it O
a O
rare O
example O
of O
a O
Momofuku B-EST
dish O
that O
contains O
less O
fat O
than O
its O
inspiration O
. O

It O
is O
a O
fine O
pastry B-FOOD
to O
have O
with O
Bang B-EST
Bar I-EST
's O
Vietnamese B-CUISINE
coffee B-FOOD
, O
even O
after O
you O
learn O
that O
the O
cream B-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
icing I-FOOD
contains O
fermented B-FOOD
chickpeas I-FOOD
. O

By O
the O
way O
, O
bang B-FOOD
, O
or O
bbang B-FOOD
or O
ppang B-FOOD
, O
depending O
on O
how O
you O
like O
your O
Korean O
words O
transliterated O
, O
means O
bread B-FOOD
. O

So O
this O
shawarma B-TYPE
joint I-TYPE
inside O
a O
mall O
is O
officially O
a O
bread B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
, O
which O
makes O
sense O
given O
how O
pleasant O
the O
bread B-FOOD
is O
. O

Still O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
help O
wondering O
how O
the O
people O
in O

of O
the O

-DOCSTART- O

Dated O
was O
the O
word O
one O
friend O
used O
after O
going O
to O
Benno B-EST
, O
and O
if O
you O
've O
eaten O
there O
, O
too O
, O
you O
'll O
know O
why O
. O

It O
's O
as O
if O
the O
past O
15 O
years O
in O
food O
never O
happened O
. O

The O
menu O
seems O
to O
be O
stuck O
in O
some O
time O
between O
1994 O
, O
when O
Thomas O
Keller O
bought O
the O
French B-EST
Laundry I-EST
, O
and O
2004 O
, O
when O
he O
opened O
Per B-EST
Se I-EST
with O
a O
young O
Jonathan O
Benno O
leading O
the O
kitchen O
. O

The O
restaurant O
will O
probably O
be O
a O
tough O
sell O
to O
those O
diners O
who O
expect O
all O
restaurants O
to O
fall O
on O
a O
continuum O
between O
Noma B-EST
and O
the O
Salt O
Bae O
place O
. O

But O
I O
prefer O
it O
to O
any O
number O
of O
newer O
, O
self O
- O
consciously O
modern O
restaurants O
, O
some O
of O
which O
are O
so O
determined O
to O
be O
of O
the O
moment O
that O
they O
might O
as O
well O
have O
a O
time O
stamp O
. O

Benno B-EST
is O
not O
trying O
to O
be O
contemporary O
. O

It O
's O
trying O
to O
be O
delicious O
. O

And O
it O
is O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
almost O
without O
exception O
. O

Benno B-EST
is O
the O
third O
of O
three O
dining O
operations O
that O
Mr. O
Benno O
opened O
last O
year O
in O
the O
Evelyn B-LOC
Hotel I-LOC
, O
on O
East B-LOC
27th I-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

It O
is O
the O
one O
where O
the O
prices O
, O
and O
presumably O
the O
stakes O
, O
are O
highest O
. O

We O
know O
it O
is O
a O
statement O
restaurant O
because O
Mr. O
Benno O
has O
put O
his O
name O
on O
it O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
his O
career O
. O

Whatever O
the O
statement O
is O
, O
it O
is O
not O
forward O
- O
looking O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
statement O
is O
in O
French O
( O
barigoule B-FOOD
, O
mousseline B-FOOD
, O
tete B-FOOD
de I-FOOD
veau I-FOOD
, O
bearnaise B-FOOD
) O
, O
a O
significant O
part O
is O
in O
Italian O
( O
carnaroli B-FOOD
risotto I-FOOD
, O
garganelli B-FOOD
verde I-FOOD
, O
pecorino B-FOOD
ginepro I-FOOD
) O
and O
not O
one O
word O
is O
in O
Danish O
or O
Mandarin O
. O

The O
statement O
has O
a O
lot O
to O
say O
on O
the O
topics O
of O
stocks B-FOOD
and O
purees B-FOOD
and O
accurate O
chopping O
and O
patient O
skimming O
; O
it O
is O
entirely O
silent O
on O
the O
subjects O
of O
fermented B-FOOD
vegetables I-FOOD
, O
or O
foraging O
, O
or O
immigration O
, O
or O
food O
deserts O
, O
or O
hashtags O
. O

The O
statement O
is O
delivered O
in O
a O
windowless O
hotel O
dining O
room O
to O
people O
sitting O
comfortably O
on O
black O
- O
leather O
chairs O
or O
velvet O
banquettes O
the O
color O
of O
a O
pinot B-FOOD
noir I-FOOD
from O
the O
Loire B-LOC
Valley I-LOC
. O

It O
takes O
the O
form O
of O
a O
fixed O
number O
of O
courses O
, O
three O
or O
four O
or O
five O
, O
your O
choice O
. O

One O
will O
be O
dessert O
and O
one O
a O
main O
course O
. O

None O
of O
them O
is O
a O
small O
plate O
meant O
for O
sharing O
. O

None O
is O
a O
large O
- O
format O
plate O
either O
, O
unless O
you O
count O
the O
veal B-DISH
sirloin I-DISH
chop I-DISH
that O
arrives O
on O
a O
silver O
platter O
in O
slices O
that O
are O
as O
pink O
and O
delicately O
shaded O
as O
the O
cheek O
on O
any O
blushing O
young O
aristocrat O
Fragonard O
ever O
painted O
. O

The O
presentations O
are O
not O
overly O
dramatic O
. O

They O
can O
be O
disarmingly O
modest O
, O
like O
the O
cold O
slice O
of O
fish B-FOOD
terrine I-FOOD
that O
appeared O
before O
the O
appetizers O
one O
night O
looking O
pale O
and O
somewhat O
lost O
. O

I O
barely O
noticed O
it O
. O

Then O
I O
tasted O
fennel B-FOOD
and O
other O
bouillabaisse B-FOOD
flavors O
and O
-- O
excuse O
me O
, O
what O
was O
your O
name O
again O
? O

-- O
I O
started O
to O
pay O
attention O
. O

It O
is O
not O
news O
that O
the O
liquid B-FOOD
yolk I-FOOD
of O
an O
egg B-FOOD
tastes O
good O
trickled O
over O
baby B-FOOD
leeks I-FOOD
, O
fingerlings B-FOOD
, O
black B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
truffle O
froth O
and O
pioppini B-FOOD
mushrooms I-FOOD
the O
size O
of O
shirt O
buttons O
. O

But O
just O
how O
good O
it O
is O
makes O
an O
interesting O
item O
. O

Lamb B-DISH
saddle I-DISH
, O
with O
grill O
marks O
that O
could O
come O
from O
a O
steakhouse B-TYPE
, O
is O
served O
with O
fairytale B-FOOD
eggplant I-FOOD
and O
Thumbelina B-FOOD
carrots I-FOOD
. O

Each O
vegetable B-FOOD
in O
this O
miniature O
garden O
is O
planted O
in O
a O
puree B-FOOD
or O
a O
reduced O
essence O
of O
itself O
. O

Each O
is O
very O
good O
, O
and O
the O
carrots B-FOOD
are O
fantastic O
. O

Alongside O
them O
sits O
lamb B-FOOD
breast I-FOOD
that O
has O
been O
pressed O
into O
a O
rich O
little O
brick O
coated O
in O
bread B-FOOD
crumbs I-FOOD
. O

One O
corner O
of O
this O
brick O
sits O
in O
a O
dark O
- O
green O
spread B-FOOD
that O
tastes O
like O
gremolata B-FOOD
. O

Not O
one O
combination O
of O
flavors O
on O
this O
plate O
is O
original O
, O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
at O
all O
. O

The O
Italian B-TYPE
food O
that O
Mr. O
Benno O
made O
at O
his O
last O
restaurant O
, O
Lincoln B-EST
Ristorante I-EST
, O
could O
be O
impressive O
, O
but O
I O
sometimes O
had O
the O
sense O
that O
he O
was O
cooking O
from O
the O
outside O
in O
, O
trying O
to O
unlock O
the O
flavors O
of O
Italy B-LOC
through O
process O
and O
method O
. O

The O
results O
did O
n't O
always O
match O
the O
evident O
effort O
. O

I O
still O
got O
a O
bit O
of O
that O
feeling O
from O
his O
food O
at O
Leonelli B-EST
Taberna I-EST
, O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
Evelyn B-LOC
lobby O
. O

It O
's O
supposed O
to O
be O
the O
hotel O
's O
casual O
Italian B-TYPE
restaurant O
, O
and O
it O
would O
be O
if O
you O
did O
n't O
sometimes O
catch O
the O
food O
trying O
to O
relax O
. O

Only O
a O
lasagna B-DISH
with O
green B-FOOD
noodles I-FOOD
below O

some O
skeptics O
to O
give O

a O
try O

The O
restaurant O
's O
greatest O
challenge O
is O
that O
the O
food O
seems O
to O
come O
from O
an O
era O
that O
's O
too O
old O
to O
seem O
fresh O
but O
too O
recent O
to O
feel O
nostalgic O
about O
. O

When O
pop O
music O
is O
that O
age O
, O
we O
cringe O
. O

When O
buildings O
are O
that O
age O
, O
we O
knock O
them O
down O
before O
they O
can O
be O
landmarked O
. O

But O
sometimes O
one O
chef O
cooking O
what O
he O
believes O
is O
better O
than O

I O
could O
see O

because O
the O
car O
and O
I O
were O
sharing O
a O
room O
on O
West B-LOC

The O

The O
whole O

is O
called O
Intersect O

gives O
you O
a O

idea O
who O
made O
the O

paying O
to O
keep O
it O

Intersect O
by O
Lexus O
is O
one O
of O
those O
modern O
places O
where O
brands O
, O
instead O
of O
asking O
you O
to O
buy O
one O
of O
their O
products O
then O
and O
there O
, O
instead O
try O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
the O
kinds O
of O
emotions O
about O
the O
brand O
that O
may O
lead O
to O
a O
sale O
later O

This O
is O
a O
job O
formerly O
performed O

it O

that O
seemed O

and O
working O
my O

through O
Mr. O

at O

helped O
me O
understand O
what O
other O
restaurants O
around O

have O
been O
trying O
to O
imitate O
: O
the O
charred B-FOOD

the O
gently O

What O

the O

calls O
it O
mole B-DISH
de I-DISH
Piaxtla I-DISH
, O
after O
the O
Pueblan O
town O
where O
his O
father O
grew O
up O
, O
and O
as O
a O
reminder O
that O
there O
is O
not O
just O
one O
mole B-FOOD
poblano I-FOOD
but O
many O
. O

Some O
have O
apple B-FOOD
in O
addition O
to O
raisins B-FOOD
. O

Some O
are O
thickened O
with O
animal B-FOOD
crackers I-FOOD
. O

Mr. O
Aguilar O
remembers O
that O
in O
his O
childhood O
home O
, O
plantains B-FOOD
were O
allowed O
to O
hang O
until O
they O
were O
black O
before O
they O
could O
be O
pounded O
into O
mole B-FOOD
. O

Maybe O
this O
explains O
the O
particular O
sweetness O
of O
Casa B-EST
Enrique I-EST
's O
version O
, O
which O
is O
not O
the O
candy B-FOOD
- O
bar O
sweetness O
of O
some O
. O

It O
's O
deep O
and O
complicated O
. O

The O
character O
of O
this O
mole B-DISH
de I-DISH
Piaxtla I-DISH
unfurls O
as O
you O
eat O
, O
whether O
the O
sauce B-FOOD
has O
been O
soaked O
into O
enchiladas B-FOOD
filled O
with O
chicken B-FOOD
or O
simply O
pooled O
on O
a O
plate O
over O
and O
under O
a O
quartered B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
and O
yellow B-FOOD
rice I-FOOD
cooked O
with O
peas B-FOOD
. O

Mr. O
Aguilar O
has O
been O
frying O
, O
blending O
and O
stirring O
mole B-DISH
de I-DISH
Piaxtla I-DISH
since O
Casa B-EST
Enrique I-EST
opened O
in O
2012 O
, O
just O
off O
Vernon B-LOC
Boulevard I-LOC
, O
in O
Long B-LOC
Island I-LOC
City I-LOC
, I-LOC
Queens O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
he O
has O
barely O
changed O
his O
menu O
since O
our O
Hungry O
City O
critic O
, O
Ligaya O
Mishan O
, O
reviewed O
it O
the O
next O
year O
. O

Mr. O
Aguilar O
says O
he O
is O
emulating O
the O
restaurants O
he O
likes O
best O
in O
Mexico B-LOC
, O
ones O
whose O
kitchens O
make O
the O
same O
dishes O
year O
in O
and O
year O
out O
. O

Whether O
despite O
this O
or O
because O
of O
it O
, O
the O
restaurant O
seems O
to O
have O
improved O
in O
subtle O
ways O
. O

Acoustic O
panels O
tacked O
to O
the O
ceiling O
make O
conversation O
easier O
. O

Servers O
, O
always O
welcoming O
, O
have O
become O
experts O
at O
anticipating O
the O
meal O
's O
ebb O
and O
flow O
. O

They O
'll O
step O
in O
just O
when O
you O
're O
ready O
for O
a O
fresh O
drink O
, O
maybe O
a O
margarita B-FOOD
with O
some O
tamarind B-FOOD
this O
time O
to O
offset O
the O
raw B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
sugar O
syrup O
. O

They O
'll O
gauge O
the O
precise O
moment O
when O
you O
're O
ready O
to O
have O
dinner O
plates O
cleared O
to O
make O
room O
for O
dessert O
. O

Or O
they O
'll O
break O
away O
from O
your O
table O
just O
long O
enough O
to O
join O
in O
a O
full O
- O
throated O
singing O
of O
" O
Happy O
Birthday O
" O
around O
a O
slice O
of O
tres B-DISH
leches I-DISH
cake I-DISH
with O
a O
candle O
stuck O
in O
it O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
room O
. O

This O
may O
happen O
three O
or O
four O
times O
a O
night O
, O
probably O
not O
because O
Casa B-EST
Enrique I-EST
looks O
particularly O
festive O
-- O
from O
floor O
to O
ceiling O
, O
it O
's O
done O
almost O
entirely O
in O
white O
-- O
but O
, O
I O
'd O
guess O
, O
because O
regulars O
know O
it O
regularly O
outperforms O
any O
number O
of O
other O
restaurants O
that O
might O
seem O
to O
be O
more O
special O
on O
the O
surface O
but O
are O
n't O
, O
really O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
tres B-DISH
leches I-DISH
cake I-DISH
, O
if O
not O
as O
soggy O
with O
condensed B-FOOD
milk I-FOOD
as O
it O
could O
be O
, O
is O
still O
pretty O
good O
, O
though O
I O
think O
the O
flan B-DISH
is O
almost O
mandatory O
, O
and O
it O
, O
too O
, O
is O
a O
perfectly O
credible O
birthday O
- O
candle O
holder O
. O

Although O
the O
guacamole B-DISH
is O
freshly O
mashed O
and O
pleasingly O
minimalist O
, O
I O
tend O
to O
skip O
it O
as O
long O
as O
the O
people O
I O
'm O
with O
do O
n't O
mind O
. O

Instead O
I O
'll O
head O
straight O
for O
the O
two B-DISH
- I-DISH
bite O
sopecitos O
topped O
with O
refried B-FOOD
beans I-FOOD
and O
loose O
chorizo B-FOOD
, O
or O
the O
albondigas B-DISH
in O
cumin B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
laced I-FOOD
chipotle O
sauce O
, O
each O
of O
the O
three O
meatballs B-FOOD
stuffed O
with O
hard B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
cooked O
eggs O
. O

The O
best O
Mexican B-CUISINE
seafood B-FOOD
dishes O
often O
come O
from O
restaurants O
that O
specialize O
in O
them O
. O

Mr. O
Aguilar O
, O
though O
, O
seems O
equally O
at O
home O
with O
fish B-FOOD
and O
meat B-FOOD
. O

The O
market O
fish B-FOOD
offered O
as O
a O
main O
course O
-- O
lately O
a O
black B-FOOD
sea I-FOOD
bass I-FOOD
-- O
has O
always O
been O
seared O
to O
a O
crisp O
on O
the O
skin O
side O
. O

Still O
, O
in O
all O
these O
years O
I O
've O
never O
been O
convinced O
that O
the O
corn B-FOOD
under O
it O
compares O
to O
the O
best O
street O
- O
corner O
esquites B-FOOD
, O
or O
that O
it O
and O
the O
fish B-FOOD
really O
add O
up O
to O
a O
whole O
dish O
. O

The O
seafood B-FOOD
appetizers O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
are O
some O
of O
my O
favorite O
things O
at O
Casa B-EST
Enrique I-EST
: O
the O
delicately O
fried B-DISH
oysters I-DISH
sitting O
in O
a O
mayonnaise B-FOOD
that O
gets O
its O
tangerine O
color O
from O
ground B-FOOD
chiles I-FOOD
; O
the O
ceviche B-DISH
, O
freshly O
tossed O
with O
lime B-FOOD
and O
herbs B-FOOD
; O
the O
crab B-DISH
tostadas I-DISH
, O
loaded O
with O
a O
thin O
slice O
or O
two O
of O
Serrano B-FOOD
chile I-FOOD
, O
chopped O
tomato B-FOOD
, O
leaves O
of O
cilantro B-FOOD
, O
smooth O
avocado B-FOOD
salsa I-FOOD
and O
a O
spoonful O
of O
crab B-FOOD
meat I-FOOD
, O
pure O
and O
clean O
; O
and O
the O
shrimp B-DISH
cocktail I-DISH
, O
which O
gets O
its O
roundness O
and O
slight O
richness O
, O
I O
think O
, O
from O
orange B-FOOD
soda I-FOOD
, O
just O
the O
way O
you O
'd O
hope O
. O

Mr. O
Aguilar O
is O
not O
one O
of O
those O
chefs O
who O
set O
up O
masa B-FOOD
factories O
in O
their O
basements O
. O

Casa B-EST
Enrique I-EST
's O
corn B-FOOD
tortillas I-FOOD
do O
not O
have O
the O
pretty O
floral O
aromas O
of O
Cosme B-EST
's O
, O
or O
the O
sweet O
, O
focused O
corn B-FOOD
flavor O
you O
taste O
in O
Claro B-EST
's O
. O

But O
they O
are O
better O
than O
you O
'd O
find O
almost O
anywhere O
else O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
. O

They O
give O
a O
boost O
to O
the O
tacos B-FOOD
, O
made O
with O
braised B-FOOD
tongue I-FOOD
or O
brisket B-FOOD
; O
crumbled O
chorizo B-FOOD
; O
or O
fried B-FOOD
, I-FOOD
battered I-FOOD
fish O
, O
and O
they O
are O
especially O
delicious O
soaked O
in O
salsa B-FOOD
verde I-FOOD
and O
wrapped O
around O
roasted B-FOOD
poblanos I-FOOD
in O
cream B-FOOD
to O
make O
enchiladas B-DISH
Dona I-DISH
Blanca I-DISH
. O

And O
while O
Cosme B-EST
's O
more O
modern O
approach O
has O
soaked O
up O
more O
media O
attention O
, O
I O
've O
encountered O
more O
bloops O
and O
wobbles O
eating O
there O
than O
I O
have O
exploring O
the O
far O
more O
traditional O
menu O
at O
Casa B-EST
Enrique I-EST
. O

It O
is O
n't O
necessarily O
the O
more O
interesting O
restaurant O
, O
but O
it O
's O
the O
one O
where O
I O
'm O
more O
confident O
that O
if O
I O
went O
there O
tonight O
, O
everything O
would O
taste O
exactly O
the O
way O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
. O

The O
pozole B-DISH
will O
be O
dark O
and O
intense O
, O
though O
not O
especially O
spicy O
, O
with O
tender O
strands O
of O
pork B-FOOD
in O
the O
broth B-FOOD
and O
all O
the O
usual O
mix O
- O
ins O
waiting O
on O
the O
side O
. O

The O
pork B-DISH
ribs I-DISH
will O
be O
slowly O
braised O
, O
in O
the O
style O
of O
Chiapas B-LOC
, O
in O
a O
thick O
cooked O
salsa B-FOOD
built O
on O
a O
foundation O
of O
guajillo B-FOOD
chiles I-FOOD
. O

These O
ribs B-FOOD
are O
not O
to O
be O
confused O
with O
the O
baby B-FOOD
back I-FOOD
ribs I-FOOD
, O
cooked O
in O
an O
even O
thicker O
, O
creamier O
pipian B-FOOD
rojo I-FOOD
, O
that O
sometimes O
turn O
up O
as O
a O
daily O
special O
. O

Best O
of O
all O
, O
perhaps O
, O
will O
be O
the O
chamorro B-DISH
de I-DISH
borrego I-DISH
, O
or O
lamb B-FOOD
shank I-FOOD
stewed O
with O
chickpeas B-FOOD
; O
it O
will O
be O
very O
tender O
and O
very O
flavorful O
in O
its O
rough O
sauce B-FOOD
of I-FOOD
pulla I-FOOD
chiles I-FOOD
with O
crushed O
guaje B-FOOD
seeds I-FOOD
. O

The O
name O
of O
that O
sauce B-FOOD
is O
huaxmole B-FOOD
, O
or O
sometimes O
guaxmole B-FOOD
, O
or O
even O
mole B-FOOD
de I-FOOD
guaje I-FOOD
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
's O
a O
mole B-FOOD
, O
and O
one O
that O
rarely O
flies O
as O
far O
north O
as O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
. O

At O
Casa B-EST

Everybody O
's O
a O
critic O
, O
right O
? O

I O
happen O
to O
get O
paid O
for O
criticism O
, O
and O
I O
would O
like O
to O
criticize O
that O
old O
platitude O
right O
out O
the O
window O
: O

No O
, O
everybody O
is O
not O
a O
critic O
. O

What O
most O
of O
you O
are O
doing O
out O
there O
, O
online O
and O
in O
three O
dimensions O
, O
is O
complaining O
. O

When O
we O
complain O
, O
we O
experience O
something O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
like O
and O
we O
say O
something O
about O
it O
. O

A O
critic O
does O
n't O
write O
about O
his O
own O
dissatisfaction O
, O
or O
does O
n't O
just O
do O
that O
. O

A O
critic O
has O
to O
poke O
his O
head O
out O
of O
his O
turtle O
shell O
, O
look O
around O
and O
gesture O
, O
with O
stubby O
legs O
, O
toward O
the O
sources O
of O
dissatisfaction O
. O

Done O
perceptively O
, O
with O
analytic O
thinking O
and O
an O
effort O
to O
connect O
the O
dots O
between O
this O
experience O
and O
others O
, O
this O
can O
be O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
value O
system O
that O
readers O
might O
share O
, O
or O
reject O
, O
or O
at O
least O
attempt O
to O
understand O
. O

Complaining O
is O
as O
easy O
as O
breathing O
. O

Writing O
criticism O
is O
a O
real O
pain O
. O

That O
was O
a O
complaint O
, O
by O
the O
way O
. O

But O
criticism O
and O
complaint O
are O
closely O
related O
enough O
for O
me O
to O
know O
that O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
complaining O
going O
on O
, O
and O
that O
most O
of O
the O
complaints O
are O
n't O
having O
any O
effect O
at O
all O
. O

This O
may O
not O
be O
the O
point O
. O

People O
who O
study O
complaints O
divide O
them O
into O
two O
categories O
, O
instrumental O
and O
expressive O
. O

An O
instrumental O
complaint O
is O
" O
directed O
toward O
a O
specific O
target O
and O
intended O
to O
bring O
about O
a O
specific O
outcome O
, O
" O
according O
to O
Robin O
Kowalski O
, O
a O
professor O
of O
psychology O
at O
Clemson O
University O
who O
has O
studied O
the O
social O
functions O
of O
complaining O
. O

Calling O
a O
restaurant O
's O
owner O
the O
next O
day O
to O
say O
that O
you O
waited O
an O
hour O
for O
dessert O
and O
do O
n't O
intend O
to O
come O
back O
is O
an O
instrumental O
complaint O
. O

Texting O
a O
friend O
to O
say O
the O
polar O
vortex O
is O
making O
your O
skin O
peel O
off O
is O
an O
expressive O
complaint O
. O

We O
call O
expressive O
complaints O
venting O
, O
kvetching O
, O
griping O
or O
a O
number O
of O
other O
names O
. O

It O
's O
important O
to O
know O
which O
of O
the O
two O
types O
of O
complaint O
is O
right O
for O
you O
before O
opening O
the O
first O
can O
of O
invective O
. O

Venting O
has O
its O
uses O
. O

In O
one O
study O
, O
Dr. O
Kowalski O
and O
some O
colleagues O
showed O
that O
when O
we O
are O
asked O
to O
put O
our O
feelings O
of O
dissatisfaction O
with O
somebody O
into O
writing O
, O
our O
" O
positive O
affect O
" O
-- O
good O
feelings O
, O
basically O
-- O
will O
rise O
about O
15 O
minutes O
later O
, O
after O
an O
initial O
downswing O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
if O
a O
meal O
lets O
you O
down O
, O
taking O
a O
pair O
of O
pliers O
and O
a O
blowtorch O
to O
the O
restaurant O
on O
Yelp O
might O
give O
you O
a O
brief O
lift O
. O

But O
once O
the O
rush O
of O
having O
gotten O
it O
off O
your O
chest O
is O
gone O
, O
you O
'd O
realize O
nothing O
has O
changed O
. O

You O
're O
still O
out O
the O
price O
of O
dinner O
, O
and O
you O
wo O
n't O
find O
out O
whether O
your O
grievance O
has O
reached O
the O
right O
ears O
unless O
somebody O
at O
the O
restaurant O
responds O
. O

Some O
owners O
make O
a O
point O
of O
scouring O
review O
sites O
so O
they O
can O
do O
just O
that O
. O

Others O
use O
the O
review O
's O
date O
and O
details O
to O
identify O
and O
get O
in O
touch O
with O
the O
kvetcher O
. O

But O
there O
are O
more O
direct O
ways O
to O
get O
your O
gripe O
acknowledged O
than O
scrawling O
it O
on O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
internet O
. O

" O
If O
there O
's O
something O
that O
's O
really O
bothering O
you O
, O
the O
ultimate O
benefits O
are O
going O
to O
come O
from O
targeted O
complaining O
, O
" O
Dr. O
Kowalski O
said O
. O

" O
Telling O
the O
person O
or O
restaurant O
. O
" O

I O
know O
, O
I O
know O
. O

This O
is O
the O
part O
I O
avoid O
, O
too O
, O
by O
saving O
all O
my O
criticisms O
for O
my O
reviews O
. O

I O
hate O
confrontations O
, O
I O
run O
from O
them O
, O
I O
'd O
rather O
pay O
the O
check O
, O
even O
with O
my O
own O
money O
, O
and O
walk O
out O
never O
to O
return O
. O

But O
let O
's O
say O
you O
want O
something O
out O
of O
your O
complaint O
. O

Maybe O
you O
just O
want O
a O
rib B-FOOD

of O
the O

you O

Or O
you O
have O
a O
reason O
for O
wanting O
an O
item O
taken O
off O
your O
bill O

Or O
( O
and O
I O
think O
this O
is O
what O
most O
people O
are O
looking O
for O
when O
they O
complain O
) O
you O
just O
want O
somebody O
to O
look O
you O
in O
the O
eye O
and O
say O
: O
" O
So O
sorry O
about O
that O

Is O
there O
anything O
we O
can O
do O
to O
make O
it O

" O

Whatever O
you O
want O
, O
you O
're O
more O
likely O
to O
get O
it O
if O
you O
have O
a O
word O
with O
a O
manager O
either O
before O
you O
leave O
or O
later O
on O
. O

As O
a O
side O
benefit O
, O
you O
'll O
be O
helping O
the O
restaurant O
, O
too O
; O
when O
somebody O
is O
un O
happy O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
meal O
, O
almost O
any O
manager O
or O
restaurateur O
wants O
to O
know O
. O

" O
We O
actually O
really O
welcome O
complaints O
, O
" O
said O
Melinda O
Shopsin O
, O
a O
film O
producer O
who O
cooks O
and O
waits O
tables O
at O
Shopsin B-EST
's O
, O
her O
family O
's O
restaurant O
on O
the O
Lower B-LOC
East I-LOC
Side I-LOC
. O

This O
may O
come O
as O
a O
surprise O
to O
anyone O
who O
has O
heard O
the O
numerous O
accounts O
of O
customers O
' O
being O
tossed O
out O
of O
Shopsin B-EST
's O
for O
any O
number O
of O
arcane O
infractions O
. O

And O
yet O
, O
Ms. O
Shopsin O
says O
that O
when O
her O
mother O
was O
still O
alive O
, O
she O
would O
ask O
what O
was O
wrong O
when O
she O
saw O
an O
unfinished O
plate O
, O
and O
then O
take O
a O
bite O
to O
see O
for O
herself O
. O

At O
other O
restaurants O
, O
this O
exploratory O
bite O
may O
happen O
backstage O
, O
in O
the O
kitchen O
. O

If O
you O
're O
going O
to O
make O
an O
instrumental O
complaint O
, O
though O
, O
you O
still O
need O
to O
figure O
out O
whether O
the O
reasons O
you O
're O
unhappy O
are O
subjective O
or O
objective O
. O

Did O
Medieval B-EST
Times I-EST
undercook O
the O
chicken B-FOOD
, O
or O
do O
you O
just O
not O
like O
eating O
with O
your O
hands O
? O

Even O
if O
you O
're O
pretty O
sure O
the O
problem O
is O
objective O
, O
it O
can O
be O
useful O
to O
pretend O
it O
's O
subjective O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
diplomacy O
. O

The O
chef O
John O
Tesar O
recalls O
a O
night O
, O
soon O
after O
he O
'd O
opened O
his O
Knife B-EST
steakhouse B-TYPE
in O
Dallas B-LOC
, O
when O
he O
got O
into O
an O
argument O
with O
a O
customer O
about O
the O
weight O
of O
a O
steak O
-- O
an O
objective O
complaint O
if O
ever O
there O
was O
one O
. O

" O
We O
had O
a O
33 O
- O
ounce O
rib B-DISH
- I-DISH
eye I-DISH
for O
two O
, O
" O
Mr. O
Tesar O
said O
. O

One O
customer O
who O
ordered O
it O
was O
n't O
convinced O
and O
began O
" O
screaming O
, O
" O
according O
to O
Mr. O
Tesar O
: O
" O
This O
steak O
is B-FOOD
too O
small O
! O

This O
is O
n't O
enough O
to O
feed O
all O
of O
us O
! O
' O
" O

He O
went O
to O
the O
table O
, O
and O
the O
hostilities O
quickly O
escalated O
, O
he O
said O
, O
until O
" O
I O
went O
into O
the O
kitchen O
, O
got O
a O
scale O
, O
grabbed O
the O
steak O
, O
weighed O
it O
in O
front O
of O
her O
, O
and O
said O
, O
It O
's O
36 O
ounces O
! O
' O
" O

The O
story O
ends O
happily O
, O
with O
the O
two O
combatants O
meeting O
again O
at O
a O
dinner O
party O
some O
time O
later O
and O
getting O
along O
swimmingly O
. O

" O
We O
both O
realized O
how O
absurd O
and O
insecure O
we O
were O
being O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

All O
this O
might O
have O
been O
avoided O
if O
the O
complaint O
had O
been O
cast O
subjectively O
: O
" O
That O
steak B-FOOD
looks O
smaller O
than O
we O
expected O
. O

Are O
you O
sure O
it O
's O
the O
one O
we O
ordered O
? O
" O

Subjective O
complaints O
are O
still O
important O
data O
for O
restaurants O
. O

If O
one O
person O
does O
n't O
like O
the O
new O
hot B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
dog O
lasagna O
, O
it O
's O
an O
aberration O
. O

If O
15 O
people O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
the O
recipe O
probably O
needs O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
workshop O
. O

The O
chef O
or O
owner O
needs O
to O
know O
this O
, O
but O
also O
needs O
to O
hear O
it O
in O
terms O
that O
wo O
n't O
lead O
to O
a O
screaming O
match O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
. O

Perhaps O
you O
have O
seen O
Gordon O
Ramsay O
critique O
another O
chef O
's O
cooking O
on O
television O
? O

Do O
n't O
do O
it O
like O
that O
. O

In O
general O
, O
the O
more O
specific O
your O
complaint O
, O
the O
more O
likely O
it O
is O
to O
be O
understood O
. O

The O
worst O
, O
most O
useless O
and O
potentially O
dangerous O
complaints O
are O
broad O
, O
sweeping O
condemnations O
. O

" O
There O
is O
complaining O
that O
makes O
you O
think O
about O
what O
you O
're O
doing O
, O
and O
there O
is O
complaining O
where O
everybody O
thinks O
they O
're O
entitled O
to O
say O
anything O

" O
Saying O
, O
This O
is O
terrible O
' O
is O
not O
complaining O

That O
is O
being O
rude O

It O

It O

telling O

that O
I O

It O

my O

Even O
when O
the O
person O
you O
're O
grousing O
to O
did O
not O
cook O
your O
pasta B-FOOD
personally O
, O
you O
should O
proceed O
gently O
, O
in O
nonconfrontational O
terms O

It O
may O
be O
helpful O
to O
imagine O
that O
you O
are O
speaking O
with O
an O
air O
traffic O
controller O
trying O
to O
land O
20 O
jets O
during O
a O
snowstorm O
; O
you O
would O
try O
very O
hard O
not O
to O
add O
to O
the O
overall O
stress O
level O
in O
the O
tower O
, O
even O
if O
your O
child O
was O
on O
one O
of O
those O
jets O

" O
If O
you O
can O
be O
patient O
, O
open O
and O
polite O
, O
that O
's O
really O
helpful O

Ms. O

more O

-- O
even O
though O
it O

not O

it O

People O
have O
to O
understand O
that O
sometimes O
to O
fix O
a O
mistake O
is O
not O
easy O
. O
" O

And O
sometimes O
, O
a O
restaurant O
can O
make O
customers O
happy O
by O
changing O
something O
that O
is O
n't O
a O
mistake O
at O
all O
. O

Occasionally O
, O
diners O
at O
Shopsin B-EST
's O
who O
had O
ordered O
migas B-FOOD
complained O
about O
finding O
cilantro B-FOOD
in O
the O
dish O
. O

Initially O
, O
the O
response O
would O
be O
that O
migas B-FOOD
are O
supposed O
to O
have O
cilantro B-FOOD
. O

Which O
may O
be O
true O
, O
but O
perhaps O
was O
n't O
the O
point O
. O

Now O
, O
Ms. O
Shopsin O
asks O
customers O
whether O
they O
like O
cilantro B-FOOD

If O
the O
answer O
is O
no O
, O
there O
wo O
n't O
be O
any O
in O

It O
is O
a O
safe O
guess O
that O
the O
Eastern O
European O
Jews O
who O
brought O
the O
bialy B-FOOD
from O
Bialystok B-LOC
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
, O
piecing O
back O
together O
the O
recipe O
for O
this O
plain O
but O
beguiling O
dimpled O
roll B-FOOD
in O
their O
new O
world O
after O
fleeing O
their O
old O
one O
, O
did O
not O
do O
it O
so O
that O
one O
day O
it O
could O
be O
sliced O
open O
and O
stuffed O
with O
a O
New B-LOC
Jersey I-LOC
pork B-FOOD
sausage I-FOOD
that O
comes O
in O
a O
cloth O
sack O
. O

To O
be O
fair O
, O
this O
was O
not O
the O
original O
plan O
at O
Shelsky B-EST
's I-EST
Brooklyn I-EST
Bagels O
, O
either O
. O

The O
idea O
was O
to O
serve O
pork B-DISH
roll I-DISH
, I-DISH
egg I-DISH
and I-DISH
cheese I-DISH
sandwiches O
on O
a O
kaiser B-FOOD

Peter O
Shelsky O
, O
the O
bakery O
's O
owner O
, O
grew O
up O
in O
Manhattan B-LOC
, O
but O
he O
knew O
that O
some O
good O
things O
come O
from O
New B-LOC
Jersey I-LOC
, O
particularly O
pork B-FOOD
roll I-FOOD
, O
which O
he O
wanted O
to O
sell O
in O
the O
mornings O
. O

Also O
known O
as O
Taylor B-FOOD
ham I-FOOD
, O
pork B-FOOD
roll I-FOOD
is O
a O
cured B-FOOD
, I-FOOD
smoked I-FOOD
and I-FOOD
cooked I-FOOD
meat O
product O
that O
has O
the O
tightly O
pebbled O
appearance O
of O
engineered O
stone O
, O
like O
a O
Corian O
countertop O
made O
of O
flesh O
. O

Pressing O
sliced O
pork B-FOOD
roll I-FOOD
on O
a O
hot O
griddle O
intensifies O
its O
saltiness O
while O
giving O
it O
a O
hint O
of O
a O
crust O
that O
contrasts O
attractively O
with O
the O
slightly O
spongy O
interior O
. O

Griddled B-FOOD
pork I-FOOD
roll I-FOOD
, O
combined O
with O
a O
cooked B-FOOD
egg I-FOOD
and O
a O
slice O
of O
American B-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
, O
is O
eaten O
across O
New B-LOC
Jersey I-LOC
as O
a O
breakfast B-FOOD
sandwich I-FOOD
. O

Usually O
it O
is O
found O
on O
a O
kaiser B-FOOD
roll I-FOOD
. O

Sometimes O
it O
is O
seen O
on O
a O
bagel B-FOOD
. O

But O
some O
Shelsky B-EST
's O
customers O
requested O
it O
on O
a O
freshly O
baked O
bialy B-FOOD
, O
and O
others O
followed O
, O
and O
now O
pork B-FOOD
roll I-FOOD
sandwiches I-FOOD
made O
on O
bialys B-FOOD
are O
nearly O
as O
popular O
as O
the O
ones O
made O
on O
rolls B-FOOD
, O
with O
bagels B-FOOD
a O
distant O
third O
. O

The O
bialy B-FOOD
might O
have O
been O
custom O
- O
made O
for O
the O
job O
, O
particularly O
the O
ones O
at O
Shelsky B-EST
's O
, O
which O
are O
baked O
to O
a O
darker O
brown O
, O
their O
thumbprint O
divots O
filled O
with O
a O
more O
robustly O
caramelized B-FOOD
onion I-FOOD
confit I-FOOD
, O
than O
garden O
- O
variety O
bialys B-FOOD
. O

Both O
traits O
are O
intensified O
if O
you O
have O
the O
bialy B-FOOD
thoroughly O
toasted O
, O
as O
the O
person O
behind O
the O
counter O
will O
almost O
certainly O
recommend O

not O

to O

a O

you O

Contemporaneously O

you O
worked O

became O
curious O
about O
what O
else O
this O

was O
up O

one O

you O
noticed O
that O
the O

smelled O
like O
an O

in O
August O

and O
a O
minute O
later O
Belon B-FOOD
oysters I-FOOD
on O
a O

of O

sailed O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
opening O
that O
lights O
up O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

You O
ordered O
a O
plate O
of O
your O
own O
because O
you O
wanted O
to O
know O
how O
the O
warm O
oysters B-FOOD
would O
taste O
under O
their O
yellow O
blankets O
of O
smoked B-FOOD
rosemary I-FOOD
hollandaise I-FOOD

From O
a O
short O
list O
of O
charcuterie B-FOOD
you O
chose O
the O
squab B-FOOD

pork I-FOOD
terrine I-FOOD
, O
with O
a O
few O
prunes B-FOOD
embedded O
into O
the O
pink O
and O
pleasingly O
coarse O
- O
grained O

You O
spread O
this O

whole B-FOOD

grain O
mustard O

apricot B-FOOD

some O
of O
the O

them O

2016 O

taking O
over O
what O
had O
been O
a O
Polish B-CUISINE
restaurant O
called O
Cinamoon B-EST
. O

The O
charcuterie B-FOOD
was O
made O
on O
site O
from O
the O
start O
, O
but O
the O
menu O
swerved O
in O
a O
more O

English B-CUISINE

leaning O
direction O
last O
fall O
when O
Ed O
Szymanski O
was O
hired O
as O
the O
chef O
. O

This O
might O
have O
been O
predicted O
, O
if O
not O
from O
Mr. O
Szymanski O
's O
English O
upbringing O
and O
British O
citizenship O
, O
then O
from O
his O
work O
history O

He O
has O
cooked O
at O
the O
Beatrice B-EST
Inn I-EST
, O
where O
various O
beasts O
of O

posed O

silver O

For O
a O
panoramic O
tour O
of O
Mr. O
Szymanski O
's O
accumulated O
meat B-FOOD
wisdom O
, O
you O
could O
call O
two O
days O
ahead O
and O
reserve O

and O

for O
at O

four O

along O
the O

of O

. O

The O
everyday O
menu O
, O
though O
, O
is O
not O
exactly O
made O
up O
of O
grain B-FOOD
bowls I-FOOD
. O

On O
any O
given O
night O
, O
you O
can O
drop O
in O
and O
marvel O
at O
the O
fried B-DISH
lamb I-DISH
ribs I-DISH
, O
their O
apple B-FOOD
glaze I-FOOD
augmented O
by O
broken O
coriander B-FOOD
and O

The O

The O

This O
is O
served O
with O
roasted B-FOOD
, I-FOOD
pureed I-FOOD
celery I-FOOD
root O
and O
bruleed B-FOOD
pears I-FOOD
. O

The O
plates O
are O
marked O
by O
a O
refinement O
and O
moderation O
that O
is O
not O
always O
achieved O
by O
other O
chefs O
in O
the O
guts O

and O

A O

of O
a O

-- O
lacquered O
, O
scored O
in O
a O
starburst O
and O
very O
tender O

Care O
is O
even O
lavished O
on O
the O
grilled B-DISH
rib I-DISH
- I-DISH
eye I-DISH
for O
two O
, O
which O
comes O
to O
the O

with O
neatly O

marrow I-FOOD
under O
a O
tidy O
crust O
of O
parsley B-FOOD
, O
chives B-FOOD
, O
pickle B-FOOD
shallots I-FOOD
and O
buttered B-FOOD
bread I-FOOD
crumbs I-FOOD
. O

Mr. O
Szymanski O
does O
not O
gesture O
toward O
fish B-FOOD
and O
vegetables B-FOOD
very O
often O
, O
but O
when O
he O
does O
he O
generally O
musters O
some O
conviction O
. O

True O
, O
the O
roasted B-DISH
pumpkin I-DISH
mash I-DISH
with O
toasted B-FOOD
hazelnuts I-FOOD
and O
fresh O
cheese B-FOOD
has O
an O
obligatory O
air O
, O
as O
does O
the O
grilled B-DISH
bread I-DISH
with O
labneh B-FOOD
and O
honey B-FOOD
. O

But O
the O
smoked B-DISH
whitefish I-DISH
salad I-DISH
, O
with O
caramelized B-FOOD
shallots I-FOOD
and O
creme B-FOOD
fraiche I-FOOD
and O
a O
side O
of O
saltines O
, O
is O
more O
energetic O
than O
you O
might O
guess O
. O

Grilled B-DISH
flatbread I-DISH
looks O
out O
of O
place O
on O
this O
menu O
, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
fine O
canvas O
for O
roasted B-FOOD
hens I-FOOD
- O
of O
- O
the O
- O
woods O
and O
other O
wild O
mushrooms B-FOOD
that O
are O
fleshy O
and O
flavorful O
enough O
to O
get O
noticed O
on O
their O
own O
. O

Skate B-DISH
, O
a O
main O
course O
, O
comes O
with O
smoked B-FOOD
German I-FOOD
butterball I-FOOD
potatoes I-FOOD
and O
a O
soaring O
, O
fino B-FOOD
sherry I-FOOD

laced I-FOOD
beurre O
blanc O
. O

The O
salad B-DISH
of O
radicchio B-FOOD
and O
other O
bitter B-FOOD
lettuces I-FOOD
is O
as O
crisp O
and O
refreshing O
as O
any O
plate O
of O
leaves B-FOOD
can O
be O
in O
February O
. O

It O
is O
also O
a O
very O
good O
thing O
to O
eat O
with O
steak B-FOOD
, O
as O
it O
happens O
. O

Anyone O
who O
has O
not O
caught O
on O
to O
the O
English B-CUISINE
theme O
so O
far O
will O
get O
a O
last O
chance O
with O
the O
dessert O
menu O
, O
which O
offers O
treacle B-DISH
tart I-DISH
, O
sticky B-DISH
toffee I-DISH
pudding I-DISH
, O
a O
posset B-DISH
and O
three O
cheeses B-DISH
, O
all O
from O
England B-LOC
. O

The O
treacle B-DISH
tart I-DISH
was O
dry O
when O
I O
had O
it O
. O

The O
sticky B-DISH
toffee I-DISH
pudding I-DISH
was O
surprisingly O
but O
not O
unpleasantly O
cakelike O
. O

The O
posset B-DISH
, O
though O
, O
is O
a O
small O
miracle O
, O
an O
eggless B-FOOD
custard I-FOOD
of O
sugar B-FOOD
, O
lemon B-FOOD
juice I-FOOD
and O
cream B-FOOD
scented O
with O
Earl B-FOOD
Grey I-FOOD
tea I-FOOD
, O
dressed O
up O
with O
Cara B-FOOD
Cara I-FOOD
orange I-FOOD
wedges O
and O
a O
few O
Earl B-FOOD
Grey I-FOOD
meringues I-FOOD
. O

There O
should O
be O
more O
possets B-FOOD
around O
town O
. O

There O
should O
be O
possets B-FOOD
galore O
. O

And O
by O
the O
way O
, O
there O
should O
be O
more O
wine O
lists O
like O
Cherry B-EST
Point I-EST
's O
. O

Assembled O
by O
Garret O
Smith O
, O
who O
owns O
the O
restaurant O
with O
Vincent O
Mazeau O
, O
it O
consistently O
favors O
obscure O
and O
surprising O
over O
familiar O
and O
dull O
. O

By O
the O
bottle O
, O
there O
are O
oddities O
such O
as O
apple B-FOOD
wine I-FOOD
and O
mead B-FOOD
, O
but O
also O
a O
few O
things O
you O
might O
have O
heard O
of O
: O
a O
cremant B-DISH
d'Alsace I-DISH
from O
Dirler B-EST
Cade I-EST
, O
a O
Sybille B-DISH
Kuntz I-DISH
riesling I-DISH
, O
an O
Olga B-DISH
Raffault I-DISH
chinon I-DISH
and O
a O
lean O
, O
exact O
pinot B-DISH
noir I-DISH
from O
Enderle B-EST
& I-EST
Moll I-EST
. O

Only O
two O
bottles O
, O
both O
sparkling B-FOOD
wines I-FOOD
, O
are O
over O
$ O
100 O
, O
and O
most O
of O
the O
others O
are O
closer O
to O
$ O
50 O
. O

At O
these O
prices O
, O
you O
could O
just O
close O
your O
eyes O
and O
pick O
something O
, O
which O
is O
lucky O
because O
the O
servers O
, O
though O
charming O
and O
truly O
unpretentious O
, O
have O
n't O
fully O
internalized O
the O
list O
's O
ins O
and O
outs O
. O

It O
's O
one O
of O
the O
ways O
in O
which O
Cherry B-EST
Point I-EST
seems O
not O
to O
have O
caught O
up O
yet O
with O
how O
good O
it O
has O
become O
. O

If O
you O
treat O
it O
like O
a O
bar B-TYPE
, O
you O
might O
not O
notice O
. O

But O
if O
you O
eat O
the O
way O
I O
did O
, O
ordering O
half O
the O
menu O
at O
a O
time O
, O
you O
could O
be O
putting O
more O
stress O
on O
the O
infrastructure O
than O
it O
can O
handle O
. O

You O
might O
be O
in O
for O
a O
very O
slow O
meal O
. O

But O
it O
will O
also O
be O
a O
very O
good O
meal O
. O

The O
great O
Midtown B-LOC
shrines O
to O
French B-CUISINE
cuisine O
were O
mourned O
one O
by O
one O
as O
they O
went O
, O
often O
at O
length O
and O
in O
print O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
another O
style O
of O
French B-CUISINE
restaurant O
was O
dying O
off O
, O
but O
generally O
without O
benefit O
of O
a O

This O

Occasionally O

stand O

either O
a O

As O
soon O
as O
you O
order O
, O
you O
get O
a O
preview O
of O
what O
you O
're O
in O
for O
: O
A O
length O
of O
chewy O
, O
substantial O
baguette B-FOOD
arrives O
with O
a O
small O
mound O
of O
cultured B-FOOD
butter I-FOOD
, O
a O
pile O
of O
truffled B-FOOD
cheese I-FOOD
spread I-FOOD
and O
a O
pink O
hunk O
of O
rustic O
pork B-FOOD
pate I-FOOD
. O

On O
a O
quiet O
night O
at O
home O
, O
this O
could O
serve O
as O
a O
light O
dinner O
. O

At O
Pierre B-EST
Lapin I-EST
, O
it O
is O
a O
little O
snack O
to O
stave O
off O
hunger O
before O
the O
appetizers O
. O

Going O
back O
at O
least O
as O
far O
as O
his O
days O
at O
Commerce B-EST
, O
Mr. O
Moore O
has O
seemed O
at O
home O
with O
profuse O
helpings O
and O
sauces O
that O
settled O
over O
them O
like O
a O
goose O
- O
down O
duvet O
over O
a O
sleeping O
Saint O
Bernard O
. O

After O
closing O
that O
restaurant O
, O
he O
opened O
an O
ode O
to O
Southern B-CUISINE
immoderation B-TYPE
called O
Harold B-EST
's I-EST
Meat I-EST
& I-EST
Three O
, O
now O
just O
Harold B-EST
's O
; O
the O
most O
memorable O
thing O
I O
've O
eaten O
there O
was O
a O
Kentucky B-LOC
hot B-DISH
brown I-DISH
sandwich I-DISH
on O
which O
the O
Mornay B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
flowed O
freely O
. O

He O
also O
briefly O
ran O
a O
less O
focused O
study O
of O
Americana O
called O
the O
Greenwich B-EST
Grille I-EST
, O
where O
I O
ate O
a O
chicken B-DISH
potpie I-DISH
that O
I O
thought O
had O
potential O
. O

About O
a O
week O
later O
, O
I O
learned O
that O
the O
place O
had O
closed O
. O

None O
of O
Mr. O
Moore O
's O
previous O
kitchens O
went O
for O
the O
gut O
quite O
as O
gleefully O
as O
Pierre B-EST
Lapin I-EST
's O
. O

Your O
first O
course O
there O
could O
well O
be O
, O
and O
almost O
certainly O
will O
be O
if O
you O
leave O
the O
choice O
to O
me O
, O
an O
avalanche O
of O
mushrooms B-FOOD
in I-FOOD
cream I-FOOD
cascading O
over O
the O
edge O
of O
a O
tall O
slab O
of O
buttered B-FOOD
and I-FOOD
griddled I-FOOD
pain I-FOOD
de I-FOOD
mie I-FOOD
. O

But O
it O
would O
be O
a O
mistake O
to O
overlook O
the O
Brie B-DISH
au I-DISH
four I-DISH
, O
roughly O
half O
a O
pound O
of O
baked B-FOOD
Brie I-FOOD
melting O
among O
dried B-FOOD
figs I-FOOD
and O
walnuts B-FOOD
, O
all O
served O
with O
toasted B-FOOD
baguette I-FOOD
. O

I O
ended O
up O
ordering O
the O
Brie B-FOOD
for O
the O
table O
, O
which O
freed O
somebody O
else O
to O
get O
the O
very O
meaty O
frogs B-FOOD
' I-FOOD
legs O
in O
a O
small O
lake O
of O
parsley B-FOOD
, O
garlic B-FOOD
, O
butter B-FOOD
and O
lemon B-FOOD
juice I-FOOD
, O
while O
another O
guest O
tried O
the O
" O
balle B-DISH
de I-DISH
matzo I-DISH
en I-DISH
consomme I-DISH
. O
" O

In O
English O
, O
that O
means O
a O
nice O
bowl O
of O
chicken B-FOOD
soup I-FOOD
with O
a O
single O
matzo B-FOOD
ball I-FOOD
so O
densely O
packed O
that O
if O
you O
tossed O
it O
out O
of O
a O
second O
- O
story O
window O
it O
would O
probably O
put O
a O
dent O
in O
a O
car O
hood O
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
trait O
in O
a O
matzo B-FOOD
ball I-FOOD
unless O
you O
happen O
to O
own O
the O
car O
. O

The O
lusty O
tune O
begun O
by O
the O

is O
picked O
up O

around O
in O

Cognac B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
flamed I-FOOD
cream O
sauce O
. O

It O
sounds O
insanely O
overcrowded O
, O
but O
is O
very O
rewarding O
to O
unpack O
. O

We O
have O
only O
scratched O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
menu O
. O

It O
goes O
on O
, O
perhaps O
longer O
than O
it O
should O
, O
because O
some O
dishes O
are O
more O
appealing O
than O
others O
. O

A O
black B-FOOD
sea I-FOOD
bass I-FOOD
" O
bonne B-DISH
femme I-DISH
" O
was O
simply O
dull O
instead O
of O
simple O
. O

The O
soupy O
, O
thin O
cassoulet B-DISH
could O
have O
used O
more O
meat B-FOOD
and O
a O
thicker O
crust O
of O
bread B-FOOD
crumbs I-FOOD
. O

The O
garlic B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
Mr. O
Moore O
made O
for O
snails B-FOOD
tasted O
less O
garlicky O
than O
run O
- O
of O
- O
the O
- O
mill O
snail B-FOOD
butter I-FOOD
; O
the O
snails B-FOOD
and O
I O
never O
figured O
out O
what O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
do O
with O
the O
sunny B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
side O
- O
up O
egg O
planted O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
plate O
. O

The O
menu O
could O
be O
trimmed O
by O
about O
a O
third O
. O

The O
same O
is O
most O
likely O
true O
for O
a O
few O
individual O
dishes O
, O
although O
Mr. O
Moore O
's O
shambolic O
, O
celebratory O
cooking O
style O
is O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
Pierre B-EST
Lapin I-EST
works O
as O
well O
as O
it O
does O
. O

If O
he O
tidied O
everything O
up O
he O
'd O
be O
going O
head O
- O
to O
- O
head O
with O
Le B-EST
Coucou I-EST
, O
a O
contest O
that O
would O
not O
play O
to O
his O
strengths O
. O

The O
excess O
, O
the O
untucked O
shirttails O
on O
the O
dishes O
, O
the O
incomplete O
thoughts O
on O
the O
menu O
are O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
's O
charm O
. O

That O
charm O
does O
not O
quite O
extend O
to O
the O
wine O
list O
, O
which O
looks O
like O
one O
from O
four O
decades O
ago O
. O

It O
's O
almost O
entirely O
drawn O
from O
Bordeaux B-FOOD
, O
Burgundy B-FOOD
and O
the O
Rhone B-FOOD
, O
with O
very O
few O
bottles O
under O
$ O
75 O
. O

This O
seems O
to O
be O
taking O
the O
joke O
a O
little O
too O
far O
-- O
in O
1971 O
, O
you O
could O
still O
get O
cheap O
Bordeaux B-FOOD
. O

I O
drank O
well O
, O
but O
I O
always O
spent O
more O
on O
it O
than O
I O
meant O
to O
, O
which O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
thing O
that O
can O
keep O
diners O
from O
coming O
back O
. O

For O
dessert O
there O
is O
a O
coconut B-DISH
cake I-DISH
that O
has O
little O
to O
do O
with O
France B-LOC

Dense O
and O
rich O

a O
homespun O
American B-CUISINE
style O
that O
some O
people O
will O
love O
and O
others O
will O
find O
too O
leaden O
, O
it O
followed O
Mr. O
Moore O
here O
from O
Commerce B-EST
, O
where O
it O
was O
a O
big O
hit O
. O

Other O
members O
of O
the O
lineup O
you O
already O
know O
. O

The O
chocolate B-DISH
mousse I-DISH
is O
deliciously O
dark O
, O
though O
not O
as O
airy O
as O
it O
could O
be O
. O

The O

crust I-FOOD
on O
the O

Both O
are O
overshadowed O
, O
though O
, O
by O
a O
peculiarly O
likable O
Pavlova B-DISH
. O

It O
is O
conceived O
as O
a O
tart B-FOOD

with O
a O
meringue B-FOOD
crust I-FOOD

a O
whipped B-FOOD

would O
have O

Part O
of O
the O
fun O
of O
eating O
at O
a O
pop B-TYPE
- O
up O
is O
the O
thrill O
of O
invading O
a O
space O
after O
hours O
, O
like O
being O
locked O
in O
the O
museum O
at O
night O
with O
the O
whale O
and O
the O
diamonds O
. O

Another O
part O
is O
the O
sense O
of O
being O
in O
on O
a O
secret O
, O
eating O
at O
some O
place O
that O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
Yelp O
entry O
and O
may O
not O
even O
have O
a O
name O
, O
while O
your O
friends O
are O
waiting O
in O
line O
at O
Roberta B-EST

The O
mismatch O
between O
the O
borrowed O
space O
and O
the O
borrowers O
can O
send O
off O
sparks O
, O
too O
. O

Three O
years O
ago O
, O
when O
the O
Danish O
chef O
Bo O
Bech O
staged O
a O
one O
- O
night O
pop B-TYPE
- O
up O
in O
the O
kitchen O
at O
Cosme B-EST
in O
Manhattan B-LOC
, O
using O
ingredients O
he O
'd O
bought O
from O
farmers O
and O
shellfishers O
in O
Virginia B-LOC
the O
day O
before O
, O
his O
Mid B-CUISINE
- O
Atlantic O
- O
Nordic O
cooking O
stood O
out O
against O
the O
aromas O
of O
griddled B-FOOD
masa I-FOOD
and O
roasted B-FOOD
chiles I-FOOD
. O

When O
a O
pop B-TYPE
- O
up O
settles O
down O
into O
a O
space O
of O
its O
own O
, O
it O
loses O
those O
things O
. O

In O
their O
place O
, O
it O
takes O
on O
the O
extra O
weight O
of O
proprietorship O
. O

The O
owners O
have O
to O
make O
decisions O
that O
were O
previously O
made O
for O
them O
, O
and O
those O
decisions O
will O
start O
to O
define O
them O
. O

It O
's O
their O
paint O

on O
the O
wall O
, O
their O
scented O
candles O
in O
the O
bathroom O
, O
their O
name O

the O
door O
. O

This O
is O
the O
position O
in O
which O
we O
find O
the O
former O
pop B-TYPE
- O
up O
Oxalis B-EST
and O
its O
chef O
, O
Nico O
Russell O
, O
a O
veteran O
of O
Daniel B-EST
, O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
and O
Mirazur B-EST
, O
on O
the O
French B-LOC
Riviera I-LOC
. O

Beginning O
in O
2016 O
, O
Mr. O
Russell O
slalomed O
through O
a O
series O
of O
restaurants O
that O
would O
hand O
him O
the O
keys O
on O
off O
nights O
so O
he O
could O
cook O
tasting O
menus O
of O
10 O
courses O
or O
so O
. O

First O
he O
inhabited O
Fitzcarraldo B-EST
, O
an O
Italian B-CUISINE
restaurant O
whose O
combination O
of O
industrial O
, O
nautical O
, O
cinematic O
and O
Mediterranean O
elements O
has O
made O
it O
a O
frequent O
wedding O
site O
. O

Later O
he O
moved O
on O
to O
Egg B-EST
, O
an O
austerely O
contemporary O
temple O
to O
breakfast O
which O
had O
begun O
its O
own O
life O
, O
more O
than O
a O
decade O
earlier O
, O
as O
a O
pop B-TYPE
- O
up O
. O

He O
sold O
tickets O
to O
his O
Oxalis B-EST
dinners O
, O
enough O
of O
them O
to O
get O
a O
few O
investors O
interested O
. O

With O
enough O
funding O
to O
take O
on O
a O
lease O
in O
Crown B-LOC
Heights I-LOC
, O
Oxalis B-EST
opened O
in O
November O
in O
a O
former O
wine B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
within O
sight O
of O
the O
Brooklyn B-LOC
Museum I-LOC
. O

Mr. O
Russell O
's O
vision O
for O
Oxalis B-EST
is O
the O
one O
behind O
the O
bistronomie O
movement O
in O
France B-LOC
and O
its O
disciples O
abroad O
: O
carefully O
considered O
food O
served O
without O
the O
hoopla O
that O
drives O
up O
tabs O
. O

He O
slings O
a O
lot O
of O
vegetables B-FOOD
in O
Oxalis B-EST
's O
four- O
to O
six O
- O
course O
set O
menus O
, O
and O
it O
's O
one O
sign O
of O
his O
skill O
that O
this O
does O
n't O
come O
across O
as O
a O
cost O
- O
cutting O
measure O
even O
though O
it O
must O
be O
, O
at O
least O
in O
part O
-- O
dinner O
is O
an O
extremely O
reasonable O
$ O
60 O
. O

Both O
the O
price O
and O
the O
understated O
cooking O
style O
reminded O
me O
of O
Contra B-EST
, O
which O
opened O
with O
a O
five O
- O
course O
, O
$ O
55 O
menu O
. O

The O
last O
time O
I O
went O
I O
ate O
a O
dish O
built O
around O
spaghetti B-FOOD
- O
like O
strands O
of O
rutabaga B-FOOD
under O
a O
warm O
snowdrift O
of O
whipped B-FOOD
Alpine I-FOOD
fontina I-FOOD
. O

These O
two O
mild O
- O
tasting O
ingredients O
were O
set O
in O
motion O
by O
the O
force O
of O
a O
third O
, O
a O
dark O
and O
focused O
coffee B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
and I-FOOD
- O
chicory O
cream O
sauce O
. O

This O
was O
a O
rutabaga B-FOOD
that O
made O
me O
smile O
. O

Granted O
, O
I O
probably O
like O
rutabaga B-FOOD
more O
than O
the O
average O
person O
, O
but O
I O
suspect O
that O
exposure O
to O
the O
rutabaga B-FOOD
at O
Oxalis B-EST
would O
make O
the O
average O
person O
realize O
that O
I O
'm O
right O
. O

Meals O
begin O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
bite O
- O
size O
snacks O
, O
one O
of O
which O
tends O
to O
be O
a O
crisp O
potato B-DISH
cake I-DISH
dusted O
with O
bay B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
leaf O
powder O
and O
topped O
with O
a O
chip O
of O
nori B-FOOD
. O

It O
looks O
harmless O
enough O
, O
but O
can O
produce O
powerful O
emotions O
, O
which O
are O
easier O
to O
understand O
once O
you O
know O
that O
the O
potatoes B-FOOD
are O
stewed O
in O
duck B-FOOD
fat I-FOOD
and O
then O
deep O
- O
fried O
. O

The O
other O
snack O
might O
be O
some O
lightly O
dehydrated B-DISH
beets I-DISH
brushed O
with O
marjoram B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
infused O
cream O
, O
or O
tiny O
grilled B-DISH
carrots I-DISH
that O
you O
dip O
in O
chamomile B-FOOD
sabayon I-FOOD
. O

( O
This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
dishes O
that O
suggests O
the O
long O
shadow O
of O
Noma B-EST
, O
which O
in O
its O
early O
days O
famously O
matched O
aged B-FOOD
carrots I-FOOD
with O
chamomile B-FOOD
. O
) O

The O
price O
seems O
meant O
to O
encourage O
frequent O
visits O
, O
but O
if O
you O
return O
often O
you O
may O
experience O
deja O
vu O
. O

At O
meals O
in O
December O
, O
January O
and O
February O
, O
I O
was O
always O
served O
some O
variation O
on O
raw B-FOOD
sea I-FOOD
scallops I-FOOD
with O
daikon B-FOOD
and O
apple B-FOOD
and O
some O
version O
of O
duck B-FOOD
breast I-FOOD
, O
sweet B-FOOD
potato I-FOOD
and O
yogurt B-FOOD
. O

The O
portions O
in O
both O
cases O
were O
restrained O
but O
the O
flavors O
were O
outsize O
. O

The O
scallops B-FOOD
were O
cured O
in O
miso B-FOOD
and O
refrigerated O
for O
a O
few O
days O
and O
came O
out O
of O
it O
with O
something O
like O
the O
concentration O
of O
flavor O
that O
beef B-FOOD
gets O
from O
dry O
- O
aging O
, O
but O
none O
of O
the O
funk O
. O

The O
duck B-FOOD
's O
flavor O
was O
less O
surprising O
, O
but O
there O
was O
some O
energy O
in O
its O
collision O
with O
sweet B-FOOD
potato I-FOOD
puree I-FOOD
and O
fig B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
leaf O
yogurt O
tart O
enough O
to O
cause O
double O
- O
takes O
. O

Like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
menu O
, O
desserts O
are O
unshowy O
but O
can O
be O
highly O
impressive O
. O

One O
worked O
goat B-FOOD
milk I-FOOD
up O
into O
a O
thing O
of O
beauty O
: O
Some O
of O
it O
was O
made O
into O
a O
simple O
frozen B-FOOD
custard I-FOOD
, O
the O
rest O
cooked O
down O
into O
cajeta B-FOOD
. O

The O
cooking O
makes O
it O
clear O
why O
people O
chased O
Oxalis B-EST
around O
Brooklyn B-LOC
in O
its O
various O
borrowed O
spaces O
, O
but O
other O
aspects O
of O
the O
restaurant O
suggest O
that O
it O
has O
n't O
quite O
figured O
out O
how O
to O
live O
in O
a O
space O
of O
its O
own O
. O

A O
meal O
there O
can O
be O
a O
somewhat O
solemn O
experience O
, O
which O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
be O
what O
Mr. O
Russell O
and O
his O
partners O
are O
aiming O
for O
. O

The O
layout O
seems O
to O
work O
against O
it O
. O

The O
kitchen O
is O
right O
up O
front O
, O
and O
the O
bar O
is O
all O
the O
way O
in O
the O
back O
, O
separated O
from O
the O
dining O
room O
by O
a O
glass O
door O
in O
a O
glass O
wall O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
what O
the O
wall O
is O
for O
, O
unless O
Oxalis B-EST
is O
planning O
to O
bring O
back O
the O
smoking O
section O
. O

Instead O
of O
serving O
as O
a O
street O
- O
side O
welcome O
and O
a O
source O
of O
energy O
for O
the O
dining O
room O
, O
the O
bar O
feels O
like O
a O
waiting O
room O
. O

And O
while O
it O
takes O
reservations O
, O
the O
tasting O
menu O
is O
n't O
served O
there O
. O

The O
bar O
menu O
is O
a O
la O
carte O
. O

The O
dining O
room O
could O
use O
a O
little O
lift O
. O

It O
's O
as O
plain O
as O
a O
Shaker O
church O
, O
with O
clamshell O
- O
colored O
wainscoting O
below O
white O
walls O
unbroken O
by O
pictures O
or O
anything O
else O
. O

( O
All O
the O
art O
is O
in O
the O
restroom O
. O
) O

The O
way O
the O
servers O
have O
been O
coached O
on O
their O
lines O
so O
far O
underlines O
the O
decorative O
stiffness O
. O

They O
say O
stuff O
like O
" O
Moving O
now O
into O
more O
sweet O
things O
" O
rather O
than O
" O
Here O
's O
your O
dessert O
, O
" O
and O
my O
neighbor O
one O
night O
was O
instructed O
to O
" O
sit O
back O
and O
relax O
, O
" O
something O
that O
tends O
to O
go O
without O
saying O
in O
most O
restaurants O
. O

Things O
have O
loosened O
up O
since O
the O
liquor O
license O
came O
through O
. O

In O
the O
first O
few O
weeks O
, O
the O
servers O
were O
always O
trying O
to O
push O
a O
nonalcoholic O
beverage O
pairing O
for O
$ O
20 O
, O
and O
while O
the O
bar O
was O
mixing O
sodas O
that O
were O
more O
interesting O
than O
many O
cocktails O
around O
town O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
they O
were O
different O
enough O
from O
one O
another O
to O
justify O
drinking O
the O
whole O
slate O
. O

Now O
there O
are O
also O
wine O
pairings O
, O
starting O
at O
$ O
35 O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
wondered O
whether O
it O
would O
get O
the O
air O
circulating O
if O
the O
bar O
popped O
up O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
, O
or O
vice O
versa O
. O

There O
's O
probably O
some O
simple O
fix O
, O
or O
a O
series O
of O
them O
, O
that O
would O
give O
Oxalis O
some O
of O
its O
old O
sense O
of O
adventure O
. O

You O
can O
sense O
it O
lying O
there O
, O
waiting O
, O
when O
you O
taste O
that O
cajeta O
, O
those O
scallops O
, O
the O
fantastic O
little O
potato O
cakes O
. O

Despite O

the O

By O
that O
time O

all O
that O

to O

The O
other O
reason O
for O
the O

is O
that O
it O
recapitulates O
a O
pattern O
that O

the O

its O
resemblance O

his O

kept O
on O

that O
he O
carries O

mounds O

On O
March O
1 O
, O
looking O

eat O

it O

This O

This O
one O
course O
, O
if O
tripled O
in O

, O
could O
be O
spun O
off O

would O
probably O
be O

So O
far O
, O
Hall B-EST
has O
not O
been O
fully O
discovered O
, O
but O
it O
still O
gets O
busy O
enough O
at O
dinner O
time O
that O
you O
can O
be O
stranded O
by O
the O
front O
door O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
before O
anyone O
on O
staff O
notices O
. O

Some O
diners O
on O
their O
way O
to O
Odo B-EST
will O
find O
this O
an O
awkward O
start O
to O
a O
meal O
that O
costs O
$ O
200 O
before O
tax O
, O
tip O
and O
drinks O
. O

But O
they O
may O
also O
discern O
that O
Hall B-EST
, O
lined O
with O
carved O
oak O
panels O
salvaged O
from O
what O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
a O
library O
or O
church O
vestry O
from O
around O
1900 O
, O
is O
one O
of O
the O
neighborhood O
's O
most O
entrancing O
rooms O
; O
that O
the O
corridor O
, O
which O
seems O
too O
narrow O
and O
definitely O
climbs O
on O
its O
way O
toward O
a O
too O
- O
short O
brass O
door O
with O
no O
handle O
, O
is O
perspective O
- O
altering O
in O
a O
way O
a O
Surrealist O
would O
enjoy O
; O
and O
that O
Odo B-EST
, O
a O
shadowy O
and O
windowless O
space O
on O
the O
far O
side O
of O
that O
door O
is O
an O
unusually O
tranquil O
shelter O
from O
crowds O
, O
noise O
and O
anything O
else O
you O
might O
want O
to O
get O
away O
from O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
. O

The O
14 O

the O

, O
in O
the O

of O
it O

a O

This O
is O
where O
Mr. O
Odo O
and O
his O
cooks O
assemble O
the O
other O

I O
promised O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
. O

Duck B-DISH
breast I-DISH
has O
been O
grilled O
over O
charcoal O
and O
positioned O
between O
two O
sauces B-FOOD

One O
is O
a O
black O
spill O
of O
concentrated B-FOOD
soy I-FOOD

with O
sansho B-FOOD
pepper I-FOOD
; O
the O
other O
is O
an O
ivory O
pool O
of O
pureed B-FOOD
apples I-FOOD
and O
cream B-FOOD
. O

These O
sauces B-FOOD
contrast O
in O
every O
way O
you O
can O
think O
of O
, O
including O
East O
versus O
West O
, O
and O
they O
come O
together O
like O
opposing O
poles O
of O
a O

. O

A O
springy O
chunk O
of O
truffle B-FOOD

truffles I-FOOD
floating O

You O
smell O
truffles B-FOOD
in O
the O
air O
first O
, O
get O
them O
on O
the O
tip O
of O
your O
tongue O
next O
and O
finally O
taste O
them O
everywhere O
when O
they O
're O
released O
from O
the O
mochi B-FOOD
. O

A O

something O

an O

O.D.O. O
-- O
pursues O
local O

not O
just O
for O
its O

throughout O

. O

The O

Kaiseki O

near O

liturgical O

almost O
seems O
to O

the O
minute O
they O

available O

Mr. O
Odo O
came O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
as O
the O
chef O
of O
Kajitsu B-EST
, O
the O
extraordinary O
restaurant O
on O
East B-LOC
39th I-LOC
Street I-LOC
that O
follows O
the O
vegetarian B-DIET
cooking O
tradition O
known O
as O
shojin O
ryori O
, O
born O
centuries O
ago O
in O
Zen O
Buddhist O
temples O
. O

One O
contribution O
he O
made O
in O
his O
five O
years O
there O
was O
to O
freshen O
up O
the O
menus O
with O
more O
food O
grown O
nearby O
. O

In O
the O
first O
and O
last O
tastes O
of O
his O
February O
and O
March O
menus O
, O
he O
anchors O
Odo B-EST
firmly O
in O
the O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
region O
. O

When O
you O
sit O
down O
, O
you O
are O
immediately O
poured O
a O
cup O
of O
cold O
sake B-FOOD
. O

It O
is O
brewed O
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
, O
and O
it O
is O
very O
good O
, O
swirling O
with O
fresh B-FOOD
- O
fruit O
aromatics O
. O

Then O
at O
the O
end O
, O
after O
the O
fresh O
fruit B-FOOD
, O
Mr. O
Odo O
serves O
ice B-DISH
cream I-DISH
made O
with O
kasu B-FOOD
, O
the O
creamy O
solids O
left O
over O
at O
the O
end O
of O
sake B-FOOD
distillation O
. O

The O
ice B-DISH
cream I-DISH
looks O
like O
vanilla B-FOOD
and O
tastes O
, O
not O
surprisingly O
, O
like O
fermented B-FOOD
rice I-FOOD
. O

This O
particular O
kasu B-FOOD
is O
supplied O
by O
the O
same O
brewery B-TYPE
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
that O
makes O
the O
sake B-FOOD
. O

Expanding O
his O
range O
to O
meat B-FOOD
and O
fish B-FOOD
at O
Odo B-EST
, O
he O
has O
kept O
the O
resourcefulness O
that O
limitations O
encourage O
. O

Somewhere O
along O
the O
way O
Mr. O
Odo O
also O
picked O
up O
technical O
skills O
in O
traditions O
far O
outside O
kaiseki O
. O

Each O
night O
, O
in O
the O
gohan O
course O
, O
Odo O
offers O
a O
choice O
of O
three O
starchy O
dishes O
. O

This O
is O
where O
I O
encountered O
a O
very O
fine O
seafood B-DISH
curry I-DISH
over I-DISH
rice I-DISH
; O
an O
elegant O
bowl O
of O
short B-DISH
ramen I-DISH
noodles I-DISH
in I-DISH
king I-DISH
crab I-DISH
broth I-DISH
; O
and O
fresh O
soba B-DISH
served O
with O
little O
pieces O
of O
pickled B-FOOD
vegetables I-FOOD
and O
wasabi B-FOOD
blossoms I-FOOD
, O
looking O
a O
bit O
like O
broccoli B-FOOD
florets I-FOOD
but O
tasting O
like O
mustard B-FOOD
. O

As O
with O
the O
cocktail B-FOOD
and O
the O
sushi B-FOOD
, O
each O
of O
these O
dishes O
could O
, O
if O
Mr. O
Odo O
wanted O
, O
be O
leveraged O
into O
separate O
specialized O
restaurants O
, O
or O
food B-TYPE
- I-TYPE
hall O
stands O
. O

You O
could O
tell O
yourself O
that O
$ O
200 O
is O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
money O
for O
a O
single O
meal O
or O
you O
could O
say O
that O
for O
the O
chance O
to O
visit O
all O
these O
different O
establishments O
without O
leaving O
your O
seat O
, O
it O
's O
a O
pretty O
good O
deal O
. O

Either O
way O
, O
you O
'd O
be O
right O

When O
I O
left O
my O
home O
state O
of O
Rhode B-LOC
Island I-LOC
at O
18 O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
take O
long O
to O
discover O
that O
there O
was O
almost O
nothing O
about O
its O
local O
food O
customs O
that O
did O
n't O
make O
outsiders O
laugh O
. O

That O
small O
children O
routinely O
bought O
coffee B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
flavored O
milk O
in O
school O
cafeterias O
; O
that O
" O
beer B-FOOD
" O
was O
not O
pronounced O
with O
an O
" O

at O
the O
end O
, O

pizza B-FOOD
was O
; O
that O
a O
hot B-FOOD
dog I-FOOD

to O
about O
four O
inches O
and O
topped O
with O
meat B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD

that O

time O
may O
deploy O
a O
maneuver O
known O
as O
" O
wieners O
up O
the O

-- O
all O
of O
this O
apparently O
strikes O
people O
who O
grew O
up O
more O
than O
20 O
miles O
from O
Providence B-LOC
as O
very O
funny O
. O

When O
New O
Yorkers O
hear O
that O
Violet B-EST
, O
a O
new O
restaurant O
in O
the O
East B-LOC
Village I-LOC
, O
serves O
a O
style O
of O
pizza B-FOOD
that O
comes O
from O
Rhode B-LOC
Island I-LOC
, O
they O
start O
to O
smile O
, O
as O
if O
getting O
ready O
for O
the O
punch O
line O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
though O
, O
Violet B-EST
's O
pies B-FOOD
are O
a O
homage O
not O
to O
the O
whole O
state O
but O
to O
a O
specific O
restaurant O
, O
Al B-EST
Forno I-EST
, O
in O
Providence B-LOC
. O

If O
you O
know O
one O
thing O
about O
Al B-EST
Forno I-EST
, O
you O
know O
that O
its O
pizza B-FOOD
is O
not O
a O
joke O
. O

One O
of O
the O
restaurant O
's O
two O
founders O
, O
George O
Germon O
, O
originated O
the O
recipe O
in O
the O
early O
1980s O
, O
more O
or O
less O
out O
of O
desperation O
. O

After O
failing O
to O
get O
an O
oven O
hot O
enough O
to O
produce O
a O
crust B-FOOD
as O
thin O
and O
crunchy O
as O
the O
ones O
he O
remembered O
eating O
in O
Italy B-LOC
, O
he O
tossed O
dough B-FOOD
on O
a O
wood O
- O
burning O
grill O
and O
watched O
in O
awe O
as O
it O
stiffened O
to O
a O
crisp O
almost O
instantly O
. O

The O
pizza B-FOOD
he O
and O
his O
wife O
, O
Johanne O
Killeen O
, O
would O
develop O
and O
elaborate O
from O
there O
was O
in O
a O
category O
of O
its O
own O
. O

The O
skills O
required O
to O
bake O
dough B-FOOD
in O
a O
pizza O
oven O
, O
whether O
it O
runs O
on O
gas O
, O
coal O
or O
wood O
, O
do O
n't O
apply O
to O
grilled B-FOOD
pizza I-FOOD
at O
all O
. O

This O
makes O
it O
an O
unending O
source O
of O
fascination O
to O
pizza O
technologists O
including O
Violet B-EST
's O
chef O
, O
Matt O
Hyland O
. O

With O
his O
wife O
and O
business O
partner O
, O
Emily O

Mr. O

paid O
tribute O
to O

New B-LOC

pizza B-FOOD
at O
his O
first O

then O
took O
on O
Detroit B-LOC
pan B-FOOD
pizza I-FOOD
at O
Emmy B-EST

They O
have O
expanded O
both O

But O
Mr. O

has O
been O
a O
student O
of O
the O
Al B-EST
Forno I-EST
school O
of O
pizza B-FOOD
for O
years O

since O
going O

Violet B-EST
, O
which O
he O
opened O
at O
the O
start O
of O
the O
year O
, O
is O
dedicated O
to O
the O
style O

He O
has O
worked O
allusions O
to O
other O
features O
of O
the O
state O

cuisine O
into O
the O
menu O
, O
which O
makes O
forays O
into O
pasta B-FOOD
and O
small O
seafood B-FOOD
dishes O
, O
but O
the O
pizza O
grill O
is O
at O
the O
center O
of O
the O
action O
. O

Anyone O
who O
has O
eaten O
at O
Al B-EST
Forno I-EST
will O
recognize O
the O
lineage O
of O
Violet B-EST
's O
pies B-FOOD
. O

Both O
are O
as O
thin O
as O
a O
saltine B-FOOD
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
edge O
, O
with O
parallel O
lines O
of O
grill O
marks O
on O
their O
undersides O
. O

Al B-EST
Forno I-EST
puts O
fontina B-FOOD
on O
its O
margheritas B-DISH
, O
as O
Violet B-EST
did O
with O
all O
its O
pizzas B-FOOD
until O
recently O
, O
when O
it O
began O
experimenting O
with O
havarti B-FOOD
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
the O
cheeses B-FOOD
are O
on O
the O
dry O
side O
and O
grated O
for O
fast O
, O
thin O
distribution O
. O

Sauces B-FOOD
are O
splashed O
down O
by O
the O
spoonful O
, O
quickly O
, O
before O
the O
crust B-FOOD
burns O
. O

That O
's O
the O
template O
for O
a O
pie B-FOOD
called O
the O
Atwells B-DISH
: O
a O
base O
coat O
of O
grated O
havarti B-FOOD
and O
pecorino B-FOOD
under O
big O
blots O
of O
a O
garlic B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
laden O
pesto O
made O
even O
greener O
than O
usual O
by O
the O
inclusion O
of O
broccoli B-FOOD
and O
pistachios B-FOOD
. O

While O
Al B-EST
Forno I-EST
tosses O
raw O
, O
slivered O
scallions B-FOOD
on O
almost O
every O
pie B-FOOD
, O
Violet B-EST
may O
chop O
its O
scallions B-FOOD
or O
grill O
them O
. O

One O
appealingly O
eccentric O
pie B-FOOD
that O
combines O
a O
New B-LOC
Haven I-LOC
clam B-FOOD
pizza I-FOOD
with O
a O
Peking B-FOOD
duck I-FOOD
pancake I-FOOD
is O
finished O
with O
fried B-FOOD
julienned I-FOOD
leeks I-FOOD
. O

Olive B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
does O
give O
Al B-EST
Forno I-EST
's O
crust B-FOOD
extra O
crackle O
and O
flavor O
, O
but O
Violet B-EST
's O
less O
lavishly O
oiled O
dough B-FOOD
, O
made O
with O
a O
sourdough B-FOOD
starter I-FOOD
, O
has O
more O
flavor O
of O
its O
own O
. O

It O
's O
a O
little O
salty O
, O
crunchy O
but O
not O
brittle O
, O
more O
substantial O
than O
you O
expect O
, O
and O
highly O
chewable O
. O

Violet B-EST
gives O
you O
a O
heavy O
pair O
of O
shears O
to O
snip O
the O
pie B-FOOD
into O
wedges O
, O
or O
any O
shape O
you O
like O
. O

Wielding O
them O
supplies O
the O
palpable O
thrill O
of O
using O
exactly O
the O
right O
tool O
for O
the O
job O
, O
and O
it O
's O
even O
better O
than O
that O
because O
the O
job O
is O
eating O
pizza B-FOOD
. O

A O
trip O
to O
Providence B-LOC
last O
weekend O
, O
though O
, O
turned O
up O
more O
than O
structural O
similarities O
between O
Violet B-EST
and O
Al B-EST
Forno I-EST
. O

Three O
of O
the O
four O
pizzas B-FOOD
on O
Al B-EST
Forno I-EST
's O
menu O
reminded O
me O
of O
pies B-FOOD
I O
'd O
eaten O
at O
Violet B-EST
. O

One O
resembled O
the O
Atwells B-DISH
, O
but O
its O
pesto B-FOOD
was O
made O
with O
asparagus B-FOOD
rather O
than O
broccoli B-FOOD
. O

For O
Violet B-EST
's O
Beech B-DISH
Vibes I-DISH
, O
a O
thin O
layer O
of O
duxelles B-FOOD
is O
spread O
from O
rim O
to O
rim O
, O
then O
topped O
with O
tahini B-FOOD
, O
caramelized B-FOOD
onions I-FOOD
and O
pickled B-FOOD
beech I-FOOD
mushrooms I-FOOD
. O

It O
reminds O
me O
of O
a O
pissaladiere B-FOOD
in O
which O
the O
anchovies B-FOOD
have O
been O
replaced O
by O
mushrooms B-FOOD
. O

Al B-EST

The O
difference O
between O

does O
n't O
quite O
put O
to O
rest O
the O
suspicion O
that O

conscientious O
about O

Beyond O

All O

probably O
more O

I O
have O
never O

if O
you O

all O

that O

under O
the O

the O

Nothing O
about O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
Cornish B-CUISINE

at O
Blue B-EST
Smoke I-EST
screams O
, O
" O
I O
am O
the O
best O
thing O
you O
will O
eat O
today O
! O
" O

It O
looks O
a O
bit O
like O
a O
deflated O
football O
that O
somebody O
punctured O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
sticks O
and O
dragged O
through O
the O

In O

in O
Blue B-EST
Smoke I-EST

attempt O

bring O
together O
the O
barbecued B-DISH

the O

a O
good O

more O
than O

The O
process O
goes O
like O
this O
, O
approximately O
: O
spatchcocked O
, O
brined O
, O
rubbed O
with O
spices B-FOOD

smoked O

the O
last O

" O
That O
introduction O
of O
fresh O
chile B-FOOD
onto O
that O
fried B-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD

it O
just O
brings O
the O
zing O

Then O
came O
one O
final O
touch O
, O
he O
said O
: O
" O
a O
little O
swirlybird O
of O
Tabasco B-FOOD
hot I-FOOD
honey I-FOOD

you O

But O
you O
'll O
know O
there O

more O
to O
it O
when O
your O
jaw O
smashes O
through O
the O
dark O

I O
'm O
starting O
to O
think O
the O
American O
cult O
of O
chef O
worship O
may O
really O
be O
on O
the O
way O
out O
. O

At O
the O
very O
least O
, O
it O
has O
paused O
to O
catch O
its O
breath O
. O

Since O
the O
seven O
- O
story O
food O
court O
in O
Hudson B-LOC
Yards I-LOC
was O
unveiled O
last O
month O
, O
the O
public O
reaction O
has O
been O
somewhere O
between O
shrug O
and O
ugh O
. O

Attitudes O
may O
improve O
as O
visitors O
eat O
their O
way O
to O
the O
top O
floor O
. O

So O
far O
, O
though O
, O
the O
response O
has O
n't O
come O
close O
to O
matching O
the O
greeting O
bestowed O
on O
the O
restaurants O
at O
Time B-FOOD
Warner I-FOOD
Center I-FOOD
in O
2004 O
, O
even O
though O
the O
project O
represents O
the O
same O
basic O
idea O
executed O
by O
the O
same O
developer O
with O
at O
least O
one O
of O
the O
same O
chefs O
, O
Thomas O
Keller O
. O

Even O
more O
striking O
has O
been O
the O
low O
- O
key O
reception O
to O
Rocco O
DiSpirito O
's O
return O
. O

Late O
last O
year O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
took O
over O
the O
kitchen O
at O
Standard B-EST
Grill I-EST
in O
the O
meatpacking B-LOC
district I-LOC
. O

At O
one O
point O
, O
when O
he O
was O
the O
chef O
at O
both O
Union B-EST
Pacific I-EST
and O
Rocco B-EST
's I-EST
on I-EST
22nd O
while O
starring O
in O
a O
television O
show O
, O
he O
was O
arguably O
the O
most O
famous O
chef O
in O
the O
country O
. O

Then O
both O
places O
closed O
, O
and O
the O
show O
was O
canceled O
. O

Mr. O
DiSpirito O
has O
not O
been O
in O
charge O
of O
a O
restaurant O
since O
George O
W. O
Bush O
was O
in O
the O
White O
House O
. O

For O
that O
matter O
, O
it O
has O
been O
some O
years O
since O
Standard B-EST
Grill I-EST
itself O
has O
done O
anything O
noteworthy O
. O

In O
2009 O
, O
when O
it O
was O
new O
and O
Dan O
Silverman O
was O
the O
chef O
, O
I O
reviewed O
it O
, O
gave O
it O
one O
star O
and O
then O
lost O
track O
of O
it O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
selection O
of O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
did O
not O
just O
come O
out O
of O
left O
field O
. O

It O
came O
from O
the O
weeds O
across O
the O
street O
from O
the O
parking O
lot O
behind O
left O
field O
. O

For O
surprise O
value O
alone O
, O
it O
should O
have O
been O
one O
of O
the O
year O
's O
most O
buzzed O
- O
about O
news O
items O
. O

But O
the O
trumpets O
have O
been O
muted O
, O
and O
the O
back O
handsprings O
seem O
to O
lack O
a O
certain O
bounce O
. O

This O
, O
at O
least O
, O
is O
the O
view O
from O
outside O
the O
restaurant O
. O

Once O
you O
're O
sitting O
at O
one O
of O
the O
tables O
-- O
newly O
topped O
with O
leather O
pads O
in O
a O
major O
retrofitting O
that O
has O
made O
the O
dining O
room O
look O
like O
an O
expensive O
cabaret O
, O
blue O
velvet O
and O
all O
-- O
you O
will O
hear O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
talk O
about O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
, O
or O
as O
they O
call O
him O
here O
, O
Chef O
Rocco O
. O

Chef O
Rocco O
, O
you O
learn O
, O
conceived O
each O
dish O
on O
the O
menu O
so O
that O
it O
can O
be O
eaten O
by O
one O
person O
or O
shared O
with O
others O
. O

No O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
believe O
it O
at O
first O
, O
either O
, O
but O
apparently O
it O
's O
true O
: O

Rocco O
DiSpirito O
invented O
food O
. O

There O
is O
also O
something O
that O
servers O
call O
Chef B-DISH
Rocco I-DISH
's I-DISH
Game I-DISH
Changing I-DISH
Toast O
, O
although O
sometimes O
they O
shorten O
it O
to O
Rocco B-DISH
's I-DISH
Game I-DISH
Changing O
or O
simply O
Game B-DISH
Changing I-DISH
, O
as O
in O
" O
Here O
's O
a O
little O
more O
Game B-DISH
Changing I-DISH
for O
you O
. O
" O

The O
item O
in O
question O
is O
a O
toasted O
, O
cracker O
- O
thin O
slice O
of O
bread B-FOOD
made O
of O
nuts B-FOOD
, O
oats B-FOOD
, O
seeds B-FOOD
and O
psyllium B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
seed O
husks O
held O
together O
without O
benefit O
of O
wheat B-FOOD
flour I-FOOD
. O

Like O
nearly O
everything O
on O
the O
menu O
, O
it O
is O
free B-DIET
of I-DIET
gluten I-DIET
. O

Being O
mostly O
made O
of O
browned B-FOOD
nuts I-FOOD
, O
it O
is O
also O
delicious O
. O

Whether O
it O
is O
truly O
Rocco O
's O
is O
up O
for O
debate O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
strongly O
resemble O
the O
Life B-DISH
- I-DISH
Changing I-DISH
Loaf I-DISH
of O
Bread O
recipe O
that O
Sarah O
Britton O
published O
on O
her O
blog O
, O
" O
My O
New O
Roots O
, O
" O
in O
2013 O
, O
and O
that O
appeared O
on O
another O
blog O
two O
years O
later O
, O
with O
minor O
changes O
, O
as O
Game B-DISH
Changing I-DISH
Nut I-DISH
& I-DISH
Seed I-DISH
Bread I-DISH
. O

It O
's O
one O
of O
the O
items O
that O
reflect O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
's O
recent O
obsession O
with O
nutrient O
- O
dense O
dietary O
supplements O
, O
although O
the O
way O
it O
keeps O
coming O
up O
in O
the O
servers O
' O
patter O
makes O
you O
wonder O
if O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
spent O
too O
much O
time O
as O
a O
QVC O
pitchman O
. O

Anyway O
, O
somebody O
- O
or O
- O
other O
's O
toast B-FOOD
sits O
under O
the O
smoked B-FOOD
gravlax I-FOOD
, O
red O
with O
beet B-FOOD
juice I-FOOD
and O
very O
silky O
on O
its O
bed O
of O
coconut B-FOOD
creme I-FOOD
fraiche I-FOOD
, O
that O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
sends O
out O
as O
an O
amuse O
. O

A O
plate O
of O
the O
toast B-FOOD
will O
also O
appear O
if O
you O
order O
the O
platter O
of O
acorn B-DISH
- I-DISH
fed I-DISH
, I-DISH
hand O
- O
sliced O
Iberico O
ham O
or O
the O
chilled B-DISH
Maine I-DISH
sea I-DISH
urchins I-DISH
served I-DISH
on I-DISH
the I-DISH
spiky I-DISH
half I-DISH
- O
shell O
. O

Either O
one O
will O
convince O
you O
that O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
his O
hands O
on O
raw O
materials O
that O
can O
stun O
with O
almost O
no O
assistance O
. O

The O
best O
things O
at O
Standard B-EST
Grill I-EST
, O
and O
there O
are O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
them O
, O
depend O
on O
very O
good O
ingredients O
touched O
as O
little O
as O
possible O
. O

Back O
in O
the O
Union B-EST
Pacific I-EST
days O
, O
Mr. O
DiSpirito O
's O
interest O
in O
East B-CUISINE
Asian I-CUISINE
cuisines O
came O
out O
in O
the O
form O
of O
complex O
preparations O
, O
arcane O
ingredients O
and O
out O
- O
of O
- O
nowhere O
juxtapositions O
. O

Now O
he O
seems O
to O
have O
moved O
on O
to O
the O
luxury O
minimalism O
of O
an O
omakase O
sushi O
chef O
, O
a O
style O
that O
was O
foreshadowed O
by O
the O
only O
Union B-EST
Pacific I-EST
dish O

brought O
back O

I O

It O
may O
be O
that O
Mr. O

knows O
exactly O
what O
he O
is O
doing O

Simplicity O
is O
the O
whole O
point O
of O
a O
grill O

which O
is O
first O
cousin O
to O
the O

He O
has O
also O
designed O
a O

so O
straightforward O
that O
if O
, O
after O
a O

period O
of O
time O
, O
he O
is O
no O
longer O

so O
much O
better O

so O
much O
better O

any O

of O

that O
it O

same O
Mr. O

who O
gave O

It O

Looking O
around O

one O
night O
in O
early O
March O

I O
thought O
maybe O
Jenny O
Kwak O

time O
has O
finally O
come O
. O

Her O
third O
restaurant O
, O
Haenyeo B-EST
was O
about O
three O
months O
old O

already O
filled O
with O
people O
who O
looked O
as O
if O
they O
'd O
been O
going O
there O
for O
years O
. O

It O
sits O
on O
a O
prime O

on O
a O

in O

Intimidating O
restaurants O
do O
n't O
tend O
to O
prosper O
here O
. O

Very O
few O
people O
inside O
Haenyeo B-EST
look O
the O
least O
bit O
intimidated O
as O
they O
lift O
grilled B-FOOD
oysters I-FOOD
by O
the O
shell O
to O
pour O
the O
dregs O
of O
hot O

bottom O
layer O
of O
rice B-FOOD
is O
golden O
and O
crunchy O
where O
it O
meets O
the O
hot O
stone O
bowl O
. O

The O
customers O
at O
Haenyeo B-EST
seem O
to O
have O
an O
easy O
familiarity O
with O
Korean B-CUISINE
food O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
, O
at O
least O
, O
can O
probably O
thank O
Ms. O
Kwak O
for O
that O
. O

In O
1992 O
, O
when O
she O
began O
serving O
the O
cuisine O
in O
the O
East B-LOC
Village I-LOC
at O
her O
first O
restaurant O
, O
Dok B-EST
Suni I-EST
's O
, O
the O
words O
tteokbokki B-FOOD
and O
seolleongtang B-FOOD
and O
jajangmyeon B-FOOD
did O
not O
roll O
off O
the O
tongues O
of O
most O
non O
- O
Koreans O
. O

But O
that O
's O
who O
she O
wanted O
to O
lure O
in O
with O
American O
music O
, O
date O
- O
night O
decor O
and O
Western O
- O
style O
service O
. O

Once O
she O
had O
them O
, O
she O
would O
tempt O
, O
teach O
, O
turn O
them O
on O
to O
the O
flavors O
she O
'd O
grown O
up O
with O
. O

Her O
mother O
, O
Myung O
Ja O
Kwak O
, O
shared O
cooking O
duties O
. O

Ms. O
Kwak O
's O
was O
not O
the O
take O
- O
it O
- O
or O
- O
leave O
- O
it O
approach O
of O
32nd B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
and O
she O
kept O
at O
it O
. O

She O
wrote O
" O
Dok O
Suni O
: O
Recipes O
From O
My O
Mother O
's O
Korean O
Kitchen O
, O
" O
which O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
Korean B-CUISINE
cookbooks O
in O
English O
when O
it O
came O
out O
, O
in O
1998 O
. O

At O
her O
second O
restaurant O
, O
Do B-EST
Hwa I-EST
, O
she O
and O
her O
mother O
led O
customers O
deeper O
into O
unfamiliar O
ground O
. O

Each O
of O
the O
restaurants O
stayed O
open O
for O
about O
two O
decades O
, O
which O
is O
a O
very O
long O
time O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
metaphor O
for O
how O
effectively O
Ms. O
Kwak O
paved O
the O
way O
for O
restaurants O
like O
Atoboy B-EST
, O
Soogil B-EST
, O
Danji B-EST
and O
others O
whose O
chefs O
weave O
Korean B-CUISINE
cuisine O
into O
new O
patterns O
, O
consider O
that O
one O
of O
them O
, O
Oiji B-EST
, O
moved O
into O
its O
address O
on O
First B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
right O
after O
Dok B-EST
Suni I-EST
's O
moved O
out O
. O

What O
Ms. O
Kwak O
is O
doing O
in O
Park B-LOC
Slope I-LOC
is O
n't O
all O
that O
different O
from O
what O
she O
has O
done O
all O
her O
career O
, O
except O
that O
by O
now O
South B-CUISINE
Korean I-CUISINE
comfort O
food O
has O
become O
comfort O
food O
for O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
in O
general O
. O

Haenyeo B-EST
does O
pay O
more O
attention O
to O
seafood B-FOOD
than O
Dok B-EST
Suni I-EST
or O
Do B-EST
Hwa I-EST
did O
, O
though O
. O

Ms. O
Kwak O
has O
n't O
gone O
pescatarian B-DIET
on O
us O
. O

She O
still O
serves O
impressive O
pork B-DISH
and I-DISH
beef I-DISH
bulgogis I-DISH
with I-DISH
ssamjang I-DISH
and I-DISH
lettuce I-DISH
, O
and O
the O
pan B-DISH
- I-DISH
fried O
dumplings O
are O
filled O
with O
high B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
fat I-FOOD
ground O
beef O
seasoned O
with O
kimchi B-FOOD
, O
garlic B-FOOD
and O
soy B-FOOD
. O

But O
her O
menu O
's O
orientation O
has O
shifted O
slightly O
toward O
the O
ocean O
. O

This O
is O
good O
news O
, O
because O
the O
seafood B-FOOD
at O
Haenyeo B-EST
has O
a O
sparkle O
and O
sweetness O
you O
do O
n't O
always O
find O
in O
the O
smoke O
- O
filled O
rooms O
of O
32nd B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

A O
bibimbap B-FOOD
variant O
may O
be O
the O
menu O
's O
sleeper O
dish O
, O
partly O
because O
it O
starts O
out O
looking O
like O
a O
lunch O
bowl O
from O
Sweetgreen B-EST
. O

It O
is O
a O
version O
of O
hwe B-DISH
dup I-DISH
bap I-DISH
. O

At O
first O
you O
just O
see O
raw O
tuna B-FOOD
, O
shredded O
romaine B-FOOD
and O
perilla B-FOOD
leaves I-FOOD
, O
grated O
carrots B-FOOD
and O
cucumber B-FOOD
, O
and O
strips O
of O
seaweed B-FOOD
. O

Hidden O
underneath O
is O
warm O
rice B-FOOD
. O

But O
there O
is O
a O
pink O
mound O
of O
spicy O
cod B-FOOD
roe I-FOOD
in O
the O
bowl O
, O
too O
, O
with O
cured B-FOOD
salmon I-FOOD
eggs I-FOOD
and O
a O
few O
lobes O
of O
sea B-FOOD
urchin I-FOOD
. O

Both O
of O
them O
will O
break O
apart O
as O
you O
stir O
, O
bringing O
their O
distinct O
saltwater O
intonations O
to O
the O
rice B-FOOD
and O
vegetables B-FOOD
. O

What O
the O
menu O
calls O
" O
white B-DISH
fish I-DISH
fillets I-DISH
" O
-- O
pan B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
fried O
cod O
with O
rings O
of O
scallion B-FOOD
showing O
through O
their O
thin O
gold O
sheet O
of O
egg B-FOOD
batter I-FOOD
, O
otherwise O
known O
as O
saeng B-DISH
seon I-DISH
jeon I-DISH
-- O
is O
so O
modestly O
named O
it O
might O
get O
overlooked O
; O
it O
should O
n't O
. O

The O
menu O
plays O
Do O
n't O
Mind O
Me O
again O
with O
" O
mackerel B-DISH
, I-DISH
grilled I-DISH
or I-DISH
braised O
. O
" O

Just O
get O
the O
mackerel B-FOOD
, O
because O
the O
kitchen O
knows O
how O
to O
cook O
it O
, O
whether O
over O
a O
flame O
or O
in O
a O
dark O
, O
smoky O
pan O
of O
garlic B-FOOD
and O
gochujang B-FOOD
. O

In O
truth O
, O
the O
kitchen O
seems O
to O
know O
how O
to O
cook O
every O
kind O
of O
seafood B-FOOD
, O
although O
perhaps O
it O
could O
come O
with O
a O
better O
partner O
for O
the O
fried B-DISH
scallops I-DISH
than O
the O
sweet O
, O
yellowish O
tartar B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
with O
corn B-FOOD
in O
it O
. O

The O
walls O
are O
hung O
with O
photographs O
of O
Korean O
women O
in O
wet O
suits O
. O

These O
are O
the O
haenyeo O
of O
Jeju B-LOC
island I-LOC
, O
who O
dive O
up O
to O
30 O
feet O
deep O
for O
conch O
, O
abalone O
and O
seaweed O
while O
holding O
their O
breath O
for O
several O
minutes O
at O
a O
time O
. O

The O
money O
they O
made O
diving O
is O
probably O
the O
reason O
parts O
of O
Jeju B-LOC
have O
a O
matriarchal O
family O
structure O
. O

Naming O
the O
restaurant O
after O
them O
, O
Ms. O
Kwak O
continues O
a O
theme O
started O
with O
Dok B-EST
Suni I-EST
's O
, O
which O
means O
" O
strong O
women O
's O
. O
" O

One O
dish O
that O
seems O
out O
of O
place O
is O
a O
revival O
of O
Dok B-EST
Suni I-EST
's O
fried B-DISH
chicken I-DISH
. O

Was O
the O
batter B-FOOD
always O
so O
pasty O
and O
airless O
? O

That O
's O
not O
how O
I O
remember O
it O
, O
but O
it O
's O
possible O
my O
standards O
have O
changed O
as O
Korean B-FOOD
fried I-FOOD
chicken I-FOOD
has O
infiltrated O
nearly O
every O
part O
of O
town O
over O
the O
past O
decade O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
there O
is O
better O
chicken B-FOOD
to O
seek O
out O
here O
, O
not O
just O
the O
home O
- O
style O
dokdoritang B-FOOD
stewed O
in O
chile B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
but O
also O
the O
wings B-FOOD
. O

Haenyeo B-EST
double O
- O
fries O
wings B-FOOD
that O
have O
been O
dipped O
in O
potato B-FOOD
starch I-FOOD
, O
then O
coats O
them O
with O
a O
fine O
version O
of O
a O
yangnyeom B-FOOD
chile I-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
, O
tangier O
and O
a O
little O
less O
sweet O
than O
some O
. O

When O
Ms. O
Kwak O
detours O
from O
the O
Korean B-CUISINE
straight O
and O
narrow O
, O
consider O
traipsing O
along O
behind O
her O
. O

You O
may O
wind O
up O
having O
beignets B-DISH
for O
dessert O
, O
buried O
under O
a O
fresh O
coat O
of O
powdered B-FOOD
sugar I-FOOD
in O
the O
best O
Cafe B-EST

Monde I-EST

. O

( O
This O
and O
the O
grilled B-DISH

betray O

you O
may O
follow O
her O
all O
the O
way O
to O

, O
which O
starts O
out O
as O
tteokbokki B-FOOD
in O

becomes O
totally O
atypical O
through O
the O
addition O
of O

In O
2012 O
and O
2013 O
, O
when O
people O
were O
lining O
up O
at O
Smorgasburg B-EST
and O
then O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
of O
the O
Houston B-LOC
Street I-LOC
Whole B-LOC
Foods I-LOC
Market I-LOC
for O
biodegradable O
bowls O
of O
Yuji O
Haraguchi O
's O
mazemen B-DISH
-- O
noodles B-FOOD
that O
might O
be O
dressed O
with O
crisped O
twigs O
of O
bacon B-FOOD
and O
a O
jiggling O
onsen B-FOOD
egg I-FOOD
, O
say O
, O
or O
yuzu B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
cured O
salmon O
and O
some O
Camembert B-FOOD
soft O
enough O
to O
transform O
into O
a O
sauce O
-- O
I O
was O
sure O
the O
crowds O
would O
multiply O
and O
fan O
out O
, O
demanding O
more O
of O
this O
strange O
brothless O
ramen B-FOOD
. O

And O
they O
did O
, O
in O
a O
sense O
. O

Soon O
Mr. O
Haraguchi O
had O
established O
his O
own O
free O
- O
standing O
establishment O
, O
Yuji B-EST
Ramen I-EST
in O
Williamsburg B-LOC
, I-LOC
Brooklyn O
, O
where O
he O
serves O
that O
bacon B-DISH
- I-DISH
and O
- O
egg O
mazemen O
along O
with O
his O
possibly O
visionary O
" B-DISH
tunakotsu I-DISH
" O
ramen O
. O

In O
2014 O
, O
when O
Ivan O
Orkin O
came O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
he O
brought O
along O
his O
own O
mazemen B-DISH
recipes O
. O

Over O
the O
next O
few O
years O
mazemen B-FOOD
turned O
up O
in O
other O
restaurants O
, O
too O
, O
but O
all O
of O
them O
remained O
better O
known O
for O
soup B-FOOD
ramen I-FOOD
, O
and O
sold O
more O
of O
it O
. O

It O
began O
to O
look O
as O
if O
mazemen B-FOOD
would O
never O
be O
more O
than O
a O
sideshow O
act O
, O
the O
one O
- O
armed O
ax O
- O
catcher O
of O
the O
ramen B-FOOD
circus O
. O

Then O
at O
the O
start O
of O
the O
year O
, O
the O
chef O
Shigetoshi O
Nakamura O
, O
who O
operates O
an O
intimate O
ramen B-TYPE
shop I-TYPE
on O
the O
Lower B-LOC
East I-LOC
Side I-LOC
, O
opened O
an O
annex O
next O
door O
that O
is O
dedicated O
to O
mazemen B-FOOD
. O

All O
the O
seating O
at O
this O
new O
place O
, O
Niche B-EST
, O
is O
at O
a O
dozen O
or O
so O
stools O
arranged O
around O
one O
long O
, O
narrow O
table O
. O

When O
the O
dining O
room O
is O
fully O
occupied O
, O
the O
only O
way O
to O
get O
from O
one O
end O
to O
the O
other O
is O
to O
walk O
sideways O
while O
holding O
your O
breath O
and O
picking O
up O
all O
the O
coats O
that O
you O
are O
going O
to O
knock O
off O
their O
wall O
pegs O
as O
you O
go O
. O

Not O
that O
there O
is O
much O
reason O
to O
roam O
around O
. O

Orders O
are O
taken O
from O
and O
delivered O
to O
the O
table O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
public O
restroom O
on O
the O
premises O
. O

As O
is O
the O
case O
next O
door O
at O
Nakamura B-EST
, O
seats O
by O
the O
window O
offer O
a O
close O
- O
up O
view O
of O
the O
stone O
walls O
that O
support O
the O
last O
few O
yards O
of O
the O
Williamsburg O
Bridge O
before O
it O
empties O
onto O
Delancey B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

Before O
he O
came O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
Mr. O
Nakamura O
was O
already O
well O
known O
in O
Tokyo B-LOC
, O
where O
he O
proved O
to O
have O
a O
theatrical O
streak O
. O

Before O
filling O
a O
bowl O
with O
noodles B-FOOD
, O
he O
would O
yank O
them O
from O
the O
boiling O
water O
with O
his O
left O
hand O
and O
then O
hold O
them O
high O
in O
the O
air O
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
, O
letting O
them O
drain O
while O
standing O
completely O
motionless O
. O

Suddenly O
he O
would O
drop O
his O
arm O
and O
the O
basket O
would O
plunge O
toward O
the O
water O
again O
, O
before O
stopping O
just O
in O
time O
and O
getting O
one O
quick O
, O
emphatic O
shake O
. O

When O
Mr. O
Nakamura O
was O
immortalized O
as O
one O
of O
four O
" O
ramen O
gods O
" O
in O
a O
set O
of O
Hello O
Kitty O
notepads O
and O
phone O
straps O
, O
Kitty O
was O
posed O
with O
her O
left O
paw O
raised O
high O
in O
emulation O
of O
the O
Nakamura O
Shake O
. O

If O
Mr. O
Nakamura O
has O
been O
practicing O
his O
choreography O
on O
the O
spaghetti O
- O
like O
, O
crinkly O
noodles B-FOOD
at O
Niche B-EST
, O
I O
have O
n't O
seen O
it O
yet O
. O

The O
Nakamura O
Shake O
seems O
designed O
to O
extract O
cooking O
water O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
before O
the O
noodles O
cool O
, O
and O
temperature O
is O
not O
especially O
critical O
in O
mazemen B-FOOD
. O

The O
idea O
of O
noodle B-FOOD
soup I-FOOD
without O
the O
soup B-FOOD
has O
been O
on O
the O
loose O
in O
Japan B-LOC
for O
decades O
. O

Broth B-FOOD
is O
the O
most O
expensive O
and O
labor O
- O
intensive O
part O
of O
a O
bowl O
of O
ramen B-FOOD
; O
in O
the O
1950s O
, O
a O
Tokyo B-LOC
noodle B-TYPE
shop I-TYPE
, O
in O
the O
pitiless O
logic O
of O
the O
restaurant O
business O
, O
began O
omitting O
the O
broth B-FOOD
when O
ladling O
out O
noodles B-FOOD
at O
staff O
meals O
, O
or O
so O
the O
story O
goes O
. O

This O
" O
abura B-FOOD
soba I-FOOD
" O
-- O
oil B-FOOD
noodle I-FOOD
, O
because O
it O
was O
moistened O
with O
lard B-FOOD
along O
with O
the O
seasoning O
sauce O
called O
tare B-FOOD
-- O
was O
n't O
half O
bad O
, O
so O
it O
went O
on O
the O
menu O
at O
a O
discounted O
price O
. O

As O
an O
even O
cheaper O
version O
of O
an O
already O
cheap O
and O
filling O
meal O
, O
abura B-FOOD
soba I-FOOD
was O
quickly O
embraced O
, O
especially O
by O
students O
. O

As O
food O
ideas O
tend O
to O
do O
in O
Japan B-LOC
, O
it O
evolved O
rapidly O
. O

Today O
, O
abura B-FOOD
soba I-FOOD
tends O
to O
refer O
to O
dry O
soups B-FOOD
that O
have O
more O
or O
less O
the O
same O
toppings O
you O
'd O
find O
in O
a O
bowl O
of O
normal O
ramen B-FOOD
, O
while O
mazemen B-FOOD
generally O
has O
toppings O
that O
are O
rarely O
seen O
in O
soup B-FOOD
and O
often O
would O
not O
respond O
well O
to O
being O
submerged O
in O
hot O
liquid O
. O

There O
is O
Italian B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
style O
mazemen O
, O
with O
anchovies O
, O
salami O
, O
olives O
and O
tomatoes O
. O

Some O
mazemen B-FOOD
shops O
specialize O
in O
fried B-DISH
beef I-DISH
cutlets I-DISH
. O

At O
a O
Tokyo B-LOC
restaurant O
called O
Beefst B-EST
, O
the O
centerpiece O
of O
each O
bowl O
is O
sliced B-FOOD
roast I-FOOD
beef I-FOOD
, O
served O
rare O
. O

Mr. O
Nakamura O
has O
an O
answer O
to O
that O
: O
steak B-DISH
mazemen I-DISH
. O

The O
steak B-FOOD
is O
rib O
- O
eye O
, O
in O
cubes O
that O
have O
been O
browned O
with O
a O
kitchen O
torch O
. O

When O
you O
stir O
them O
with O
the O
noodles B-FOOD
and O
a O
smooth O
, O
creamy O
spoonful O
of O
something O
the O
menu O
simply O
calls O
" O
pork B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
, O
" O
their O
juices O
and O
flecks O
of O
char O
flavor O
the O
whole O
bowl O
. O

Plain O
spinach B-FOOD
and O
fermented B-FOOD
bamboo I-FOOD
, O
meanwhile O
, O
keep O
the O
total O
effect O
from O
being O
queasy O
- O
making O
. O

Novel O
, O
straightforward O
, O
refined O
, O
unruly O
and O
impure O
of O
heart O
, O
steak B-DISH
mazemen I-DISH
has O
the O
makings O
of O
a O
classic O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
dish O
. O

So O
does O
the O
duck B-DISH
, O
a O
common O
special O
. O

A O
sliced O
breast B-FOOD
of O
moulard B-FOOD
duck I-FOOD
cooked O
to O
a O
deep O
violet O
- O
pink O
, O
it O
is O
served O
with O
a O
bright O
, O
focused O
sauce B-FOOD
built O
on O
soy B-FOOD
and O
enough O
warm O
duck B-FOOD
juices I-FOOD
to O
lubricate O
the O
whole B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
wheat O
noodles O
. O

It O
is O
not O
an O
austere O
dish O
by O
any O
means O
, O
but O
it O
is O
balanced O
and O
restrained O
. O

The O
same O
can O
not O
be O
said O
for O
another O
special O
that O
is O
always O
offered O
on O
the O
same O
nights O
: O
a O
bowl O
of O
liquefied O
foie B-DISH
gras I-DISH
topped I-DISH
with I-DISH
pistachios I-DISH
and I-DISH
truffle I-DISH
oil I-DISH
. O

It O
is O
not O
clear O
what O
will O
happen O
to O
anyone O
who O
tries O
to O
eat O
this O
with O
a O
spoon O
, O
but O
the O
prognosis O
does O
not O
seem O
good O
. O

Instead O
, O
everybody O
orders O
it O
with O
the O
duck B-DISH
mazemen I-DISH
and O
dips O
the O
noodles B-FOOD
into O
the O
foie B-FOOD
gras I-FOOD
, O
after O
which O
conscious O
thought O
tends O
to O
stop O
for O
a O
minute O
or O
two O
. O

When O
cerebral O
activity O
resumes O
, O
you O
might O
wonder O
why O
the O
sauce B-FOOD
does O
n't O
come O
with O
its O
own O
noodles B-FOOD
. O

No O
other O
mazemen B-FOOD
is O
such O
a O
joy O
ride O
, O
but O
the O
vaguely O
Italian B-CUISINE
one O
with O
tomatoes B-FOOD
, O
mushrooms B-FOOD
, O
kombu B-FOOD
and O
an O
angry O
red O
soak O
of O
chile B-FOOD
oil I-FOOD
is O
not O
the O
kind O
of O
thing O
you O
want O
to O
turn O
your O
back O
on O
. O

Even O
the O
tribute O
to O
Russ B-EST
& I-EST
Daughters I-EST
, O
where O
the O
noodles B-FOOD
are O
coated O
with O
spicy B-FOOD
cod I-FOOD
roe I-FOOD
and O
the O
topping O
is O
sliced O
smoked B-FOOD
salmon I-FOOD
, O
can O
sneak O
up O
on O
you O
. O

Niche B-EST
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
ramen B-TYPE
- O
yas O
in O
town O
where O
the O
appetizers O
are O
worth O
noticing O
. O

Sea B-DISH
urchin I-DISH
perched I-DISH
on I-DISH
tiny I-DISH
corners I-DISH
of I-DISH
toast I-DISH
is O
a O
strange O
and O
awkward O
affair O
, O
but O
the O
sardines B-DISH
on I-DISH
toast I-DISH
, O
dressed O
with O
chile B-FOOD
flakes I-FOOD
, O
are O
very O
good O
, O
as O
are O
the O
raw B-DISH
scallops I-DISH
with I-DISH
yuzu I-DISH
juice I-DISH
and O
the O
avocado B-DISH
salad I-DISH
showered O
with O
tempura B-FOOD
flakes I-FOOD
. O

Should O
fries B-FOOD
be O
an O
appetizer O
? O

Maybe O
not O
, O
particularly O
Niche B-EST
's O
" O
umami B-DISH
kombu I-DISH
fries I-DISH
, O
" O
which O
have O
been O
sprinkled O
with O
powdered B-FOOD
shio I-FOOD
kombu I-FOOD
until O
they O
are O
almost O
subliminally O
green O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
color O
, O
they O
look O
like O
the O
fries B-FOOD
at O
McDonald B-EST
's O
. O

The O
difference O
is O
that O
the O
shio B-FOOD
kombu I-FOOD
makes O
them O
almost O
diabolically O
hard O
to O
stop O
eating O
. O

And O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
eat O
them O
before O
the O
mazemen B-FOOD
arrives O
, O
then O
when O
will O
you O

with O
the O

of O

The O
menu O

it O
is O
clear O
that O
Indonesia B-LOC

There O
is O
, O
the O

fried O
just O
until O
it O
crackles O
a O

It O
has O
a O
gentle O

genuine O

that O
would O
be O
welcome O
in O
more O
of O

Of O

there O

As O

really O
come O

as O
the O
kind O
of O

that O
everybody O

talk O

The O
closest O

must O
be O

a O

more O

Probably O
. O

But O
if O
there O
are O
few O
stars O
on O
the O
table O
, O
the O
contrast O
of O

The O

This O
is O
the O

to O
give O

It O

It O
is O
true O
that O
the O
bacalaitos B-DISH
at O
the O
Freakin B-EST

in O
Astoria B-LOC
, I-LOC
Queens O
, O
are O
not O
quite O
as O
big O
around O
as O
the O
ones O
you O
will O
see O
browning O
in O

at O

scattered O
along O
the O

These O
flattened B-DISH
cod I-DISH

are O
the O
size O
of O

in O
Puerto B-LOC

, O
while O
in O
Queens B-LOC
they O
are O
roughly O
the O

Dimensions O
aside O

they O
give O
off O
all O

of O
a O

with O
green O
specks O
of O
chopped O
cilantro B-FOOD
under O
the O
surface O
that O
let O
you O
know O
they O
are O
not O
made O
from O

They O
do O
n't O
leave O
your O
fingertips O
entirely O
free O
of O
grease O

but O
they O
come O
close O
. O

They O
have O
an O
exterior O
crunch O
that O
surrenders O
quickly O
to O
the O
firm O
, O
chewy O
interior O
of O
mashed B-FOOD
salt I-FOOD
cod I-FOOD
; O
the O
texture O
is O
less O
fried B-FOOD

You O
could O
start O

build O
a O
business O
around O
bacalaitos B-DISH

The O

developed O

it O
applied O
the O

tactics O
that O
succeed O
at O
Smorgasburg B-EST

similar O
urban O

where O
the O
ideal O

held O
in O

, O
gets O

, O
costs O
under O

10 O
and O
can O
serve O
as O
a O
plank O
in O
a O

This O
may O
explain O
why O
appetizers O
are O
the O
strong O
suit O
on O
the O
Freakin B-EST
Rican I-EST
menu O
. O

The O
sorullitos B-DISH
, O
Puerto O
Rico O
's O
answer O
to O
hush B-DISH
puppies I-DISH
, O
are O
an O
exception O
; O
they O
are O
dense O
and O
dry O
, O
as O
if O
the O
cornmeal B-FOOD
had O
n't O
absorbed O
enough O
water B-FOOD
. O

Mr. O
Lopez O
's O
alcapurrias B-DISH
, O
though O
, O
are O
very O
good O
, O
even O
if O
the O
picadillo B-FOOD
that O
runs O
down O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
tube O
of O
mashed B-FOOD
fried I-FOOD
plantains I-FOOD
like O
the O
graphite O
in O
a O
pencil O
could O
be O
seasoned O
a O
little O
more O
forcefully O
. O

And O
his O
pasteles B-DISH
are O
exceptional O
. O

Pasteles B-FOOD
are O
structured O
like O
tamales B-FOOD
. O

Where O
the O
masa B-FOOD
would O
be O
, O
Mr. O
Lopez O
makes O
a O
sweet O
, O
enjoyably O
gummy O
mash O
of O
green B-FOOD
plantains I-FOOD
, O
taro B-FOOD
root I-FOOD
and O
kabocha B-FOOD
squash I-FOOD
. O

The O
filling O
is O
a O
soft O
, O
rich O
vein O
of O
stewed B-FOOD
pork I-FOOD
shoulder I-FOOD
with O
ham B-FOOD
, O
bacon B-FOOD
, O
red B-FOOD
peppers I-FOOD
and O
green B-FOOD
olives I-FOOD
. O

Rolled O
up O
in O
a O
banana O
leaf O
, O
these O
pasteles B-DISH
probably O
deserve O
their O
own O
float O
in O
the O
Puerto O

Day O

. O

Mr. O
Lopez O
fries O
chicken B-FOOD
in O
two O
styles O
. O

One O
, O
the O
chicharrones B-DISH
de I-DISH
pollo I-DISH
, O
is O
traditional O
. O

The O
other O
, O
the O
Freakin B-DISH
Crispy I-DISH
Wings I-DISH
, O
is O
not O
. O

Each O
has O
its O
rewards O
. O

The O
chicharrones B-FOOD
, O
hacked O
into O
three O
- O
bite O
hunks O
, O
taste O
of O
cider B-FOOD
vinegar I-FOOD
and O
garlic B-FOOD
powder I-FOOD
and O
have O
a O
smooth O
, O
achiote B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
tinted I-FOOD
buttermilk O
crust O
that O
breaks O
open O
with O
a O
pleasing O
crackle O
. O

The O
Freakin B-DISH
Crispy I-DISH
Wings I-DISH
are O
spicier O
, O
and O
the O
shell O
is O
thicker O
and O
more O
deeply O
crevassed O
. O

These O
wings B-FOOD
may O
owe O
more O
to O
Atlanta B-LOC
than O
to O
Mayaguez B-LOC
, O
although O
you O
can O
get O
them O
with O
a O
guava B-FOOD
barbecue I-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
that O
's O
reasonably O
tropical O
. O

Leave O
behind O
these O
appetizers O
, O
the O
core O

More O
than O
a O
year O
ago O
, O
I O
was O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
reviewing O
Del B-EST
Posto I-EST
when O
the O
news O
intervened O
. O

The O
restaurant O
had O
changed O
significantly O
since O
the O
last O
time O
it O
had O
been O
evaluated O
by O
a O
Times O
critic O
: O
Sam O
Sifton O
promoted O
it O
from O
three O
stars O
to O
four O
in O
2010 O
, O
when O
Mark O
Ladner O
was O
the O
executive O
chef O
and O
Brooks O
Headley O
was O
running O
the O
pastry O
kitchen O
. O

First O
, O
Mr. O
Headley O
had O
quit O
this O
stately O
, O
expensive O
Italian B-CUISINE
restaurant O
in O
Chelsea B-LOC
so O
he O
could O
sell O
fast O
, O
cheap O
vegetarian B-DIET
burgers B-FOOD
. O

Next O
, O
Del B-EST
Posto I-EST
had O
spent O
about O
$ O
1 O
million O
on O
crystal O
candle O
vases O
, O
white O
leather O
chairs O
and O
other O
luxurious O
fittings O
that O
made O
it O
even O
more O
stately O
and O
expensive O
. O

Finally O
, O
Mr. O
Ladner O
had O
left O
to O
sell O
fast O
, O
cheap O
pasta B-FOOD
. O

A O
fresh O
review O
was O
clearly O
in O
order O
. O

Before O
I O
could O
write O
it O
, O
though O
, O
a O
number O
of O
women O
who O
had O
worked O
for O
Mario O
Batali O
, O
one O
of O
the O
owners O
, O
started O
talking O
about O
the O
sexual O
harassment O
and O
abuse O
that O
they O
say O
he O
had O
doled O
out O
. O

Suddenly O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
more O
important O
questions O
than O
whether O
the O
braised B-DISH
- I-DISH
rabbit O
agnolotti O
were O
cooked O
al O
dente O
. O

Negotiations O
took O
more O
than O
a O
year O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Batali O
no O
longer O
profits O
from O
Del B-EST
Posto I-EST
, O
having O
sold O
his O
stake O
in O
March O
to O
a O
group O
led O
by O
his O
former O
partner O
, O
Joe O
Bastianich O
. O

Employees O
have O
said O
that O
Mr. O
Bastianich O
himself O
helped O
, O
at O
a O
minimum O
, O
to O
build O
the O
sexist O
and O
disrespectful O
environment O
in O
which O
Mr. O
Batali O
operated O
. O

Mr. O
Bastianich O
has O
apologized O
, O
saying O
that O
he O
had O
heard O
Mr. O
Batali O
speak O
inappropriately O
to O
employees O
, O
and O
that O
he O
should O
have O
done O
more O
to O
stop O
the O
sexual O
harassment O
. O

Some O
diners O
will O
stay O
away O
, O
feeling O
that O
Mr. O
Bastianich O
has O
not O
sufficiently O
atoned O
. O

I O
understand O
this O
, O
but O
I O
am O
also O
interested O
in O
the O
way O
employees O
may O
be O
treated O
at O
the O
restaurant O
now O
and O
in O
the O
future O
. O

Here O
, O
there O
is O
reason O
to O
hope O
. O

Among O
other O
human O
- O
resources O
reforms O
, O
employees O
can O
now O
report O
complaints O
about O
owners O
or O
corporate O
officers O
to O
an O
independent O
investigative O
firm O
with O
the O
power O
to O
refer O
cases O
to O
outside O
counsel O
. O

As O
part O
of O
the O
restructuring O
, O
Melissa O
Rodriguez O
, O
who O
has O
been O
the O
executive O
chef O
of O
Del B-EST
Posto I-EST
since O
2017 O
, O
was O
made O
a O
partner O
in O
the O
restaurant O
, O
along O
with O
Jeff O
Katz O
, O
now O
the O
managing O
partner O
. O

A O
new O
pastry O
chef O
, O
Georgia O
Wodder O
, O
was O
appointed O
last O
spring O
. O

Del B-EST
Posto I-EST
is O
, O
with O
the O
possible O
exception O
of O
Aquavit B-EST
, O
the O
grandest O
and O
most O
expensive O
restaurant O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
where O
women O
are O
in O
charge O
of O
everything O
you O
eat O
, O
starting O
with O
the O
miniature B-DISH
saffron I-DISH
waffle I-DISH
rolled O
like O
a O
cannoli B-FOOD
and O
stuffed O
at O
one O
tiny O
end O
with O
taleggio B-FOOD
and O
at O
the O
other O
with O
fennel B-FOOD
pesto I-FOOD
, O
and O
ending O
with O
the O
prosecco B-DISH
marshmallow I-DISH
tucked O
into O
the O
wooden O
drawer O
of O
a O
custom O
- O
made O
cheese O
grater O
. O

The O
cooking O
is O
more O
subdued O
now O
. O

The O
kitchen O
is O
not O
seen O
as O
a O
beacon O
of O
innovation O
the O
way O
it O
used O
to O
be O
, O
perhaps O
because O
Ms. O
Rodriguez O
is O
less O
interested O
than O
Mr. O
Ladner O
was O
in O
feats O
of O
technical O
derring O
- O
do O
like O
100 O
- O
layer O
lasagnas B-FOOD
. O

She O
gets O
her O
effects O
by O
following O
old O
Italian B-CUISINE
templates O
and O
putting O
them O
together O
so O
elegantly O
that O
they O
seem O
to O
light O
up O
from O
inside O
. O

There O
's O
an O
honesty O
to O
her O
approach O
-- O
she O
does O
n't O
try O
to O
shoot O
out O
all O
the O
lights O
by O
supercharging O
dishes O
with O
fat O
-- O
but O
it O
's O
not O
the O
kind O
of O
peasant O
simplicity O
people O
usually O
mean O
when O
they O
talk O
about O
honesty O
in O
Italian B-CUISINE
food O
. O

It O
's O
a O
sophisticated O
honesty O
. O

You O
know O
chicken B-DISH
cacciatore I-DISH
, O
of O
course O
. O

Ms. O
Rodriguez O
's O
version O
is O
made O
from O
guinea B-FOOD
hen I-FOOD
breast I-FOOD
, O
roasted O
until O
the O
skin O
crackles O
like O
parchment O
. O

What O
would O
be O
the O
body O
of O
the O
stew B-FOOD
is O
now O
a O
sauce B-FOOD
; O
the O
tomato B-FOOD
, O
celery B-FOOD
and O
onion B-FOOD
in O
it O
come O
through O
distinctly O
. O

Occupying O
a O
little O
sidecar O
is O
a O
pressed O
puck O
of O
braised B-FOOD
leg I-FOOD
meat I-FOOD
under O
a O
single O
, O
Roman B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
style O
gnocco O
, O
a O
small O
featherbed O
of O
semolina B-FOOD
held O
together O
by O
eggs B-FOOD
, O
milk B-FOOD
and O
cheese B-FOOD
. O

One O
side O
has O
been O
broiled O
so O
hard O
it O
is O
nearly O
burned O
, O
which O
seems O
like O
a O
mistake O
at O
first O
, O
but O
turns O
out O
to O
supply O
the O
bit O
of O
campfire O
that O
this O
hunter O
's O
stew O
needs O
. O

It O
has O
to O
be O
far O
more O
complicated O
to O
prepare O
than O
the O
cacciatore B-DISH
at O
your O
neighborhood O
Italian B-CUISINE
restaurant O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
simpler O
, O
pared O
to O
essentials O
, O
and O
wonderful O
in O
every O
bite O
. O

I O
've O
never O
seen O
anyone O
wring O
as O
much O
flavor O
out O
of O
salsify B-FOOD
as O
Ms. O
Rodriguez O
does O
. O

Sliced O
transparently O
thin O
and O
fried O
, O
it O
makes O
crunchy O
brown O
chips O
about O
half O
the O
size O
of O
an O
M&M. B-FOOD

These O
decorate O
the O
top O
of O
a O
grilled B-DISH
- I-DISH
salsify O
pudding O
that O
has O
the O
refreshing O
bittersweetness O
of O
one O
of O
those O
plant B-DIET
- O
based O
Italian B-FOOD
aperitifs I-FOOD
. O

If O
it O
were O
not O
garnished O
with O
streaky O
leaves O
of O
radicchio B-FOOD
, O
it O
could O
pass O
for O
a O
dessert O
. O

The O
menu O
structure O
has O
not O
changed O
, O
although O
the O
prices O
have O
. O

Everything O
can O
be O
had O
a O
la O
carte O
. O

Lunch O
is O
still O
a O
relative O
bargain O
, O
though O
the O
price O
has O
shimmied O
up O
to O
$ O
59 O
for O
three O
courses O
. O

For O
a O
blowout O
$ O
194 O
dinner O
, O
the O
Captain O
's O
Menu O
yields O
eight O
courses O
or O
so O
. O

Most O
people O
, O
however O
, O
go O
with O
the O
$ O
164 O
, O
five O
- O
course O
Menu O
del O
Posto O
. O

The O
primary O
argument O
in O
favor O
of O
this O
strategy O
is O
, O
to O
me O
, O
an O
overwhelming O
one O
: O
Two O
of O
those O
five O
courses O
are O
pasta O
. O

Del B-EST
Posto I-EST
's O
pastas B-FOOD
are O
worth O
doubling O
up O
on O
. O

They O
can O
come O
in O
many O
forms O
. O

Delicate O
conical B-DISH
tortellini I-DISH

The O
range O
of O
flavors O
Ms. O
Wodder O
commands O
in O
her O
pastry O
kitchen O
seems O
unnecessarily O
limited O
to O
me O

although O
I O
may O
be O
unfairly O
comparing O
her O
desserts O
with O
Mr. O
Headley O

, O
which O
roamed O
all O
over O
the O
place O
. O

Individually O
, O
her O
desserts O
are O
soothing O
, O
often O
showcasing O
the O
comforts O
of O
dairy O
. O

More O
emphasis O

some O
extra O
acidity O
or O

might O
have O
brought O

Del B-EST
Posto I-EST
has O
in O
recent O
years O
picked O
up O
a O
reputation O
as O
a O
restaurant O
for O
one O
- O
percenters O
. O

It O
rarely O
gives O
that O
impression O
once O
you O
are O
inside O
, O
where O
servers O
solemnly O
accommodate O
just O
about O
anyone O
. O

There O
is O
a O
vegan B-DIET
menu O
at O
Del B-EST
Posto I-EST
. O

A O
vegetarian B-DIET
meal O
can O
be O
put O
together O
easily O
, O
and O
almost O
everything O
can O
be O
made O
without B-DIET
gluten I-DIET
, O
including O
the O
pasta B-FOOD
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
stockpile O
of O
Champagnes B-FOOD
includes O
some O
lock O

and O
- O
key O
stuff O
, O
and O
should O
you O
require O
a O
Barolo B-DISH
costing O
between O

4,000 O

Though O
the O
restaurant O
is O
not O
exclusively O
for O
rich O
people O
, O
it O
is O
explicitly O
for O
occasions O
. O

Once O
, O
when O
a O
reservationist O
called O
to O
confirm O
and O
asked O
whether O
I O
was O
celebrating O
anything O
special O
, O
I O
said O
no O
, O
and O
was O
gently O
laughed O
at O
: O
" O
Just O
a O
normal O
Tuesday O
night O
at O
Del B-EST
Posto I-EST
? O
" O

There O
is O
little O
danger O
that O
anyone O
will O
mistake O
a O
night O
at O
Del B-EST
Posto I-EST
for O
normal O
. O

If O
nothing O
else O
, O
the O
napkins O
and O
towels O
are O
a O
tip O
- O
off O
. O

First O
, O
there O
is O
a O
small O
hot O
linen O
napkin O
scented O
with O
tomato B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
vine O
oil O
, O
to O
wipe O
the O
dust O
of O
the O
outside O
world O
from O
your O
hands O
. O

Then O
a O
large O
white O
linen O
napkin O
, O
followed O
just O
before O
dessert O
by O
a O
small O
yellow O
one O
. O

It O
is O
given O
to O
you O
, O
and O
the O
white O
one O
is O
taken O
away O
, O
by O
a O
server O
using O
a O
large O
fork O
and O
spoon O
as O
tongs O
. O

When O
you O
go O
to O
the O
restrooms O
, O
you O
may O
encounter O
an O
attendant O
who O
has O
just O
restocked O
the O
hand O
towels O
from O
a O
large O
basket O
she O
carries O
on O
one O
arm O
, O
like O
Heidi O
out O
gathering O
wildflowers O
for O
Grandfather O
. O

There O
are O
little O
ceremonies O
like O
this O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
; O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
of O
any O
other O
restaurant O
that O
performs O
quite O
so O
many O
tasks O
whose O
only O
real O
purpose O
is O
to O
draw O
attention O
to O
themselves O
. O

And O
these O
things O
are O
rarely O
done O
with O
a O
smile O
; O
employees O
seem O
to O
have O
been O
directed O
to O
keep O
a O
respectful O
, O
formal O
distance O
as O
they O
carry O
out O
your O
requests O
and O
perform O
other O
services O
you O
'd O
never O
think O
of O
requesting O
. O

They O
rarely O
seem O
comfortable O
. O

Their O
solemnity O
is O
underlined O
by O
the O
sepulchral O
lighting O
at O
night O
, O
so O
gloomy O
it O
makes O
the O
crypt O
of O
Grant O
's O
tomb O
look O
like O
a O
tiki B-TYPE
bar I-TYPE
. O

A O
good O
deal O
of O
the O
service O
is O
the O
attentive O
, O
helpful O
kind O
that O
you O
really O
want O
, O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
it O
seems O
designed O
only O
to O
give O
customers O
the O
sensation O
of O
temporary O
power O
over O
other O
people O
. O

Some O
people O
may O
love O
this O
, O
but O
it O
reflects O
a O
serious O
lack O
of O
imagination O
when O
you O
think O
about O
the O
ways O
the O
service O
at O
Blue B-EST
Hill I-EST
at I-EST
Stone I-EST
Barns I-EST
or O
Noma B-EST
, O
for O
instance O
, O
is O
integrated O
into O
the O
experience O
. O

Is O
it O
stretching O
a O
point O
to O
ask O
if O
enshrining O
subservience O
, O
as O
Del B-EST
Posto I-EST
does O
, O
reflects O
the O
same O
twisted O
sense O
of O
priorities O
that O
allowed O
Mr. O
Batali O
to O
get O
away O
with O
abusing O
his O
own O
power O
for O
so O
long O
? O

( O
And O
is O
it O
a O
coincidence O
that O
far O
more O
men O
than O
women O
seem O
to O
work O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
upper O
ranks O
? O
) O

Now O
that O
Ms. O
Rodriguez O
owns O
a O
piece O
of O
the O
restaurant O
, O
perhaps O
she O
can O
lead O
a O
reconsideration O
of O
priorities O
in O
the O
front O
of O
the O
house O
, O
and O
find O
a O
tone O
that O
more O
closely O
matches O
her O
philosophy O
in O
the O
back O
. O

She O
should O
n't O
have O
to O
clean O
up O
the O
messes O
men O
made O
. O

But O
having O
worked O
her O
way O
to O
the O
top O
of O
a O
restaurant O
that O
has O
always O
aspired O
to O
provide O
luxury O
, O
she O
has O
a O
chance O
to O
decide O
what O
, O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
in O
2019 O
, O
that O
word O
might O
mean O

Hanon B-LOC
, O
a O
new O
udon B-TYPE
shop I-TYPE
in O
Williamsburg B-LOC

Brooklyn O

was O
produced O
by O
the O

of O
a O
Tokyo B-LOC
video O
- O
production O
company O
and O
a O
Japanese O
manufacturer O
of O
unusually O
thin O
condoms O
. O

The O
condoms O
became O
the O
subject O
of O
a O
series O
of O
advertisements O
on O
which O
the O
production O
company O
worked O

in O
one O

when O
two O

each O
other O
very O
much O
, O
sometimes O
they O
decide O
to O
create O
a O
new O
company O
together O
. O

That O
is O
what O
happened O
with O
the O
production O
firm O
and O
the O
prophylactics O
people O
when O
, O
for O
reasons O
that O
are O
perhaps O
best O
not O
to O
question O
, O
they O
hit O
upon O
the O
idea O
of O
expanding O
their O
product O
line O
from O
condoms O
into O
noodles B-FOOD
. O

The O
restaurant O
lies O
across O
Union B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
from O
Kellogg B-EST
's I-EST
Diner O
. O

Its O
door O
is O
marked O
during O
business O
hours O
by O
the O
fluttering O
white O
noren O
curtains O
. O

It O
is O
the O
second O
Hanon B-EST
location O
. O

The O
first O
is O
about O
6,700 O
miles O
away O
, O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Kamakura B-LOC
, O
which O
lies O
south O
of O
Tokyo B-LOC
and O
is O
known O
for O
soba B-FOOD
, O
not O
udon B-FOOD
. O

This O
gave O
Hanon B-EST
the O
advantage O
of O
not O
competing O
against O
any O
of O
Japan B-LOC
's O
established O
udon B-FOOD
styles O
, O
leaving O
its O
chef O
, O
Takahiro O
Yanagisawa O
, O
free O
to O
come O
up O
with O
his O
own O
. O

Mr. O
Yanagisawa O
, O
who O
had O
spent O
25 O
years O
making O
sushi B-FOOD
before O
turning O
to O
noodles B-FOOD
, O
focused O
his O
innovative O
urges O
on O
the O
dough B-FOOD
. O

He O
began O
by O
adding O
wheat B-FOOD
germ I-FOOD
and O
bran B-FOOD
to O
the O
white B-FOOD
flour I-FOOD
that O
in O
udon B-FOOD
is O
typically O
used O
alone O
. O

The O
resulting O
noodle B-FOOD
is O
called O
zenryufun B-FOOD
or O
whole B-FOOD
wheat I-FOOD
. O

The O
bran B-FOOD
and O
germ B-FOOD
are O
Mr. O
Yanagisawa O
's O
attempts O
to O
make O
a O
more O
healthful O
udon B-FOOD
, O
but O
they O
also O
add O
flavor O
, O
a O
mottled O
color O
and O
a O
slightly O
rough O
texture O
that O
holds O
on O
to O
the O
dashi B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
based O
broth O
. O

This O
dough B-FOOD
is O
also O
made O
into O
a O
green O
noodle B-FOOD
, O
called O
sasauchi B-FOOD
, O
by O
mixing O
in O
powdered B-FOOD
barley I-FOOD
shoots I-FOOD
and O
leaves B-FOOD
of I-FOOD
kuma I-FOOD
- O
zasa O
, O
a O
bamboo B-FOOD
variety O
that O

To O
the O
human O
palate O
, O
or O
at O
least O
this O
human O
's O
palate O
, O
sasa B-FOOD
tastes O
something O
like O
green B-FOOD
tea I-FOOD
. O

Both O
the O
speckled B-FOOD
zenryufun I-FOOD
and O
the O
green B-FOOD
sasauchi I-FOOD
are O
flat O
noodles B-FOOD
, O
resembling O
fettuccine B-FOOD
that O
has O
been O
working O
out O
. O

Avoiding O
extremes O
, O
they O
are O
moderately O
chewy O
and O
reasonably O
springy O
. O

Either O
flavor O
, O
or O
both O
, O
can O
be O
ordered O
cold O
and O
spread O
on O
a O
bamboo O
mat O
for O
dunking O
into O
a O
sauce O
, O
either O
a O
peanut B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
buttery I-FOOD
sesame O
sauce O
or O
the O
traditional O
dashi B-FOOD
- I-FOOD
based I-FOOD
dipping O
sauce O
. O

For O
larger O
or O
more O
curious O
appetites O
, O
these O
dipping B-FOOD
noodles I-FOOD
, O
called O
seiro B-DISH
udon I-DISH
, O
can O
be O
dangled O
into O
a O
hot B-FOOD
duck I-FOOD
soup I-FOOD
in O
which O
a O
few O
hunks O
of O
well O
- O
boiled O
duck B-FOOD
meat I-FOOD
swim O
. O

The O
cold B-FOOD
noodles I-FOOD
can O
also O
be O
accessorized O
with O
whipped B-FOOD
mountain I-FOOD
yam I-FOOD
or O
tempura B-FOOD
or O
both O
. O

If O
you O
had O
stumbled O
into O
Hanon B-EST
under O
the O
impression O
that O
it O
was O
another O
generic O
Williamsburg B-LOC
noodle B-TYPE
mill I-TYPE
, O
the O
tempura B-FOOD
would O
set O
you O
straight O
. O

The O
crust B-FOOD
is O
engineered O
for O
udon B-FOOD
, O
thick O
and O
substantial O
enough O
that O
it O
will O
not O
dissolve O
and O
float O
away O
in O
the O
soup B-FOOD
, O
yet O
somehow O
not O
oily O
or O
clunky O
. O

The O
tempura B-DISH
is O
served O
with O
sea B-TYPE
salt I-TYPE
, O
which O
will O
not O
only O
season O
the O
fried B-FOOD
blowfish I-FOOD
tails I-FOOD
, O
shrimp B-FOOD
, O
mushroom B-FOOD
and O
vegetables B-FOOD
, O
but O
will O
also O
do O
very O
good O
things O
to O
any O
noodles B-FOOD
it O
happens O
to O
meet O
. O

With O
the O
hot B-FOOD
soups I-FOOD
, O
there O
is O
no O
choice O
of O
noodles B-FOOD
. O

All O
are O
made O
with O
zenryufun B-FOOD

The O
plain B-DISH
broth I-DISH
, O
a O
dashi B-FOOD
augmented O
by O
white B-FOOD
soy I-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
, O
is O
not O
so O
salty O
or O
concentrated O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
drink O
it O
all O
. O

It O
also O
performs O
well O
made O
into O
a O
thick O
- O
but O
- O
not O
- O
sludgy O
curry B-FOOD
soup I-FOOD
with O
thin O
pink O
slices O
of O

; O
a O
shaggy O
, O
mossy O
, O
salty O

sour O
mass O
of O

kombu B-FOOD
; O
and O
a O
soup B-DISH
of I-DISH
shaved I-DISH
beef I-DISH
and I-DISH
onions I-DISH
that O
tastes O
like O
a O
deeper O
, O
stronger O
version O
of O
French B-DISH
dip I-DISH
jus I-DISH
and O
is O
blitzed O
by O
a O
little O
grated B-FOOD
yuzu I-FOOD
peel I-FOOD
at O
the O
end O
. O

A O
few O
near O
- O
relatives O
of O
udon B-FOOD
make O
it O
to O
the O
menu O
as O
well O
. O

The O
beef B-DISH
- O
and O
- O
onion O
combination O
can O
also O
be O
had O
over O
rice B-FOOD
. O

Creamy O
, O
slightly O
spicy O
cod B-FOOD
roe I-FOOD
is O
tossed O
with O
zenryufun B-FOOD
for O
an O
excellent O
mentaiko B-DISH
pasta I-DISH
that O
, O
for O
once O
, O
relies O
on O
the O
roe B-FOOD
rather O
than O
Kewpie B-FOOD
mayonnaise I-FOOD
to O
make O
an O
impression O
. O

The O
eventual O
plan O
is O
to O
sell O
both O
colors O
of O
noodle B-FOOD
to O
grocery O
stores O
and O
other O
restaurants O
-- O
to O
become O
, O
in O
essence O
, O
the O
Sun B-DISH
Noodle I-DISH
of O
the O
udonisphere O
. O

This O
would O
be O
a O
gain O
for O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
but O
for O
the O
moment O
Hanon B-EST
's O
udon B-FOOD
is O
found O
only O
at O
Hanon B-EST
, O
where O
the O
noodles B-FOOD
are O
made O
fresh O
each O
day O
. O

Any O
plan O
for O
world O
domination O
is O
not O
hinted O
at O
on O
the O

though O
nobody O
has O
bothered O
to O
post O
a O

there O
yet O
. O

Nor O
does O
the O

suggest O
a O
budding O

Atmospheric O

the O
fizzy O
, O
fuzzy O
and O
furry O
delights O
of O
natural B-FOOD
wines I-FOOD
. O

The O
idea O
of O
Hanon B-EST
is O
not O
to O
slurp O
and O
slide O
out O
, O
but O
to O
stay O
for O
a O
meal O
: O
a O
chilled O
French B-FOOD
red I-FOOD
with O
the O
fried B-DISH
chicken I-DISH
and O
Japanese B-DISH
omelet I-DISH
, O
maybe O
, O
and O
something O
a O
bit O
brawnier O
with O
curry B-DISH
soup I-DISH
. O

Dessert O
could O
be O
a O
tofu B-DISH
blancmange I-DISH
, O
smooth O
and O
white O
and O
somewhat O
sweet O
, O
but O
there O
is O
more O
satisfaction O
in O
the O
grainy O
, O
earthy O
bricks O
of O
red B-FOOD
bean I-FOOD
paste I-FOOD
. O

The O
meal O
might O
end O
with O
tea B-FOOD
, O
to O
which O
the O
restaurant O
takes O
the O
same O
unhurried O
approach O
it O
applies O
to O
everything O
else O
. O

The O
iced B-DISH
oolong I-DISH
is O
slowly O
cold O
- O
brewed O
; O
a O
bamboo O
whisk O
and O
ceramic O
chawan O
are O
kept O
on O
the O
dining O
counter O
for O
painstakingly O
whipping O
up O
bowls O
of O
matcha B-FOOD
; O
an O
appliance O
imported O
from O
Taiwan B-LOC
will O
transform O
freshly O
steeped O
hojicha B-FOOD
and O
ice O
into O
a O
tan O
froth O
, O
a O
process O
that O
takes O
about O
five O
minutes O
. O

This O
foam B-DISH
tea I-DISH
is O
dairy O
- O
free O
, O
unlike O
Taiwan B-LOC
's O
infamous O
cheese B-DISH
tea I-DISH
. O

It O
is O
served O
in O
a O
wine O
glass O
, O
and O
the O
experience O
of O
drinking O
it O
is O
similar O
to O
tackling O
a O
pint O
of O
Guinness B-DISH
before O
the O
head O
has O
settled O
down O

You O
will O
find O
Kawi B-EST
, O
the O
latest O
Momofuku B-EST
restaurant O
, O
on O
the O
fifth O
floor O
of O
20 B-LOC
Hudson I-LOC
Yards I-LOC
, O
assuming O
you O
stay O
determined O
and O
swallow O
back O
the O
urge O
to O
run O
for O
the O
exits O
that O
may O
grip O
you O
as O
you O
negotiate O
escalators O
that O
do O
n't O
connect O
to O
one O
another O
, O
elevators O
that O
are O
hidden O
out O
of O
sight O
like O
somebody O
's O
crazy O
grandfather O
and O
shiny O
retail O
windows O
that O
seem O
to O
be O
trying O
to O
provoke O
a O
class O
war O
. O

By O
the O
time O
people O
reach O
Kawi B-EST
they O
tend O
to O
look O
rattled O
; O
New O
Yorkers O
who O
will O
easily O
weave O
their O
way O
around O
broken O
sidewalks O

garbage O

the O
interior O
of O
a O
shopping O
mall O

Kawi B-EST
, O
now O
two O
months O
old O
, O
can O
be O
disorienting O
in O
its O
own O
way O
, O
but O
at O
least O
you O
can O
have O
a O
seat O
and O
a O
drink O
while O
you O
get O
your O
bearings O
. O

Space O
there O
is O
used O
, O
or O
not O
used O
, O
the O
way O
it O
is O
in O
Las B-LOC
Vegas I-LOC
. O

There O
's O
a O
very O
long O
bar O
behind O
a O
line O
of O
black O
, O
geometric O
bar O
stools O
receding O
toward O
the O
vanishing O

Between O
all O
this O

are O
aisles O
wide O
enough O
for O
a O
Zamboni O
. O

All O
those O
seats O
have O
backs O
, O
too O
. O

Kawi B-EST
is O
loaded O
with O
the O
comforts O
and O
accommodations O
that O
critics O
, O
including O
me O
, O
were O
begging O
Mr. O
Chang O
to O
pay O
more O
attention O
to O
as O
recently O
as O
the O
opening O
of O
Nishi B-EST
three O
years O
ago O
. O

Has O
anybody O
complained O
before O
that O
a O
David O
Chang O
restaurant O
was O
too O
quiet O
? O

They O
're O
saying O
it O
about O
Kawi B-EST
. O

If O
there O
is O
anybody O
left O
who O
still O
thinks O
of O
Mr. O
Chang O
as O
a O
downtown O
punk O
, O
Kawi B-EST
will O
clear O
up O
that O
misconception O
. O

The O
early O
Momofuku B-EST
restaurants O
were O
skateboards O
; O
Kawi B-EST
is O
a O
minivan O
with O
sliding O
doors O
, O
armrests O
, O
cupholders O
and O
Don O
Henley O
on O
the O
stereo O
. O

The O
ride O
may O
not O
be O
as O
fast O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
lot O
smoother O
. O

Kawi B-EST
is O
also O
the O
first O
Momofuku B-EST
restaurant O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
to O
address O
Korean B-CUISINE
cuisine O
head O
on O
and O
at O
length O
. O

Majordomo B-EST
, O
which O
opened O
in O
Los B-LOC
Angeles I-LOC
last O
year O
, O
is O
at O
least O
half O
Korean B-CUISINE
, O
but O
the O
menu O
is O
loaded O
up O
with O
other O
stuff O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
which O
is O
big O
and O
showy O
and O
seemingly O
designed O
to O
dazzle O
the O
high O
rollers O
. O

It O
can O
be O
hard O
to O
remember O
you O
're O
eating O
galbi B-DISH
- O
jjim O
after O
a O
server O
buries O
it O
beneath O
a O
tableside O
avalanche O
of O
shaved O
raclette B-FOOD
. O

Eunjo O
Park O
, O
Kawi B-EST
's O
executive O
chef O
, O
avoids O
this O
type O
of O
distraction O
. O

This O
is O
lucky O
, O
because O
she O
makes O
food O
that O
you O
want O
to O
concentrate O
on O
. O

Before O
joining O
the O
Momofuku B-EST
stable O
, O
she O
worked O
in O
the O
formal O
and O
highly O
fastidious O
kitchens O
of O
Daniel O
, O
Le B-EST
Bec I-EST
- O
Fin O
and O
Per B-EST
Se I-EST
. O

She O
later O
returned O
to O
South B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
, O
where O
she O
had O
lived O
until O
she O
was O
12 O
, O
for O
advanced O
studies O
at O
the O
Seoul B-LOC
restaurant O
Gaon B-EST
and O
at O
the O
kitchen O
of O
the O
Chunjinam B-EST
hermitage O
, O
presided O
over O
by O
Jeong O
Kwan O
, O
certainly O
the O
most O
celebrated O
cooking O
Zen O
nun O
in O
her O
country O
. O

A O
strong O
interest O
in O
tradition O
marks O
Ms. O
Park O
's O
food O
at O
Kawi B-EST
. O

Her O
dishes O
are O
set O
apart O
from O
versions O
you O
may O
have O
had O
before O
by O
the O
exactitude O
of O
the O
technique O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
ingredients O
. O

One O
section O
of O
her O
menu O
is O
turned O
over O
to O
kimbap B-FOOD
, O
those O
wide O
, O
nori B-FOOD
- O
wrapped O
sushi B-FOOD
rolls I-FOOD
often O
spotted O
at O
salad O
bars O
, O
languishing O
under O
plastic O
wrap O
. O

Most O
kimbap B-FOOD
is O
designed O
to O
be O
portable O
, O
filling O
and O
inexpensive O
. O

Ms. O
Park O
's O
kimbap B-FOOD
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
is O
built O
for O
pleasure O
. O

She O
has O
a O
pickled B-DISH
vegetable I-DISH
kimbap I-DISH
on O
the O
lunch O
menu O
that O
is O
truly O
exciting O
; O
you O
are O
meant O
to O
dip O
it O
in O
a O
dark O
liquid O
that O
tastes O
a O
bit O
like O
soy B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
but O
is O
made O
with O
beets B-FOOD
. O

The O
dinner O
menu O
brings O
kimbap B-DISH
filled I-DISH
with I-DISH
chives I-DISH
, I-DISH
pickled I-DISH
daikon I-DISH
, I-DISH
citrus I-DISH
jelly I-DISH
and I-DISH
a I-DISH
buttery I-DISH
pink I-DISH
vein I-DISH
of I-DISH
foie I-DISH
gras O
terrine O
. O

Has O
this O
really O
never O
been O
done O
before O
, O
you O
wonder O
as O
you O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
if O
not O
, O
why O
not O
? O

Among O
the O
other O
gussied O
- O
up O
raw O
fish B-FOOD
that O
you O
expect O
in O
Momofukuland B-EST
, O
like O
a O
refreshing O
if O
somewhat O
staid O
madai B-DISH
tartare I-DISH
, O
are O
some O
dime O
- O
size O
clams B-FOOD
in O
chile B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
and O
an O
elegant O
, O
inspired O
interpretation O
of O
gejang B-FOOD
. O

Blue B-FOOD
crab I-FOOD
legs I-FOOD
and I-FOOD
claw I-FOOD
are O
cracked O
and O
given O
a O
three O
- O
day O
soak O
in O
soy B-FOOD
sauce I-FOOD
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
which O
gives O
them O
an O
impressive O
amount O
of O
flavor O
. O

Then O
, O
in O
case O
you O
have O
n't O
noticed O
that O
you O
're O
dealing O
with O
a O
real O
chef O
, O
Ms. O
Park O
stirs O
the O
crab B-FOOD
's I-FOOD
roe O
with O
creamy O
rice B-FOOD
and O
spoons O
this O
Korean B-CUISINE
risotto B-FOOD
into O
the O
open O
belly O
of O
the O
shell B-FOOD
. O

At O
moments O
like O
this O
, O
or O
in O
the O
hwedupbap B-DISH
filled O
with O
raw O
fish B-FOOD
as O
strikingly O
good O
as O
any O
you O
'll O
find O
in O
a O
$ O
200 O
omakase O
, O
or O
in O
the O
doenjang B-DISH
jjigae I-DISH
, O
a O
potful O
of O
braised B-FOOD
fermented I-FOOD
bean I-FOOD
paste I-FOOD
with O
pork B-FOOD
belly I-FOOD
that O
appears O
on O
the O
menu O
as O
" O
yesterday B-DISH
's I-DISH
stinky I-DISH
soybean I-DISH
stew O
" O
and O
manages O
to O
be O
homespun O
and O
polished O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
it O
's O
possible O
to O
see O
Kawi B-EST
as O
Ms. O
Park O
's O
response O
to O
Atomix B-EST
. O

It O
's O
as O
if O
she O
had O
looked O
at O
Junghyun O
Park O
's O
dazzlingly O
complex O
compositions O
at O
his O
year O
- O
old O
modern O
Korean B-CUISINE
restaurant O
and O
decided O
that O
she O
could O
cook O
in O
a O
style O
that O
was O
every O
bit O
as O
modern O
and O
painstaking O
, O
but O
that O
instead O
of O
turning O
traditional O
dishes O
into O
tasting O
- O
menu O
food O
she O
would O
keep O
the O
old O
forms O
and O
innovate O
inside O
them O
. O

With O
her O
tidy O
, O
refined O
, O
French B-FOOD
- O
influenced O
neo O
- O
traditionalism O
, O
Ms. O
Park O
could O
become O
something O
like O
the O
Alain O
Ducasse O
of O
Korean B-CUISINE
cooking O
. O

It O
's O
not O
obvious O
, O
though O
, O
that O
Kawi B-EST
needs O
an O
Alain O
Ducasse O
. O

Certain O
appetizers O
seem O
to O
belong O
on O
another O
planet O
, O
more O
beautiful O
and O
gentle O
than O
ours O
, O
such O
as O
the O
soft B-DISH
tofu I-DISH
with I-DISH
soy I-DISH
syrup I-DISH
that O
, O
sitting O
under O
a O
shattering O
thin O
crust B-FOOD
of I-FOOD
caramelized I-FOOD
sugar I-FOOD
, O
is O
like O
a O
savory O
creme B-DISH
brulee I-DISH
by O
way O
of O
Seoul B-LOC
. O

And O
there O
are O
others O
, O
such O
as O
the O
sticks O
of O
fried B-FOOD
cod I-FOOD
that O
a O
server O
pointlessly O
snips O
in O
half O
with O
scissors O
and O
then O
spritzes O
with O
atomized O
yuzu B-FOOD
juice I-FOOD
, O
that O
are O
right O
at O
home O
at O
Hudson B-LOC
Yards I-LOC
. O

The O
presentation O
seemed O
forced O
. O

That O
could O
also O
describe O
the O
boiled B-DISH
chicken I-DISH
dish O
, O
one O
of O
the O
menu O
's O
showiest O
items O
and O
, O
at O
$ O
64 O
, O
one O
of O
its O
most O
expensive O
. O

The O
whole O
bird O
is O
steamed O
, O
then O
the O
breast B-FOOD
is O
sliced O
and O
served O
plain O
while O
the O
dark B-FOOD
meat I-FOOD
is O
fried O
and O
coated O
with O
spices B-FOOD
. O

Neither O
is O
spectacular O
on O
its O
own O
, O
and O
the O
combination O
is O
bizarre O
. O

More O
successful O
versions O
of O
elaborate O
, O
oversize O
, O
multicomponent O
dishes O
are O
proven O
moneymakers O
elsewhere O
in O
the O
Momofuku B-EST
republic O
. O

But O
arm O
- O
waving O
platters O
like O
that O
seem O
out O
of O
place O
at O
Kawi B-EST
, O
which O
is O
the O
least O
Momofukian O
of O
the O
Momofukus B-EST
. O

The O
most O
uncharacteristic O
thing O
of O
all O
is O
that O
the O
dining O
room O
has O
never O
been O
operating O
at O
anything O
close O
to O
capacity O
, O
at O
least O
when O
I O
've O
been O
there O
. O

Maybe O
tables O
are O
being O
kept O
off O
the O
reservation O
books O
to O
give O
the O
cooks O
time O
to O
learn O
where O
the O
spice O
cabinet O
is O
. O

Or O
maybe O
the O
fans O
who O
are O
so O
devoted O
to O
Mr. O
Chang O
's O
downtown O
spots O
are O
still O
trying O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
escalators O
. O

count _ _ O
on _ _ O
Peter _ _ B-EST
Luger _ _ I-EST
Steak _ _ I-EST
House _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
Brooklyn _ _ B-LOC
to _ _ O
produce _ _ O
certain _ _ O
sensations _ _ O
at _ _ O
every _ _ O
meal. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
insistent _ _ O
smell _ _ O
of _ _ O
broiled _ _ B-DISH
dry-aged _ _ I-DISH
steak _ _ I-DISH
that _ _ O
hits _ _ O
me _ _ O
the _ _ O
minute _ _ O
I _ _ O
open _ _ O
the _ _ O
door _ _ O
and _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
sooner, _ _ O
while _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
still _ _ O
outside _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
South _ _ B-LOC
Williamsburg _ _ I-LOC
sidewalk, _ _ O
producing _ _ O
a _ _ O
raised _ _ O
pulse, _ _ O
a _ _ O
quickening _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
senses _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
restlessness _ _ O
familiar _ _ O
to _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
who _ _ O
has _ _ O
seen _ _ O
a _ _ O
tiger _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
just _ _ O
heard _ _ O
the _ _ O
approach _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
lunch _ _ O
bucket. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
hiss _ _ O
of _ _ O
butter _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
melted _ _ O
tallow _ _ B-FOOD
as _ _ O
they _ _ O
slide _ _ O
down _ _ O
the _ _ O
hot _ _ O
platter, _ _ O
past _ _ O
the _ _ O
sliced _ _ B-DISH
porterhouse _ _ I-DISH
or _ _ O
rib _ _ B-DISH
steak _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
their _ _ O
charred _ _ O
bones, _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
a _ _ O
pool _ _ O
at _ _ O
one _ _ O
end. _ _ O
The _ _ O
server _ _ O
will _ _ O
spoon _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
sizzling _ _ O
fat _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
meat _ _ B-FOOD
he _ _ O
has _ _ O
just _ _ O
plated, _ _ O
generally _ _ O
with _ _ O
some _ _ O
line _ _ O
like _ _ O
"Here _ _ O
are _ _ O
your _ _ O
vitamins." _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
thunk _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
schlag _ _ B-FOOD
landing _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
bare _ _ O
wood _ _ O
table _ _ O
when _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
is _ _ O
served, _ _ O
and _ _ O
soon _ _ O
after, _ _ O
the _ _ O
softer _ _ O
tap-tap-tap _ _ O
of _ _ O
waxy _ _ O
chocolate _ _ B-FOOD
coins _ _ O
in _ _ O
gold _ _ O
foil _ _ O
dropped _ _ O
one _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
time _ _ O
on _ _ O
top _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
check. _ _ O
And _ _ O
after _ _ O
I've _ _ O
paid, _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
unshakable _ _ O
sense _ _ O
that _ _ O
I've _ _ O
been _ _ O
scammed. _ _ O
The _ _ O
last _ _ O
sensation _ _ O
was _ _ O
not _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Peter _ _ B-EST
Luger _ _ I-EST
experience _ _ O
when _ _ O
I _ _ O
started _ _ O
eating _ _ O
there, _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
1990s. _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
acutely _ _ O
aware _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
cost _ _ O
back _ _ O
then _ _ O
because _ _ O
I _ _ O
would _ _ O
settle _ _ O
the _ _ O
tab _ _ O
by _ _ O
counting _ _ O
out _ _ O
$20 _ _ O
bills; _ _ O
cash _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
only _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
pay _ _ O
unless _ _ O
you _ _ O
had _ _ O
a _ _ O
Peter _ _ B-EST
Luger _ _ I-EST
credit _ _ O
card. _ _ O
At _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
night _ _ O
my _ _ O
wallet _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
empty. _ _ O
Because _ _ O
a _ _ O
Peter _ _ B-EST
Luger _ _ I-EST
steak _ _ B-DISH
made _ _ O
me _ _ O
feel _ _ O
alive _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
way _ _ O
that _ _ O
few _ _ O
other _ _ O
things _ _ O
did, _ _ O
I _ _ O
considered _ _ O
this _ _ O
a _ _ O
fair _ _ O
trade, _ _ O
although _ _ O
I _ _ O
could _ _ O
afford _ _ O
it _ _ O
only _ _ O
once _ _ O
a _ _ O
year _ _ O
or _ _ O
so. _ _ O
I _ _ O
don't _ _ O
remember _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
doubts _ _ O
began, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
grew _ _ O
over _ _ O
time. _ _ O
Diners _ _ O
who _ _ O
walk _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
door _ _ O
eager _ _ O
to _ _ O
hand _ _ O
over _ _ O
literal _ _ O
piles _ _ O
of _ _ O
money _ _ O
aren't _ _ O
greeted; _ _ O
they're _ _ O
processed. _ _ O
A _ _ O
host _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
clipboard _ _ O
looks _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
name, _ _ O
or _ _ O
writes _ _ O
it _ _ O
down _ _ O
and _ _ O
quotes _ _ O
a _ _ O
waiting _ _ O
time. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
almost _ _ O
always _ _ O
a _ _ O
wait, _ _ O
with _ _ O
or _ _ O
without _ _ O
a _ _ O
reservation, _ _ O
and _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
almost _ _ O
always _ _ O
a _ _ O
long _ _ O
line _ _ O
of _ _ O
supplicants _ _ O
against _ _ O
the _ _ O
wall. _ _ O
A _ _ O
kind _ _ O
word _ _ O
or _ _ O
reassuring _ _ O
smile _ _ O
from _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
on _ _ O
staff _ _ O
would _ _ O
help _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
pass. _ _ O
The _ _ O
smile _ _ O
never _ _ O
comes. _ _ O

The _ _ O

seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
go _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O

to _ _ O
make _ _ O

The _ _ O

who _ _ O
once _ _ O
were _ _ O
charmingly _ _ O
brusque, _ _ O
now _ _ O
give _ _ O
the _ _ O
strong _ _ O
impression _ _ O
that _ _ O
these _ _ O
endless _ _ O
demands _ _ O
for _ _ O
food _ _ O
and _ _ O
drink _ _ O
are _ _ O
all _ _ O
that's _ _ O
standing _ _ O
between _ _ O
them _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
hard-earned _ _ O

quickly; _ _ O
the _ _ O
canned _ _ O
jokes _ _ O
about _ _ O

and _ _ O
schlag _ _ B-FOOD
don't _ _ O
flow _ _ O
as _ _ O
freely. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
things _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
as _ _ O
ever. _ _ O
The _ _ O
shrimp _ _ B-DISH
cocktail _ _ I-DISH
has _ _ O
always _ _ O
tasted _ _ O
like _ _ O
cold _ _ O

The _ _ O

fortified _ _ O
by _ _ O
corn _ _ B-FOOD
syrup. _ _ I-FOOD
Although _ _ O
the _ _ O
fries _ _ B-DISH
are _ _ O
reasonably _ _ O
crisp, _ _ O
their _ _ O
insides _ _ O
are _ _ O
mealy _ _ O
and _ _ O
bland _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
way _ _ O
that _ _ O
fresh-cut _ _ O
potatoes _ _ B-FOOD
almost _ _ O
certainly _ _ O
would _ _ O
not _ _ O

the _ _ O
person _ _ O
who _ _ O
ordered _ _ O
the _ _ O
sole _ _ B-DISH
at _ _ O
Peter _ _ B-EST

-- _ _ O
was _ _ O
strangely _ _ O
similar: _ _ O
The _ _ O
bread _ _ B-FOOD
crumbs _ _ I-FOOD
on _ _ O
top _ _ O
were _ _ O
gold _ _ O
and _ _ O
crunchy, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
fish _ _ B-FOOD
underneath _ _ O
was _ _ O
dry _ _ O
and _ _ O
almost _ _ O
powdery. _ _ O
Was _ _ O
the _ _ O
Caesar _ _ B-DISH
salad _ _ I-DISH
always _ _ O
so _ _ O
drippy, _ _ O
the _ _ O
croutons _ _ B-FOOD
always _ _ O
straight _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
bag, _ _ O
the _ _ O
grated _ _ O
cheese _ _ B-FOOD
always _ _ O
so _ _ O
white _ _ O
and _ _ O
rubbery? _ _ O
I _ _ O
know _ _ O
there _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
time _ _ O
the _ _ O
German _ _ B-DISH
fried _ _ I-DISH
potatoes _ _ I-DISH
were _ _ O
brown _ _ O
and _ _ O
crunchy, _ _ O
because _ _ O
I _ _ O
eagerly _ _ O
ate _ _ O
them _ _ O
each _ _ O
time _ _ O
I _ _ O
went. _ _ O
Now _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
mushy, _ _ O
dingy, _ _ O
gray _ _ O
and _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
cold. _ _ O
I _ _ O
look _ _ O
forward _ _ O
to _ _ O
them _ _ O
the _ _ O

Lunch _ _ O
one _ _ O
afternoon _ _ O
vividly _ _ O
demonstrated _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen's _ _ O
inconsistency: _ _ O
I _ _ O
ordered _ _ O
a _ _ O
burger, _ _ B-DISH
medium-rare, _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
bar. _ _ O
So _ _ O
had _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O
people _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
to _ _ O
my _ _ O
right, _ _ O
it _ _ O
turned _ _ O
out. _ _ O
One _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
got _ _ O
what _ _ O
we'd _ _ O
all _ _ O
asked _ _ O
for, _ _ O
a _ _ O
midnight-dark _ _ O
crust _ _ O
giving _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
an _ _ O
evenly _ _ O
rosy _ _ O
interior _ _ O
so _ _ O
full _ _ O
of _ _ O
juices _ _ O
it _ _ O
looked _ _ O
like _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
ready _ _ O
to _ _ O
cry. _ _ O
The _ _ O
other _ _ O
one _ _ O
got _ _ O
a _ _ O
patty _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
almost _ _ O
completely _ _ O
brown _ _ O
inside. _ _ O
I _ _ O
got _ _ O
a _ _ O
weird _ _ O
hybrid, _ _ O
a _ _ O
burger _ _ B-FOOD
whose _ _ O
interior _ _ O
shaded _ _ O
from _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
perfect _ _ O
on _ _ O
one _ _ O
side _ _ O
to _ _ O
gray _ _ O
and _ _ O
hard _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
other. _ _ O
The _ _ O

afflicted _ _ O
a _ _ O
medium-rare _ _ B-DISH

I _ _ O
was _ _ O
served _ _ O
one _ _ O
night: _ _ O
The _ _ O
fillet _ _ B-FOOD
was _ _ O
ideal _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
side _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
T-bone, _ _ B-FOOD
the _ _ O
strip, _ _ B-FOOD
ranged _ _ O
from _ _ O
medium-rare _ _ O
to _ _ O
medium-well. _ _ O
I _ _ O
could _ _ O
live _ _ O
with _ _ O
this; _ _ O
big _ _ O
cuts _ _ O
of _ _ O
meat _ _ O

evenly. _ _ O
What _ _ O
gnaws _ _ O
at _ _ O
me _ _ O
every _ _ O
time _ _ O
I _ _ O
eat _ _ O
a _ _ O
Luger _ _ B-EST

is _ _ O
the _ _ O
realization _ _ O
that _ _ O
it's _ _ O
just _ _ O
another _ _ O

But _ _ O

I _ _ O
could _ _ O

about _ _ O

-- _ _ O
compared _ _ O
to _ _ O
Peter _ _ B-EST

they _ _ O
don't _ _ O
count. _ _ O
Luger _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
city's _ _ O
oldest, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it's _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
age, _ _ O
tradition, _ _ O
superb _ _ O
beef, _ _ B-FOOD
blistering _ _ O
heat, _ _ O
an _ _ O
instinctive _ _ O
avoidance _ _ O
of _ _ O
anything _ _ O
fancy _ _ O
and _ _ O
an _ _ O
immensely _ _ O
attractive _ _ O
self-assurance _ _ O
came _ _ O
together _ _ O
to _ _ O
produce _ _ O
something _ _ O
that _ _ O
felt _ _ O
less _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
than _ _ O
an _ _ O
affirmation _ _ O
of _ _ O
life, _ _ O
or _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
life _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
lived _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
City. _ _ O
This _ _ O
sounds _ _ O
ridiculously _ _ O
grand. _ _ O
Years _ _ O
ago _ _ O
I _ _ O
thought _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
true, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
and _ _ O
so _ _ O
did _ _ O
other _ _ O
people. _ _ O
The _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
will _ _ O
always _ _ O
have _ _ O
its _ _ O
loyalists. _ _ O
They _ _ O
will _ _ O
laugh _ _ O
away _ _ O
the _ _ O
prices, _ _ O
the _ _ O
$16.95 _ _ O
sliced _ _ O
tomatoes _ _ O
that _ _ O
taste _ _ O
like _ _ O
1979, _ _ O
the _ _ O
$229.80 _ _ O
porterhouse _ _ O
for _ _ O
four. _ _ O
They _ _ O
will _ _ O
say _ _ O
that _ _ O
nobody _ _ O
goes _ _ O
to _ _ O
Luger _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
sole, _ _ O
nobody _ _ O
goes _ _ O
to _ _ O

for _ _ O
the _ _ O

nobody _ _ O
goes _ _ O
to _ _ O

for _ _ O
the _ _ O

nobody _ _ O
goes _ _ O
to _ _ O

for _ _ O
the _ _ O
service. _ _ O
The _ _ O
list _ _ O
goes _ _ O
on, _ _ O
and _ _ O
gets _ _ O

Over _ _ O
the _ _ O
years, _ _ O
I _ _ O
have _ _ O
eaten _ _ O
many _ _ O
bowls _ _ O
of _ _ O
pasta _ _ B-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
clams _ _ I-DISH
that _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
rewired _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
chef _ _ O
who _ _ O
was _ _ O
trying _ _ O
to _ _ O
stand _ _ O
out. _ _ O
But _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
not _ _ O
come _ _ O
across _ _ O
one _ _ O
that _ _ O
made _ _ O
as _ _ O
much _ _ O
sense _ _ O
to _ _ O
me _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
big, _ _ O
sloshing _ _ O
platters _ _ O
you _ _ O
get _ _ O
at _ _ O
old-line _ _ O
Italian-American _ _ B-CUISINE
clam _ _ B-TYPE
bars _ _ I-TYPE
like _ _ O
Randazzo's _ _ B-EST
until _ _ O
tripping _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
Greenwich _ _ B-LOC
Village _ _ I-LOC
restaurant _ _ O
called _ _ O
Babs _ _ B-EST
this _ _ O
summer. _ _ O
Mind _ _ O
you, _ _ O
virtually _ _ O
the _ _ O
only _ _ O
Italian _ _ B-CUISINE
thing _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
tagliatelle _ _ B-DISH
with _ _ I-DISH
clams _ _ I-DISH
at _ _ O
Babs _ _ B-EST
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
tagliatelle. _ _ B-FOOD
The _ _ O
sauce _ _ B-FOOD
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
mustard _ _ B-FOOD
beurre _ _ I-FOOD
blanc, _ _ I-FOOD
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
those _ _ O
French _ _ B-CUISINE
sauces _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
all _ _ O
culinary-school _ _ O
students _ _ O
are _ _ O
supposed _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
able _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
in _ _ O
their _ _ O
sleep. _ _ O
Mustard _ _ B-FOOD
beurre _ _ I-FOOD
blanc _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
often _ _ O
found _ _ O
providing _ _ O
a _ _ O
decorous _ _ O
yellow _ _ O
veil _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-FOOD
breast _ _ I-FOOD
or _ _ O
salmon _ _ B-FOOD
fillet. _ _ I-FOOD
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
normally _ _ O
poured _ _ O
over _ _ O
noodles. _ _ B-FOOD
But, _ _ O
tossed _ _ O
with _ _ O
salty _ _ O
French _ _ B-FOOD
ham _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
Manila _ _ O
clams _ _ O
smaller _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
thumbprint, _ _ O
it _ _ O
made _ _ O
a _ _ O
strangely _ _ O
exciting _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
much _ _ O
more _ _ O
coherent _ _ O
than _ _ O
it _ _ O
sounds. _ _ O
Once _ _ O
I _ _ O
got _ _ O
to _ _ O
know _ _ O
Babs _ _ O
better, _ _ O
I _ _ O
understood _ _ O
that _ _ O
strange _ _ O
excitement _ _ O
is _ _ O
what _ _ O
it _ _ O
does _ _ O
best. _ _ O
Its _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Efrén _ _ O
Hernández, _ _ O
has _ _ O
talked _ _ O
about _ _ O
Babs _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
European _ _ O
grill, _ _ O
and _ _ O
many _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
are _ _ O
seared _ _ O
over _ _ O
hot _ _ O
charcoal, _ _ O
but _ _ O
he _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
wider _ _ O
frame _ _ O
of _ _ O
reference _ _ O
than _ _ O
that. _ _ O
He _ _ O
was _ _ O
raised _ _ O
in _ _ O
Southern _ _ O
California _ _ O
by _ _ O
immigrants _ _ O
from _ _ O
Mexico, _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mexican _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
runs _ _ O
through _ _ O
his _ _ O
menu _ _ O
like _ _ O
an _ _ O
underground _ _ O
stream _ _ O
that _ _ O
sometimes _ _ O
gurgles _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
surface. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Hernández _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
interested _ _ O
in _ _ O
fusion, _ _ O
though; _ _ O
as _ _ O
far _ _ O
as _ _ O
I _ _ O
can _ _ O
tell, _ _ O
he _ _ O
likes _ _ O
rubbing _ _ O
cultures _ _ O
together _ _ O
to _ _ O
see _ _ O
what _ _ O
color _ _ O
the _ _ O
sparks _ _ O
will _ _ O
be. _ _ O
See, _ _ O
for _ _ O
example, _ _ O
what _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
calls _ _ O
divorced _ _ O
sea _ _ O
bream, _ _ O
a _ _ O
handsome _ _ O
dish _ _ O
that _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
splashed _ _ O
around _ _ O
Instagram _ _ O
even _ _ O
more _ _ O
frequently _ _ O
than _ _ O
it _ _ O
already _ _ O
is _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
tables _ _ O
were _ _ O
lighted _ _ O
by _ _ O
ceiling _ _ O
pinspots _ _ O
rather _ _ O
than _ _ O
disco-era _ _ O
chrome _ _ O
globes _ _ O
that _ _ O
look _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
they _ _ O
were _ _ O
salvaged _ _ O
from _ _ O
Regine's _ _ O
. _ _ O
The _ _ O
bream _ _ O
is _ _ O
split, _ _ O
and _ _ O
one _ _ O
side _ _ O
brushed _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
red _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
green _ _ O
sauce, _ _ O
before _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
over _ _ O
charcoal. _ _ O
The _ _ O
dish _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
allusion _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
two-tone _ _ O
pescado _ _ O
a _ _ O
la _ _ O
talla _ _ O
served _ _ O
at _ _ O
Contramar _ _ O
in _ _ O
Mexico _ _ O
City, _ _ O
itself _ _ O
derived _ _ O
from _ _ O
huevos _ _ O
divorciados, _ _ O
a _ _ O
breakfast _ _ O
of _ _ O
two _ _ O
fried _ _ O
eggs _ _ O
beneath _ _ O
two _ _ O
contrasting _ _ O
salsas. _ _ O
In _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Hernández's _ _ O
kitchen, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
the _ _ O
red _ _ O
adobo _ _ O
at _ _ O
Contramar _ _ O
is _ _ O
replaced _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
Catalan _ _ O
romesco, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
parsley _ _ O
salsa _ _ O
becomes _ _ O
a _ _ O
French _ _ O
pistou. _ _ O
But _ _ O
surely _ _ O
the _ _ O
tortilla _ _ O
on _ _ O
its _ _ O
own _ _ O
plate _ _ O
off _ _ O
to _ _ O
one _ _ O
side _ _ O
brings _ _ O
it _ _ O
back _ _ O
to _ _ O
Mexico? _ _ O
Not _ _ O
so _ _ O
fast. _ _ O
According _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
taloa, _ _ O
a _ _ O
Basque _ _ O
cornmeal _ _ O
cake _ _ O
that _ _ O
cooks _ _ O
from _ _ O
Bayonne _ _ O
to _ _ O
Bilbao _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
griddling _ _ O
for _ _ O
centuries. _ _ O
The _ _ O
taloa _ _ O
at _ _ O
Babs _ _ O
is _ _ O
tender, _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
and _ _ O
floral. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Hernández _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
at _ _ O
Babs _ _ O
since _ _ O
it _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
July. _ _ O
He _ _ O
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
at _ _ O
Mimi _ _ O
, _ _ O
a _ _ O
French _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
a _ _ O
block _ _ O
away _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
owned _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
people _ _ O
(Daniel _ _ O
Bennett, _ _ O
his _ _ O
brother _ _ O
Evan, _ _ O
and _ _ O
Louis _ _ O
Levy; _ _ O
they _ _ O
named _ _ O
Babs _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mimi _ _ O
after _ _ O
their _ _ O
grandmothers.) _ _ O
I _ _ O
haven't _ _ O
been _ _ O
back _ _ O
to _ _ O
Mimi _ _ O
since _ _ O
Liz _ _ O
Johnson _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
. _ _ O
She _ _ O
was _ _ O
aiming _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
style _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
at _ _ O
once _ _ O
brawny _ _ O
and _ _ O
lavish, _ _ O
and _ _ O
since _ _ O
taking _ _ O
over _ _ O
last _ _ O
year _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Hernández _ _ O
has _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
to _ _ O
continue _ _ O
in _ _ O
that _ _ O
vein _ _ O
while _ _ O
bringing _ _ O
his _ _ O
far-ranging _ _ O
curiosity _ _ O
to _ _ O
bear. _ _ O
As _ _ O
they _ _ O
did _ _ O
at _ _ O
Mimi, _ _ O
the _ _ O
owners _ _ O
have _ _ O
planted _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
curved _ _ O
bar _ _ O
right _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
door _ _ O
at _ _ O
Babs. _ _ O
The _ _ O
cocktails _ _ O
stirred _ _ O
and _ _ O
shaken _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
mostly _ _ O
recognizable _ _ O
relatives _ _ O
of _ _ O
classics, _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
martini _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
two _ _ O
brands _ _ O
of _ _ O
gin. _ _ O
There's _ _ O
something _ _ O
charmingly _ _ O
self-deprecating _ _ O
about _ _ O
a _ _ O
cocktail _ _ O
list _ _ O
that _ _ O
includes _ _ O
Mount _ _ O
Gay _ _ O
and _ _ O
tonic, _ _ O
which _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
barflies _ _ O
know _ _ O
as _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
drinks _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
safely _ _ O
order _ _ O
in _ _ O
dives _ _ O
that _ _ O
don't _ _ O
do _ _ O
anything _ _ O
else _ _ O
right. _ _ O
The _ _ O
wine _ _ O
list, _ _ O
meanwhile, _ _ O
is _ _ O
mostly _ _ O
French _ _ O
and _ _ O
sticks _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
old _ _ O
guard; _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
tell _ _ O
it's _ _ O
not _ _ O
trying _ _ O
especially _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
cool _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
just _ _ O
one _ _ O
orange _ _ O
wine, _ _ O
lumped _ _ O
in _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
sparkling _ _ O
wines. _ _ O
Only _ _ O
the _ _ O
wine _ _ O
geeks _ _ O
will _ _ O
wish _ _ O
for _ _ O
more, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
rest _ _ O
of _ _ O
us _ _ O
might _ _ O
wish _ _ O
there _ _ O
were _ _ O
as _ _ O
many _ _ O
bottles _ _ O
costing _ _ O
around _ _ O
$50 _ _ O
as _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
$90 _ _ O
range. _ _ O
The _ _ O
numbers _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
can _ _ O
sneak _ _ O
up _ _ O
on _ _ O
you, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
My _ _ O
$48 _ _ O
lobster _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
creature _ _ O
that _ _ O
couldn't _ _ O
have _ _ O
weighed _ _ O
much _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
pound. _ _ O
The _ _ O
server _ _ O
brightly _ _ O
suggested _ _ O
dunking _ _ O
its _ _ O
tomalley _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
smoked _ _ O
potato _ _ O
purée, _ _ O
and _ _ O
I _ _ O
would _ _ O
have _ _ O
tried _ _ O
it _ _ O
if _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
found _ _ O
any _ _ O
tomalley. _ _ O
And _ _ O
while _ _ O
I _ _ O
can _ _ O
imagine _ _ O
happily _ _ O
paying _ _ O
$36 _ _ O
for _ _ O
Babs's _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
chops, _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
want _ _ O
them _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
something _ _ O
more _ _ O
compelling _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
cold, _ _ O
underseasoned _ _ O
"Basque _ _ O
potato _ _ O
salad" _ _ O
into _ _ O
which _ _ O
some _ _ O
baby _ _ O
sardines _ _ O
had _ _ O
apparently _ _ O
disappeared _ _ O
without _ _ O
a _ _ O
trace. _ _ O
But _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
wrong _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
charcoal-grilled _ _ O
swordfish _ _ O
with _ _ O
mint _ _ O
salsa _ _ O
verde, _ _ O
fennel _ _ O
and _ _ O
green _ _ O
olives, _ _ O
and _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
ordered _ _ O
the _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
andouille _ _ O
this _ _ O
summer _ _ O
you _ _ O
found _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Hernández _ _ O
knocking _ _ O
cuisines _ _ O
together _ _ O
again, _ _ O
this _ _ O
time _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
corn-and-chanterelles _ _ O
risotto _ _ O
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
slow-burning _ _ O
splash _ _ O
of _ _ O
Calabrian _ _ O
chile _ _ O
oil. _ _ O
He _ _ O
shows _ _ O
how _ _ O
well _ _ O
he _ _ O
can _ _ O
work _ _ O
in _ _ O
small _ _ O
strokes _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
layered _ _ O
appetizer _ _ O
of _ _ O
raw _ _ O
sea _ _ O
scallops, _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
potato _ _ O
purée _ _ O
and _ _ O
trout _ _ O
roe, _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
briny _ _ O
and _ _ O
fascinating _ _ O
salsa _ _ O
of _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
cucumbers, _ _ O
seaweed _ _ O
and _ _ O
fermented _ _ O
serrano _ _ O
chiles; _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
fried _ _ O
cod _ _ O
cheeks, _ _ O
tender _ _ O
and _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
over _ _ O
an _ _ O
orange _ _ O
slick _ _ O
of _ _ O
romesco _ _ O
aioli. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Hernández's _ _ O
imagination _ _ O
fights _ _ O
against _ _ O
predictability. _ _ O
A _ _ O
crab _ _ O
salad, _ _ O
for _ _ O
instance, _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
need _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
interesting _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
fresh, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
at _ _ O
Babs _ _ O
is _ _ O
both. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
gribiche _ _ O
that's _ _ O
full _ _ O
of _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
dill, _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
it's _ _ O
piled _ _ O
up _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
big _ _ O
beehive _ _ O
on _ _ O
top _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
smoked _ _ O
potato _ _ O
pancake. _ _ O
Like _ _ O
many _ _ O
small _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
these _ _ O
days, _ _ O
Babs _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
offer _ _ O
many _ _ O
desserts, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
ones _ _ O
it _ _ O
does _ _ O
are _ _ O
far _ _ O
more _ _ O
intriguing _ _ O
than _ _ O
average. _ _ O
A _ _ O
fine _ _ O
apple _ _ O
galette _ _ O
is _ _ O
improved _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
grating _ _ O
of _ _ O
Swiss-style _ _ O
cheese _ _ O
from _ _ O
Edelweiss _ _ O
Creamery _ _ O
in _ _ O
Wisconsin _ _ O
and _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
drizzle _ _ O
of _ _ O
20-year-old _ _ O
Pedro _ _ O
Ximénez _ _ O
sherry, _ _ O
thick _ _ O
as _ _ O
syrup _ _ O
and _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
like _ _ O
chocolate _ _ O
and _ _ O
coffee. _ _ O
Why _ _ O
sherry _ _ O
with _ _ O
Swiss _ _ O
cheese? _ _ O
I _ _ O
don't _ _ O
know, _ _ O
but _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Hernández _ _ O
does. _ _ O

For _ _ O
a _ _ O
long _ _ O
time, _ _ O
the _ _ O
seriousness _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
pizzeria _ _ B-TYPE
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
gauged _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
simple _ _ O
yes-or-no _ _ O
question: _ _ O
Did _ _ O
it _ _ O
sell _ _ O
pizza _ _ B-FOOD
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
slice? _ _ O
The _ _ O
ones _ _ O
that _ _ O
cared _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
about _ _ O
upholding _ _ O
traditions, _ _ O
maintaining _ _ O
quality _ _ O
and _ _ O
so _ _ O
on _ _ O
-- _ _ O
like _ _ O
Totonno's _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
John's _ _ B-EST
of _ _ I-EST
Bleecker _ _ I-EST
Street _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
Kesté _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
Lucali _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
Una _ _ B-EST
Pizza _ _ I-EST
Napoletana _ _ I-EST
-- _ _ O
emphatically _ _ O
did _ _ O
not. _ _ O
Today, _ _ O
we _ _ O
live _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
era _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
elevated _ _ O
slice _ _ B-TYPE
joint. _ _ I-TYPE
Some _ _ O
of _ _ O
them, _ _ O
like _ _ O
Scarr's _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
grind _ _ O
wheat _ _ B-FOOD
berries _ _ I-FOOD
into _ _ O
new _ _ O
flour _ _ B-FOOD
every _ _ O
day. _ _ O
Many _ _ O
use _ _ O
minuscule _ _ O
quantities _ _ O
of _ _ O
yeast; _ _ B-FOOD
others _ _ O
abandon _ _ O
commercial _ _ O
yeast _ _ B-FOOD
altogether _ _ O
in _ _ O
favor _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
natural _ _ O
leavening _ _ O
in _ _ O
sourdough _ _ B-FOOD
starters. _ _ I-FOOD
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
slice _ _ B-TYPE
joints _ _ I-TYPE
that _ _ O
ferment _ _ O
their _ _ O
dough _ _ B-FOOD
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
day, _ _ O
some _ _ O
that _ _ O
let _ _ O
it _ _ O
bubble _ _ O
away _ _ O
for _ _ O
two _ _ O
days _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
that _ _ O
go _ _ O
in _ _ O
for _ _ O

A _ _ O
new _ _ O
example _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
breed, _ _ O
F&F _ _ B-EST
Pizzeria _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
Brooklyn _ _ B-LOC
last _ _ O
week _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
help _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
baker _ _ O
whose _ _ O
starter _ _ B-FOOD
dough _ _ I-FOOD
has _ _ O
traveled _ _ O
internationally _ _ O
and _ _ O
another _ _ O
baker _ _ O
who _ _ O
has _ _ O
decades _ _ O
of _ _ O
experience _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
paddle. _ _ O
Among _ _ O
themselves, _ _ O
these _ _ O
new-school _ _ O
pizza _ _ B-FOOD
makers _ _ O
speak _ _ O
of _ _ O
hydration _ _ O
levels, _ _ O
fermentation _ _ O
periods _ _ O
and _ _ O
digestibility. _ _ O
Many _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O
slice _ _ O
masters _ _ O
are _ _ O
chasing _ _ O
an _ _ O
ideal _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
foldable, _ _ O
portable _ _ O
triangle _ _ O
sold _ _ O
across _ _ O
linoleum _ _ O
counters _ _ O
in _ _ O
all _ _ O
five _ _ O
boroughs, _ _ O
a _ _ O
search _ _ O
suffused _ _ O
with _ _ O
nostalgia _ _ O
for _ _ O
an _ _ O
era _ _ O
before _ _ O
processed _ _ O
cheese, _ _ B-FOOD
sweetened _ _ O
sauce _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
wholesale _ _ O
dough. _ _ B-FOOD
Others _ _ O
are _ _ O
celebrated _ _ O
for _ _ O
achievements _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
square _ _ O
slice, _ _ O
a _ _ O
descendant _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Sicilian, _ _ B-CUISINE
with _ _ O
an _ _ O
airier, _ _ O
less _ _ O
doughy _ _ O
crust; _ _ B-FOOD
leaders _ _ O
in _ _ O
this _ _ O
style _ _ O
include _ _ O
Corner _ _ B-EST
Slice _ _ I-EST
and _ _ O
Mama's _ _ B-EST
Too _ _ I-EST
. _ _ O
Perhaps _ _ O
the _ _ O
smallest _ _ O
group _ _ O
of _ _ O
all _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
bakers _ _ O
who _ _ O
turn _ _ O
their _ _ O
eyes _ _ O
toward _ _ O
Rome, _ _ B-LOC
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
slices _ _ O
are _ _ O
rectangular _ _ O
and _ _ O
are _ _ O
known _ _ O
as _ _ O
pizza _ _ B-DISH
al _ _ I-DISH
taglio. _ _ I-DISH
They _ _ O
resemble _ _ O
focaccia _ _ B-FOOD
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
$3 _ _ O
slice _ _ O
from _ _ O
Ray's _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it's _ _ O
doubtful _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
practitioners _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
style _ _ O
even _ _ O
think _ _ O
of _ _ O
themselves _ _ O
as _ _ O
belonging _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
elevated-slice _ _ O
movement. _ _ O
But _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
argue _ _ O
that _ _ O
they _ _ O
do _ _ O
belong _ _ O
to _ _ O
it, _ _ O
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
elevated _ _ O
slices _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
area _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
moment _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
Roman-style _ _ B-CUISINE
ones _ _ O
that _ _ O
Bread _ _ B-EST
and _ _ I-EST
Salt _ _ I-EST
sells _ _ O
inside _ _ O
its _ _ O
bakery _ _ B-TYPE
and _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
on _ _ O
Palisade _ _ B-LOC
Avenue, _ _ I-LOC
up _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Jersey _ _ B-LOC
City _ _ I-LOC
Heights. _ _ I-LOC
At _ _ O
any _ _ O
given _ _ O
time, _ _ O
three _ _ O
to _ _ O
six _ _ O
pizzas _ _ B-FOOD
sit _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
counter. _ _ O
They _ _ O
are _ _ O
oblong _ _ O
and, _ _ O
because _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
baked _ _ O
without _ _ O
a _ _ O
pan _ _ O
to _ _ O
shape _ _ O
the _ _ O
dough, _ _ B-FOOD
they _ _ O
have _ _ O
rounded _ _ O
corners, _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
horse _ _ O
track. _ _ O
The _ _ O
crust _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
noticeably _ _ O
lightweight _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
pick _ _ O
it _ _ O
up, _ _ O
an _ _ O
impression _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
confirmed _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
mouth _ _ O
and, _ _ O
later, _ _ O
the _ _ O
stomach. _ _ O
The _ _ O
interior _ _ O
is _ _ O
honeycombed _ _ O
with _ _ O
air _ _ O
pockets. _ _ O
The _ _ O
underside _ _ O
of _ _ O
each _ _ O
slice _ _ O
is _ _ O
strong _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
carry _ _ O
a _ _ O
relatively _ _ O
heavy _ _ O
load _ _ O
of _ _ O
toppings _ _ O
without _ _ O
bending _ _ O
or _ _ O
collapsing. _ _ O
This _ _ O
structural _ _ O
soundness _ _ O
is _ _ O
key _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
pleasure. _ _ O
The _ _ O
toppings _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
Bread _ _ B-EST
and _ _ I-EST
Salt _ _ I-EST
slice _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
decorations _ _ O
or _ _ O
seasonings, _ _ O
as _ _ O
they _ _ O
often _ _ O
are _ _ O
on _ _ O
round _ _ O
pizza. _ _ B-FOOD
Each _ _ O
one _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
point _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
slice: _ _ O
a _ _ O
mix _ _ O
of _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
mushrooms _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
pepper, _ _ B-FOOD
parsley _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
flecks _ _ O
of _ _ O
grated _ _ O
Parmigiano-Reggiano; _ _ B-FOOD
zucchini _ _ B-FOOD
shaved _ _ O
into _ _ O
fine _ _ O
threads _ _ O
and _ _ O
showered _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
minute _ _ O
with _ _ O
mint _ _ B-FOOD
leaves; _ _ I-FOOD
slices _ _ O
of _ _ O
late-summer _ _ O
red _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ I-FOOD
yellow _ _ I-FOOD
peppers _ _ I-FOOD
picked _ _ O
while _ _ O
they _ _ O
still _ _ O
had _ _ O
few _ _ O
faintly _ _ O
bitter _ _ O
streaks _ _ O
of _ _ O
green _ _ O
reaching _ _ O
up _ _ O
their _ _ O
sides; _ _ O
a _ _ O
rough, _ _ O
dark _ _ O
pesto _ _ B-FOOD
spooned _ _ O
around _ _ O
cherry _ _ B-FOOD
tomatoes _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
were _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
until _ _ O
their _ _ O
skins _ _ O
turned _ _ O
black _ _ O
and _ _ O
pulled _ _ O
away _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
globes _ _ O
of _ _ O
pulp _ _ O
inside; _ _ O
Concord _ _ B-FOOD
grapes _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
blotch _ _ O
the _ _ O
dough _ _ B-FOOD
with _ _ O
purple _ _ O
like _ _ O
exploded _ _ O
jelly _ _ B-FOOD
grenades. _ _ O
A _ _ O
chef's _ _ O
hand _ _ O
is _ _ O
at _ _ O
work _ _ O
here, _ _ O
tossing _ _ O
black _ _ B-FOOD
pepper _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
rosemary _ _ B-FOOD
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
grape _ _ B-DISH
pizza, _ _ I-DISH
adding _ _ O
salt _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
excellent _ _ O
Sicilian _ _ B-FOOD
olive _ _ I-FOOD
oil _ _ I-FOOD
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
tomato _ _ B-FOOD
pulp, _ _ O
and _ _ O
hammering _ _ O
basil _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
hazelnuts _ _ B-FOOD
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
pesto _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
mortar. _ _ O
The _ _ O
hand _ _ O
belongs _ _ O
to _ _ O
Rick _ _ O
Easton, _ _ O
who _ _ O
oversees _ _ O
the _ _ O
pizzas _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
nonpizzas _ _ O
and _ _ O
owns _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
He _ _ O
also _ _ O
owned _ _ O
its _ _ O
predecessor, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Bread _ _ B-EST
and _ _ I-EST
Salt _ _ I-EST
that _ _ O
operated _ _ O
in _ _ O
Pittsburgh _ _ B-LOC
for _ _ O
all _ _ O
of _ _ O
2015 _ _ O
plus _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
weeks _ _ O
on _ _ O
either _ _ O
side. _ _ O
For _ _ O
a _ _ O
short-lived _ _ O
place, _ _ O
it _ _ O
got _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
media _ _ O
attention, _ _ O
luring _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
hunters _ _ O
and _ _ O
recipe _ _ O
gatherers _ _ O
from _ _ O
across _ _ O
the _ _ O
country. _ _ O
By _ _ O
the _ _ O
start _ _ O
of _ _ O
2016, _ _ O
he _ _ O
had _ _ O
decided _ _ O
to _ _ O
move _ _ O
to _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
City. _ _ I-LOC
When _ _ O
his _ _ O
first _ _ O
job _ _ O
fell _ _ O
through, _ _ O
he _ _ O
began _ _ O
shopping _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
location _ _ O
for _ _ O
Bread _ _ B-EST
and _ _ I-EST
Salt. _ _ I-EST
The _ _ O
real _ _ O
estate _ _ O
market _ _ O
had _ _ O
ideas _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
own, _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
often _ _ O
does, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
how _ _ O
the _ _ O
incarnation _ _ O
of _ _ O
Bread _ _ B-EST
and _ _ I-EST
Salt _ _ I-EST
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Easton _ _ O
opened _ _ O
early _ _ O
this _ _ O
summer _ _ O
wound _ _ O
up _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
Jersey. _ _ I-LOC
In _ _ O
addition _ _ O
to _ _ O
cheaper _ _ O
rents, _ _ O
Jersey _ _ B-LOC
City _ _ I-LOC
has _ _ O
ordinances _ _ O
that _ _ O
allow _ _ O
customers _ _ O
to _ _ O
show _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
bottles _ _ O
of _ _ O
wine _ _ B-FOOD
or _ _ O
beer _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
drink _ _ O
them, _ _ O
a _ _ O
handy _ _ O
policy _ _ O
because _ _ O
Bread _ _ B-EST
and _ _ I-EST
Salt's _ _ I-EST
beverage _ _ O
list _ _ O
has _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
more _ _ O
potent _ _ O
than _ _ O
Italian _ _ B-FOOD
sodas _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
sparkling _ _ B-FOOD
water. _ _ I-FOOD
Each _ _ O
night's _ _ O
menu, _ _ O
written _ _ O
in _ _ O
chalk _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
blackboard _ _ O
next _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
counter _ _ O
where _ _ O
you _ _ O
order, _ _ O
contains _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
as _ _ O
many _ _ O
things _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
pizza _ _ B-FOOD
as _ _ O
things _ _ O
that _ _ O
are. _ _ O
Generally _ _ O
these _ _ O
other _ _ O
items _ _ O
are _ _ O
modest _ _ O
in _ _ O
size _ _ O
and _ _ O
trattoria-ish _ _ B-TYPE
in _ _ O
spirit; _ _ O
prepared _ _ O
ahead _ _ O
of _ _ O
time, _ _ O
they _ _ O
need _ _ O
at _ _ O
most _ _ O
five _ _ O
minutes _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
oven _ _ O
before _ _ O
a _ _ O
cook _ _ O
will _ _ O
arrange _ _ O
them _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
board _ _ O
and _ _ O
carry _ _ O
them _ _ O
to _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
25 _ _ O
or _ _ O
so _ _ O
seats. _ _ O
I _ _ O
wish _ _ O
the _ _ O
tripe _ _ B-DISH
stewed _ _ I-DISH
in _ _ I-DISH
spicy _ _ I-DISH
tomato _ _ I-DISH
sauce, _ _ I-DISH
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
Romans _ _ O
do _ _ O
it, _ _ O
were _ _ O
available _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
time. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
not, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
meatballs _ _ B-DISH
almost _ _ O
always _ _ O
are, _ _ O
and _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
wonderful, _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
enough _ _ O
bread _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
extremely _ _ O
tender _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
bright _ _ O
marinara. _ _ B-FOOD
Another _ _ O
reliable _ _ O
find _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
sandwich _ _ B-FOOD
of _ _ O
some _ _ O
kind, _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
plain, _ _ O
untopped _ _ O
pizza. _ _ B-FOOD
Twice _ _ O
I've _ _ O
had _ _ O
a _ _ O
warm _ _ O
mortadella _ _ B-DISH
sandwich _ _ I-DISH
there, _ _ O
and _ _ O
both _ _ O
times _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
convinced _ _ O
there _ _ O
was _ _ O
no _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
improve _ _ O
on _ _ O
it. _ _ O
One _ _ O
dish _ _ O
was _ _ O
denoted _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
single _ _ O
word: _ _ O
beans. _ _ B-DISH
I've _ _ O
thought _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
every _ _ O
day _ _ O
since, _ _ O
partly _ _ O
because _ _ O
the _ _ O
beans _ _ B-FOOD
-- _ _ O
scarlet _ _ B-FOOD
runners _ _ I-FOOD
-- _ _ O
were _ _ O
perfectly _ _ O
intact _ _ O
but _ _ O
perfectly _ _ O
tender; _ _ O
partly _ _ O
because _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
brooding _ _ O
depth _ _ O
they _ _ O
took _ _ O
on _ _ O
from _ _ O
being _ _ O
finished _ _ O
with _ _ O
sweet _ _ B-FOOD
red _ _ I-FOOD
peppers _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
dried _ _ O
and _ _ O
fried, _ _ O
an _ _ O
ingredient _ _ O
the _ _ O
Italians _ _ O
call _ _ O
peperoni _ _ B-FOOD
cruschi; _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
partly _ _ O
because _ _ O
their _ _ O
broth _ _ B-FOOD
tasted _ _ O
so _ _ O
good _ _ O
when _ _ O
given _ _ O
a _ _ O
chance _ _ O
to _ _ O
soak _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
slice _ _ O
of _ _ O
thick-crusted _ _ O
sourdough _ _ B-FOOD
bread _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
came _ _ O
on _ _ O
top. _ _ O
That _ _ O
bread _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Easton's, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
It _ _ O
comes _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
things, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
excellent. _ _ O
Bread _ _ B-EST
and _ _ I-EST
Salt _ _ I-EST
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
settling _ _ O
into _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
Jersey. _ _ I-LOC
Some _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
better _ _ O
when _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Easton _ _ O
has _ _ O
had _ _ O
time _ _ O
to _ _ O
infiltrate _ _ O
the _ _ O
local _ _ O
farm _ _ O
scene. _ _ O
In _ _ O
August, _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
state _ _ O
was _ _ O
rolling _ _ O
in _ _ O
juicy _ _ O
peaches, _ _ B-FOOD
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
serving _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
unripe _ _ O
ones _ _ O
in _ _ O
red _ _ B-FOOD
wine _ _ I-FOOD
for _ _ O
dessert. _ _ O
There _ _ O
was _ _ O
also _ _ O
a _ _ O
very _ _ O
strange _ _ O
cantaloupe _ _ B-DISH
pudding. _ _ I-DISH
By _ _ O
September _ _ O
things _ _ O
were _ _ O
looking _ _ O
up; _ _ O
one _ _ O
day _ _ O
there _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
scoop _ _ O
of _ _ O
Tristar _ _ B-DISH
strawberry _ _ I-DISH
sorbet _ _ I-DISH
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
anise-seed-flecked _ _ B-FOOD
polenta _ _ I-FOOD
gelato, _ _ I-FOOD
both _ _ O
made _ _ O
by _ _ O
Superiority _ _ B-EST
Burger. _ _ I-EST
(Mr. _ _ O
Easton _ _ O
is _ _ O
friendly _ _ O
with _ _ O
that _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
owner, _ _ O
Brooks _ _ O
Headley _ _ O
, _ _ O
and _ _ O
helped _ _ O
devise _ _ O
the _ _ O
recipe _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
focaccia _ _ B-FOOD
Superiority _ _ B-EST
Burger _ _ I-EST
serves _ _ O
on _ _ O
Fridays.) _ _ O
Although _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Easton _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
handful _ _ O
of _ _ O
employees, _ _ O
Bread _ _ B-EST
and _ _ I-EST
Salt _ _ I-EST
has _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
blind _ _ O
spots _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
one-person _ _ O
operation. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
easiest _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
to _ _ O
communicate _ _ O
with, _ _ O
having _ _ O
an _ _ O
Instagram _ _ O
account _ _ O
but _ _ O
no _ _ O
website _ _ O
or _ _ O
phone. _ _ O
On _ _ O
a _ _ O
recent _ _ O
Sunday, _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
was _ _ O
supposed _ _ O
to _ _ O
open _ _ O
at _ _ O
1 _ _ O
p.m., _ _ O
a _ _ O
sign _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
front _ _ O
door _ _ O
announced _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
delayed _ _ O
until _ _ O
1:30. _ _ O
That _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
communiqué; _ _ O
the _ _ O
doors _ _ O
were _ _ O
not _ _ O
unlocked _ _ O
until _ _ O
2. _ _ O
But _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Easton _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
singular _ _ O
vision, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
reason _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
is _ _ O
so _ _ O
compelling. _ _ O
Looking _ _ O
around _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
place, _ _ O
you're _ _ O
not _ _ O
sure _ _ O
how _ _ O
it _ _ O
can _ _ O
keep _ _ O
going _ _ O
like _ _ O
this. _ _ O
But _ _ O
then _ _ O
the _ _ O
plates _ _ O
start _ _ O
to _ _ O
come _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
and _ _ O
you _ _ O
don't _ _ O
want _ _ O
them _ _ O
ever _ _ O
to _ _ O
stop. _ _ O

you _ _ O

If _ _ O
you've _ _ O
found _ _ O
your _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu's _ _ O

you _ _ O

Kinilaw, _ _ B-DISH
a _ _ O
Filipino _ _ B-CUISINE
ceviche _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
piercingly _ _ O
sour _ _ O
calamansi _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ I-FOOD
cane _ _ I-FOOD
vinegar _ _ I-FOOD
marinade _ _ I-FOOD
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
jab _ _ O
of _ _ O
bird's-eye _ _ B-FOOD
chile, _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
worth _ _ O
sticking _ _ O
around _ _ O
for, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
on _ _ O
those _ _ O
nights _ _ O
when _ _ O
it's _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
bay _ _ B-FOOD
scallops _ _ I-FOOD
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
fish. _ _ B-FOOD
After _ _ O
that, _ _ O
you _ _ O
might _ _ O
look _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
fried _ _ O
pork-and-carrot _ _ O
won _ _ O
tons _ _ O
called _ _ O
pinsec _ _ O
frito _ _ O
(or, _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
has _ _ O
them, _ _ O
pinsit _ _ O
frito). _ _ O
They _ _ O
are _ _ O
typically _ _ O
folded _ _ O
into _ _ O
triangles, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
ones _ _ O
at _ _ O
Tsismis _ _ O
are _ _ O
twisted _ _ O
into _ _ O
little _ _ O
cones _ _ O
that _ _ O
look _ _ O
like _ _ O
Hershey's _ _ O
kisses, _ _ O
though _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
bigger _ _ O
and _ _ O
golden-brown. _ _ O
Once _ _ O
they _ _ O
stop _ _ O
steaming, _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
hold _ _ O
them _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
cowlick _ _ O
of _ _ O
fried _ _ O
wrapper _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
top _ _ O
and _ _ O
swish _ _ O
them _ _ O
around _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
chile _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
Won _ _ O
tons _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
filling _ _ O
flop _ _ O
around _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
soup _ _ O
called _ _ O
pancit _ _ O
molo, _ _ O
although _ _ O
these _ _ O
are _ _ O
boiled. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
almost _ _ O
as _ _ O
much _ _ O
ground _ _ O
pork _ _ O
inside _ _ O
them _ _ O
as _ _ O
outside _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
broth, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
thick _ _ O
with _ _ O
garlic _ _ O
and _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
scallions. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
if _ _ O
it's _ _ O
well _ _ O
after _ _ O
5:thirsty _ _ O
and _ _ O
you're _ _ O
not _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
bar, _ _ O
Jappy's _ _ O
wings _ _ O
are _ _ O
worth _ _ O
considering. _ _ O
Jappy _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Jappy _ _ O
Afzelius, _ _ O
and _ _ O
he _ _ O
fries _ _ O
those _ _ O
wings _ _ O
with _ _ O
thinly _ _ O
sliced _ _ O
garlic _ _ O
and _ _ O
sends _ _ O
them _ _ O
out _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
salsa _ _ O
of _ _ O
raw _ _ O
mangoes, _ _ O
charred _ _ O
onions _ _ O
and _ _ O
chiles. _ _ O
The _ _ O
heat _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
salsa _ _ O
will _ _ O
not _ _ O
cause _ _ O
your _ _ O
shirt _ _ O
to _ _ O
burst _ _ O
into _ _ O
flames, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
hot _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
your _ _ O
memory _ _ O
of _ _ O
Jappy's _ _ O
wings _ _ O
a _ _ O
lasting _ _ O
one. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Afzelius _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
native _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Philippines _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
graduate _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
academy _ _ O
in _ _ O
Manila, _ _ O
which _ _ O
shipped _ _ O
him _ _ O
off _ _ O
to _ _ O
Paris _ _ O
to _ _ O
intern _ _ O
in _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
Alain _ _ O
Ducasse's _ _ O
bistros. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Ducasse _ _ O
masterminds _ _ O
then _ _ O
sent _ _ O
him _ _ O
to _ _ O
work _ _ O
at _ _ O
Benoit _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ O
York, _ _ O
after _ _ O
which _ _ O
he _ _ O
turned _ _ O
up _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
sous-chef _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
Filipino _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
Brooklyn _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
best _ _ O
known _ _ O
for _ _ O
its _ _ O
$100 _ _ O
doughnut _ _ O
-- _ _ O
ube-filled, _ _ O
Cristal-frosted _ _ O
and _ _ O
gold-leafed. _ _ O
Happily, _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
at _ _ O
Tsismis _ _ O
approaches _ _ O
that _ _ O
level _ _ O
of _ _ O
look-at-me _ _ O
desperation. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Afzelius's _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
is _ _ O
loose, _ _ O
unfussy _ _ O
and _ _ O
liberated. _ _ O
He _ _ O
tosses _ _ O
tradition _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
bus _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
suits _ _ O
him. _ _ O
The _ _ O
result _ _ O
is _ _ O
Filipino-American _ _ O
drinking _ _ O
food _ _ O
that _ _ O
tends _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
charmingly _ _ O
offhand. _ _ O
From _ _ O
time _ _ O
to _ _ O
time, _ _ O
it _ _ O
can _ _ O
lean _ _ O
toward _ _ O
sloppiness. _ _ O
One _ _ O
night _ _ O
the _ _ O
fried _ _ O
milkfish _ _ O
in _ _ O
pritong _ _ O
isda _ _ O
was _ _ O
so _ _ O
overdone _ _ O
that _ _ O
even _ _ O
topping _ _ O
it _ _ O
with _ _ O
calamansi _ _ O
juice, _ _ O
fish _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
crisp, _ _ O
juicy _ _ O
spoonful _ _ O
of _ _ O
marinated _ _ O
chayote _ _ O
on _ _ O
top _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
revive _ _ O
it. _ _ O
A _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
adobong _ _ O
manok, _ _ O
which _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Afzelius _ _ O
makes _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
plus _ _ O
a _ _ O
soy-turmeric _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
rather _ _ O
than _ _ O
an _ _ O
all-in-one _ _ O
stew, _ _ O
would _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
more _ _ O
successful _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
smoked _ _ O
eggplant _ _ O
hadn't _ _ O
been _ _ O
so _ _ O
undercooked _ _ O
it _ _ O
squeaked. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
eggplant _ _ O
on _ _ O
top _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
kare-kare _ _ O
was _ _ O
as _ _ O
soft _ _ O
as _ _ O
warm _ _ O
marrow, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
vegetables _ _ O
-- _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
green _ _ O
beans, _ _ O
bok _ _ O
choy, _ _ O
enoki _ _ O
mushrooms _ _ O
-- _ _ O
made _ _ O
a _ _ O
refreshing _ _ O
counterpoint _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
stewed _ _ O
oxtails _ _ O
in _ _ O
thick _ _ O
peanut _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
Already _ _ O
pungent _ _ O
with _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
paste, _ _ O
the _ _ O
kare-kare _ _ O
comes _ _ O
with _ _ O
extra _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
side _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
add _ _ O
to _ _ O
your _ _ O
heart's _ _ O
content. _ _ O
As _ _ O
they _ _ O
do _ _ O
at _ _ O
Bad _ _ O
Saint _ _ O
in _ _ O
Washington, _ _ O
probably _ _ O
the _ _ O
country's _ _ O
most _ _ O
talked-about _ _ O
Filipino _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
Tsismis _ _ O
makes _ _ O
its _ _ O
laing _ _ O
by _ _ O
simmering _ _ O
local _ _ O
kale, _ _ O
rather _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
more _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
taro _ _ O
leaves, _ _ O
in _ _ O
coconut _ _ O
milk. _ _ O
And _ _ O
if _ _ O
this _ _ O
version _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
have _ _ O
the _ _ O
perspective-altering _ _ O
funk _ _ O
of _ _ O
Bad _ _ O
Saint's, _ _ O
it _ _ O
still _ _ O
draws _ _ O
plenty _ _ O
of _ _ O
depth _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
paste _ _ O
and _ _ O
smoked _ _ O
fish _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
milk _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
big _ _ O
handful _ _ O
of _ _ O
dried _ _ O
baby _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
dropped _ _ O
on _ _ O
top. _ _ O
By _ _ O
this _ _ O
point, _ _ O
you _ _ O
will _ _ O
probably _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
glass _ _ O
in _ _ O
your _ _ O
hand. _ _ O
Housemade _ _ O
calamansi _ _ O
soda _ _ O
sounds _ _ O
lovely, _ _ O
but _ _ O
mine _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
flat _ _ O
and _ _ O
weak. _ _ O
In _ _ O
lieu _ _ O
of _ _ O
hard _ _ O
spirits, _ _ O
sake _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
backbone _ _ O
of _ _ O
most _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
cocktails. _ _ O
They _ _ O
are _ _ O
typically _ _ O
fleshed _ _ O
out _ _ O
with _ _ O
half _ _ O
a _ _ O
dozen _ _ O
other _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
-- _ _ O
vermouth, _ _ O
Aperol, _ _ O
artichoke _ _ O
liqueur _ _ O
and _ _ O
bitters, _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
case _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
A _ _ O
La _ _ O
Bira _ _ O
-- _ _ O
which _ _ O
sound _ _ O
at _ _ O
first _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
they _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
assembled _ _ O
by _ _ O
walking _ _ O
through _ _ O
a _ _ O
liquor _ _ O
store _ _ O
blindfolded, _ _ O
but _ _ O
which _ _ O
after _ _ O
a _ _ O
closer _ _ O
look _ _ O
reveal _ _ O
a _ _ O
degree _ _ O
of _ _ O
inner _ _ O
logic. _ _ O
If _ _ O
this _ _ O
does _ _ O
not _ _ O
pique _ _ O
your _ _ O
curiosity, _ _ O
the _ _ O
list _ _ O
of _ _ O
wines _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
glass _ _ O
is _ _ O
almost _ _ O
long _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
qualify _ _ O
Tsismis _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
wine _ _ O
bar, _ _ O
although _ _ O
the _ _ O
choices _ _ O
are _ _ O
not _ _ O
as _ _ O
outré _ _ O
as _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
across _ _ O
the _ _ O
street _ _ O
at _ _ O
Wildair _ _ O
. _ _ O
In _ _ O
a _ _ O
city _ _ O
crazy _ _ O
for _ _ O
kakigori _ _ O
, _ _ O
patbingsu _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
varieties _ _ O
of _ _ O
flavored _ _ O
snow, _ _ O
Tsismis's _ _ O
halo-halo _ _ O
will _ _ O
probably _ _ O
be _ _ O
an _ _ O
instant _ _ O
hit. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Afzelius _ _ O
has _ _ O
the _ _ O
very _ _ O
good _ _ O
idea _ _ O
of _ _ O
putting _ _ O
coconut _ _ O
sorbet _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
shaved _ _ O
ice _ _ O
would _ _ O
usually _ _ O
go; _ _ O
from _ _ O
there _ _ O
he _ _ O
goes _ _ O
to _ _ O
town _ _ O
with _ _ O
coconut _ _ O
jellies _ _ O
and _ _ O
what _ _ O
seems _ _ O
like _ _ O
every _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
fruit _ _ O
he _ _ O
can _ _ O
put _ _ O
his _ _ O
hands _ _ O
on. _ _ O
But _ _ O
discerning _ _ O
collectors _ _ O
of _ _ O
Filipino _ _ O
sweets _ _ O
should _ _ O
note _ _ O
that _ _ O
Tsismis _ _ O
serves _ _ O
excellent _ _ O
silvanas. _ _ O
A _ _ O
silvana _ _ O
is _ _ O
either _ _ O
a _ _ O
shrunken _ _ O
cake _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
cookie _ _ O
with _ _ O
big _ _ O
ideas, _ _ O
depending _ _ O
on _ _ O
your _ _ O
perspective. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
made _ _ O
of _ _ O
two _ _ O
cashew _ _ O
meringues _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
sandwiched _ _ O
together _ _ O
with _ _ O
buttercream _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
painted _ _ O
with _ _ O
more _ _ O
buttercream, _ _ O
which _ _ O
holds _ _ O
cashew _ _ O
crumbs _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
outside _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole _ _ O
package. _ _ O
Once _ _ O
frosted _ _ O
and _ _ O
crumbed, _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
refrigerated _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
buttercream _ _ O
will _ _ O
melt _ _ O
before _ _ O
it _ _ O
gets _ _ O
inside _ _ O
your _ _ O
mouth. _ _ O
No _ _ O
gold _ _ O
leaf _ _ O
adorns _ _ O
the _ _ O
silvanas. _ _ O
It _ _ O
would _ _ O
only _ _ O
get _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
way. _ _ O

Last _ _ O
month _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
friend _ _ O
who _ _ O
lives _ _ O
a _ _ O
thousand _ _ O
miles _ _ O
away _ _ O
and _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
get _ _ O
to _ _ O
Manhattan _ _ B-LOC
as _ _ O
often _ _ O
as _ _ O
he _ _ O
once _ _ O
did. _ _ O
When _ _ O
I _ _ O
asked _ _ O
where _ _ O
he _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat, _ _ O
he _ _ O
answered, _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
wistfully, _ _ O
"Somewhere _ _ O
that _ _ O
speaks _ _ O
of _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York, _ _ I-LOC
a _ _ O
city _ _ O
I _ _ O
have _ _ O
lost _ _ O
touch _ _ O
with." _ _ O
At _ _ O
first, _ _ O
I _ _ O
looked _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
place _ _ O
where _ _ O
we _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
thick _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
all. _ _ O
I _ _ O
thought _ _ O
of _ _ O
Bar _ _ B-EST
Pisellino _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
that _ _ O
narrow _ _ O
glass _ _ O
sarcophagus _ _ O
run _ _ O
by _ _ O
Rita _ _ O
Sodi _ _ O
and _ _ O
Jody _ _ O
Williams, _ _ O
where _ _ O
you _ _ O
drink _ _ O
your _ _ O
sgroppino _ _ B-FOOD
standing _ _ O
up _ _ O
between _ _ O
the _ _ O
window _ _ O
along _ _ O
Grove _ _ B-LOC
Street _ _ I-LOC
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
along _ _ O
Seventh _ _ B-LOC
Avenue. _ _ I-LOC
People _ _ O
trickle _ _ O
in, _ _ O
eat _ _ O
some _ _ O
olives _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
tuna _ _ B-DISH
tramezzino, _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
head _ _ O
out _ _ O
again. _ _ O
Although _ _ O
it's _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
subway _ _ O
car, _ _ O
you _ _ O
get _ _ O
the _ _ O
feeling _ _ O
that _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
stayed _ _ O
long _ _ O
enough, _ _ O
you'd _ _ O
eventually _ _ O
see _ _ O
everybody _ _ O
you _ _ O
know. _ _ O
But _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
truly _ _ O
speaks _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
place _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
has _ _ O
become _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
decade _ _ O
or _ _ O
so _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
the _ _ O
opposite _ _ O
of _ _ O
Bar _ _ B-EST
Pisellino. _ _ I-EST
This _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
would _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
thick _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
all. _ _ O
It _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
hushed, _ _ O
sheltered, _ _ O
exclusive, _ _ O
admitting _ _ O
no _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
handful _ _ O
of _ _ O
people _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
time. _ _ O
It _ _ O
would _ _ O
protect _ _ O
those _ _ O
people, _ _ O
once _ _ O
they _ _ O
were _ _ O
inside, _ _ O
from _ _ O
crowds _ _ O
spilling _ _ O
in _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
street, _ _ O
even _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
street _ _ O
itself. _ _ O
It _ _ O
would _ _ O
join _ _ O
the _ _ O
steady _ _ O
march _ _ O
of _ _ O
new _ _ O
tasting _ _ B-TYPE
counters _ _ I-TYPE
and _ _ O
omakase _ _ B-TYPE
hideaways. _ _ I-TYPE
And _ _ O
it _ _ O
would _ _ O
illustrate _ _ O
the _ _ O
growing _ _ O
ease _ _ O
with _ _ O
which _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
of _ _ O
means _ _ O
can _ _ O
glide _ _ O
through _ _ O
and _ _ O
above _ _ O
the _ _ O
fray, _ _ O
slipping _ _ O
from _ _ O
one _ _ O
cloistered _ _ O
room _ _ O
to _ _ O
another _ _ O
in _ _ O
black _ _ O
cars _ _ O
without _ _ O
touching _ _ O
down. _ _ O
That _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
like _ _ O
Frevo _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
which _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
serving _ _ O
suave, _ _ O
$124 _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
menus _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
modern-French _ _ B-CUISINE
sensibility _ _ O
in _ _ O
Greenwich _ _ B-LOC
Village _ _ I-LOC
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
four _ _ O
months. _ _ O
Frevo _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
work _ _ O
of _ _ O
Franco _ _ O
Sampogna, _ _ O
who _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
and _ _ O
Bernardo _ _ O
Silva, _ _ O
the _ _ O
manager. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Sampogna _ _ O
is _ _ O
from _ _ O
Brazil _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Silva _ _ O
comes _ _ O
from _ _ O
Portugal; _ _ B-LOC
they _ _ O
met _ _ O
10 _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago _ _ O
while _ _ O
working _ _ O
in _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
in _ _ O
France, _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
quickly _ _ O
decided _ _ O
that _ _ O
one _ _ O
day _ _ O
they _ _ O
would _ _ O
open _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
City _ _ I-LOC
that _ _ O
would _ _ O
give _ _ O
diners _ _ O
"that _ _ O
feeling _ _ O
of _ _ O
being _ _ O
in _ _ O
your _ _ O
own _ _ O
secluded _ _ O
safe _ _ O
haven," _ _ O
as _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Sampogna _ _ O
put _ _ O
it. _ _ O
To _ _ O
get _ _ O
into _ _ O
Frevo, _ _ B-EST
you _ _ O
first _ _ O
need _ _ O
to _ _ O
know _ _ O
that _ _ O
Frevo _ _ B-EST
exists. _ _ O
There's _ _ O
no _ _ O
sign. _ _ O
When _ _ O
you _ _ O
arrive _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
correct _ _ O
address, _ _ O
what _ _ O
you _ _ O
see _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
art _ _ O
gallery _ _ O
with _ _ O
just _ _ O
enough _ _ O
room _ _ O
on _ _ O
its _ _ O
white _ _ O
walls _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
six _ _ O
abstract _ _ O
paintings _ _ O
that _ _ O
hang _ _ O
there _ _ O
fairly _ _ O
close _ _ O
together. _ _ O
The _ _ O
paintings _ _ O
are _ _ O
real _ _ O
paintings _ _ O
made _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
real _ _ O
artist, _ _ O
Thomas _ _ O
Labarthe, _ _ O
who _ _ O
goes _ _ O
by _ _ O
Toma-L _ _ O
, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
gallery _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
entirely _ _ O
a _ _ O
real _ _ O
gallery. _ _ O
If _ _ O
it _ _ O
were, _ _ O
the _ _ O
young _ _ O
woman _ _ O
who _ _ O
sits _ _ O
there _ _ O
keeping _ _ O
an _ _ O
eye _ _ O
on _ _ O
things _ _ O
would _ _ O
stare _ _ O
blankly _ _ O
ahead _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
entered, _ _ O
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
walking _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
you _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
smile _ _ O
and _ _ O
reassuring _ _ O
you _ _ O
that, _ _ O
yes, _ _ O
you've _ _ O
come _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
right _ _ O
place. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
she _ _ O
reaches _ _ O
behind _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
canvases _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
swings _ _ O
out _ _ O
on _ _ O
invisible _ _ O
hinges, _ _ O
leaving _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
place _ _ O
a _ _ O
doorway _ _ O
through _ _ O
which _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
see, _ _ O
illuminated _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
large, _ _ O
dark _ _ O
room, _ _ O
a _ _ O
stainless-steel _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
long, _ _ O
curving _ _ O
counter _ _ O
of _ _ O
polished _ _ O
quartzite. _ _ O
You _ _ O
hop _ _ O
up _ _ O
on _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
18 _ _ O
padded _ _ O
seats, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
door _ _ O
clicks _ _ O
closed. _ _ O
You _ _ O
are _ _ O
in. _ _ O
When _ _ O
the _ _ O
door _ _ O
opens _ _ O
again, _ _ O
typically _ _ O
not _ _ O
for _ _ O
another _ _ O
half _ _ O
an _ _ O
hour, _ _ O
in _ _ O
will _ _ O
walk _ _ O
another _ _ O
set _ _ O
of _ _ O
people _ _ O
who, _ _ O
like _ _ O
you, _ _ O
knew _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
gallery _ _ O
was _ _ O
not _ _ O
a _ _ O
normal _ _ O
gallery. _ _ O
Let's _ _ O
say _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
misdirection _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
gallery _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
secret _ _ O
door _ _ O
do _ _ O
not _ _ O
make _ _ O
these _ _ O
newcomers _ _ O
feel _ _ O
sufficiently _ _ O
insulated _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
outside _ _ O
world. _ _ O
Frevo _ _ B-EST
gives _ _ O
them _ _ O
the _ _ O
opportunity _ _ O
to _ _ O
sit _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
round _ _ O
chef's _ _ O
table _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
back _ _ O
corner _ _ O
around _ _ O
which _ _ O
a _ _ O
curtain _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
drawn, _ _ O
as _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
hospital _ _ O
room. _ _ O
Much _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
comes _ _ O
right _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
neo-speakeasy _ _ B-TYPE
handbook, _ _ O
although _ _ O
Frevo _ _ B-EST
does _ _ O
throw _ _ O
itself _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
act _ _ O
with _ _ O
an _ _ O
unusual _ _ O
level _ _ O
of _ _ O
commitment. _ _ O
The _ _ O
gallery, _ _ O
for _ _ O
instance, _ _ O
installed _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
batch _ _ O
of _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Labarthe's _ _ O
canvases _ _ O
around _ _ O
Labor _ _ O
Day. _ _ O
But _ _ O
each _ _ O
time _ _ O
I _ _ O
went _ _ O
to _ _ O
Frevo, _ _ B-EST
I _ _ O
stared _ _ O
at _ _ O
that _ _ O
curtain. _ _ O
Nobody _ _ O
ever _ _ O
closed _ _ O
it _ _ O
while _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
there, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
still _ _ O
reminded _ _ O
me _ _ O
how _ _ O
easy _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
now _ _ O
for _ _ O
some _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
to _ _ O
climb _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
treehouse _ _ O
and _ _ O
pull _ _ O
the _ _ O
ladder _ _ O
up _ _ O
behind _ _ O
them. _ _ O
I _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
admit, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
like _ _ O
Frevo _ _ B-EST
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
I _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
brings _ _ O
to _ _ O
mind. _ _ O
The _ _ O
pleasures _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
secluded _ _ O
safe _ _ O
haven _ _ O
are _ _ O
real, _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Sampogna's _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
is _ _ O
focused _ _ O
and _ _ O
refined. _ _ O
I _ _ O
haven't _ _ O
been _ _ O
able _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
his _ _ O
halibut _ _ B-DISH
dish _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
my _ _ O
mind, _ _ O
for _ _ O
instance. _ _ O
The _ _ O
fish _ _ B-FOOD
rests _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
thin, _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
platform _ _ O
of _ _ O
fried _ _ B-FOOD
bread _ _ I-FOOD
shellacked _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark _ _ O
mushroom _ _ B-FOOD
marmalade; _ _ I-FOOD
this _ _ O
miniature _ _ O
mushroom _ _ O
tart _ _ O
drinks _ _ O
up _ _ O
the _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
halibut _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
goes, _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
oven, _ _ O
from _ _ O
raw _ _ O
to _ _ O
that _ _ O
just-cooked _ _ O
state _ _ O
where _ _ O
its _ _ O
flesh _ _ O
slides _ _ O
apart _ _ O
into _ _ O
thick _ _ O
and _ _ O
almost _ _ O
fluffy _ _ O
white _ _ O
flakes. _ _ O
Alongside _ _ O
the _ _ O
fish _ _ O
are _ _ O
bulbs _ _ O
of _ _ O
melted _ _ O
fennel, _ _ O
their _ _ O
spiced _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
juices _ _ O
boiled _ _ O
down _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
bittersweet _ _ O
syrup. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Sampogna's _ _ O
opening _ _ O
salvo _ _ O
often _ _ O
involves _ _ O
quinoa _ _ O
doing _ _ O
something _ _ O
quinoa _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
usually _ _ O
do, _ _ O
and _ _ O
doing _ _ O
it _ _ O
quite _ _ O
nicely. _ _ O
I _ _ O
liked _ _ O
its _ _ O
freshness _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
used _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
salad _ _ O
spooned _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
demitasse _ _ O
of _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
hummus; _ _ O
I _ _ O
liked _ _ O
its _ _ O
crunch _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
dehydrated _ _ O
and _ _ O
sprinkled _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
mouthfuls _ _ O
of _ _ O
black _ _ O
lentils _ _ O
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
glistening _ _ O
orbs _ _ O
of _ _ O
smoked _ _ O
trout _ _ O
roe. _ _ O
A _ _ O
dish _ _ O
from _ _ O
early _ _ O
July _ _ O
brought _ _ O
peas, _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
tail _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
their _ _ O
season, _ _ O
together _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
rich _ _ O
pistachio-tarragon _ _ O
cream _ _ O
and _ _ O
white _ _ O
puffs _ _ O
of _ _ O
coconut _ _ O
mousse: _ _ O
light _ _ O
and _ _ O
charming. _ _ O
I _ _ O
wished _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Sampogna _ _ O
had _ _ O
exploited _ _ O
summer _ _ O
produce _ _ O
as _ _ O
sensitively _ _ O
when _ _ O
I _ _ O
went _ _ O
back _ _ O
in _ _ O
August _ _ O
and _ _ O
September. _ _ O
His _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
is _ _ O
small _ _ O
enough _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
could _ _ O
respond _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
market _ _ O
day _ _ O
by _ _ O
day, _ _ O
but _ _ O
so _ _ O
far _ _ O
this _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
interest _ _ O
him. _ _ O
Frevo, _ _ O
at _ _ O
$124 _ _ O
for _ _ O
five _ _ O
courses, _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
a _ _ O
huge _ _ O
splurge _ _ O
by _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
standards, _ _ O
but _ _ O
servers _ _ O
try _ _ O
to _ _ O
inflate _ _ O
the _ _ O
total _ _ O
by _ _ O
pushing _ _ O
supplements. _ _ O
For _ _ O
$30 _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
get _ _ O
Kaluga _ _ O
caviar _ _ O
troweled _ _ O
on _ _ O
to _ _ O
your _ _ O
first _ _ O
course; _ _ O
$20 _ _ O
gets _ _ O
you _ _ O
upgraded _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
foie _ _ O
gras _ _ O
torchon _ _ O
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
less-thrilling _ _ O
mushrooms _ _ O
with _ _ O
gnocchi; _ _ O
it's _ _ O
$18 _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
serving _ _ O
of _ _ O
aged _ _ O
Comté _ _ O
before _ _ O
dessert, _ _ O
and _ _ O
another _ _ O
$30 _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
white _ _ O
truffles _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
cheese. _ _ O
This _ _ O
tactic _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
as _ _ O
grating _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
at _ _ O
Per _ _ O
Se _ _ O
, _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
supplements _ _ O
are _ _ O
piled _ _ O
onto _ _ O
a _ _ O
base _ _ O
charge _ _ O
of _ _ O
$355, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
a _ _ O
snag _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
otherwise _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
hospitality _ _ O
provided _ _ O
by _ _ O
Frevo's _ _ O
small _ _ O
crew _ _ O
of _ _ O
servers _ _ O
and _ _ O
cooks. _ _ O
Everyone _ _ O
I've _ _ O
brought _ _ O
to _ _ O
Frevo _ _ O
has _ _ O
fallen _ _ O
under _ _ O
its _ _ O
spell, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
resist. _ _ O
The _ _ O
music _ _ O
is _ _ O
slinky _ _ O
and _ _ O
sinuous. _ _ O
The _ _ O
room _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
nocturnal _ _ O
theatricality; _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
counter _ _ O
with _ _ O
darkness _ _ O
behind _ _ O
you _ _ O
facing _ _ O
the _ _ O
spotlighted _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
can _ _ O
feel _ _ O
like _ _ O
attending _ _ O
an _ _ O
extremely _ _ O
elegant _ _ O
campfire. _ _ O
I _ _ O
still _ _ O
think _ _ O
Frevo _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
perfect _ _ O
spot _ _ O
to _ _ O
familiarize _ _ O
yourself _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
frictionless _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
of _ _ O
2019. _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
when _ _ O
my _ _ O
out-of-town _ _ O
friend _ _ O
arrived, _ _ O
we _ _ O
had _ _ O
our _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
at _ _ O
Bar _ _ O
Pisellino. _ _ O
We _ _ O
were _ _ O
hungry _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
taste _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
old _ _ O
chaos. _ _ O

Billy _ _ O
Durney, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Brooklyn _ _ B-LOC
restaurateur _ _ O
and _ _ O
pitmaster, _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
talking _ _ O
for _ _ O
several _ _ O
years _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
fried _ _ B-FOOD
chicken _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
planned _ _ O
to _ _ O
bring _ _ O
to _ _ O
Red _ _ B-EST
Hook. _ _ I-EST
At _ _ O
first, _ _ O
there _ _ O
was _ _ O
no _ _ O
reason _ _ O
to _ _ O
doubt _ _ O
him. _ _ O
That _ _ O
the _ _ O
man _ _ O
is _ _ O
comfortable _ _ O
with _ _ O
long _ _ O
time _ _ O
horizons _ _ O
was _ _ O
clear _ _ O
to _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
who _ _ O
watched _ _ O
how _ _ O
patiently _ _ O
he _ _ O
studied _ _ O
the _ _ O
science _ _ O
of _ _ O
indirect _ _ O
heat _ _ O
at _ _ O
his _ _ O
first _ _ O
establishment _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
neighborhood, _ _ O
Hometown _ _ B-EST
Bar-B-Que _ _ I-EST
. _ _ O
After _ _ O
Hurricane _ _ O
Sandy _ _ O
flooded _ _ O
streets _ _ O
and _ _ O
knocked _ _ O
out _ _ O
power _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
area _ _ O
shortly _ _ O
before _ _ O
the _ _ O
scheduled _ _ O
opening _ _ O
in _ _ O
2012, _ _ O
he _ _ O
gave _ _ O
away _ _ O
smoked _ _ B-FOOD
briskets, _ _ I-FOOD
ribs _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
shoulders _ _ B-FOOD
to _ _ O
local _ _ O
residents _ _ O
until _ _ O
electricity _ _ O
was _ _ O
restored _ _ O
almost _ _ O
three _ _ O
weeks _ _ O
later, _ _ O
honing _ _ O
his _ _ O
technique _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
while. _ _ O
The _ _ O
years _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
by _ _ O
without _ _ O
a _ _ O
drumstick _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
sight. _ _ O
But _ _ O
as _ _ O
recently _ _ O
as _ _ O
March, _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
still _ _ O
possible _ _ O
to _ _ O
take _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Durney _ _ O
at _ _ O
his _ _ O
word _ _ O
when _ _ O
he _ _ O
talked _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
star _ _ O
attraction _ _ O
of _ _ O
his _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
completed _ _ O
fried-chicken _ _ B-FOOD
emporium _ _ B-TYPE
, _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
called _ _ O
Red _ _ B-EST
Hook _ _ I-EST
Tavern. _ _ I-EST
The _ _ O
doors _ _ O
were _ _ O
finally _ _ O
unlocked _ _ O
in _ _ O
July, _ _ O
revealing _ _ O
a _ _ O
row _ _ O
of _ _ O
tables _ _ O
under _ _ O
electrified _ _ O
gas _ _ O
lamps _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
row _ _ O
of _ _ O
stools _ _ O
in _ _ O
front _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
white-oak _ _ O
bar _ _ O
that _ _ O
looks _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
built _ _ O
to _ _ O
last _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
until _ _ O
Van _ _ B-LOC
Brunt _ _ I-LOC
Street _ _ I-LOC
sinks _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
sea. _ _ O
Wearing _ _ O
wallpaper _ _ O
and _ _ O
wainscoting _ _ O
and _ _ O
pressed _ _ O
tin, _ _ O
Red _ _ B-EST
Hook _ _ I-EST
Tavern _ _ I-EST
does _ _ O
a _ _ O
straight-faced _ _ O
impression _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
whiskey-simmered _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
corner _ _ B-TYPE
bar _ _ I-TYPE
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
certain _ _ O
age. _ _ O
The _ _ O
attention _ _ O
to _ _ O
detail _ _ O
was _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
expected, _ _ O
given _ _ O
how _ _ O
convincingly _ _ O
Hometown _ _ B-EST
conjures _ _ O
a _ _ O
Texas _ _ B-LOC
Hill _ _ I-LOC
Country _ _ I-LOC
barbecue _ _ B-FOOD
palace. _ _ O
What _ _ O
was _ _ O
something _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
surprise, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
was _ _ O
that _ _ O
chickens _ _ O
were _ _ O
not _ _ O
being _ _ O
fried _ _ O
anywhere _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
premises. _ _ O
In _ _ O
fact, _ _ O
Red _ _ B-EST
Hook _ _ I-EST
Tavern's _ _ I-EST
star _ _ O
attraction _ _ O
turned _ _ O
out _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
cheeseburger. _ _ B-DISH
To _ _ O
be _ _ O
fair, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Durney _ _ O
probably _ _ O
would _ _ O
not _ _ O
have _ _ O
drummed _ _ O
up _ _ O
much _ _ O
enthusiasm _ _ O
had _ _ O
he _ _ O
gone _ _ O
around _ _ O
telling _ _ O
people _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
open _ _ O
a _ _ O
bar _ _ B-TYPE
that _ _ O
served _ _ O
hamburgers. _ _ B-FOOD
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
has _ _ O
so _ _ O
many _ _ O
of _ _ O
those _ _ O
already _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
style _ _ O
they _ _ O
typically _ _ O
serve _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
recognized _ _ O
subgenre _ _ O
that _ _ O
George _ _ O
Motz _ _ O
calls _ _ O
"the _ _ B-DISH
New _ _ I-DISH
York _ _ I-DISH
City _ _ I-DISH
pub _ _ I-DISH
burger." _ _ I-DISH
According _ _ O
to _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Motz, _ _ O
a _ _ O
filmmaker _ _ O
and _ _ O
author _ _ O
whose _ _ O
work _ _ O
explores _ _ O
all _ _ O
things _ _ O
ground-beef-and-bun-related, _ _ O
the _ _ O
hallmarks _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
pub _ _ O
burger _ _ O
are _ _ O
a _ _ O
thicker-than-average _ _ O
patty _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
relative _ _ O
lack _ _ O
of _ _ O
adornment. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
plain, _ _ O
sturdy _ _ O
and _ _ O
hunger-calming _ _ O
burger _ _ O
you _ _ O
get _ _ O
at _ _ O
P.J. _ _ O

in _ _ O

and _ _ O
at _ _ O
Donovan's _ _ O
Pub _ _ O
in _ _ O
Queens. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Durney _ _ O
has _ _ O
said _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
intends _ _ O
the _ _ O
Red _ _ O
Hook _ _ O

burger _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
homage _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
at _ _ O

. _ _ O
(You _ _ O
might _ _ O
think _ _ O
that _ _ O

traffics _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O

known _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O

but _ _ O
most _ _ O
burger _ _ O
taxonomists _ _ O
agree _ _ O
that _ _ O
what _ _ O
it _ _ O
serves, _ _ O
only _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
bar _ _ O
and _ _ O
only _ _ O
at _ _ O
lunch, _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
pub _ _ O
burger.) _ _ O
Like _ _ O
Peter _ _ O
Luger, _ _ O
Red _ _ O
Hook _ _ O
Tavern _ _ O
employs _ _ O
a _ _ O
toasted _ _ O
and _ _ O
buttered _ _ O
hard _ _ O
roll _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
smattering _ _ O
of _ _ O
sesame _ _ O
seeds _ _ O
-- _ _ O
about _ _ O
as _ _ O
many _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
stars _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
see _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
sky _ _ O
over _ _ O
Manhattan _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
very _ _ O
clear _ _ O
night. _ _ O
In _ _ O
both _ _ O
places, _ _ O
the _ _ O
patties _ _ O
are _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
some _ _ O
portion _ _ O
of _ _ O
dry-aged _ _ O
prime _ _ O
beef, _ _ O
stand _ _ O
about _ _ O
an _ _ O
inch _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
half _ _ O
tall, _ _ O
and _ _ O
possess _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark _ _ O
crust _ _ O
that _ _ O
fills _ _ O
your _ _ O
head _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
instinct-triggering _ _ O
aromas _ _ O
and _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
whose _ _ O
creation _ _ O
in _ _ O
browned _ _ O
meat _ _ O
was _ _ O
described _ _ O
by _ _ O
Louis _ _ O
Camille _ _ O
Maillard _ _ O
. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
some _ _ O
minor _ _ O
divergences. _ _ O
At _ _ O
Peter _ _ O
Luger, _ _ O
cheese _ _ O
is _ _ O
optional, _ _ O
while _ _ O
the _ _ O
top _ _ O
and _ _ O
sides _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
burger _ _ O
at _ _ O
Red _ _ O
Hook _ _ O
Tavern _ _ O
are _ _ O
tightly _ _ O
wrapped _ _ O
in _ _ O
glossy _ _ O
yellow _ _ O
American _ _ O
cheese _ _ O
by _ _ O
default. _ _ O
A _ _ O
thick _ _ O
cross-section _ _ O
of _ _ O
white _ _ O
onion _ _ O
is _ _ O
laid _ _ O
below _ _ O
the _ _ O
top _ _ O
bun _ _ O
at _ _ O
Luger. _ _ O
At _ _ O
Red _ _ O
Hook _ _ O
Tavern, _ _ O
the _ _ O
onion _ _ O
is _ _ O
stationed _ _ O
below _ _ O
the _ _ O
patty, _ _ O
where _ _ O
it _ _ O
helps _ _ O
keep _ _ O
the _ _ O
bottom _ _ O
bun _ _ O
dry, _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
coaster. _ _ O
They _ _ O
give _ _ O
you _ _ O
a _ _ O
half-sour _ _ O
pickle _ _ O
spear _ _ O
and _ _ O
fries, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
which _ _ O
are _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
dimensions. _ _ O
The _ _ O
important _ _ O
difference _ _ O
between _ _ O
the _ _ O
burgers, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
lately _ _ O
Peter _ _ O
Luger's _ _ O
have _ _ O
tended _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
better _ _ O
in _ _ O
memory _ _ O
than _ _ O
in _ _ O
reality, _ _ O
while _ _ O
the _ _ O
Red _ _ O
Hook _ _ O
Tavern's _ _ O
is, _ _ O
right _ _ O
now, _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
few _ _ O
absolutely _ _ O
mandatory _ _ O
burgers _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
City. _ _ O
The _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
is _ _ O
overseen _ _ O
by _ _ O
Allison _ _ O
Plumer, _ _ O
a _ _ O
chef _ _ O
who _ _ O
has _ _ O
done _ _ O
most _ _ O
of _ _ O
her _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
in _ _ O
Brooklyn. _ _ O
She _ _ O
has _ _ O
an _ _ O
excellent _ _ O
dry-aged _ _ O
steak _ _ O
-- _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
strip, _ _ O
naturally _ _ O
-- _ _ O
impressively _ _ O
browned _ _ O
and _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
cast-iron _ _ O
skillet _ _ O
full _ _ O
of _ _ O
creamed _ _ O
spinach, _ _ O
a _ _ O
touch _ _ O
so _ _ O
right _ _ O
it _ _ O
may _ _ O
qualify _ _ O
as _ _ O
art. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
detail _ _ O
that _ _ O
makes _ _ O
Red _ _ O
Hook _ _ O
Tavern _ _ O
something _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
place _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
locals _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
beer _ _ O
and _ _ O
burgers. _ _ O
Another _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
golden _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
gravy _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
hint _ _ O
of _ _ O
butterscotch _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
ladled _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
well _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
mashed _ _ O
potatoes _ _ O
that _ _ O
come _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
half-chicken, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
advertised _ _ O
as _ _ O
simply _ _ O
pan-roasted, _ _ O
although _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
the _ _ O
wonderfully _ _ O
stiff _ _ O
shards _ _ O
of _ _ O
skin _ _ O
you _ _ O
get _ _ O
from _ _ O
weighting _ _ O
down _ _ O
the _ _ O
bird _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
cooks. _ _ O
Everybody _ _ O
who _ _ O
has _ _ O
eaten _ _ O
at _ _ O
Red _ _ O
Hook _ _ O
Tavern _ _ O
will _ _ O
tell _ _ O
you _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
the _ _ O
country-ham-and-Cheddar _ _ O
croquettes _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
pool _ _ O
of _ _ O
whole-grain _ _ O
Dijonnaise. _ _ O
Everybody _ _ O
is _ _ O
right, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
Consensus _ _ O
has _ _ O
also _ _ O
formed _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
wedge _ _ O
salad, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
clearly _ _ O
not _ _ O
a _ _ O
wedge, _ _ O
but _ _ O
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
a _ _ O
very _ _ O
fine _ _ O
salad, _ _ O
with _ _ O
blue _ _ O
cheese _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
thick, _ _ O
Lugeresque _ _ O
bacon _ _ O
slice _ _ O
flopped _ _ O
over _ _ O
individual _ _ O
leaves _ _ O
of _ _ O
romaine. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
considerably _ _ O
less _ _ O
unanimity _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
corn, _ _ O
kernels _ _ O
of _ _ O
which _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
supposed _ _ O
to _ _ O
wrap _ _ O
in _ _ O
radicchio _ _ O
that _ _ O
you've _ _ O
first _ _ O
smeared _ _ O
with _ _ O
'nduja; _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
camp _ _ O
that _ _ O
thinks _ _ O
it _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
fine _ _ O
dish _ _ O
for _ _ O
another _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
where _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
be _ _ O
glad _ _ O
to _ _ O
see _ _ O
littlenecks _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
with _ _ O
way _ _ O
too _ _ O
much _ _ O
stale, _ _ O
acrid _ _ O
garlic. _ _ O
Of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
there's _ _ O
no _ _ O
correct _ _ O
amount _ _ O
of _ _ O
stale, _ _ O
acrid _ _ O
garlic, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
really _ _ O
goes _ _ O
all _ _ O
in. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
two _ _ O
desserts. _ _ O
Both _ _ O
are _ _ O
sundaes _ _ O
. _ _ O
They _ _ O
do _ _ O
not _ _ O
have _ _ O
the _ _ O
thematic _ _ O
inevitability _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
creamed _ _ O
spinach, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they're _ _ O
put _ _ O
together _ _ O
with _ _ O
more _ _ O
sophistication _ _ O
than _ _ O
average. _ _ O
The _ _ O
truth _ _ O
is, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
that _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
gives _ _ O
the _ _ O
burger _ _ O
a _ _ O
real _ _ O
run _ _ O
for _ _ O
its _ _ O
money. _ _ O
What _ _ O
does, _ _ O
or _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
equals _ _ O
it _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
reason _ _ O
to _ _ O
reserve _ _ O
a _ _ O
table _ _ O
a _ _ O
couple _ _ O
of _ _ O
weeks _ _ O
in _ _ O
advance, _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
list _ _ O
of _ _ O
drinks _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Durney _ _ O
has _ _ O
put _ _ O
together _ _ O
with _ _ O
Jeff _ _ O
Porter _ _ O
and _ _ O
Kenneth _ _ O
Crum. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Durney's _ _ O
enthusiasm _ _ O
for _ _ O
wines _ _ O
made _ _ O
by _ _ O
small, _ _ O
eccentric _ _ O
producers _ _ O
is _ _ O
on _ _ O
view _ _ O
at _ _ O
Hometown, _ _ O
surely _ _ O
the _ _ O
only _ _ O
place _ _ O
on _ _ O
earth _ _ O
where _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
drink _ _ O
Milan _ _ O
Nasterec's _ _ O
skin-fermented _ _ O
Moravian _ _ O
pinot _ _ O
noir _ _ O
alongside _ _ O
a _ _ O
taco _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
slice _ _ O
of _ _ O
barbecued _ _ O
brisket _ _ O
and, _ _ O
in _ _ O
lieu _ _ O
of _ _ O
salsa, _ _ O
a _ _ O
glowing _ _ O
yellow _ _ O
stripe _ _ O
of _ _ O
queso. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Durney _ _ O
indulges _ _ O
his _ _ O
curiosity _ _ O
more _ _ O
deeply _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
tavern. _ _ O
Ten _ _ O

Champagnes _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O

for _ _ O
under _ _ O

a _ _ O

and _ _ O
there's _ _ O
a _ _ O
$40 _ _ O
sparkling _ _ O
red _ _ O
from _ _ O
Maryland. _ _ O
Darlings _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
nonconformist _ _ O

movement _ _ O
such _ _ O
as _ _ O
Radikon _ _ O
, _ _ O
Marcel _ _ O
Lapierre _ _ O
and _ _ O
Frank _ _ O
Cornelissen _ _ O
are _ _ O
all _ _ O
given _ _ O
the _ _ O
space _ _ O
you'd _ _ O
expect, _ _ O
but _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
also _ _ O
less _ _ O
familiar _ _ O
names _ _ O
like _ _ O
Subject _ _ O

Change _ _ O
, _ _ O
a _ _ O

of _ _ O

low-alcohol _ _ O
zinfandel-syrah _ _ O

and _ _ O

Ruth _ _ O
Reichl _ _ O
wrote _ _ O
in _ _ O
The _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
Times _ _ O
in _ _ O
1998. _ _ O
She _ _ O
gave _ _ O
reasons _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
poor _ _ O
showing, _ _ O
including _ _ O
talented _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
being _ _ O
paid _ _ O
more _ _ O
in _ _ O
Hong _ _ O
Kong _ _ O
and _ _ O
China. _ _ O
That _ _ O
is _ _ O
as _ _ O
true _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
21 _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
but _ _ O
what _ _ O
has _ _ O
changed _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
rise _ _ O
of _ _ O
global _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
groups, _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
disappointing _ _ O
duck _ _ O
specialist _ _ O
DaDong _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
surprisingly _ _ O
solid _ _ O
Hao _ _ O
Noodle _ _ O
outposts _ _ O
and, _ _ O
now, _ _ O
to _ _ O
Hutong. _ _ O
The _ _ O
original _ _ O
Hutong _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
2003 _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
28th _ _ O
floor _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
glass _ _ O
tower _ _ O
overlooking _ _ O
the _ _ O
Hong _ _ O
Kong _ _ O
harbor, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room _ _ O
tries _ _ O
to _ _ O
conjure _ _ O
the _ _ O
atmosphere _ _ O
of _ _ O
Beijing's _ _ O
vanishing _ _ O
premodern _ _ O
alleys, _ _ O
or _ _ O
hutongs, _ _ O
by _ _ O
means _ _ O
of _ _ O
red _ _ O
paper _ _ O
lanterns, _ _ O
carved _ _ O
wooden _ _ O
doors _ _ O
and _ _ O
birdcages. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Manhattan _ _ O
branch _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
different _ _ O
impression. _ _ O
The _ _ O
entrance _ _ O
is _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O

of _ _ O
the _ _ O

the _ _ O

Building _ _ O
between _ _ O
East _ _ O
58th _ _ O

59th _ _ O
Streets. _ _ O
Turn _ _ O
right _ _ O
and _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
narrow _ _ O
hallway _ _ O
between _ _ O
two _ _ O
soaring _ _ O

of _ _ O
them _ _ O
for _ _ O

a _ _ O

room. _ _ O
The _ _ O
inspiration _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
Art _ _ O
Deco _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
pinch _ _ O
of _ _ O
cocaine; _ _ O
the _ _ O
blue _ _ O
leather _ _ O
banquettes, _ _ O
beveled _ _ O
mirrors _ _ O
and _ _ O
chandeliers _ _ O
of _ _ O
mirror-polished _ _ O
steel _ _ O
could _ _ O
come _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
set _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
nightclub _ _ O
in _ _ O
some _ _ O
cross _ _ O
between _ _ O
" _ _ O
Scarface _ _ O
" _ _ O
and _ _ O
"Gentlemen _ _ O
Prefer _ _ O
Blondes." _ _ O
A _ _ O
guest _ _ O
who _ _ O
has _ _ O
lived _ _ O
in _ _ O
China _ _ O
allowed _ _ O
his _ _ O
eyes _ _ O
to _ _ O
adjust _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
glinting _ _ O
light _ _ O
as _ _ O
he _ _ O
looked _ _ O
toward _ _ O
the _ _ O
ceiling, _ _ O
which _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
far _ _ O
away. _ _ O
"It's _ _ O
very _ _ O
… _ _ O
yin," _ _ O
he _ _ O
said. _ _ O
Hutong _ _ O
is _ _ O
ostensibly _ _ O
a _ _ O
Northern _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
apparent _ _ O
in _ _ O
Hong _ _ O
Kong _ _ O
than _ _ O
in _ _ O
Manhattan, _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
pruned _ _ O
to _ _ O
about _ _ O
half _ _ O
the _ _ O
size. _ _ O
Lamb, _ _ O
a _ _ O
mainstay _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
northern _ _ O
provinces, _ _ O
was _ _ O
represented _ _ O
in _ _ O
August _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
single _ _ O
dish, _ _ O
cumin-speckled _ _ O
ribs _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
languorously _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
mind-altering _ _ O
tenderness. _ _ O
By _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
of _ _ O
my _ _ O
last _ _ O
visit, _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
had _ _ O
ambled _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
entirely. _ _ O
The _ _ O
most _ _ O
famous _ _ O
preparation _ _ O
from _ _ O
northern _ _ O
China, _ _ O
Peking _ _ O
duck, _ _ O
arrived _ _ O
at _ _ O
my _ _ O
table _ _ O
worse _ _ O
for _ _ O
wear _ _ O
and _ _ O
tear, _ _ O
carved _ _ O
haphazardly, _ _ O
with _ _ O
blobs _ _ O
of _ _ O
unmelted _ _ O
fat _ _ O
clinging _ _ O
to _ _ O
limp _ _ O
skin. _ _ O
The _ _ O
second _ _ O
course, _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark-meat _ _ O
stir-fry _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
folded _ _ O
in _ _ O
iceberg _ _ O
lettuce, _ _ O
was _ _ O
more _ _ O
skillfully _ _ O
done, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
sting _ _ O
of _ _ O
paying _ _ O
$84 _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
whole _ _ O
duck _ _ O
with _ _ O
uncrisp _ _ O
skin _ _ O
lingered. _ _ O
Much _ _ O
of _ _ O
what _ _ O
hasn't _ _ O
been _ _ O
trimmed _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
Hong _ _ O
Kong _ _ O
menu _ _ O
comes _ _ O
from _ _ O
Sichuan. _ _ O
So _ _ O
does _ _ O
Fei _ _ O
Wang, _ _ O
the _ _ O
executive _ _ O
chef _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
branch, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
native _ _ O
of _ _ O
Chengdu. _ _ O
Most _ _ O
recently _ _ O
seen _ _ O
running _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Hutong _ _ O
in _ _ O
London, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Wang _ _ O
weaves _ _ O
chiles _ _ O
-- _ _ O
fresh, _ _ O
dried, _ _ O
roasted, _ _ O
pickled, _ _ O
name _ _ O
it _ _ O
-- _ _ O
into _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
everything. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
known _ _ O
as _ _ O
Red _ _ O
Lantern, _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole _ _ O
dried _ _ O
peppers _ _ O
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
of _ _ O
cherries _ _ O
are _ _ O
mostly _ _ O
decorative; _ _ O
fried _ _ O
soft-shell _ _ O
crabs _ _ O
are _ _ O
buried _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
chiles _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
pan _ _ O
with _ _ O
an _ _ O
arcing _ _ O
bamboo _ _ O
handle, _ _ O
like _ _ O
jelly _ _ O
beans _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
plastic _ _ O
grass _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
Easter _ _ O
basket. _ _ O
The _ _ O
ground _ _ O
spices _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
crabs' _ _ O
shatteringly _ _ O
brittle _ _ O
crust _ _ O
-- _ _ O
lightly _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
and _ _ O
more _ _ O
aromatic _ _ O
than _ _ O
searingly _ _ O
hot _ _ O
-- _ _ O
may _ _ O
remind _ _ O
you _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
rice-cracker _ _ O
snack _ _ O
you _ _ O
grew _ _ O
up _ _ O
on, _ _ O
or _ _ O
it _ _ O
may _ _ O
make _ _ O
you _ _ O
think _ _ O
of _ _ O
Old _ _ O
Bay. _ _ O
Fermented _ _ O
chiles _ _ O
provide _ _ O
an _ _ O
electric _ _ O
buzz, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
modicum _ _ O
of _ _ O
heat, _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
halibut _ _ O
that _ _ O
arrives _ _ O
boxed _ _ O
up _ _ O
inside _ _ O
a _ _ O
red _ _ O
bell _ _ O
pepper _ _ O
and _ _ O
sitting _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
nest _ _ O
of _ _ O
rice _ _ O
noodles. _ _ O
(The _ _ O
pepper _ _ O
opens _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
six-pointed _ _ O
star _ _ O
that _ _ O
gives _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
its _ _ O
name, _ _ O
halibut _ _ O
red _ _ O
star _ _ O
noodles.) _ _ O
Kou _ _ O
shui _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
is _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
submerged _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
orange _ _ O
lake _ _ O
of _ _ O
excellent _ _ O
chile _ _ O
oil, _ _ O
although _ _ O
the _ _ O
adroit _ _ O
way _ _ O
the _ _ O
oil _ _ O
is _ _ O
balanced _ _ O
by _ _ O
rice _ _ O
vinegar, _ _ O
sesame _ _ O
oil, _ _ O
soy _ _ O
sauce, _ _ O
ginger _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
is _ _ O
what _ _ O
gives _ _ O
Hutong _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
city's _ _ O
most _ _ O
impressive _ _ O
versions _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
traditional _ _ O
cold _ _ O
dish. _ _ O
If _ _ O
Hutong _ _ O
has _ _ O
another _ _ O
appetizer _ _ O
that _ _ O
equals _ _ O
it, _ _ O
I _ _ O
haven't _ _ O
found _ _ O
it _ _ O
yet. _ _ O
I _ _ O
did, _ _ O
however, _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
cryptic _ _ O
encounter _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
log-cabin _ _ O
stack _ _ O
of _ _ O
okra _ _ O
doused _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
wasabi _ _ O
sauce, _ _ O
and _ _ O
an _ _ O
inconclusive _ _ O
rendezvous _ _ O
with _ _ O
some _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
asparagus _ _ O
stalks _ _ O
whose _ _ O
tips _ _ O
were _ _ O
enrobed _ _ O
in _ _ O
white _ _ O
sesame _ _ O
sauce; _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
had _ _ O
tried _ _ O
to _ _ O
replicate _ _ O
strawberries _ _ O
dipped _ _ O
in _ _ O
white _ _ O
chocolate _ _ O
without _ _ O
access _ _ O
to _ _ O
strawberries _ _ O
or _ _ O
white _ _ O
chocolate. _ _ O
You _ _ O
could _ _ O
attempt _ _ O
to _ _ O
unknot _ _ O
these _ _ O
mysteries. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
again, _ _ O
you _ _ O
could _ _ O
simply _ _ O
begin _ _ O
your _ _ O
meal _ _ O
with _ _ O
dim _ _ O
sum. _ _ O
And _ _ O
then, _ _ O
after _ _ O
picking _ _ O
your _ _ O
way _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
chile-besotted _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses, _ _ O
you _ _ O
could _ _ O
end _ _ O
it _ _ O
that _ _ O
way, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
that _ _ O
mimics _ _ O
the _ _ O
shape _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
bun, _ _ O
pleated _ _ O
and _ _ O
twisted _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
pucker _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
top. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
made _ _ O
of _ _ O
white _ _ O
chocolate, _ _ O
the _ _ O
wrapper _ _ O
on _ _ O
this _ _ O
trompe _ _ O
l'oeil _ _ O
bao, _ _ O
and _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
white _ _ O
sesame _ _ O
cream _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
core _ _ O
of _ _ O
bittersweet _ _ O
salted _ _ O
caramel. _ _ O
Alongside _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
single _ _ O
scoop _ _ O
of _ _ O
ice _ _ O
cream _ _ O
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
lightly _ _ O
sweetened _ _ O
soy _ _ O
milk. _ _ O
The _ _ O
soy _ _ O
milk _ _ O
is _ _ O
extremely _ _ O
fresh. _ _ O
I _ _ O
don't _ _ O
mean _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
carton _ _ O
won't _ _ O
expire _ _ O
for _ _ O
another _ _ O
three _ _ O
weeks; _ _ O
I _ _ O
mean _ _ O
that _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
was _ _ O
squeezing _ _ O
the _ _ O
soybeans _ _ O
shortly _ _ O
before _ _ O
the _ _ O
ice _ _ O
cream _ _ O
was _ _ O
frozen. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
snack _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
childhood, _ _ O
bread _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
glass _ _ O
of _ _ O
milk, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
hard, _ _ O
after _ _ O
several _ _ O
courses _ _ O
of _ _ O
spice, _ _ O
to _ _ O
think _ _ O
of _ _ O
anything _ _ O
more _ _ O
welcome. _ _ O

Four _ _ O
summers _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
a _ _ O
young _ _ O
chef _ _ O
named _ _ O
José _ _ O
Luis _ _ O
Chávez _ _ O
began _ _ O
leveraging _ _ O
the _ _ O
poke _ _ B-FOOD
craze _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
salad-bowl _ _ B-FOOD
trend _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
string _ _ O
of _ _ O
fast-casual _ _ B-TYPE
ceviche _ _ O
bars. _ _ O
He _ _ O
began _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
counter _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Gansevoort _ _ O
Market _ _ O
food _ _ O
hall _ _ O
called _ _ O
Mission _ _ O
Ceviche _ _ O
; _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
now _ _ O
another _ _ O
in _ _ O
Canal _ _ O
Street _ _ O
Market _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
third _ _ O
is _ _ O
supposed _ _ O
to _ _ O
open _ _ O
in _ _ O
Norwalk, _ _ O
Conn., _ _ O
later _ _ O
this _ _ O
year. _ _ O
At _ _ O
all _ _ O
locations, _ _ O
the _ _ O
stock-in-trade _ _ O
is _ _ O
citrus-marinated _ _ O
raw _ _ O
fish _ _ O
with _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
potatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
kernels _ _ O
of _ _ O
chubby _ _ O
Andean _ _ O
corn, _ _ O
in _ _ O
both _ _ O
its _ _ O
soft _ _ O
and _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
forms. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
of _ _ O
course _ _ O
the _ _ O
standard _ _ O
Peruvian _ _ O
formula, _ _ O
but _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chávez _ _ O
had _ _ O
the _ _ O
inspiration _ _ O
of _ _ O
serving _ _ O
his _ _ O
ceviche _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
clear _ _ O
plastic _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
base _ _ O
of _ _ O
salad, _ _ O
rice _ _ O
or, _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
dollar _ _ O
more, _ _ O
quinoa. _ _ O
The _ _ O
supplemental _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
make _ _ O
a _ _ O
plausible _ _ O
desk _ _ O
lunch _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish _ _ O
that _ _ O
some _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
still _ _ O
aren't _ _ O
quite _ _ O
sure _ _ O
what _ _ O
to _ _ O
do _ _ O
with. _ _ O
The _ _ O
surprising _ _ O
thing _ _ O
about _ _ O
Mission _ _ O
Ceviche's _ _ O
salad _ _ O
bowls _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
they _ _ O
taste _ _ O
like _ _ O
real _ _ O
Peruvian _ _ O
food. _ _ O
The _ _ O
raw _ _ O
fish _ _ O
is _ _ O
firm _ _ O
and _ _ O
cold _ _ O
and _ _ O
neatly _ _ O
cut _ _ O
up _ _ O
into _ _ O
solid _ _ O
pieces _ _ O
that _ _ O
hold _ _ O
their _ _ O
shape. _ _ O
The _ _ O
leche _ _ O
de _ _ O
tigre _ _ O
marinade _ _ O
in _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chávez's _ _ O
"ceviche _ _ O
clásico" _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
bright _ _ O
and _ _ O
precise _ _ O
cocktail _ _ O
of _ _ O
lime _ _ O
and _ _ O
rocoto _ _ O
chiles, _ _ O
although _ _ O
you _ _ O
might _ _ O
wish _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
rocotos _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
applied _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
less _ _ O
restraint. _ _ O
You _ _ O
get _ _ O
a _ _ O
higher-caliber _ _ O
shot _ _ O
of _ _ O
spice, _ _ O
this _ _ O
time _ _ O
from _ _ O
ají _ _ O
amarillo _ _ O
chiles, _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
ceviche _ _ O
mixto, _ _ O
a _ _ O
combination _ _ O
of _ _ O
octopus, _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
and _ _ O
fluke _ _ O
enveloped _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
creamy, _ _ O
goldenrod-colored _ _ O
leche _ _ O
de _ _ O
tigre. _ _ O
The _ _ O
clásico _ _ O
is _ _ O
accessorized _ _ O
with _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
potato _ _ O
purée; _ _ O
the _ _ O
mixto _ _ O
gets _ _ O
avocado _ _ O
purée, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
The _ _ O
purées _ _ O
are _ _ O
piped _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
bags _ _ O
like _ _ O
buttercream _ _ O
roses _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
wedding _ _ O
cake, _ _ O
and _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
delicious. _ _ O
When _ _ O
I _ _ O
wandered _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
Gansevoort _ _ O
Market _ _ O
location _ _ O
in _ _ O
February, _ _ O
it _ _ O
seemed _ _ O
clear _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chávez _ _ O
could _ _ O
run _ _ O
an _ _ O
interesting _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
if _ _ O
he _ _ O
ever _ _ O
decided _ _ O
to _ _ O
put _ _ O
his _ _ O
food _ _ O
into _ _ O
something _ _ O
other _ _ O
than _ _ O
recyclable _ _ O
salad _ _ O
bowls. _ _ O
Then, _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
beginning _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
summer, _ _ O
he _ _ O
did _ _ O
just _ _ O
that, _ _ O
opening _ _ O
a _ _ O
sit-down _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
Upper _ _ O
East _ _ O
Side _ _ O
with _ _ O
real _ _ O
plates _ _ O
and _ _ O
bowls. _ _ O
The _ _ O
new _ _ O
space _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
large _ _ O
or _ _ O
lavish, _ _ O
but _ _ O
compared _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
earlier _ _ O
efforts, _ _ O
Mission _ _ O
Ceviche _ _ O
Restaurant _ _ O
& _ _ O
Bar _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
palace. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
seating _ _ O
for _ _ O
65 _ _ O
or _ _ O
so _ _ O
people _ _ O
beneath _ _ O
a _ _ O
wall _ _ O
sculpture _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
fish _ _ O
that _ _ O
glows _ _ O
from _ _ O
behind _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
pink _ _ O
neon _ _ O
sign _ _ O
that _ _ O
reads _ _ O
"tiger _ _ O
milk _ _ O
effect," _ _ O
probably _ _ O
a _ _ O
reference _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
belief _ _ O
that _ _ O
drinking _ _ O
leftover _ _ O
leche _ _ O
de _ _ O
tigre _ _ O
can _ _ O
put _ _ O
extra _ _ O
topspin _ _ O
on _ _ O
sexual _ _ O
performance. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu _ _ O
now _ _ O
paints _ _ O
a _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
fuller _ _ O
picture _ _ O
of _ _ O
Peruvian _ _ O
cuisine, _ _ O
extending _ _ O
into _ _ O
new _ _ O
foods _ _ O
including _ _ O
the _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
skewers _ _ O
known _ _ O
as _ _ O
anticuchos. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chávez _ _ O
dresses _ _ O
up _ _ O
the _ _ O
country's _ _ O
most _ _ O
popular _ _ O
anticucho, _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
beef _ _ O
heart, _ _ O
brushing _ _ O
it _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
rocoto _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
and _ _ O
serving _ _ O
it _ _ O
with _ _ O
newly _ _ O
fried _ _ O
blue _ _ O
potato _ _ O
chips _ _ O
and _ _ O
kernels _ _ O
of _ _ O
choclo _ _ O
corn. _ _ O
The _ _ O
trio _ _ O
of _ _ O
rocoto, _ _ O
blue _ _ O
potatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
choclo _ _ O
is _ _ O
so _ _ O
solidly _ _ O
Peruvian _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
can _ _ O
withstand _ _ O
the _ _ O
chimichurri _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chávez _ _ O
brings _ _ O
in, _ _ O
by _ _ O
way _ _ O
of _ _ O
Argentina, _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
final _ _ O
touch. _ _ O
He _ _ O
clearly _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
soft _ _ O
spot _ _ O
for _ _ O
chimichurri _ _ O
because _ _ O
he _ _ O
deploys _ _ O
it _ _ O
again _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
anticuchos _ _ O
(the _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
are _ _ O
very _ _ O
big _ _ O
and _ _ O
look _ _ O
even _ _ O
bigger _ _ O
because _ _ O
they're _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
with _ _ O
their _ _ O
heads _ _ O
on), _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
squirt _ _ O
of _ _ O
huancaína, _ _ O
the _ _ O
spicy _ _ O
yellow _ _ O
cheese _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
something _ _ O
like _ _ O
Peru's _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
queso _ _ O
dip. _ _ O
My _ _ O
favorite _ _ O
anticucho _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
more _ _ O
straightforward _ _ O
situation, _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
scallops _ _ O
under _ _ O
arugula, _ _ O
lime _ _ O
zest _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
Parmesan _ _ O
fondue. _ _ O
But _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chávez _ _ O
has _ _ O
the _ _ O
ability _ _ O
to _ _ O
put _ _ O
several _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
in _ _ O
motion _ _ O
at _ _ O
once _ _ O
and _ _ O
keep _ _ O
his _ _ O
balance, _ _ O
as _ _ O
evidenced _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
beef-heart _ _ O
skewer _ _ O
and _ _ O
his _ _ O
octopus _ _ O
causa. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is, _ _ O

Ceviche's _ _ O
servers, _ _ O
while _ _ O
eager _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
helpful, _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
habit _ _ O
of _ _ O
singling _ _ O
out _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
obvious _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
-- _ _ O
the _ _ O
classic _ _ O
ceviche, _ _ O
the _ _ O
octopus _ _ O
leg _ _ O
-- _ _ O
and _ _ O
pushing _ _ O
them _ _ O
so _ _ O
hard _ _ O
you _ _ O
might _ _ O
suspect _ _ O
the _ _ O
rest _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
minefield. _ _ O
It _ _ O
isn't. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
to _ _ O
avoid _ _ O
unless _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
brings _ _ O
back _ _ O
the _ _ O
bizarre _ _ O
strawberry-kiwi _ _ O
ceviche _ _ O
that _ _ O
showed _ _ O
up _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
special _ _ O
one _ _ O
night. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
being _ _ O
herded _ _ O
into _ _ O
getting _ _ O
the _ _ O
"Peruvian _ _ O
paella," _ _ O
you _ _ O
should _ _ O
know _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
three _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses _ _ O
are _ _ O
also _ _ O
worth _ _ O
looking _ _ O
into, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
ají _ _ O
de _ _ O
gallina, _ _ O
shredded _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
breast _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
ají _ _ O
amarillo _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
both _ _ O
soothing _ _ O
and _ _ O
spicy; _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
seco _ _ O
norteño, _ _ O
a _ _ O
slowly _ _ O
braised _ _ O
short _ _ O
rib _ _ O
in _ _ O
cilantro _ _ O
sauce. _ _ O
All _ _ O
are _ _ O
larger _ _ O
than _ _ O
average, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
quite _ _ O
rivals _ _ O
the _ _ O
ceviches. _ _ O
They _ _ O
are _ _ O
served, _ _ O
yes, _ _ O
without _ _ O
lettuce _ _ O
or _ _ O
rice, _ _ O
and _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
better _ _ O
for _ _ O
it. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Chávez's _ _ O
creative _ _ O
engine _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
high _ _ O
idle, _ _ O
and _ _ O
he _ _ O
has _ _ O
come _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
different _ _ O
ways _ _ O
to _ _ O
present _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
also _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
fast-casual _ _ O
counters. _ _ O
The _ _ O
"Nikkei" _ _ O
ceviche, _ _ O
for _ _ O
instance _ _ O
-- _ _ O
tuna _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
modified _ _ O
ponzu _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
with _ _ O
ají _ _ O
amarilllo _ _ O
and _ _ O
togarashi _ _ O
-- _ _ O
now _ _ O
comes _ _ O
with _ _ O
watermelon _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
bloop _ _ O
of _ _ O
ginger _ _ O
foam _ _ O
that _ _ O
would _ _ O
never _ _ O
survive _ _ O
a _ _ O
trip _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
court _ _ O
back _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
office. _ _ O
Neither _ _ O
would _ _ O
the _ _ O
odd _ _ O
but _ _ O
intriguing _ _ O
attempt _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
vegetarian _ _ O
ceviche _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
fish _ _ O
is _ _ O
replaced _ _ O
by _ _ O
shiitakes _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
leche _ _ O
de _ _ O
tigre _ _ O
takes _ _ O
the _ _ O
form _ _ O
of _ _ O
snow, _ _ O
frozen _ _ O
by _ _ O
liquid _ _ O
nitrogen. _ _ O
The _ _ O
art _ _ O
of _ _ O
ceviche-making _ _ O
has _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
as _ _ O
much _ _ O
in _ _ O
common _ _ O
with _ _ O
mixology _ _ O
as _ _ O
with _ _ O
cooking, _ _ O
so _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
surprise _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
cocktails _ _ O
are _ _ O
well _ _ O
calibrated _ _ O
and _ _ O
sing _ _ O
out _ _ O
with _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
lime. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
twist _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
pisco _ _ O
sour _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
passion-fruit _ _ O
juice _ _ O
and _ _ O
another _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
purple-corn _ _ O
drink _ _ O
chicha _ _ O
morada, _ _ O
although _ _ O
neither _ _ O
quite _ _ O
achieves _ _ O
the _ _ O
bracing _ _ O
elegance _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
original. _ _ O
And _ _ O
it's _ _ O
nice _ _ O
to _ _ O
see _ _ O
the _ _ O
less _ _ O
well-known _ _ O
chilcano, _ _ O
a _ _ O
pisco _ _ O
highball _ _ O
made _ _ O
with _ _ O
lime _ _ O
juice _ _ O
and _ _ O
ginger _ _ O
ale. _ _ O
(Would _ _ O
ginger _ _ O
beer _ _ O
be _ _ O
better?) _ _ O
Chicha _ _ O
morada _ _ O
appears _ _ O
again _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
raspadilla _ _ O
dessert. _ _ O
This _ _ O
time _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
syrup _ _ O
poured _ _ O
over _ _ O
shaved _ _ O
ice _ _ O
and _ _ O
sprinkled _ _ O
with _ _ O

foam. _ _ O
When _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
the _ _ O
raspadilla, _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
sprinkled _ _ O
with _ _ O
candied _ _ O

in _ _ O
a _ _ O

Mr. _ _ O

You _ _ O
can, _ _ O

you _ _ O
like, _ _ O
follow _ _ O
the _ _ O
custom _ _ O
of _ _ O
Chengdu _ _ B-LOC
or _ _ O
Chongqing _ _ B-LOC
by _ _ O
focusing _ _ O
on _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
prized _ _ O
more _ _ O
for _ _ O
feel _ _ O
than _ _ O
flavor. _ _ O
The _ _ O
duck _ _ B-FOOD
intestines, _ _ I-FOOD
for _ _ O
instance, _ _ O
which _ _ O
quickly _ _ O
contract _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O

and _ _ O
come _ _ O
out _ _ O
about _ _ O

with _ _ O
the _ _ O
texture _ _ O
of _ _ O

Or _ _ O
the _ _ O
pale _ _ O
ivory _ _ O
sheets _ _ O
of _ _ O
flattened _ _ B-FOOD
artery, _ _ I-FOOD
which _ _ O
after _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
about _ _ O
twice _ _ O
as _ _ O
long _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
long-lasting _ _ O
chew _ _ O
that _ _ O
reminds _ _ O
me _ _ O
of _ _ O
geoduck. _ _ B-FOOD
On _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
hand, _ _ O
more _ _ O
flavorful _ _ O
ingredients, _ _ O
once _ _ O
they've _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
minutes, _ _ O
can _ _ O
help _ _ O
punch _ _ O
up _ _ O
the _ _ O
broths, _ _ B-FOOD
which _ _ O
aren't _ _ O
quite _ _ O
as _ _ O
deep _ _ O
or _ _ O
complex _ _ O
as _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
at _ _ O
some _ _ O
other _ _ O
hot _ _ B-FOOD
pot _ _ I-FOOD
providers. _ _ O
This _ _ O
does _ _ O
not _ _ O
apply _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
lengths _ _ O
of _ _ O
corn _ _ B-FOOD
on _ _ I-FOOD
the _ _ I-FOOD
cob, _ _ I-FOOD
which _ _ O
don't _ _ O
taste _ _ O
like _ _ O
anything _ _ O
to _ _ O
begin _ _ O
with. _ _ O
And _ _ O
I _ _ O
would _ _ O
avoid _ _ O
the _ _ O
"vegetable _ _ B-DISH
platter," _ _ I-DISH
which _ _ O
was _ _ O
more _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
lettuce _ _ B-FOOD
platter. _ _ O
But _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
useful _ _ O
to _ _ O
keep _ _ O
in _ _ O
mind _ _ O
that _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
toss _ _ O
sliced _ _ O
king _ _ B-FOOD

and _ _ O
forget _ _ O
about _ _ O
them _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
while, _ _ O
both _ _ O
the _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O

will _ _ O
rise _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
occasion. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
ingredients, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
you _ _ O
hold _ _ O
in _ _ O
your _ _ O
chopsticks, _ _ O
watching _ _ O
for _ _ O
30 _ _ O
seconds _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
minute _ _ O
until _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
see _ _ O
they're _ _ O
ready. _ _ O
The _ _ O

of _ _ O

as _ _ O

The _ _ O

tender _ _ O
and _ _ O
running _ _ O
with _ _ O

in _ _ O
just _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
minute. _ _ O
The _ _ O
sweet, _ _ O
small _ _ O

might _ _ O
need _ _ O
twice _ _ O

out _ _ O
in _ _ O

the _ _ O

the _ _ O

of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
though _ _ O
a _ _ O

Lately _ _ O
I _ _ O
have _ _ O
fallen _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
spell _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
East _ _ B-LOC
Village _ _ I-LOC
restaurant _ _ O
called _ _ O
Foxface _ _ B-EST
. _ _ O
The _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
pin _ _ O
down, _ _ O
geographically. _ _ O
Stopping _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
weeks _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
I _ _ O
ate _ _ O
Low _ _ B-DISH
Countryish _ _ I-DISH
wild _ _ I-DISH
red _ _ I-DISH
shrimp _ _ I-DISH
on _ _ I-DISH
grits, _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ O
sweet _ _ B-FOOD
corn _ _ I-FOOD
off _ _ I-FOOD
the _ _ I-FOOD
cob _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
potent _ _ O
saffron-lobster _ _ B-EST
sauce. _ _ I-EST
More _ _ O
recently, _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
skinless _ _ O
pork _ _ B-FOOD
sausage _ _ I-FOOD
inspired _ _ I-FOOD
by _ _ O
sai _ _ B-FOOD
ua, _ _ I-FOOD
the _ _ O
spicy _ _ O
and _ _ O
tangy _ _ O
specialty _ _ O
identified _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
northern _ _ O
Thai _ _ O
city _ _ O
of _ _ O
Chiang _ _ B-LOC
Mai. _ _ I-LOC
The _ _ O
soft _ _ O
tripe _ _ B-FOOD
I _ _ O
enjoyed _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
weekend _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
simmered _ _ O
with _ _ O
'nduja, _ _ O
the _ _ O
fiery _ _ O
and _ _ O
malleable _ _ O
Calabrian _ _ O
sausage, _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
covered _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
thin _ _ O
shingles _ _ O
of _ _ O
shaved _ _ O
pecorino. _ _ O
If _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
started _ _ O
hanging _ _ O
around _ _ O
at _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
sooner, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
during _ _ O
the _ _ O
cold _ _ O
months _ _ O
after _ _ O
its _ _ O
opening, _ _ O
in _ _ O
February, _ _ O
I _ _ O
might _ _ O
have _ _ O
run _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
wider _ _ O
variety _ _ O
of _ _ O
cuisines _ _ O
and _ _ O
main _ _ O
ingredients. _ _ O
I _ _ O
did _ _ O
manage _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
elk _ _ O
osso _ _ O
buco _ _ O
while _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
still _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
I _ _ O
never _ _ O
got _ _ O
to _ _ O
try _ _ O
the _ _ O
wild _ _ O
hare, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
stewed _ _ O
in _ _ O
red _ _ O
wine _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
of _ _ O
chocolate _ _ O
and _ _ O
thickened _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O
own _ _ O
blood, _ _ O
a _ _ O
formula _ _ O
that _ _ O
students _ _ O
of _ _ O
very _ _ O
old-guard _ _ O
French _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
will _ _ O
recognize _ _ O
as _ _ O
lièvre _ _ O
à _ _ O
la _ _ O
royale. _ _ O
Nor _ _ O
did _ _ O
I _ _ O
make _ _ O
it _ _ O
in _ _ O
time _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
venison, _ _ O
left _ _ O
to _ _ O
bubble _ _ O
for _ _ O
hours _ _ O
in _ _ O
white _ _ O
wine _ _ O
with _ _ O
mushrooms _ _ O
and _ _ O
dark _ _ O
juniper _ _ O
berries. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
dish _ _ O
I _ _ O
may _ _ O
never _ _ O
forgive _ _ O
myself _ _ O
for _ _ O
missing, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
kebabs _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
preserved _ _ O
lemons _ _ O
and _ _ O
tahini, _ _ O
because _ _ O
the _ _ O
kebabs _ _ O
were _ _ O
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
ground _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
and _ _ O
camel. _ _ O
Although _ _ O
these _ _ O
foods _ _ O
may _ _ O
lack _ _ O
any _ _ O
unifying _ _ O
cultural _ _ O
background, _ _ O
they _ _ O
did _ _ O
have _ _ O
one _ _ O
thing _ _ O
in _ _ O
common: _ _ O
They _ _ O
were _ _ O
all _ _ O
served _ _ O
on _ _ O
rolls. _ _ O
Apart _ _ O
from _ _ O
an _ _ O
occasional _ _ O
salad _ _ O
or _ _ O
soup, _ _ O
everything _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
at _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
arrives _ _ O
in _ _ O
sandwich _ _ O
form. _ _ O
And _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
exception _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
muffuletta _ _ O
that _ _ O
briefly _ _ O
manifested _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
months _ _ O
back, _ _ O
every _ _ O
sandwich _ _ O
at _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
is _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
hot, _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
meat _ _ O
or _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
or _ _ O
vegetables. _ _ O
In _ _ O
Mexico, _ _ O
certain _ _ O
taco _ _ O
stands _ _ O
specialize _ _ O
in _ _ O
tacos _ _ O
de _ _ O
guisado, _ _ O
tortillas _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
one _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
stew _ _ O
or _ _ O
another. _ _ O
Most _ _ O
of _ _ O
Foxface's _ _ O
offerings _ _ O
are, _ _ O
in _ _ O
effect, _ _ O
sandwiches _ _ O
de _ _ O
guisado. _ _ O
Which _ _ O
reminds _ _ O
me _ _ O
of _ _ O
another _ _ O
impressive _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
sandwich, _ _ O
a _ _ O
magenta _ _ O
and _ _ O
green _ _ O
tangle _ _ O
of _ _ O
cilantro _ _ O
stems _ _ O
and _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
onions _ _ O
pressed _ _ O
into _ _ O
an _ _ O
engagingly _ _ O
tart _ _ O
pile _ _ O
of _ _ O
pork, _ _ O
marinated _ _ O
in _ _ O
sour _ _ O
orange _ _ O
juice _ _ O
and _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
very _ _ O
slowly _ _ O
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
banana _ _ O
leaf _ _ O
in _ _ O
emulation _ _ O
of _ _ O
cochinita _ _ O
pibil _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
Yucatán. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
guarantee _ _ O
that _ _ O
any _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O
items _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
available _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
go _ _ O
to _ _ O
Foxface. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
printed _ _ O
daily _ _ O
and _ _ O
taped _ _ O
up _ _ O
next _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
window _ _ O
on _ _ O
St. _ _ O
Marks _ _ O
Place _ _ O
where _ _ O
most _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
business _ _ O
is _ _ O
transacted. _ _ O
Sometimes _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
sandwich _ _ O
appears _ _ O
after _ _ O
the _ _ O
printed _ _ O
menu _ _ O
has _ _ O
already _ _ O
been _ _ O
posted, _ _ O
so _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
written _ _ O
out _ _ O
by _ _ O
hand _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
card _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
upper _ _ O
left _ _ O
corner _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
logo, _ _ O
a _ _ O
drawing _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
elegant _ _ O
fox _ _ O
in _ _ O
cat's-eye _ _ O
glasses _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
cigarette _ _ O
holder _ _ O
in _ _ O
one _ _ O
gloved _ _ O
hand. _ _ O
The _ _ O
sandwiches _ _ O
have _ _ O
names _ _ O
like _ _ O
It's _ _ O
What's _ _ O
'Nside _ _ O
(for _ _ O
the _ _ O
tripe _ _ O
with _ _ O
'nduja) _ _ O
or _ _ O
120 _ _ O
BPM _ _ O
(bison _ _ O
heart _ _ O
with _ _ O
tahini _ _ O
and _ _ O
"many _ _ O
spices"). _ _ O
The _ _ O
Smoking _ _ O
Fox _ _ O
is _ _ O
sold _ _ O
every _ _ O
day. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
smoked _ _ O
pork _ _ O
rib _ _ O
the _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
dry _ _ O
rosé, _ _ O
separated _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
bones _ _ O
and _ _ O
covered _ _ O
with _ _ O
coleslaw, _ _ O
pickles _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
splashes _ _ O
of _ _ O
habanero-orange _ _ O
vinegar. _ _ O
Your _ _ O
mind, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
goes _ _ O
either _ _ O
to _ _ O
Memphis _ _ O
or _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
McRib _ _ O
, _ _ O
and _ _ O
neither _ _ O
is _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
wrong, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
meat _ _ O
is _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
superior _ _ O
grade _ _ O
and _ _ O
is _ _ O
smoked _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
attention _ _ O
to _ _ O
timing _ _ O
and _ _ O
nuance _ _ O
that _ _ O
characterizes _ _ O
Foxface's _ _ O
cooking. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
a _ _ O
great _ _ O
sandwich. _ _ O
To _ _ O
place _ _ O
an _ _ O
order, _ _ O
you _ _ O
lean _ _ O
in _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
window _ _ O
and _ _ O
speak _ _ O
with _ _ O
Sivan _ _ O
Lahat, _ _ O
who _ _ O
owns _ _ O
and _ _ O
runs _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
with _ _ O
Ori _ _ O
Kushnir, _ _ O
her _ _ O
partner _ _ O
in _ _ O
life _ _ O
and _ _ O
in _ _ O
sandwiches. _ _ O
They _ _ O
immigrated _ _ O
to _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
from _ _ O
Israel _ _ O
almost _ _ O
20 _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago _ _ O
and _ _ O
have _ _ O
lived _ _ O
here _ _ O
ever _ _ O
since, _ _ O
apart _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
brief _ _ O
flirtation _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
Midwest _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
longer _ _ O
experimental _ _ O
period _ _ O
in _ _ O
Tokyo. _ _ O
While _ _ O
they _ _ O
were _ _ O
in _ _ O
Japan, _ _ O
they _ _ O
operated _ _ O
a _ _ O
pop-up _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
closest _ _ O
either _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
came _ _ O
to _ _ O
running _ _ O
a _ _ O
food _ _ O
business _ _ O
before _ _ O
opening _ _ O
Foxface. _ _ O
Like _ _ O
the _ _ O
fox _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
logo, _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Lahat _ _ O
has _ _ O
coppery _ _ O
hair _ _ O
and _ _ O
wears _ _ O
cat's-eye _ _ O
glasses. _ _ O
She _ _ O
prepares _ _ O
the _ _ O
orders _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
room _ _ O
behind _ _ O
the _ _ O
window, _ _ O
which _ _ O
measures _ _ O
48 _ _ O
square _ _ O
feet. _ _ O
Inside _ _ O
the _ _ O
building, _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
stairs, _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
second _ _ O
room. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Kushnir _ _ O
thinks _ _ O
it _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
as _ _ O
large _ _ O
as _ _ O
14 _ _ O
square _ _ O
feet. _ _ O
A _ _ O
variety _ _ O
of _ _ O
equipment _ _ O
is _ _ O
stowed _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O
rooms, _ _ O
including _ _ O
three _ _ O
induction _ _ O
burners, _ _ O
a _ _ O
roaster, _ _ O
a _ _ O
smoker _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
dishwasher. _ _ O
After _ _ O
business _ _ O
hours, _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
comes _ _ O
out _ _ O
as _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Kushnir _ _ O
supervises _ _ O
the _ _ O
more _ _ O
time-consuming _ _ O
roasts _ _ O
and _ _ O
stews. _ _ O
He _ _ O
describes _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
and _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Lahat _ _ O
cook _ _ O
as _ _ O
"dishes _ _ O
we _ _ O
like _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat, _ _ O
reimagined _ _ O
as _ _ O
sandwiches." _ _ O
I _ _ O
like _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
dishes, _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
happens, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
come _ _ O
by _ _ O
lately, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
those _ _ O
shapeless _ _ O
brown _ _ O
stews _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
so _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
style. _ _ O
Following _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
world's _ _ O
most _ _ O
influential _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
and _ _ O
shamed, _ _ O
perhaps, _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
unflattering _ _ O
lenses _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
million _ _ O
amateur _ _ O
photographers, _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
have _ _ O
shifted _ _ O
away _ _ O
from _ _ O
plain _ _ O
and _ _ O
plain-looking _ _ O
cooking. _ _ O
The _ _ O
subtlety _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
thrill _ _ O
of _ _ O
plain _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
comes _ _ O
from _ _ O
searing, _ _ O
simmering, _ _ O
reducing, _ _ O
skimming _ _ O
and _ _ O
so _ _ O
on. _ _ O
All _ _ O
the _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
own _ _ O
Instant _ _ O
Pots _ _ O
know _ _ O
this, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
segment _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
scene _ _ O
with _ _ O
artistic _ _ O
leanings _ _ O
has _ _ O
forgotten _ _ O
it, _ _ O
focusing _ _ O
instead _ _ O
on _ _ O
plating, _ _ O
arranging _ _ O
six _ _ O
or _ _ O
seven _ _ O
things _ _ O
in _ _ O
some _ _ O
photogenic _ _ O
design _ _ O
and _ _ O
hoping _ _ O
they _ _ O
will _ _ O
cohere. _ _ O
Slapping _ _ O
a _ _ O
roll _ _ O
on _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
a _ _ O
shapeless _ _ O
brown _ _ O
stew _ _ O
ready _ _ O
for _ _ O
its _ _ O
close-up, _ _ O
although _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
said _ _ O
that _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
mean _ _ O
streets _ _ O
of _ _ O
Instagram, _ _ O
an _ _ O
elk _ _ O
osso _ _ O
buco _ _ O
sandwich _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
match _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
rainbow _ _ O
unicorn _ _ O
ice _ _ O
cream _ _ O
sundae. _ _ O
Because _ _ O
space _ _ O
is _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
premium, _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
room _ _ O
to _ _ O
sit _ _ O
and _ _ O
eat _ _ O
your _ _ O
Smoking _ _ O
Fox _ _ O
at _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
itself. _ _ O
You _ _ O
can, _ _ O
however, _ _ O
take _ _ O
it _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
table _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
steps _ _ O
away _ _ O
inside _ _ O
an _ _ O
adjoining _ _ O
business _ _ O
called _ _ O
the _ _ O
William _ _ O
Barnacle _ _ O
Tavern _ _ O
. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
reassuringly _ _ O
gloomy _ _ O
bar _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
said _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
originated _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
speakeasy. _ _ O
Model _ _ O
ships _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
nautical _ _ O
paraphernalia _ _ O
are _ _ O
strewn _ _ O
about, _ _ O
references _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
rumrunning _ _ O
operation _ _ O
a _ _ O
former _ _ O
owner _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
building _ _ O
presided _ _ O
over _ _ O
during _ _ O
Prohibition. _ _ O
(The _ _ O
stairs _ _ O
that _ _ O
Foxface's _ _ O
dishwasher _ _ O
is _ _ O
housed _ _ O
below _ _ O
lead _ _ O
to _ _ O
an _ _ O
exhibition _ _ O
space _ _ O
called _ _ O
the _ _ O
Museum _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
American _ _ O

.) _ _ O
The _ _ O
bar's _ _ O
current _ _ O
owner _ _ O
has _ _ O
resisted _ _ O
some _ _ O
modern _ _ O
conveniences. _ _ O
Most _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
lighting _ _ O
at _ _ O
night _ _ O
comes _ _ O
from _ _ O
small _ _ O
candles, _ _ O
and _ _ O
all _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
music _ _ O
is _ _ O
provided _ _ O
by _ _ O
old _ _ O
films _ _ O
-- _ _ O
of _ _ O
Irish _ _ O
folk _ _ O
recitals, _ _ O
Cab _ _ O
Calloway _ _ O

-- _ _ O
that _ _ O
run _ _ O
in _ _ O
looping, _ _ O
watery _ _ O
projections _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
back _ _ O
wall. _ _ O
All _ _ O
Foxface _ _ O
sandwiches _ _ O
are _ _ O
presented _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
trim _ _ O
little _ _ O
white _ _ O
box _ _ O
that _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O

can _ _ O
purchase _ _ O
an _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
fruit _ _ O

for _ _ O
$3 _ _ O
from _ _ O
Foxface, _ _ O
or _ _ O
buy _ _ O
alcohol _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
tavern. _ _ O
The _ _ O
beer _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
expensive, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
specialty _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
house _ _ O
is _ _ O
absinthe. _ _ O
Most _ _ O
patrons _ _ O
drink _ _ O
theirs _ _ O
diluted _ _ O
with _ _ O

water _ _ O
poured _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
four-spigot _ _ O
absinthe _ _ O
fountain _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
bar. _ _ O
The _ _ O
bartender _ _ O
will _ _ O
make _ _ O
absinthe _ _ O
cocktails, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
including _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
Ernest _ _ O

Some _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
push _ _ O
their _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
menus. _ _ O
Rezdôra _ _ B-EST
doesn't. _ _ O
A _ _ O
few _ _ O
steps _ _ O
down _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
sidewalk, _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
block _ _ O
of _ _ O
East _ _ B-LOC
20th _ _ I-LOC
Street _ _ I-LOC
as _ _ O
Gramercy _ _ B-EST
Tavern _ _ I-EST
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
brownstone _ _ O
where _ _ O
Teddy _ _ O
Roosevelt _ _ O
was _ _ O
born, _ _ O
Rezdôra _ _ B-EST
lists _ _ O
a _ _ O
"regional _ _ O
pasta _ _ B-FOOD
tasting" _ _ O
for _ _ O
$90 _ _ O
on _ _ O
its _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
The _ _ O
region _ _ O
in _ _ O
question _ _ O
is _ _ O
Emilia-Romagna, _ _ B-LOC
whose _ _ O
refinements _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
art _ _ O
of _ _ O
rolling _ _ O
and _ _ O
saucing _ _ O
noodles _ _ B-FOOD
are _ _ O
admired _ _ O
even _ _ O
by _ _ O
Italians _ _ O
from _ _ O
other _ _ O
parts _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
country. _ _ O
Chances _ _ O
are _ _ O
that _ _ O
most _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
five _ _ O
pastas _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
are _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
the _ _ O
ones _ _ O
you _ _ O
picture _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
think _ _ O
about _ _ O
Emilia-Romagna, _ _ B-LOC
starting _ _ O
with _ _ O
tortellini _ _ B-FOOD
in _ _ I-FOOD
brodo. _ _ I-FOOD
This _ _ O
would _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
it _ _ O
an _ _ O
easy _ _ O
sell, _ _ O
and _ _ O
yet _ _ O
servers _ _ O
at _ _ O
Rezdôra _ _ B-EST
never _ _ O
tried _ _ O
to _ _ O
sell _ _ O
me _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
tasting. _ _ O
Until _ _ O
I _ _ O
asked _ _ O
about _ _ O
it _ _ O
one _ _ O
night, _ _ O
I _ _ O
had _ _ O
never _ _ O
seen _ _ O
the _ _ O
separate _ _ O
menu _ _ O
card _ _ O
that _ _ O
describes _ _ O
each _ _ O
course. _ _ O
With _ _ O
some _ _ O
hesitation, _ _ O
I _ _ O
ordered _ _ O
it. _ _ O
Every _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
pastas _ _ B-FOOD
was _ _ O
excellent, _ _ O
and _ _ O
one _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
worth _ _ O
walking _ _ O
a _ _ O
long _ _ O
distance _ _ O
for. _ _ O
After _ _ O
the _ _ O
fifth _ _ O
course _ _ O
was _ _ O
gone, _ _ O
it _ _ O
slowly _ _ O
dawned _ _ O
on _ _ O
me _ _ O
that _ _ O
Stefano _ _ O
Secchi, _ _ O
Rezdôra's _ _ B-EST
chef _ _ O
and _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
owners, _ _ O
had _ _ O
just _ _ O
laid _ _ O
down _ _ O
a _ _ O
straight _ _ O
flush. _ _ O
The _ _ O
tortellini _ _ B-FOOD
were _ _ O
penny-size _ _ O
hoops _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
around _ _ O
minced _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ I-FOOD
blended _ _ I-FOOD
pork _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
parcel _ _ O
just _ _ O
big _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
suggest _ _ O
the _ _ O
idea _ _ O
of _ _ O
meat. _ _ B-FOOD
"This _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
special _ _ O
broth _ _ B-FOOD
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
older _ _ O
chickens," _ _ O
a _ _ O
server _ _ O
said _ _ O
as _ _ O
he _ _ O
poured _ _ O
a _ _ O
steaming _ _ O
liquid _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
kettle _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
tortellini. _ _ B-FOOD
It _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
turkey _ _ B-FOOD
gravy. _ _ I-FOOD
The _ _ O
broth _ _ B-FOOD
spent _ _ O
about _ _ O
half _ _ O
a _ _ O
day _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
burner; _ _ O
drew _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
power _ _ O
from _ _ O
melted _ _ B-FOOD
Parmigiano-Reggiano; _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
was _ _ O
more _ _ O
intense _ _ O
than _ _ O
canned _ _ B-FOOD
chicken _ _ I-FOOD
broth _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
roughly _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
way _ _ O
that _ _ O
a _ _ O
dry-aged _ _ B-FOOD
rib-eye _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
intense _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
McDonald's _ _ B-FOOD
all-beef _ _ I-FOOD
patty. _ _ I-FOOD
This _ _ O
was _ _ O
followed _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
smooth, _ _ O
almost _ _ O
fluffy _ _ O
tomato-basil _ _ B-FOOD
sauce _ _ I-FOOD
over _ _ O
maccheroni _ _ B-FOOD
al _ _ I-FOOD
pettine, _ _ I-FOOD
delicate _ _ O
tubes _ _ O
with _ _ O
ridges _ _ O
they _ _ O
get _ _ O
from _ _ O
being _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
by _ _ O
hand _ _ O
along _ _ O
a _ _ O
comb _ _ O
made _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
job. _ _ O
Three _ _ O
straw-colored _ _ O
blobs _ _ O
that _ _ O
looked _ _ O
like _ _ O
melted _ _ B-FOOD
Brie _ _ I-FOOD
turned _ _ O
out _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
glossy _ _ O
and _ _ O
wonderful _ _ O
fonduta _ _ B-FOOD
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
Parmigiano-Reggiano. _ _ B-FOOD
From _ _ O
there _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
on _ _ O
to _ _ O
tortelloni, _ _ B-FOOD
each _ _ O
about _ _ O
three _ _ O
bites _ _ O
big, _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
plush _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
ricotta _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
shiny _ _ O
with _ _ O
melted _ _ B-FOOD
brown _ _ I-FOOD
butter _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
sage _ _ B-FOOD
leaves _ _ I-FOOD
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
bubbled. _ _ O
If _ _ O
we _ _ O
are _ _ O
talking _ _ O
about _ _ O
Emilia-Romagna _ _ B-LOC
we _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
talk _ _ O
about _ _ O
ragù, _ _ B-DISH
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
next _ _ O
course, _ _ O
tossed _ _ O
with _ _ O
slim _ _ O
ribbons _ _ O
of _ _ O
tagliolini. _ _ B-FOOD
Some _ _ O
people _ _ O
will _ _ O
find _ _ O
the _ _ O
ragù _ _ B-DISH
saltier _ _ O
than _ _ O
they _ _ O
like. _ _ O
Almost _ _ O
everyone _ _ O
will _ _ O
find _ _ O
it _ _ O
more _ _ O
tender _ _ O
and _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
20 _ _ O
or _ _ O
30 _ _ O
ragús _ _ B-FOOD
they _ _ O
ate. _ _ O

They _ _ O
are _ _ O

in _ _ O
something _ _ O

you _ _ O
will _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
far _ _ O
off _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
imagine _ _ O
an _ _ O

sauce _ _ I-FOOD
cooked _ _ O
for _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
more _ _ O
sybaritic _ _ O

emperors. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
Rome, _ _ B-LOC
though, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O

gets _ _ O
the _ _ O

from _ _ O

the _ _ O

Mr. _ _ O
Bottura's _ _ O

seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
rubbed _ _ O
off _ _ O
on _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O

more _ _ O
than _ _ O
his _ _ O

did. _ _ O
At _ _ O

you _ _ O
are _ _ O
unlikely _ _ O
to _ _ O
catch _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
using _ _ O
any _ _ O
overtly _ _ O
modernist _ _ O
techniques, _ _ O
but _ _ O
you _ _ O
may _ _ O
well _ _ O
encounter _ _ O
"cherry _ _ B-DISH

Vignola," _ _ I-DISH
a _ _ O
pleasant _ _ O

"cow _ _ B-DISH

"Grandma _ _ B-DISH

seems _ _ O
to _ _ O

Before _ _ O
leaving _ _ O
Italy, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Secchi _ _ O
also _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
at _ _ O
Antica _ _ O
Moka _ _ O
in _ _ O
Modena _ _ O
and _ _ O
All'Enoteca _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Piedmont; _ _ O
after _ _ O
coming _ _ O
back _ _ O
home _ _ O
to _ _ O
Dallas, _ _ O
where _ _ O
he _ _ O
grew _ _ O
up, _ _ O
he _ _ O
ran _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchens _ _ O
of _ _ O
two _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
his _ _ O
parents _ _ O
own _ _ O
there. _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
I _ _ O
suspect _ _ O
the _ _ O
Bottura _ _ O
connection _ _ O
is _ _ O
responsible _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
speed _ _ O
with _ _ O
which _ _ O
the _ _ O
bar _ _ O
stools _ _ O
fill _ _ O
up _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
opens _ _ O
at _ _ O
5:30 _ _ O
each _ _ O
night, _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
difficulty _ _ O
of _ _ O
reserving _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
48 _ _ O
seats, _ _ O
and _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
would-be _ _ O
customers _ _ O
collect _ _ O
in _ _ O
eddies _ _ O
outside _ _ O
the _ _ O
door _ _ O
to _ _ O
strategize. _ _ O
Not _ _ O
much _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
interior _ _ O
is _ _ O
likely _ _ O
to _ _ O
lure _ _ O
crowds; _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O
brick _ _ O
walls, _ _ O
timbered _ _ O
ceiling _ _ O
and _ _ O
bare _ _ O
wood _ _ O
tables, _ _ O
it _ _ O
looks _ _ O
like _ _ O
any _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
Manhattan _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
that _ _ O
emulate _ _ O
the _ _ O
trattorias, _ _ O
enotecas _ _ O
and _ _ O
osterias _ _ O
of _ _ O
Italy. _ _ O
And _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
eat _ _ O
at _ _ O
Rezdôra _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
way _ _ O
of _ _ O
becoming _ _ O
repeat _ _ O
customers. _ _ O
They _ _ O
come _ _ O
back _ _ O
even _ _ O
though _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
a _ _ O
young _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
and _ _ O
occasionally _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
young _ _ O
restaurant's _ _ O
mistakes. _ _ O
One _ _ O
night, _ _ O
the _ _ O
stewed _ _ O
cannellini _ _ O
beans _ _ O
placed _ _ O
alongside _ _ O
black _ _ O
sea _ _ O
bass _ _ O
and _ _ O
black _ _ O
garlic _ _ O
zabaglione _ _ O
were _ _ O
still _ _ O
crunchy; _ _ O
the _ _ O
rock _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
strozzapreti _ _ O
could _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
less _ _ O
tough _ _ O
and _ _ O
tasted _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
shrimpier. _ _ O
And _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
original _ _ O
pastas _ _ O
aren't _ _ O
quite _ _ O
as _ _ O
stunning _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
classics, _ _ O
but _ _ O
then _ _ O
every _ _ O
grandmother _ _ O
in _ _ O
Emilia-Romagna _ _ O
could _ _ O
have _ _ O
told _ _ O
you _ _ O
that. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Secchi _ _ O
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
appealing _ _ O
new _ _ O
talents _ _ O
in _ _ O
years _ _ O
to _ _ O
enter _ _ O
the _ _ O
city's _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
scene, _ _ O
the _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
cook _ _ O
who _ _ O
can _ _ O
unite _ _ O
ordinary _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
just _ _ O
like _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat _ _ O
pasta _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
fanatics _ _ O
who _ _ O
collect _ _ O
menus _ _ O
from _ _ O
Osteria _ _ O
Francescana. _ _ O
(The _ _ O
date-stamped _ _ O

He _ _ O
also _ _ O
has _ _ O
the _ _ O
good _ _ O

to _ _ O

either _ _ O

into _ _ O

There _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
more _ _ O
workplace _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
hope _ _ O
has _ _ O
left _ _ O
a _ _ O
mark _ _ O
on _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Secchi: _ _ O
his _ _ O

restaurants _ _ O
in _ _ O

both _ _ O
of _ _ O
which _ _ O
are _ _ O
called _ _ O

The _ _ O

since _ _ O
1983, _ _ O
a _ _ O
life _ _ O

that _ _ O
any _ _ O

would _ _ O
envy. _ _ O
The _ _ O
odds _ _ O
are _ _ O
against _ _ O

around _ _ O
36 _ _ O
years _ _ O
from _ _ O
now, _ _ O
but _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O

In _ _ O
the _ _ O
fall _ _ O
of _ _ O
1980, _ _ O
Patrick _ _ O
Clark, _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
chef _ _ O
at _ _ O
Keith _ _ O
McNally's _ _ O
first _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Odeon _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
helped _ _ O
introduce _ _ O
nouvelle _ _ B-CUISINE
cuisine _ _ O
to _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
rage _ _ O
in _ _ O
Europe. _ _ B-LOC
Nearly _ _ O
every _ _ O
place _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
McNally _ _ O
has _ _ O
built _ _ O
since _ _ O
then _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
a _ _ O
firm _ _ O
rejection _ _ O
of _ _ O
all _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
fashionable _ _ O
in _ _ O
food, _ _ O
and _ _ O
each _ _ O
one _ _ O
has _ _ O
been, _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
first _ _ O
few _ _ O
months, _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
fashionable _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
town. _ _ O
The _ _ O
one _ _ O
he _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
early _ _ O
June _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
meatpacking _ _ B-LOC
district, _ _ I-LOC
Pastis _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
was _ _ O
assembled _ _ O
partly _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
salvaged _ _ O
bones _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
nearby _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
he _ _ O
closed _ _ O
five _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
Pastis. _ _ B-EST
(He _ _ O
salvaged _ _ O
the _ _ O
name, _ _ O
too.) _ _ O
The _ _ O
onion _ _ B-FOOD
soup, _ _ I-FOOD
the _ _ O
meaty _ _ O
snails _ _ B-FOOD
sloshing _ _ O
around _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
divots _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
black _ _ O
iron _ _ O
snail _ _ O
pan _ _ O
with _ _ O
what _ _ O
must _ _ O
be _ _ O
half _ _ O
a _ _ O
pint _ _ O
of _ _ O
garlic _ _ B-FOOD
butter, _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
other _ _ O
old _ _ O
war _ _ O
horses _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
original _ _ O
menu _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
summoned _ _ O
for _ _ O
one _ _ O
more _ _ O
joust _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
battlefield. _ _ O
In _ _ O
short, _ _ O
the _ _ O
new _ _ O
Pastis _ _ B-EST
takes _ _ O
almost _ _ O
everything _ _ O
straight _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
old _ _ O
Pastis _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
which _ _ O
in _ _ O
turn _ _ O
took _ _ O
almost _ _ O
everything _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
stodgiest, _ _ O
least _ _ O
trend-conscious _ _ O
sort _ _ O
of _ _ O
French _ _ B-CUISINE
cafes _ _ B-TYPE
and _ _ O
brasseries. _ _ B-TYPE
Needless _ _ O
to _ _ O
say, _ _ O
reservations _ _ O
are _ _ O
harder _ _ O
to _ _ O
come _ _ O
by _ _ O
than _ _ O
at _ _ O
any _ _ O
other _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
restaurant _ _ O
that's _ _ O
opened _ _ O
this _ _ O
year. _ _ O
The _ _ O
paradox _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
Pastis _ _ B-EST
is _ _ O
really _ _ O
meant _ _ O
for _ _ O
those _ _ O
nights _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
decide _ _ O
to _ _ O
cancel _ _ O
your _ _ O
reservations _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
little _ _ O
nine-seat _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
counter _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
inspired _ _ O
by _ _ O
Kieslowski's _ _ O
"Decalogue." _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
for _ _ O
those _ _ O
times _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
get _ _ O
an _ _ O
urge _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat _ _ O
a _ _ O
Gruyère _ _ B-DISH
omelet _ _ I-DISH
after _ _ O
10 _ _ O
p.m., _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
medium-rare, _ _ O
flecked _ _ O
with _ _ O
herbs, _ _ B-FOOD
skillfully _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
and _ _ O
staunchly _ _ O
backed _ _ O
up _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
cold _ _ O
white _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
Savoie. _ _ O
Urges _ _ O
like _ _ O
that _ _ O
do _ _ O
not _ _ O
typically _ _ O
announce _ _ O
themselves _ _ O
three _ _ O
weeks _ _ O
in _ _ O
advance, _ _ O
and _ _ O
they _ _ O
don't _ _ O
tend _ _ O
to _ _ O
survive _ _ O
exposure _ _ O
to _ _ O
rooms _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
have _ _ O
read _ _ O
about _ _ O
Pastis _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
blogs _ _ O
but _ _ O
haven't _ _ O
yet _ _ O
figured _ _ O
out _ _ O
what _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
for. _ _ O
For _ _ O
much _ _ O
of _ _ O
his _ _ O
life, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
McNally _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
chipping, _ _ O
cracking, _ _ O
distressing _ _ O
and _ _ O
weathering _ _ O
interiors _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
architectural _ _ O
equivalent _ _ O
of _ _ O
rumpled _ _ O
sweaters _ _ O
two _ _ O
sizes _ _ O
too _ _ O
large. _ _ O
Perhaps _ _ O
the _ _ O
largest _ _ O
and _ _ O
certainly _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
rumpled _ _ O
of _ _ O
all _ _ O
is _ _ O
Pastis. _ _ O
It _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
have _ _ O
the _ _ O
corner _ _ O
entrance _ _ O
it _ _ O
had _ _ O
at _ _ O
its _ _ O
former _ _ O
address, _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
long _ _ O
communal _ _ O
table _ _ O
that _ _ O
sliced _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
front _ _ O
room _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
surfboard. _ _ O
And _ _ O
the _ _ O
shelves _ _ O
of _ _ O
cigarette _ _ O
packs _ _ O
are _ _ O
definitely _ _ O
gone. _ _ O
( _ _ O
You _ _ O
could _ _ O
still _ _ O
smoke _ _ O
in _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
in _ _ O
1999, _ _ O
when _ _ O
Pastis _ _ O
opened.) _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
magazine _ _ O
racks _ _ O
are _ _ O
back, _ _ O
along _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
overhead _ _ O
fans _ _ O
turning _ _ O
steadily _ _ O
below _ _ O
a _ _ O
stamped _ _ O
tin _ _ O
ceiling. _ _ O
Once _ _ O
again _ _ O
the _ _ O
walls _ _ O
are _ _ O
covered _ _ O
with _ _ O
chipped _ _ O
subway _ _ O
tiles, _ _ O
white, _ _ O
framed _ _ O
by _ _ O
black _ _ O
grout. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chairs _ _ O
still _ _ O
don't _ _ O
match. _ _ O
The _ _ O
ambient _ _ O
light _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
Scotch _ _ O
and _ _ O
soda _ _ O
and _ _ O
makes _ _ O
everybody _ _ O
look _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
they _ _ O
do _ _ O
after _ _ O
you've _ _ O
drunk _ _ O
one. _ _ O
On _ _ O
an _ _ O
antique _ _ O
mirror, _ _ O
or _ _ O
one _ _ O
that _ _ O
looks _ _ O
like _ _ O
an _ _ O
antique, _ _ O
someone _ _ O
has _ _ O
scrawled _ _ O
a _ _ O
menu _ _ O
of _ _ O
desserts, _ _ O
almost _ _ O
none _ _ O
of _ _ O
which _ _ O
Pastis _ _ O
actually _ _ O
serves. _ _ O
You _ _ O
can, _ _ O
however, _ _ O
get _ _ O
an _ _ O
energetically _ _ O
whisked _ _ O
dark-chocolate _ _ O
mousse _ _ O
under _ _ O
shaved _ _ O
curls _ _ O
of _ _ O
chocolate, _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
baba _ _ O
au _ _ O
rhum _ _ O
so _ _ O
drenched _ _ O
in _ _ O
booze _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
might _ _ O
spontaneously _ _ O
combust _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
weren't _ _ O
being _ _ O
restrained _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
white _ _ O
dune _ _ O
of _ _ O
whipped _ _ O
Chantilly _ _ O
cream. _ _ O
The _ _ O
most _ _ O
significant _ _ O
change _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
Pastis _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
second _ _ O
happened _ _ O
offstage. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
McNally, _ _ O
who _ _ O
had _ _ O
a _ _ O
stroke _ _ O
two _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
has _ _ O
brought _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurateur _ _ O
Stephen _ _ O
Starr _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
partner _ _ O
who, _ _ O
essentially, _ _ O
manages _ _ O
everything _ _ O
except _ _ O
the _ _ O
design. _ _ O
Familiar _ _ O
faces _ _ O
from _ _ O
La _ _ O
Mercerie _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
Starr _ _ O
enterprises _ _ O
work _ _ O
alongside _ _ O
loyal _ _ O
retainers _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
McNally _ _ O
empire. _ _ O
The _ _ O
McNally _ _ O
troops _ _ O
are _ _ O
exquisitely _ _ O
poised, _ _ O
self-assured, _ _ O
able _ _ O
to _ _ O
spot _ _ O
a _ _ O
misplaced _ _ O
butter _ _ O
knife _ _ O
from _ _ O
across _ _ O
the _ _ O
street. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Starr _ _ O
cadre _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
casual, _ _ O
and _ _ O
occasionally _ _ O
a _ _ O
server _ _ O
will _ _ O
ask _ _ O
your _ _ O
opinion _ _ O
of _ _ O
"the _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
so _ _ O
far," _ _ O
a _ _ O
question _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
surely _ _ O
never _ _ O
been _ _ O
uttered _ _ O
at _ _ O
Minetta _ _ O
Tavern _ _ O
. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Starr _ _ O
has _ _ O
oversight _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
wine _ _ O
list, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
less _ _ O
conservative _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
typical _ _ O
McNally _ _ O
lineup, _ _ O
and _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
food, _ _ O
which _ _ O
has _ _ O
not _ _ O
been _ _ O
a _ _ O
strong _ _ O
suit _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
McNally _ _ O
organization _ _ O
since _ _ O
the _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
Lee _ _ O
Hanson _ _ O
and _ _ O
Riad _ _ O
Nasr _ _ O
went _ _ O
out _ _ O
on _ _ O
their _ _ O
own. _ _ O
Pastis's _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Michael _ _ O
Abt, _ _ O
was _ _ O
until _ _ O
recently _ _ O
in _ _ O
charge _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
Washington _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
Le _ _ O
Diplomate _ _ O
, _ _ O
which _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Starr _ _ O
owns. _ _ O
Better _ _ O
qualifications _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
conjure, _ _ O
given _ _ O
that _ _ O
Le _ _ O
Diplomate _ _ O
is _ _ O
essentially _ _ O
an _ _ O
imitation _ _ O
McNally _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
Taking _ _ O
his _ _ O
cues _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
old _ _ O
days, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Abt _ _ O
is _ _ O
putting _ _ O
out _ _ O
simple, _ _ O
unadorned, _ _ O
hunger-obliterating _ _ O
French _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
drawn _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
era _ _ O
before _ _ O
supermarkets _ _ O
and _ _ O
fast _ _ O
food. _ _ O
The _ _ O
salad _ _ O
of _ _ O
pickled _ _ O
herring _ _ O
and _ _ O
carrots _ _ O
with _ _ O
boiled _ _ O
potatoes _ _ O
might _ _ O
come _ _ O
straight _ _ O
from _ _ O
Brasserie _ _ O
Lipp _ _ O
. _ _ O
The _ _ O
country _ _ O
pâté _ _ O
is _ _ O
laden _ _ O
with _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
livers _ _ O
and _ _ O
riddled _ _ O
with _ _ O
soft _ _ O
white _ _ O
pork _ _ O
fat _ _ O
in _ _ O
gobs _ _ O
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
of _ _ O
gumdrops, _ _ O
although _ _ O
it _ _ O
could _ _ O
stand _ _ O
more _ _ O
salt, _ _ O
and _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
be _ _ O
happy _ _ O
to _ _ O
trade _ _ O
the _ _ O
slab _ _ O
of _ _ O
butter _ _ O
that _ _ O
comes _ _ O
with _ _ O
it _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
pot _ _ O
of _ _ O
mustard. _ _ O
The _ _ O
pâté _ _ O
is _ _ O
made _ _ O
in _ _ O
house, _ _ O
as _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
gorgeously _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
boudin _ _ O
blanc. _ _ O
With _ _ O
the _ _ O
boudin, _ _ O
you _ _ O
want _ _ O
puréed _ _ O
potatoes _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
almost _ _ O
liquid. _ _ O
That _ _ O
is _ _ O
what _ _ O
you _ _ O
get. _ _ O
You _ _ O
might _ _ O
argue _ _ O
that, _ _ O
when _ _ O
it _ _ O
offers _ _ O
chilled _ _ O
king _ _ O
crab _ _ O
legs _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
dipped _ _ O
in _ _ O
aioli, _ _ O
this _ _ O
unextravagant _ _ O
cafe _ _ O
breaks _ _ O
character. _ _ O
Does _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
apply _ _ O
to _ _ O
garnishing _ _ O
sardines _ _ O
served _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
can _ _ O
with _ _ O
an _ _ O
ingot _ _ O
of _ _ O
prized, _ _ O
costly _ _ O
butter _ _ O
made _ _ O
by _ _ O
Jean-Yves _ _ O
Bordier? _ _ O
Maybe. _ _ O
I _ _ O
thought, _ _ O
in _ _ O
any _ _ O
case, _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
sardines _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
olive _ _ O
oil _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
packed _ _ O
in _ _ O
tended _ _ O
to _ _ O
talk _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
butter. _ _ O
The _ _ O
half _ _ O
roast _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
class _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
birds _ _ O
that _ _ O
Antoine _ _ O
Westermann _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
when _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
still _ _ O
at _ _ O
Le _ _ O
Coq _ _ O
Rico _ _ O
, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
probably _ _ O
as _ _ O
good _ _ O
a _ _ O
roast _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
as _ _ O
any _ _ O
normal _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
can _ _ O
produce. _ _ O
The _ _ O
duck _ _ O
in _ _ O
olives, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
is _ _ O
misconceived; _ _ O
the _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
is _ _ O
thin, _ _ O
acrid _ _ O
and _ _ O
one-dimensional _ _ O
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
head-spinningly _ _ O
rich, _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
at _ _ O
Allard _ _ O
in _ _ O
Paris _ _ O
. _ _ O
The _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
-- _ _ O
the _ _ O
trout _ _ O
amandine _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O
sautéed _ _ O
skin _ _ O
taut _ _ O
beneath _ _ O
its _ _ O
armor _ _ O
of _ _ O
toasted _ _ O
almonds; _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
mussels _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
broth _ _ O
that's _ _ O
satiny _ _ O
with _ _ O
melted _ _ O
butter; _ _ O
an _ _ O
entire _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
branzino _ _ O
with _ _ O
enough _ _ O
crisp _ _ O
summer _ _ O
vegetables _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
a _ _ O
salad _ _ O
-- _ _ O
is _ _ O
very _ _ O
appealing, _ _ O
though _ _ O
that _ _ O
won't _ _ O
stop _ _ O
the _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
are _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
steak _ _ O
frites _ _ O
without _ _ O
even _ _ O
a _ _ O
glance _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
Those _ _ O
people _ _ O
may _ _ O
get _ _ O
fries _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
and _ _ O
golden, _ _ O
or _ _ O
they _ _ O
might _ _ O
end _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
limp, _ _ O
oily _ _ O
batch, _ _ O
or _ _ O
they _ _ O
may _ _ O
get _ _ O
both _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
night, _ _ O
as _ _ O
I _ _ O
did. _ _ O
At _ _ O
the _ _ O
length _ _ O
of _ _ O
20 _ _ O
years, _ _ O
memories _ _ O
are _ _ O
untrustworthy, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
reasonably _ _ O
sure _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
at _ _ O
Pastis _ _ O
is _ _ O
better _ _ O
than _ _ O
it _ _ O
used _ _ O
to _ _ O
be. _ _ O
The _ _ O
wine _ _ O
is _ _ O
certainly _ _ O
more _ _ O
interesting. _ _ O
What's _ _ O
gone, _ _ O
and _ _ O
won't _ _ O
be _ _ O
back _ _ O
now _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
surrounding _ _ O

like _ _ O

The _ _ O
high _ _ O
cost _ _ O
of _ _ O
doing _ _ O
business _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
takes _ _ O
a _ _ O
toll _ _ O
on _ _ O
many _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
long _ _ O
run, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
can _ _ O
also _ _ O
lead _ _ O
to _ _ O
compromises _ _ O
whose _ _ O
shortcomings _ _ O
become _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O

-- _ _ O
for _ _ O
diners, _ _ B-TYPE
at _ _ O
least. _ _ O
If _ _ O
Darryl _ _ O

had _ _ O
been _ _ O
able _ _ O
to _ _ O
afford _ _ O
to _ _ O

for _ _ O
their _ _ O

Belle _ _ B-EST
Harlem _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Burnette _ _ O
might _ _ O
do _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
behind _ _ O
a _ _ O
wall _ _ O
instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
behind _ _ O
a _ _ O
counter. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Burnette, _ _ O
his _ _ O
wife _ _ O
and _ _ O
business _ _ O
partner, _ _ O
might _ _ O
spend _ _ O
all _ _ O
night _ _ O
going _ _ O
in _ _ O
and _ _ O
out _ _ O
a _ _ O
swinging _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O

instead _ _ O
of _ _ O
paying _ _ O
attention _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O

sitting _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
12 _ _ O

in _ _ O
the _ _ O

At _ _ O
this _ _ O
point, _ _ O
after _ _ O
three _ _ O
years _ _ O
in _ _ O
business, _ _ O
Belle _ _ B-EST
Harlem _ _ I-EST
might _ _ O
be _ _ O
run _ _ O
by _ _ O

the _ _ O

might _ _ O
come _ _ O
in _ _ O

a _ _ O
week _ _ O
to _ _ O
keep _ _ O
an _ _ O
eye _ _ O

they _ _ O

a _ _ O

of _ _ O
one. _ _ O
His _ _ O

is _ _ O
Alex _ _ O
Geudelekian. _ _ O
He _ _ O
was _ _ O
eating _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
there _ _ O
one _ _ O
night, _ _ O
noticed _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
weeds _ _ O
were _ _ O
growing _ _ O
up _ _ O
around _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Burnette's _ _ O
ankles, _ _ O
asked _ _ O
if _ _ O
he _ _ O
needed _ _ O
help, _ _ O
and _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
the _ _ O
sous-chef _ _ O
ever _ _ O

being _ _ O
seared _ _ O
on _ _ O

of _ _ O
the _ _ O

of _ _ O
Adam _ _ B-LOC

You _ _ O
might _ _ O
not _ _ O
hear _ _ O
the _ _ O
hiss _ _ O
of _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-FOOD
being _ _ O
fried _ _ O
inside _ _ O
buttermilk _ _ B-FOOD

before _ _ O
it _ _ O

of _ _ O
truffled _ _ B-FOOD
maple _ _ I-FOOD

warmed _ _ O
with _ _ O

If _ _ O
you _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
hear _ _ O
the _ _ O
low _ _ O
roar _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O

torch _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
warms _ _ O
a _ _ O

and _ _ O

you _ _ O
might _ _ O
not _ _ O

you're _ _ O
about _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
served _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Burnette's _ _ O
cheese-steak _ _ B-DISH

(These _ _ O

small _ _ O
toasts _ _ B-FOOD
stacked _ _ O
with _ _ O

until _ _ O
they're _ _ O

enough _ _ O
to _ _ O

The _ _ O

would _ _ O
cause _ _ O
every _ _ O

who _ _ O
lives _ _ O
within _ _ O
10 _ _ O
blocks _ _ O
of _ _ O
East _ _ B-LOC
Passyunk _ _ I-LOC
Avenue _ _ I-LOC
to _ _ O
pick _ _ O
up _ _ O
the _ _ O
nearest _ _ O
blunt _ _ O
object, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
certain _ _ O
amount _ _ O
of _ _ O
sense _ _ O
when _ _ O
you _ _ O
taste _ _ O
it.) _ _ O
Some _ _ O
of _ _ O
Belle _ _ B-EST
Harlem's _ _ I-EST
space _ _ O
limitations _ _ O
are, _ _ O
in _ _ O
fact, _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
constricting. _ _ O
When _ _ O
the _ _ O
place _ _ O
is _ _ O
full, _ _ O
some _ _ O
customers _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
ride _ _ O
sidesaddle, _ _ O
their _ _ O
knees _ _ O
angled _ _ O
away _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
counter, _ _ O
because _ _ O
if _ _ O
they _ _ O
faced _ _ O
it _ _ O
head-on _ _ O
they'd _ _ O
cut _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
narrow _ _ O
path _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
restroom _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
back. _ _ O
But _ _ O
275 _ _ O
square _ _ O
feet _ _ O
are _ _ O
what _ _ O
the _ _ O
Burnettes _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
work _ _ O
with, _ _ O
and _ _ O
they _ _ O
have _ _ O
made _ _ O
this _ _ O
shallow _ _ O
sliver _ _ O
into _ _ O
something _ _ O
rare _ _ O
not _ _ O
just _ _ O
in _ _ O
Harlem _ _ B-LOC
but _ _ O
in _ _ O
all _ _ O
Manhattan. _ _ B-LOC
One _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
peculiarities _ _ O
of _ _ O
dining _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
city, _ _ O
circa _ _ O
2019, _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
more _ _ O
high-functioning _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
is, _ _ O
the _ _ O
less _ _ O
likely _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
to _ _ O
encounter _ _ O
a _ _ O
proprietor. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
exceptions, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
but _ _ O
often _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
successful _ _ O
restaurateurs _ _ O
are _ _ O
very _ _ O
busy _ _ O
people, _ _ O
so _ _ O
they _ _ O
leave _ _ O
their _ _ O
dining _ _ O
rooms _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
hands _ _ O
of _ _ O
professional _ _ O
managers. _ _ O
Proprietors _ _ O
aren't _ _ O
always _ _ O
as _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
as _ _ O
professionals, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
as _ _ O
attuned _ _ O
to _ _ O
what _ _ O
goes _ _ O
on _ _ O
in _ _ O
their _ _ O
dining _ _ O
rooms _ _ O
as _ _ O
new _ _ O
parents _ _ O
are _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
noises _ _ O
coming _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
bassinet. _ _ O
I _ _ O
never _ _ O
quite _ _ O
felt _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
I _ _ O
were _ _ O
attending _ _ O
a _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
party _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Burnettes' _ _ O
apartment, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
feeling _ _ O
they _ _ O
say _ _ O
they're _ _ O
going _ _ O
for, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
always _ _ O
knew _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
place _ _ O
that _ _ O
somebody _ _ O
cared _ _ O
about. _ _ O
Their _ _ O
original _ _ O
plan _ _ O
was _ _ O
to _ _ O
feed _ _ O
everyone _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
meal _ _ O
-- _ _ O
a _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
"We _ _ O
found _ _ O
out _ _ O
pretty _ _ O
quickly _ _ O
Harlem _ _ O
wasn't _ _ O
ready," _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Burnette _ _ O
said _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
interview. _ _ O
How _ _ O
quickly? _ _ O
"We _ _ O
tried _ _ O
one _ _ O
night." _ _ O
Belle _ _ O
Harlem _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
out _ _ O
an _ _ O
à _ _ O
la _ _ O
carte _ _ O
menu _ _ O
the _ _ O
next _ _ O
day. _ _ O
It _ _ O
stuck. _ _ O
The _ _ O
first _ _ O
half _ _ O
is _ _ O
given _ _ O
to _ _ O
smaller _ _ O
plates, _ _ O
although _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
hallmarks _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
Burnettes _ _ O
don't _ _ O
serve _ _ O
anything _ _ O
truly _ _ O
small. _ _ O
They _ _ O
want _ _ O
you _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat. _ _ O
Two _ _ O
people _ _ O
could _ _ O
get _ _ O
away _ _ O
with _ _ O
ordering _ _ O
one _ _ O
main _ _ O
course _ _ O
and _ _ O
two _ _ O
appetizers, _ _ O
though _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
urge _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
Belle _ _ B-EST
Harlem _ _ I-EST
not _ _ O
to _ _ O
overlook _ _ O
dessert. _ _ O
These _ _ O
introductory _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
are _ _ O
where _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Burnette _ _ O
takes _ _ O
casual _ _ B-CUISINE
American _ _ I-CUISINE
vernacular _ _ I-CUISINE
food _ _ O
like _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-DISH
and _ _ I-DISH
waffles _ _ I-DISH
out _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
stroll. _ _ O
His _ _ O
fried _ _ B-FOOD
chicken _ _ I-FOOD
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
convoluted, _ _ O
frilly _ _ O
crust, _ _ O
with _ _ O
plenty _ _ O
of _ _ O
golden _ _ O
surface _ _ O
area _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
jalapeño-banana _ _ B-FOOD
syrup _ _ I-FOOD
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
lost _ _ O
in. _ _ O
The _ _ O
pizzelles _ _ B-FOOD
are _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
idea _ _ O
of _ _ O
his, _ _ O
replacing _ _ O
the _ _ O
regular _ _ O
waffles _ _ B-FOOD
he _ _ O
used _ _ O
to _ _ O
make, _ _ O
and _ _ O
they _ _ O
work _ _ O
best _ _ O
when _ _ O
he _ _ O
cooks _ _ O
them _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark _ _ O
crisp. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
where _ _ O
you'll _ _ O
find _ _ O
the _ _ O
cheese-steak _ _ B-DISH
crostini, _ _ I-DISH
as _ _ O
well _ _ O
as _ _ O
spring _ _ B-FOOD
rolls _ _ I-FOOD
stuffed _ _ O
with _ _ O
macaroni _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ I-FOOD
cheese _ _ I-FOOD
-- _ _ O
kid _ _ O
food _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
fried _ _ O
shell, _ _ O
yes, _ _ O
but _ _ O
a _ _ O
bacon _ _ B-FOOD
marmalade _ _ I-FOOD
with _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
dill _ _ B-FOOD
makes _ _ O
it _ _ O
unexpectedly _ _ O
complex, _ _ O
a _ _ O
chef's _ _ O
dish. _ _ O
The _ _ O
bottom _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
substantial: _ _ O
The _ _ O
pan-seared, _ _ B-DISH
smoked _ _ I-DISH
pork _ _ I-DISH
tenderloin, _ _ I-DISH
for _ _ O
instance, _ _ O
is _ _ O
bigger _ _ O
than _ _ O
what _ _ O
usually _ _ O
crosses _ _ O
a _ _ O
12-seat _ _ O
tasting _ _ O
counter. _ _ O
This _ _ O
month, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Burnette _ _ O
is _ _ O
laying _ _ O
the _ _ O
barrels _ _ O
of _ _ O
pork _ _ B-FOOD
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
cherry _ _ B-FOOD
compote _ _ I-FOOD
with _ _ O
basil _ _ B-FOOD
leaves, _ _ I-FOOD
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
snap _ _ O
peas _ _ O
for _ _ O
added _ _ O
sweetness. _ _ O
He _ _ O
brings _ _ O
a _ _ O
keen _ _ O
sense _ _ O
of _ _ O
what _ _ O
to _ _ O
do _ _ O
with _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
as _ _ O
they _ _ O
come _ _ O
into _ _ O
season _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
vegetables _ _ O
he _ _ O
grows _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
roof _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Burnettes' _ _ O
apartment _ _ O
building, _ _ O
a _ _ O
block _ _ O
away. _ _ O
The _ _ O
tiny _ _ O
yields _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
urban _ _ O
garden _ _ O
wouldn't _ _ O
satisfy _ _ O
a _ _ O
larger _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
but _ _ O
they _ _ O
can _ _ O
shuffle _ _ O
right _ _ O
onto _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
at _ _ O
Belle _ _ O
Harlem, _ _ O
and _ _ O
shuffle _ _ O
off _ _ O
again _ _ O
when _ _ O
they're _ _ O
all _ _ O
gone. _ _ O
This _ _ O
month, _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
thin _ _ O
bands _ _ O
of _ _ O
zucchini _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
beef _ _ O
tenderloin, _ _ O
and _ _ O
young, _ _ O
soft _ _ O
favas _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
lobster _ _ O
salad. _ _ O
There _ _ O

transparently _ _ O
thin _ _ O

tossed _ _ O
with _ _ O
butter _ _ O
and _ _ O

Mr. _ _ O

who _ _ O
is _ _ O
black _ _ O
and _ _ O
who _ _ O
grew _ _ O
up _ _ O
in _ _ O
rural _ _ O
southwestern _ _ O
Virginia, _ _ O
has _ _ O
said _ _ O
he _ _ O
worked _ _ O
up _ _ O
the _ _ O

to _ _ O

after _ _ O
seeing _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
Marcus _ _ O
Samuelsson _ _ O
on _ _ O
television _ _ O
. _ _ O
("I _ _ O
thought, _ _ O
hell, _ _ O
if _ _ O
he _ _ O
could _ _ O
do _ _ O
it, _ _ O
I _ _ O
could _ _ O
do _ _ O
it, _ _ O
too.") _ _ O
Sometimes _ _ O
today, _ _ O
in _ _ O
his _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
less _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
mile _ _ O
away _ _ O
from _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Samuelsson's _ _ O
Red _ _ O
Rooster _ _ O
Harlem _ _ O
, _ _ O
he _ _ O

back _ _ O

A _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
glass _ _ O
called _ _ O
the _ _ O
Triflin' _ _ O
Ho-Ho _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
acknowledged _ _ O
homage _ _ O
to _ _ O
Hostess _ _ O
cakes, _ _ O
although _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
English _ _ O
trifle _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
mix, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
as _ _ O
well _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
trace _ _ O
of _ _ O
Spice _ _ O
Market _ _ O
, _ _ O
where _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Burnette _ _ O
once _ _ O
worked. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chocolate _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
broken _ _ O
shards _ _ O
of _ _ O
cake _ _ O
pulses, _ _ O
intriguingly, _ _ O
with _ _ O
Urfa _ _ O
pepper; _ _ O
its _ _ O
heat _ _ O
rubs _ _ O
up _ _ O
against _ _ O
the _ _ O
passion-fruit _ _ O
cream, _ _ O
brandied _ _ O
cherries _ _ O
and _ _ O
whipped _ _ O
cream _ _ O
that _ _ O
fill _ _ O
the _ _ O
glass. _ _ O
A _ _ O
year _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
Belle _ _ O
Harlem _ _ O
eliminated _ _ O
tips _ _ O
and _ _ O
raised _ _ O
prices. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
take _ _ O
that _ _ O
into _ _ O
account, _ _ O
check _ _ O
totals _ _ O
can _ _ O
still _ _ O
seem _ _ O
high, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
happen _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
served _ _ O
pale, _ _ O
limp _ _ O
housemade _ _ O
potato _ _ O
chips _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
$42 _ _ O
duck _ _ O
breast _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
bitter _ _ O
arugula _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
poached _ _ O
pear _ _ O
that _ _ O
tastes _ _ O
like _ _ O
alcohol. _ _ O
The _ _ O
margins _ _ O
must _ _ O
be _ _ O
tight. _ _ O
At _ _ O
times _ _ O
you _ _ O
almost _ _ O
hear _ _ O
them _ _ O
squeak, _ _ O
as _ _ O
when _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Burnette _ _ O
anxiously _ _ O
reminds _ _ O
you _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
were _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
minutes _ _ O
late _ _ O
and _ _ O
suggests _ _ O
you _ _ O
order _ _ O
quickly _ _ O
so _ _ O
she _ _ O
can _ _ O
turn _ _ O
the _ _ O
seat _ _ O
in _ _ O
time _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
next _ _ O
reservation. _ _ O
A _ _ O
professional _ _ O
manager _ _ O
might _ _ O
have _ _ O
brought _ _ O
a _ _ O
more _ _ O
soothing _ _ O
manner _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
exchange. _ _ O
But _ _ O
a _ _ O
manager _ _ O
might _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
as _ _ O
genuinely _ _ O
happy _ _ O
to _ _ O
see _ _ O
a _ _ O
party _ _ O
of _ _ O
three _ _ O
walk _ _ O
in _ _ O
without _ _ O
a _ _ O
reservation _ _ O
just _ _ O
when _ _ O
three _ _ O
seats _ _ O
had _ _ O
opened _ _ O
up, _ _ O
and _ _ O
might _ _ O
not _ _ O
smile _ _ O
as _ _ O
widely _ _ O
when _ _ O
told _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
sparkling _ _ O
rosé _ _ O
is _ _ O
fantastic _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
lobster _ _ O
salad, _ _ O
and _ _ O
would _ _ O
she _ _ O
mind _ _ O
pouring _ _ O
another _ _ O
glass? _ _ O
No, _ _ O
she _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
mind _ _ O
at _ _ O
all. _ _ O

of _ _ O

reach _ _ O
a _ _ O
point _ _ O
where _ _ O
our _ _ O

can't _ _ O
keep _ _ O
up. _ _ O
The _ _ O
tuna _ _ B-FOOD

start _ _ O
to _ _ O
run _ _ O
together; _ _ O
we _ _ O
can't _ _ O
recall _ _ O
whether _ _ O
it's _ _ O
served _ _ O
in _ _ O

with _ _ O

of _ _ O

at _ _ O
Perry _ _ B-EST

or _ _ O
at _ _ O

At _ _ O
some _ _ O
point _ _ O
it's _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
recall _ _ O
what _ _ O
makes _ _ O
the _ _ O

a _ _ O
resoundingly _ _ O

different _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O

chicken _ _ I-DISH
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
Mark. _ _ B-EST
With _ _ O
his _ _ O
partner, _ _ O
Phil _ _ O
Suarez, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Vongerichten _ _ O
has _ _ O
founded _ _ O
scores _ _ O
of _ _ O
new _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
world. _ _ O
Nearly _ _ O
40 _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
are _ _ O
still _ _ O
up _ _ O
and _ _ O
running, _ _ O
15 _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York. _ _ I-LOC
Devising _ _ O
menus _ _ O
for _ _ O
each _ _ O
new _ _ O
place, _ _ O
he _ _ O
repeats _ _ O
himself _ _ O
occasionally, _ _ O
but _ _ O
more _ _ O
often _ _ O
he _ _ O
rearranges _ _ O
old _ _ O
patterns. _ _ O
Lime _ _ B-FOOD
juice _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
traded _ _ O
for _ _ O
yuzu, _ _ B-FOOD
cherry _ _ B-FOOD
vinegar _ _ I-FOOD
comes _ _ O
in _ _ O
for _ _ O
balsamic. _ _ B-FOOD
Almost _ _ O
always, _ _ O
the _ _ O
result _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
similar _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
his _ _ O
past _ _ O
work _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
recognizably _ _ O
Vongerichtenesque _ _ O
but _ _ O
different _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
seem _ _ O
fresh. _ _ O
Maybe _ _ O
he _ _ O
can _ _ O
keep _ _ O
track _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
in _ _ O
his _ _ O
head, _ _ O
but _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
rest _ _ O
of _ _ O
us _ _ O
it _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
really _ _ O
useful _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
family _ _ O
tree _ _ O
of _ _ O
every _ _ O
dish _ _ O
he _ _ O
ever _ _ O
invented, _ _ O
with _ _ O
its _ _ O
parentage _ _ O
and _ _ O
offspring. _ _ O
Something _ _ O
like _ _ O
23andMe _ _ O
, _ _ O
it _ _ O
could _ _ O
tell _ _ O
you _ _ O
which _ _ O
strands _ _ O
of _ _ O

are _ _ O
shared _ _ O
by _ _ O
which _ _ O

This _ _ O
service _ _ O
would _ _ O
come _ _ O
in _ _ O
handy _ _ O
in _ _ O
times _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
present, _ _ O
when _ _ O
critics _ _ O
and _ _ O
superfans _ _ O
are _ _ O
trying _ _ O
to _ _ O
metabolize _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Vongerichten _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
City _ _ I-LOC
during _ _ O
a _ _ O
single _ _ O
week _ _ O
in _ _ O
May. _ _ O
One _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
Paris _ _ B-EST
Café _ _ I-EST
, _ _ O
a _ _ O
casual, _ _ B-TYPE
all-day _ _ I-TYPE
proposition _ _ I-TYPE
inside _ _ O
Eero _ _ O
Saarinen's _ _ O
T.W.A. _ _ B-LOC
terminal _ _ I-LOC
at _ _ O
Kennedy _ _ B-LOC
International _ _ I-LOC
Airport, _ _ I-LOC
now _ _ O
gloriously _ _ O
resurrected _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
TWA _ _ B-LOC
Hotel. _ _ I-LOC
The _ _ O
second _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
polished _ _ O
seafood _ _ B-TYPE
house _ _ I-TYPE
that _ _ I-TYPE
sits _ _ O
out _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
East _ _ B-LOC
River _ _ I-LOC
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
Pier _ _ B-LOC
17, _ _ I-LOC
next _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
wreck _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
old _ _ O
Fulton _ _ B-LOC
Fish _ _ I-LOC
Market; _ _ I-LOC
it's _ _ O
called _ _ O
the _ _ O
Fulton _ _ B-EST
. _ _ O
Because _ _ O
I've _ _ O
been _ _ O
to _ _ O
both _ _ O
so _ _ O
recently, _ _ O
I _ _ O
can _ _ O
report _ _ O
confidently _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
Fulton _ _ B-EST
slices _ _ O
deep-red _ _ O
strawberries _ _ B-FOOD
over _ _ O
strawberry _ _ B-FOOD
ice _ _ I-FOOD
cream _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
sorbet _ _ B-FOOD
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
strawberries _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
red _ _ B-FOOD
wine _ _ I-FOOD
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
its _ _ O
strawberry _ _ B-DISH
sundae, _ _ I-DISH
while _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
Paris _ _ B-EST
Café _ _ I-EST
substitutes _ _ O
dried _ _ B-FOOD
strawberries. _ _ I-FOOD
That _ _ O
version _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
bad, _ _ O
but _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
undeniable _ _ O
difference _ _ O
between _ _ O
fresh _ _ B-FOOD
summer _ _ I-FOOD
berries _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
dehydrated _ _ O
ones, _ _ O
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
difference _ _ O
suggests _ _ O
the _ _ O
quality _ _ O
gap _ _ O
between _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O
restaurants. _ _ O
The _ _ O
best _ _ O
reasons _ _ O
to _ _ O
go _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
Paris _ _ B-EST
Café _ _ I-EST
are _ _ O
Saarinen's _ _ O
glass _ _ O
walls, _ _ O
gliding _ _ O
curves _ _ O
and _ _ O
suspended _ _ O
catwalk, _ _ O
although _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
areas _ _ O
are _ _ O
swell, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
smartly _ _ O
evoking _ _ O
Raymond _ _ O
Loewy's _ _ O
original _ _ O
design _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
space, _ _ O
which _ _ O
looked _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
coffee _ _ B-TYPE
shop _ _ I-TYPE
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
moon. _ _ O
The _ _ O
place _ _ O
has _ _ O
some _ _ O
likable _ _ O
pizzas _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
salads, _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
vaults _ _ O
clear _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
airport. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
recipes _ _ O
seem _ _ O
designed _ _ O
not _ _ O
to _ _ O
push _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
too _ _ O
hard, _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
is _ _ O
even _ _ O
more _ _ O
Vongerichtenesque _ _ O
than _ _ O
usual, _ _ O
and _ _ O
any _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
involving _ _ O
fruits _ _ B-FOOD
or _ _ O
vegetables _ _ B-FOOD
will _ _ O
make _ _ O
you _ _ O
wonder _ _ O
whether _ _ O
the _ _ O
produce _ _ O
truck _ _ O
drove _ _ O
to _ _ O
La _ _ B-LOC
Guardia _ _ I-LOC
instead. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Fulton, _ _ B-EST
though, _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
grown-up _ _ O
production. _ _ O
Under _ _ O
the _ _ O
day-to-day _ _ O
command _ _ O
of _ _ O
Noah _ _ O
Poses, _ _ O
the _ _ O
executive _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
easily _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
seafood _ _ B-TYPE
restaurant _ _ I-TYPE
to _ _ O
open _ _ O
in _ _ O
Manhattan _ _ B-LOC
since _ _ O
the _ _ O
Pool _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
and _ _ O
easier _ _ O
to _ _ O
afford. _ _ O
Yes, _ _ O
a _ _ O
handful _ _ O
of _ _ O
items _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
have _ _ O
that _ _ O
glassy-eyed _ _ O
stare, _ _ O
but _ _ O
almost _ _ O
everything _ _ O
else _ _ O
comes _ _ O
through. _ _ O
To _ _ O
get _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
Fulton, _ _ B-EST
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
walk _ _ O
almost _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
way _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
pier, _ _ O
where _ _ O
some _ _ O
tall _ _ O
planters _ _ O
cordon _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
Fulton's _ _ B-EST
outdoor _ _ O
tables. _ _ O
All _ _ O
the _ _ O
tables, _ _ O
indoors _ _ O
and _ _ O
out, _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
view _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Brooklyn _ _ B-LOC
Bridge, _ _ I-LOC
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
backdrops _ _ O
are _ _ O
inside _ _ O
and _ _ O
upstairs, _ _ O
where _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
see _ _ O
that _ _ O
you're _ _ O
surrounded _ _ O
by _ _ O
water. _ _ O
Mentioning _ _ O
the _ _ O
view _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
selling _ _ O
point _ _ O
will _ _ O
make _ _ O
some _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
cringe. _ _ O
But _ _ O
Pier _ _ B-LOC
17's _ _ I-LOC
developer, _ _ O
clearly _ _ O
hoping _ _ O
to _ _ O
erase _ _ O
the _ _ O
stigma, _ _ O
has _ _ O
recruited _ _ O
David _ _ O
Chang, _ _ O
Andrew _ _ O
Carmellini _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Vongerichten. _ _ O
Day _ _ O
trippers _ _ O
and _ _ O
tourists _ _ O
will _ _ O
love _ _ O
the _ _ O
Fulton, _ _ B-EST
in _ _ O
any _ _ O
case, _ _ O
and _ _ O
they _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
right. _ _ O
True, _ _ O
the _ _ O
outdoor _ _ O
patio _ _ O
feels _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
beachside _ _ O
bar _ _ O
of _ _ O
some _ _ O
island _ _ O
resort, _ _ O
with _ _ O
soft-core _ _ O
club _ _ O
music _ _ O
playing _ _ O
and _ _ O
servers _ _ O
carrying _ _ O
too-small _ _ O
trays _ _ O
slinking _ _ O
around _ _ O
in _ _ O
long _ _ O
skirts. _ _ O
Once _ _ O
you _ _ O
get _ _ O
inside, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
the _ _ O
tension _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
open _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
lets _ _ O
you _ _ O
know _ _ O
this _ _ O
is, _ _ O
in _ _ O
fact, _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York. _ _ I-LOC
Running _ _ O
a _ _ O
seafood _ _ B-TYPE
house _ _ I-TYPE
gives _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Vongerichten _ _ O
an _ _ O
opening _ _ O
to _ _ O
lead _ _ O
with _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
his _ _ O
strong _ _ O
suits, _ _ O
raw _ _ B-FOOD
fish. _ _ I-FOOD
The _ _ O
sea _ _ B-DISH
trout _ _ I-DISH
tartare _ _ I-DISH
is _ _ O
stirred _ _ O
with _ _ O
raw _ _ O
oysters _ _ O
and _ _ O
horseradish, _ _ O
which _ _ O
creates _ _ O
the _ _ O
uncanny _ _ O
momentary _ _ O
illusion _ _ O
that _ _ O
you're _ _ O
eating _ _ O
beef. _ _ O
White _ _ O
ponzu, _ _ O
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
white _ _ O
soy _ _ O
sauce, _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
centerpiece _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
platter _ _ O
of _ _ O
iced _ _ O
sashimi. _ _ O
Local _ _ O
fluke, _ _ O
taking _ _ O
a _ _ O
bath _ _ O
in _ _ O
habanero _ _ O
vinaigrette, _ _ O
is _ _ O
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
mint _ _ O
and _ _ O
Sichuan _ _ O
buttons; _ _ O
even _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
know _ _ O
what's _ _ O
coming _ _ O
-- _ _ O
Sichuan _ _ O
buttons _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
flower _ _ O
buds _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
toothache _ _ O
plant, _ _ O
which _ _ O
when _ _ O
chewed, _ _ O
produce _ _ O
a _ _ O
numbing _ _ O
and _ _ O
cooling _ _ O
sensation _ _ O
-- _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
surprise. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Fulton's _ _ O
Manhattan _ _ O
clam _ _ O
chowder _ _ O
is _ _ O
spicy, _ _ O
thick _ _ O
with _ _ O
potatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
healthy _ _ O
portion _ _ O
of _ _ O
clams. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
the _ _ O
rare _ _ O
version _ _ O
that _ _ O
tastes _ _ O
as _ _ O
good _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
sounds, _ _ O
although _ _ O
purists _ _ O
will _ _ O
deduct _ _ O
one _ _ O
point _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
absence _ _ O
of _ _ O
oyster _ _ O
crackers. _ _ O
There's _ _ O
a _ _ O
very _ _ O
intriguing _ _ O
sesame-poppy _ _ O
crust _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
soft-shell _ _ O
crabs; _ _ O
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
just _ _ O
enough _ _ O
time _ _ O
to _ _ O
register _ _ O
the _ _ O
seeds _ _ O
before _ _ O
a _ _ O
potent _ _ O
green _ _ O
salsa _ _ O
of _ _ O
coriander _ _ O
and _ _ O
jalapeño _ _ O
kicks _ _ O
in. _ _ O
Few _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
are _ _ O
as _ _ O
skilled _ _ O
at _ _ O
using _ _ O
acidity, _ _ O
heat _ _ O
and _ _ O
salt _ _ O
to _ _ O
bring _ _ O
definition _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish. _ _ O
So _ _ O
it's _ _ O
a _ _ O
surprise _ _ O
to _ _ O
realize _ _ O
how _ _ O
generic _ _ O
the _ _ O
Fulton's _ _ O
fish _ _ O
stew _ _ O
is, _ _ O
or _ _ O
to _ _ O
wonder _ _ O
what _ _ O
the _ _ O
ingredient _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
throws _ _ O
the _ _ O
red _ _ O
snapper _ _ O
ceviche _ _ O
in _ _ O
watermelon _ _ O

out _ _ O
of _ _ O
whack. _ _ O
A _ _ O
separate _ _ O
menu _ _ O
card _ _ O
lets _ _ O
you _ _ O
know _ _ O
that _ _ O
most _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
seafood _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
ordered _ _ O
"simply _ _ O
cooked." _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
never _ _ O
curious _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
try _ _ O
it, _ _ O
being _ _ O
too _ _ O
distracted _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
salmon _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
cumin-coriander _ _ O
seed _ _ O
crust _ _ O
so _ _ O
fragrant _ _ O
it _ _ O
turns _ _ O
heads; _ _ O
the _ _ O
sea _ _ O
bass _ _ O
and _ _ O
carrots _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
life-affirming _ _ O
pool _ _ O
of _ _ O
lemon-turmeric _ _ O
sauce; _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
detailed-oriented _ _ O
fish _ _ O
and _ _ O
crisps, _ _ O
a _ _ O
brick _ _ O
of _ _ O
flounder _ _ O
kept _ _ O
at _ _ O
scalding _ _ O
temperature _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
leakproof _ _ O
and _ _ O
supernaturally _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
buckwheat _ _ O
batter. _ _ O
Served _ _ O
with _ _ O
mashed _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
peas, _ _ O
it _ _ O
could _ _ O
almost _ _ O
pass _ _ O
for _ _ O
English _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
come _ _ O
with _ _ O
saffron _ _ O
aioli. _ _ O
Most _ _ O
distracting _ _ O
of _ _ O
all _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
whole _ _ O
black _ _ O
bass _ _ O
baked _ _ O
inside _ _ O
a _ _ O
fish-shaped _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
lavishly _ _ O
decorated _ _ O
with _ _ O
golden _ _ O
scales, _ _ O
fins, _ _ O
gills _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
parts _ _ O
the _ _ O
bass _ _ O
itself _ _ O
won't _ _ O
be _ _ O
needing _ _ O
anymore. _ _ O
It _ _ O
takes _ _ O
a _ _ O
good _ _ O
10 _ _ O
minutes _ _ O
to _ _ O
unveil _ _ O
it, _ _ O
fillet _ _ O
it _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
plate _ _ O
it _ _ O
together _ _ O
with _ _ O
slices _ _ O
of _ _ O
crust, _ _ O
some _ _ O
tomato _ _ O
concassé _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
choron, _ _ O
and _ _ O
I _ _ O
doubt _ _ O
many _ _ O
movies _ _ O
playing _ _ O
in _ _ O
theaters _ _ O
now _ _ O
can _ _ O
rival _ _ O
it _ _ O
for _ _ O
entertainment. _ _ O
Wonderful _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
see _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
showpieces _ _ O
of _ _ O
pre-nouvelle _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
given _ _ O
so _ _ O
much _ _ O
attention, _ _ O
you _ _ O
could _ _ O
ask _ _ O
whether _ _ O
whole _ _ O
fish _ _ O
en _ _ O
croute _ _ O
really _ _ O
makes _ _ O
sense _ _ O
after, _ _ O
say, _ _ O
kale _ _ O
salad. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Vongerichten's _ _ O
technical _ _ O
approach _ _ O
may _ _ O
let _ _ O
him _ _ O
generate _ _ O
a _ _ O
menu _ _ O
full _ _ O
of _ _ O
smart, _ _ O
reliably _ _ O
pleasurable _ _ O
food, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
guarantee _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
all _ _ O
hang _ _ O
together. _ _ O
The _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
menu _ _ O
does, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
by _ _ O
sneakily _ _ O
staying _ _ O
true _ _ O
to _ _ O
classic _ _ O
American _ _ O
desserts. _ _ O
What's _ _ O
sold _ _ O
as _ _ O
Meyer _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
pudding _ _ O
turns _ _ O
out _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
more _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
meringue _ _ O
tart _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
quick, _ _ O
pulsing _ _ O
acidity; _ _ O
the _ _ O
apricot _ _ O
pie _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
crisp, _ _ O
with _ _ O
oatmeal _ _ O
streusel _ _ O
on _ _ O
top; _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
highlight _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
strawberry _ _ O
sundae _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
the _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
fruit _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
strawberry _ _ O
ice _ _ O
cream, _ _ O
its _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
straight _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
summertime _ _ O
ice _ _ O
cream _ _ O
shacks _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O

"Does _ _ O
the _ _ O
sheep's _ _ B-DISH
head _ _ I-DISH
soup _ _ I-DISH
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
stuff _ _ O
in _ _ O
it?" _ _ O
I _ _ O
asked _ _ O
my _ _ O
server. _ _ O
Realizing _ _ O
that _ _ O
this _ _ O
was _ _ O
somewhat _ _ O
ambiguous, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
applied _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish _ _ O
as _ _ O
laden _ _ O
with _ _ O
stuff _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
brew _ _ O
of _ _ O
lambs' _ _ B-FOOD
snouts, _ _ I-FOOD
ears, _ _ B-FOOD
tongues, _ _ B-FOOD
cheeks _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
eyeballs _ _ B-FOOD
known _ _ O
in _ _ O
Turkey _ _ B-LOC
as _ _ O
kelle _ _ B-FOOD
paca, _ _ I-FOOD
I _ _ O
tried _ _ O
again. _ _ O
"Is _ _ O
it _ _ O
very _ _ O
filling, _ _ O
I _ _ O
mean?" _ _ O
My _ _ O
concern _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
familiar _ _ O
one, _ _ O
to _ _ O
me _ _ O
at _ _ O
least. _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
in _ _ O
Queens, _ _ B-DISH
at _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
Turkish _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
Astoria _ _ B-LOC
called _ _ O
Lokanta _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
was _ _ O
so _ _ O
appealing _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
to _ _ O
try _ _ O
it _ _ O
all. _ _ O
Already _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
set _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
bourekas, _ _ B-DISH
some _ _ O
labneh, _ _ B-DISH
the _ _ O
fava _ _ B-DISH
dip _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
some _ _ O
form _ _ O
of _ _ O
braised _ _ B-DISH
lamb _ _ I-DISH
over _ _ I-DISH
eggplant. _ _ I-DISH
I'd _ _ O
spotted _ _ O
another _ _ O
three _ _ O
or _ _ O
four _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
probably _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
tack _ _ O
on _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
my _ _ O
order, _ _ O
as _ _ O
if _ _ O
by _ _ O
afterthought. _ _ O
I _ _ O
suspected _ _ O
that _ _ O
I _ _ O
could _ _ O
add _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
kelle _ _ B-DISH
paca _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
still _ _ O
eat _ _ O
everything _ _ O
else. _ _ O
But _ _ O
a _ _ O
big _ _ O
bowl, _ _ O
one _ _ O
so _ _ O
thick _ _ O
with _ _ O
bits _ _ O
formerly _ _ O
affixed _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
sheep's _ _ O
skull _ _ O
that _ _ O
a _ _ O
spoon _ _ O
would _ _ O
stand _ _ O
up _ _ O
in _ _ O
it, _ _ O
might _ _ O
tip _ _ O
the _ _ O
scale. _ _ O
The _ _ O
server _ _ O
pondered _ _ O
this _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
while _ _ O
until _ _ O
a _ _ O
wiry _ _ O
man _ _ O
got _ _ O
up _ _ O
from _ _ O
his _ _ O
marble-topped _ _ O
table _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
corner _ _ O
and _ _ O
conferred _ _ O
with _ _ O
her. _ _ O
Wearing _ _ O
baggy _ _ O
jeans, _ _ O
a _ _ O
white _ _ O
T-shirt _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
baseball _ _ O
cap _ _ O
that _ _ O
kept _ _ O
his _ _ O
zinc-colored _ _ O
ponytail _ _ O
in _ _ O
place, _ _ O
he _ _ O
looked _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
contractor, _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
a _ _ O
painter _ _ O
who'd _ _ O
come _ _ O
by _ _ O
to _ _ O
touch _ _ O
up _ _ O
the _ _ O
moldings _ _ O
and _ _ O
had _ _ O
been _ _ O
invited _ _ O
to _ _ O
stay _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
Turkish _ _ B-CUISINE
coffee. _ _ B-FOOD
Then _ _ O
he _ _ O
spoke _ _ O
to _ _ O
us _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
sheep's _ _ B-DISH
head _ _ I-DISH
soup. _ _ I-DISH
"I _ _ O
am _ _ O
a _ _ O
genius," _ _ O
he _ _ O
began. _ _ O
"And _ _ O
even _ _ O
I _ _ O
don't _ _ O
know _ _ O
how _ _ O
to _ _ O
answer _ _ O
this _ _ O
question. _ _ O
I _ _ O
think _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
question _ _ O
must _ _ O
be _ _ O
wrong." _ _ O
As _ _ O
those _ _ O
who _ _ O
chase _ _ O
the _ _ O
scent _ _ O
of _ _ O
lamb _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
charred _ _ B-FOOD
eggplant _ _ I-FOOD
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
have _ _ O
probably _ _ O
guessed, _ _ O
this _ _ O
was _ _ O
no _ _ O
contractor. _ _ O
This _ _ O
was _ _ O
Orhan _ _ O
Yegen, _ _ O
the _ _ O
Turkish-born _ _ O
chef _ _ O
and _ _ O
restaurateur _ _ O
who _ _ O
has _ _ O
opened _ _ O
close _ _ O
to _ _ O
20 _ _ O
Turkish _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurants _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
two _ _ O
decades _ _ O
or _ _ O
so _ _ O
while _ _ O
keeping _ _ O
up _ _ O
a _ _ O
running _ _ O
monologue _ _ O
that _ _ O
made _ _ O
him _ _ O
a _ _ O
favorite _ _ O
of _ _ O
food _ _ O
writers _ _ O
. _ _ O
In _ _ O
2004, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Yegen _ _ O
opened _ _ O
Sip _ _ B-EST
Sak _ _ I-EST
in _ _ O
Turtle _ _ B-LOC
Bay, _ _ I-LOC
then _ _ O
proceeded _ _ O
to _ _ O
surprise _ _ O
those _ _ O
who _ _ O
had _ _ O
charted _ _ O
his _ _ O
career _ _ O
by _ _ O
embarking _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
long, _ _ O
stable _ _ O
period _ _ O
. _ _ O
All _ _ O
was _ _ O
quiet, _ _ O
relatively _ _ O
speaking, _ _ O
until _ _ O
April, _ _ O
when _ _ O
Lokanta _ _ B-EST
arrived _ _ O
in _ _ O
Astoria _ _ B-LOC
to _ _ O
supplement _ _ O
the _ _ O
Greek _ _ B-CUISINE
and _ _ O
Cypriot _ _ B-CUISINE
menus _ _ O
along _ _ O
its _ _ O
stretch _ _ O
of _ _ O
Broadway, _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Yegen _ _ O
arrived _ _ O
to _ _ O
tell _ _ O
customers _ _ O
that _ _ O
their _ _ O
questions _ _ O
were _ _ O
wrong. _ _ O
The _ _ O
kelle _ _ B-DISH
paca _ _ I-DISH
colloquy _ _ O
ended _ _ O
when _ _ O
I _ _ O
agreed _ _ O
to _ _ O
order _ _ O
it. _ _ O
After _ _ O
hours _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
stove, _ _ O
the _ _ O
meat _ _ B-FOOD
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
head _ _ O
had _ _ O
fallen _ _ O
away _ _ O
into _ _ O
about _ _ O
eight _ _ O
different _ _ O
textures, _ _ O
from _ _ O
frilly _ _ O
to _ _ O
ropy _ _ O
to _ _ O
collagenously _ _ O
chewy _ _ O
to _ _ O
tender _ _ O
and _ _ O
lean. _ _ O
All _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
suspended _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
slippery, _ _ O
almost _ _ O
sticky _ _ O
broth _ _ B-FOOD
the _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
cappuccino. _ _ B-FOOD
And _ _ O
no, _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
not _ _ O
too _ _ O
filling. _ _ O
Soups, _ _ B-FOOD
braises, _ _ B-FOOD
stews _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
recipes _ _ O
requiring _ _ O
plenty _ _ O
of _ _ O
time _ _ O
and _ _ O
even _ _ O
more _ _ O
olive _ _ B-FOOD
oil _ _ I-FOOD
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
basis _ _ O
of _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Yegen's _ _ O
reputation. _ _ O
They _ _ O
set _ _ O
his _ _ O
menus _ _ O
apart _ _ O
from _ _ O
those _ _ O
at _ _ O
other _ _ O
Turkish _ _ B-CUISINE
restaurants _ _ O
around _ _ O
town, _ _ O
which _ _ O
tend _ _ O
to _ _ O
revolve _ _ O
around _ _ O
the _ _ O
grill. _ _ O
Lokanta _ _ B-EST
makes _ _ O
very _ _ O
fine _ _ O
kofte, _ _ B-DISH
but _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
full _ _ O
medley _ _ O
of _ _ O
minced _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ I-FOOD
skewered _ _ I-FOOD
meats, _ _ I-FOOD
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
better _ _ O
off _ _ O
under _ _ O
the _ _ O
swaying _ _ O
chandeliers _ _ O
of _ _ O
Taci's _ _ B-EST
Beyti _ _ I-EST
on _ _ O
Coney _ _ B-LOC
Island _ _ I-LOC
Avenue _ _ I-LOC
in _ _ O
Brooklyn. _ _ B-LOC
Lokanta _ _ B-EST
will _ _ O
grill _ _ O
or _ _ O
roast _ _ O
a _ _ O
whole _ _ O
fish, _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
all _ _ O
that _ _ O
different _ _ O
from _ _ O
what _ _ O
might _ _ O
be _ _ O
served _ _ O
in _ _ O
Brooklyn _ _ B-LOC
at _ _ O
Liman _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
where _ _ O
your _ _ O
bass _ _ B-FOOD
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
filleted _ _ O
within _ _ O
view _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
fishing _ _ O
boats _ _ O
and _ _ O
swans _ _ O
of _ _ O
Sheepshead _ _ B-LOC
Bay. _ _ I-LOC
Diners _ _ O
in _ _ O
Lokanta's _ _ B-EST
custody _ _ O
have _ _ O
signed _ _ O
on _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
more _ _ O
nuanced _ _ O
view _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Turkish _ _ B-CUISINE
kitchen. _ _ O
Take, _ _ O
for _ _ O
instance, _ _ O
the _ _ O
shadings _ _ O
that _ _ O
lamb _ _ B-FOOD
takes _ _ O
on. _ _ O
In _ _ O
hunkar _ _ B-DISH
begendi, _ _ I-DISH
chunks _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
are _ _ O
stewed _ _ O
in _ _ O
tomatoes _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
peppers _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
ladled _ _ O
over _ _ O
an _ _ O
eggplant _ _ B-FOOD
mash _ _ I-FOOD
beaten _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
memorable _ _ O
richness _ _ O
with _ _ O
cheese _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
milk. _ _ B-FOOD
Ali _ _ B-EST
nazik _ _ I-EST
is, _ _ O
in _ _ O
schematic _ _ O
form, _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
thing, _ _ O
built _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
foundation _ _ O
of _ _ O
milky _ _ O
eggplant, _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
in _ _ O
Lokanta's _ _ B-EST
version _ _ O
the _ _ O
lamb _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
ground _ _ O
and _ _ O
simmered _ _ O
with _ _ O
onions _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
red _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ I-FOOD
green _ _ I-FOOD
peppers; _ _ I-FOOD
somehow _ _ O
it _ _ O
achieves _ _ O
a _ _ O
rich, _ _ O
unctuous _ _ O
consistency _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
amplified _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
eggplant _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
scoop _ _ O
of _ _ O
strained _ _ O
yogurt _ _ O
dropped _ _ O
on _ _ O
top. _ _ O
Lokanta's _ _ O
"roasted _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
and _ _ O
rice" _ _ O
is _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
pilaf _ _ O
family, _ _ O
which _ _ O
means _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
rice _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
just _ _ O
a _ _ O
side _ _ O
dish _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
heart _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
recipe, _ _ O
baked _ _ O
until _ _ O
alluringly _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
with _ _ O
currants, _ _ O
allspice _ _ O
and _ _ O
cinnamon, _ _ O
then _ _ O
sprinkled _ _ O
with _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
dill _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
minute. _ _ O
The _ _ O
lamb's _ _ O
job _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
obligingly _ _ O
tender, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
succeeds, _ _ O
one _ _ O
reason _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
is _ _ O
requested _ _ O
by _ _ O
so _ _ O
many _ _ O
tables. _ _ O
To _ _ O
fend _ _ O
off _ _ O
boredom, _ _ O
I _ _ O
imagine, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Yegen _ _ O
fills _ _ O
his _ _ O
manti _ _ O
with _ _ O
both _ _ O
lamb _ _ O
and _ _ O
beef. _ _ O
Each _ _ O
little _ _ O
dumpling _ _ O
is _ _ O
rolled _ _ O
by _ _ O
fingertip _ _ O
and _ _ O
is _ _ O
roughly _ _ O
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
of _ _ O
one. _ _ O
The _ _ O
meat _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
just _ _ O
forcefully _ _ O
enough _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
will _ _ O
announce _ _ O
itself, _ _ O
politely _ _ O
but _ _ O
clearly, _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
breaks _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
dough. _ _ O
It _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
possible _ _ O
to _ _ O
sit _ _ O
down _ _ O
in _ _ O
front _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
these, _ _ O
spooning _ _ O
them _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
their _ _ O
warm _ _ O
yogurt _ _ O
and _ _ O
chile _ _ O
oil _ _ O
and _ _ O
dried _ _ O
mint, _ _ O
and _ _ O
call _ _ O
for _ _ O
another _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
a _ _ O
minute _ _ O
later. _ _ O
Of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
the _ _ O
meal _ _ O
should _ _ O
begin _ _ O
with _ _ O
strips _ _ O
of _ _ O
nigella-dotted _ _ O
Turkish _ _ O
bread _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
spread _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
-- _ _ O
maybe _ _ O
memorably _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
purée _ _ O
of _ _ O
dried _ _ O
favas; _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
roughly _ _ O
mashed _ _ O
eggplant, _ _ O
smoky _ _ O
without _ _ O
a _ _ O
trace _ _ O
of _ _ O
bitterness; _ _ O
and _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
strained-yogurt _ _ O
dips, _ _ O
either _ _ O
the _ _ O
tangy _ _ O
cacik, _ _ O
laced _ _ O
with _ _ O
minced _ _ O
cucumbers, _ _ O
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
labneh, _ _ O
as _ _ O
firm _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
mattress. _ _ O
Either _ _ O
will _ _ O
prove _ _ O
useful _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
meal _ _ O
goes _ _ O
on. _ _ O
So _ _ O
will _ _ O
a _ _ O
simple _ _ O
salad, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
with _ _ O
white _ _ O
beans _ _ O
and _ _ O
purple _ _ O
onions. _ _ O
The _ _ O
tightly _ _ O
rolled, _ _ O
golden _ _ O
bourekas _ _ O
are _ _ O
like _ _ O
skinny _ _ O
Turkish _ _ O
spring _ _ O
rolls _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
dill _ _ O
and _ _ O
melting _ _ O
feta. _ _ O
Cold _ _ O
poached _ _ O
leeks, _ _ O
a _ _ O
frequent _ _ O
special, _ _ O
are _ _ O
more _ _ O
appealing _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
cold _ _ O
poached _ _ O
artichokes _ _ O
that _ _ O
have _ _ O
a _ _ O
permanent _ _ O
spot _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
If _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Yegen _ _ O
tells _ _ O
you _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
octopus _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
city, _ _ O
keep _ _ O
in _ _ O
mind _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
rarely _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
leave _ _ O
his _ _ O
own _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
quite _ _ O
good, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
fugitive _ _ O
sweetness _ _ O
that _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
supplied _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
tomatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
purple _ _ O
onions. _ _ O
Desserts _ _ O
run _ _ O
toward _ _ O
milky _ _ O
white _ _ O
puddings, _ _ O
nice _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
looking _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
mild _ _ O
sedative. _ _ O
The _ _ O
baklava, _ _ O
imported _ _ O
from _ _ O
Turkey, _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
treat _ _ O
for _ _ O
those _ _ O
of _ _ O
us _ _ O
who _ _ O
like _ _ O
pistachios _ _ O
and _ _ O
think _ _ O
sugar _ _ O
syrup _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
better _ _ O
baklava _ _ O
sweetener _ _ O
than _ _ O
honey. _ _ O
The _ _ O
unlikely _ _ O
champion, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
butternut _ _ O
squash _ _ O
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
languorously _ _ O
baked _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
own _ _ O
juices _ _ O
with _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
but _ _ O
sugar. _ _ O
The _ _ O
technique _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
those _ _ O
small _ _ O
tricks _ _ O
that _ _ O
helps _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Yegen's _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
stand _ _ O
out, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
perfume _ _ O
of _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
peel _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Turkish _ _ O
lemonade. _ _ O
Lokanta _ _ O
has _ _ O
no _ _ O
liquor _ _ O
license _ _ O
yet. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
customers _ _ O
smuggle _ _ O
wine _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
door _ _ O
and _ _ O
keep _ _ O
the _ _ O
bottles _ _ O
on _ _ O
their _ _ O
tables, _ _ O
which _ _ O
are _ _ O
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
radiant _ _ O
white _ _ O
marble _ _ O
from _ _ O
Turkey _ _ O
and _ _ O
surrounded _ _ O
by _ _ O
classic _ _ O
bentwood _ _ O
cafe _ _ O
chairs. _ _ O
But _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
hard _ _ O
not _ _ O
to _ _ O
want _ _ O
the _ _ O
lemonade, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
cold _ _ O
and _ _ O
just _ _ O
tart _ _ O
enough _ _ O
and _ _ O
not _ _ O
very _ _ O
filling _ _ O
at _ _ O
all. _ _ O

The _ _ O
chef _ _ O
John _ _ O
Fraser's _ _ O
new _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
blandly _ _ O
corporate _ _ O
name, _ _ O
701West _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
that _ _ O
tells _ _ O
you _ _ O
less _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
place _ _ O
than _ _ O
simply _ _ O
walking _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
dining _ _ O
room. _ _ O
One _ _ O
of _ _ O
several _ _ O
operations _ _ O
he _ _ O
is _ _ O
running _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
new _ _ O
Times _ _ B-LOC
Square _ _ I-LOC
Edition _ _ I-LOC
hotel, _ _ I-LOC
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
clad _ _ O
in _ _ O
paneling _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
walls _ _ O
and _ _ O
ceilings. _ _ O
Velvet _ _ O
curtains _ _ O
and _ _ O
banquettes _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
alarming _ _ O
color _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
blue _ _ O
macaw's _ _ O
tail _ _ O
feathers. _ _ O
Wooden _ _ O
blinds _ _ O
are _ _ O
usually _ _ O
snapped _ _ O
shut _ _ O
against _ _ O
the _ _ O
strobes _ _ O
of _ _ O
47th _ _ B-LOC
Street _ _ I-LOC
and _ _ O
Seventh _ _ B-LOC
Avenue. _ _ I-LOC
To _ _ O
get _ _ O
to _ _ O
your _ _ O
table, _ _ O
you _ _ O
must _ _ O
first _ _ O
pass _ _ O
between _ _ O
two _ _ O
identical _ _ O
Champagne _ _ O
trolleys. _ _ O
An _ _ O
iced _ _ O
reservoir _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
center _ _ O
of _ _ O
each _ _ O
is _ _ O
loaded _ _ O
with _ _ O
about _ _ O
half _ _ O
a _ _ O
dozen _ _ O
bottles _ _ O
that _ _ O
range _ _ O
in _ _ O
price _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
Blanquette _ _ B-DISH
de _ _ I-DISH
Limoux _ _ I-DISH
for _ _ O
$26 _ _ O
a _ _ O
glass _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
2006 _ _ B-DISH
brut _ _ I-DISH
from _ _ O
Dom _ _ B-EST
Pérignon _ _ I-EST
for _ _ O
$66 _ _ O
a _ _ O
glass. _ _ O
Before _ _ O
you _ _ O
sit _ _ O
down, _ _ O
you've _ _ O
already _ _ O
learned _ _ O
that _ _ O
wine _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
front _ _ O
and _ _ O
center, _ _ O
literally _ _ O
and _ _ O
figuratively; _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
likely _ _ O
to _ _ O
come _ _ O
from _ _ O
classic, _ _ O
mannerly _ _ O
European _ _ O
estates _ _ O
than, _ _ O
say, _ _ O
Macedonian _ _ O
villages _ _ O
still _ _ O
using _ _ O
amphoras _ _ O
that _ _ O
Odysseus _ _ O
drank _ _ O
from; _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
ideal _ _ O
customer _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
likely _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
up _ _ O
and _ _ O
walk _ _ O
out _ _ O
upon _ _ O
being _ _ O
offered _ _ O
a _ _ O
$66 _ _ O
aperitif; _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
expects _ _ O
to _ _ O
attract _ _ O
so _ _ O
many _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O
customers _ _ O
that _ _ O
a _ _ O
single _ _ O
Champagne _ _ O
trolley _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
enough. _ _ O
Which _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
say _ _ O
that _ _ O
Marriott _ _ B-LOC
International _ _ I-LOC
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
hotelier _ _ O
Ian _ _ O
Schrager _ _ O
installed _ _ O
701West _ _ B-EST
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
11th _ _ O
floor _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Edition _ _ B-DIET
for _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
still _ _ O
think _ _ O
a _ _ O
leisurely, _ _ O
three-course _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
interesting _ _ O
bottles _ _ O
and _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
customary _ _ O
niceties _ _ O
is _ _ O
worth _ _ O
spending _ _ O
money _ _ O
on. _ _ O
It _ _ O
belongs _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
species _ _ O
of _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
longer _ _ O
in _ _ O
great _ _ O
supply _ _ O
in _ _ O
Manhattan, _ _ B-LOC
let _ _ O
alone _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
intersection _ _ O
where _ _ O
the _ _ O
green _ _ O
neon _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
Olive _ _ B-EST
Garden _ _ I-EST
faces _ _ O
off _ _ O
across _ _ O
Seventh _ _ B-LOC
Avenue _ _ I-LOC
against _ _ O
the _ _ O
giant _ _ O
candy _ _ O
bars _ _ O
of _ _ O
Hershey's _ _ O
Chocolate _ _ O
World. _ _ O
It _ _ O
also _ _ O
marks _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Fraser's _ _ O
first _ _ O
arabesques _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
stage _ _ O
of _ _ O
formal _ _ O
dining _ _ O
since _ _ O
Dovetail _ _ B-EST
closed _ _ O
last _ _ O
year. _ _ O
These _ _ O
are _ _ O
early _ _ O
days _ _ O
for _ _ O
701West, _ _ B-EST
but _ _ O
so _ _ O
far _ _ O
I've _ _ O
found _ _ O
the _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
more _ _ O
original _ _ O
and _ _ O
appealing _ _ O
than _ _ O
Dovetail's _ _ B-EST
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
final _ _ O
phase. _ _ O
As _ _ O
you _ _ O
know _ _ O
if _ _ O
you've _ _ O
tried _ _ O
the _ _ O
fried-cauliflower _ _ B-DISH
buns _ _ I-DISH
at _ _ O
Nix, _ _ B-EST
or _ _ O
the _ _ O
ramen-style _ _ B-DISH
boiled _ _ I-DISH
eggs _ _ I-DISH
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
Loyal _ _ B-EST
whose _ _ O
yolks _ _ B-FOOD
are _ _ O
red _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
film _ _ O
of _ _ O
jellied _ _ B-FOOD
chile _ _ I-FOOD
oil, _ _ I-FOOD
Mr. _ _ O
Fraser _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
playful, _ _ O
imaginative _ _ O
streak. _ _ O
He _ _ O
needs _ _ O
it _ _ O
at _ _ O
701West, _ _ B-EST
where _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
real _ _ O
theme _ _ O
beyond _ _ O
wine _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
style. _ _ O
But _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
enough _ _ O
creativity _ _ O
across _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu, _ _ O
on _ _ O
which _ _ O
he _ _ O
collaborates _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
de _ _ O
cuisine, _ _ O
Rob _ _ O
Lawson, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Sébastien _ _ O
Rouxel, _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
the _ _ O
engaging, _ _ O
somewhat _ _ O
eccentric _ _ O
experience _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
clearly _ _ O
meant _ _ O
to _ _ O
be. _ _ O
Before _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
courses _ _ O
appear, _ _ O
for _ _ O
example, _ _ O
there _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
"cauliflower _ _ B-DISH
mille-feuille," _ _ I-DISH
the _ _ O
raw _ _ O
vegetable _ _ B-FOOD
shaved _ _ O
into _ _ O
white _ _ O
sheets _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
softened _ _ O
by _ _ O
chilled _ _ B-FOOD
mezcal _ _ I-FOOD
cream _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
topped _ _ O
with _ _ O
sturgeon _ _ B-FOOD
caviar. _ _ I-FOOD
It's _ _ O
enticingly _ _ O
off-kilter, _ _ O
and _ _ O
another _ _ O
frequent _ _ O
amuse _ _ O
manages _ _ O
to _ _ O
outdo _ _ O
it: _ _ O
a _ _ O
spoonful _ _ O
or _ _ O
so _ _ O
of _ _ O
white-asparagus _ _ B-FOOD
foam _ _ I-FOOD
above _ _ O
a _ _ O
warm _ _ O
custard _ _ B-FOOD
of _ _ I-FOOD
sunflower-seed _ _ I-FOOD
butter, _ _ I-FOOD
dense _ _ O
and _ _ O
nutty _ _ O
and _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
drops _ _ O
of _ _ O
honey. _ _ B-FOOD
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
luxury _ _ O
dining _ _ O
in _ _ O
its _ _ O
way, _ _ O
which _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
predictable _ _ O
way. _ _ O
The _ _ O
menu _ _ O
proposes _ _ O
three _ _ O
courses _ _ O
for _ _ O
$98, _ _ O
but _ _ O
a _ _ O
server _ _ O
informed _ _ O
me _ _ O
that _ _ O
"we _ _ O
also _ _ O
have _ _ O
à _ _ O
la _ _ O
carte, _ _ O
if _ _ O
that's _ _ O
more _ _ O
your _ _ O
rhythm _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
evening." _ _ O
Frequently _ _ O
the _ _ O
surprises _ _ O
come _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
form _ _ O
of _ _ O
an _ _ O
unexpected _ _ O
tweak _ _ O
dealt _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
vegetable. _ _ B-FOOD
Slowly _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
in _ _ O
beet _ _ B-FOOD
juice, _ _ I-FOOD
a _ _ O
whole _ _ O
beet _ _ B-FOOD
takes _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
glistening _ _ O
ruby _ _ O
intensity _ _ O
of _ _ O
raw _ _ B-FOOD
bluefin _ _ I-FOOD
tuna. _ _ I-FOOD
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
appetizer _ _ O
of _ _ O
actual _ _ O
bluefin _ _ B-FOOD
as _ _ O
well, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
the _ _ O
precise, _ _ O
Japanese-informed _ _ O
minimalism _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish _ _ O
you'd _ _ O
get _ _ O
at _ _ O
Jean-Georges, _ _ B-EST
with _ _ O
tiny _ _ O
spring _ _ B-FOOD
peas _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
young _ _ O
turnip _ _ B-FOOD
greens _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
an _ _ O
electrifying _ _ O
white _ _ O
cloud _ _ O
of _ _ O
grated _ _ B-FOOD
horseradish. _ _ I-FOOD
In _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish _ _ O
of _ _ O
fava _ _ B-DISH
agnolotti, _ _ I-DISH
the _ _ O
X _ _ O
factor _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
bright, _ _ O
almost _ _ O
effervescent _ _ O
sparkle _ _ O
of _ _ O
vinegar-marinated _ _ O
tomatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
their _ _ O
juices _ _ O
stirred _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
Parmesan-rind _ _ O
broth. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
mystifying _ _ O
appetizer _ _ O
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
the _ _ O
dueling _ _ O
tidal _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
of _ _ O
sea _ _ O
urchin _ _ O
and _ _ O
squid-ink _ _ O
risotto _ _ O
are _ _ O
allowed _ _ O
to _ _ O
cancel _ _ O
each _ _ O
other _ _ O
out. _ _ O
For _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
part, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
the _ _ O
plates _ _ O
don't _ _ O
overreach, _ _ O
for _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
inventiveness _ _ O
on _ _ O
display. _ _ O
Asparagus _ _ O
dipped _ _ O
in _ _ O
aioli _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
good _ _ O
idea, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
but _ _ O
what _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
asparagus _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
steamed _ _ O
inside _ _ O
a _ _ O
wrapper _ _ O
of _ _ O
thinly _ _ O
shaved _ _ O
cedar _ _ O
until _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
as _ _ O
smoky _ _ O
as _ _ O
country _ _ O
bacon? _ _ O
And _ _ O
what _ _ O
if _ _ O
the _ _ O
aioli _ _ O
is _ _ O
enhanced _ _ O
by _ _ O
truffles? _ _ O
It _ _ O
may _ _ O
sound _ _ O
overworked, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
such _ _ O
a _ _ O
thrill _ _ O
that _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
my _ _ O
guests _ _ O
asked _ _ O
for _ _ O
another _ _ O
plate _ _ O
before _ _ O
we _ _ O
could _ _ O
move _ _ O
on _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses, _ _ O
throwing _ _ O
the _ _ O
rhythm _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
evening _ _ O
right _ _ O
out _ _ O
the _ _ O
window. _ _ O
The _ _ O
night _ _ O
will _ _ O
pause _ _ O
again _ _ O
if _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
main _ _ O
courses _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
potato, _ _ O
as _ _ O
everyone _ _ O
tries _ _ O
to _ _ O
figure _ _ O
out _ _ O
where _ _ O
it _ _ O
got _ _ O
its _ _ O
creaminess _ _ O
and _ _ O
savory _ _ O
depth. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
once _ _ O
you _ _ O
know _ _ O
it's _ _ O
been _ _ O
sealed _ _ O
up _ _ O
and _ _ O
baked _ _ O
inside _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
coffin _ _ O
of _ _ O
sourdough _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
streaked _ _ O
with _ _ O
green _ _ O
threads _ _ O
of _ _ O
wakame _ _ O
seaweed, _ _ O
you _ _ O
still _ _ O
can't _ _ O
quite _ _ O
believe _ _ O
that _ _ O
all _ _ O
this _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
achieved _ _ O
with _ _ O
an _ _ O
ordinary _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
potato. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
large _ _ O
pieces _ _ O
of _ _ O
fish _ _ O
and _ _ O
meat _ _ O
are _ _ O
showstoppers _ _ O
on _ _ O
their _ _ O
own, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
lobster _ _ O
that _ _ O
rests _ _ O
for _ _ O
four _ _ O
days _ _ O
in _ _ O
aged-beef _ _ O
fat _ _ O
before _ _ O
being _ _ O
broiled _ _ O
and _ _ O
set _ _ O
over _ _ O
some _ _ O
jammy _ _ O
ratatouille. _ _ O
When _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O
not, _ _ O
something _ _ O
else _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
plate _ _ O
usually _ _ O
is. _ _ O
The _ _ O
long _ _ O
slab _ _ O
of _ _ O
roasted _ _ O
duck _ _ O
breast _ _ O
dredged _ _ O
in _ _ O
powdered _ _ O
herbes _ _ O
de _ _ O
Provence _ _ O
would _ _ O
keep _ _ O
my _ _ O
attention _ _ O
even _ _ O
without _ _ O
its _ _ O
sidekick, _ _ O
a _ _ O
curiously _ _ O
likable _ _ O
risotto _ _ O
made _ _ O
from _ _ O
pine _ _ O
nuts. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
case _ _ O
of _ _ O
lamb, _ _ O
the _ _ O
firecracker _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
cocotte _ _ O
of _ _ O
fresh, _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
cranberry _ _ O
beans. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Rouxel, _ _ O
recently _ _ O
of _ _ O
Upland _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
Clocktower, _ _ O
brings _ _ O
a _ _ O
lighter-than-air _ _ O
quality _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
desserts. _ _ O
Hovering _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
crunchy _ _ O
buckwheat _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
crust _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
wavy _ _ O
sea _ _ O
of _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
cream _ _ O
infused _ _ O
with _ _ O
parsnips. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
earthy _ _ O
and _ _ O
ethereal _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
time. _ _ O
He _ _ O
even _ _ O
knows _ _ O
what _ _ O
to _ _ O
do _ _ O
with _ _ O
white _ _ O
chocolate, _ _ O
aerating _ _ O
it _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
mousse _ _ O
to _ _ O
frost _ _ O
an _ _ O
English-pea _ _ O
sponge _ _ O
cake, _ _ O
and _ _ O
giving _ _ O
it _ _ O
a _ _ O
piercing _ _ O
sour-cherry _ _ O
sorbet _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
foil. _ _ O
All _ _ O
seven _ _ O
captains _ _ O
working _ _ O
at _ _ O
701West _ _ O
are _ _ O
sommeliers, _ _ O
listed _ _ O
by _ _ O
name _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu; _ _ O
they _ _ O
are _ _ O

This _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
those _ _ O
innovations _ _ O
in _ _ O
service _ _ O
that _ _ O
seems _ _ O
obvious _ _ O
now _ _ O
that _ _ O
somebody's _ _ O
actually _ _ O
doing _ _ O
it. _ _ O
The _ _ O
meal _ _ O
can _ _ O
become _ _ O
an _ _ O
evening-long _ _ O
conversation _ _ O
about _ _ O
wine; _ _ O
the _ _ O
sommeliers _ _ O
even _ _ O
invite _ _ O
you _ _ O
to _ _ O
play _ _ O
the _ _ O

game _ _ O

identity _ _ O
of _ _ O

It _ _ O
is _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
incredible _ _ O
that _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
tries _ _ O
so _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
give _ _ O

the _ _ O

it _ _ O
does _ _ O
have _ _ O

to _ _ O

any _ _ O

in _ _ O

you _ _ O

quickly _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O

essentially _ _ O
two _ _ O
choices: _ _ O
You _ _ O
can _ _ O
use _ _ O
a _ _ O
spoon, _ _ O

hold _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
to _ _ O
your _ _ O

and _ _ O

your _ _ O

as _ _ O
if _ _ O

If _ _ O
you _ _ O
go _ _ O
the _ _ O
Jell-O _ _ B-FOOD
shot _ _ I-FOOD
route, _ _ O
it _ _ O
may _ _ O
help _ _ O
to _ _ O
bring _ _ O
a _ _ O
pair _ _ O
of _ _ O
chopsticks _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
fingertip _ _ O
into _ _ O
play _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O

minute _ _ O
to _ _ O
encourage _ _ O
the _ _ O

to _ _ O
leave _ _ O
the _ _ O
nest. _ _ O
You _ _ O
have _ _ O
now _ _ O
transferred _ _ O
to _ _ O
your _ _ O
mouth _ _ O
a _ _ O
warm _ _ O
divot _ _ O
of _ _ O
steamed _ _ B-FOOD
rice _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
tapioca _ _ B-FOOD
flours _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
consistency _ _ O
like _ _ O
panna _ _ B-FOOD

and _ _ O
a _ _ O
negligible _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
on _ _ O
its _ _ O
own. _ _ O
All _ _ O
the _ _ O
action _ _ O
is _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O

these _ _ O

a _ _ O
spoonful _ _ O
of _ _ O

scallions _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
green _ _ B-FOOD
oil _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
which _ _ O
they _ _ O
were _ _ O
sizzled, _ _ O
red _ _ O
rings _ _ O
of _ _ O
fresh _ _ O

chile, _ _ I-FOOD
some _ _ O

a _ _ O

skin, _ _ I-FOOD
standing _ _ O
in _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
pork _ _ B-FOOD
rinds _ _ I-FOOD
a _ _ O
banh _ _ B-FOOD
beo _ _ I-FOOD
vendor _ _ O
in _ _ O
Hue _ _ B-LOC
would _ _ O
use. _ _ O
The _ _ O
divot _ _ O
of _ _ O
rice _ _ B-FOOD
cake _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
warm, _ _ O
which _ _ O
helps _ _ O
the _ _ O
aromas _ _ O
drive _ _ O
their _ _ O
way _ _ O
into _ _ O
your _ _ O
head. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
over _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
minute. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you're _ _ O
lucky, _ _ O
there _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
another _ _ O
banh _ _ B-FOOD
beo _ _ I-FOOD
on _ _ O
the _ _ O

you _ _ O

Ms. _ _ O
Wong _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef. _ _ O
Though _ _ O
she _ _ O
has _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
at _ _ O
Gramercy _ _ B-EST
Tavern _ _ I-EST
and _ _ O
Battersby _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
her _ _ O
background _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
of _ _ O
Vietnam _ _ B-LOC
before _ _ O
Van _ _ B-EST
Da _ _ I-EST
was _ _ O
more _ _ O
or _ _ O
less _ _ O
confined _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
roughly _ _ O
two _ _ O
weeks _ _ O
she _ _ O
spent _ _ O
traveling _ _ O
there _ _ O
while _ _ O
living _ _ O
in _ _ O
Hong _ _ B-LOC
Kong _ _ I-LOC
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
Fulbright _ _ O
grant _ _ O
a _ _ O
decade _ _ O

Nevertheless, _ _ O
she _ _ O
has _ _ O
put _ _ O
together _ _ O
a _ _ O
trenchant, _ _ O
concise _ _ O
and _ _ O
pleasure-focused _ _ O
menu _ _ O
of _ _ O
Vietnamese _ _ B-CUISINE
dishes. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
she _ _ O
learned _ _ O
directly _ _ O
from _ _ O
her _ _ O
boss, _ _ O
and _ _ O
on _ _ O
those _ _ O
recipes _ _ O
she _ _ O
was _ _ O
apparently _ _ O
discouraged _ _ O
from _ _ O
drawing _ _ O
outside _ _ O
the _ _ O
lines. _ _ O
Others _ _ O
are _ _ O
more _ _ O
freely _ _ O
interpreted. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
a _ _ O
credit _ _ O
to _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Wong's _ _ O
sensitivity _ _ O
that _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
don't _ _ O
already _ _ O
know _ _ O
the _ _ O
original _ _ O
templates, _ _ O
it _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
tell _ _ O
where _ _ O
they _ _ O
end _ _ O
and _ _ O
her _ _ O
imagination _ _ O

In _ _ O
Vietnam, _ _ B-LOC
the _ _ O
cups _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
shrimp. _ _ B-FOOD
Ms. _ _ O

instead _ _ O
spoons _ _ O
sautéed _ _ B-FOOD
mushrooms _ _ I-FOOD

along _ _ O
with _ _ O

of _ _ O

and _ _ O
a _ _ O
spill _ _ O
of _ _ O

Ms. _ _ O
Wong _ _ O
makes _ _ O
an _ _ O
effort _ _ O
to _ _ O
bring _ _ O
out _ _ O
regional _ _ O
differences _ _ O
in _ _ O
Vietnamese _ _ O
cuisine _ _ O
by _ _ O
devoting _ _ O
sections _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
to _ _ O
Saigon _ _ O
and _ _ O
Hanoi, _ _ O
hundreds _ _ O
of _ _ O
miles _ _ O
apart, _ _ O
as _ _ O
well _ _ O
as _ _ O
Hue, _ _ O
somewhere _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
middle. _ _ O
She _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
have _ _ O
quite _ _ O
enough _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
from _ _ O
any _ _ O
one _ _ O
place _ _ O
to _ _ O
paint _ _ O
a _ _ O
full _ _ O
picture, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
project _ _ O
is _ _ O
intriguing. _ _ O
Like _ _ O
other _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
chefs, _ _ O
she _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
caught _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
tractor _ _ O
beam _ _ O
of _ _ O
cha _ _ O
ca _ _ O
la _ _ O
Vong _ _ O
, _ _ O
the _ _ O
turmeric-and _ _ O
dill-scented _ _ O
fish _ _ O
dish _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
specialty _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
100-year-old _ _ O
Hanoi _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
name. _ _ O
Her _ _ O
version, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
supplies _ _ O
less _ _ O
dill, _ _ O
less _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
and _ _ O
less _ _ O
satisfaction _ _ O
than _ _ O
some _ _ O
others. _ _ O
Her _ _ O
two _ _ O
improvisations _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
theme _ _ O
of _ _ O
Hanoi's _ _ O
best-known _ _ O
contribution _ _ O
to _ _ O
gastronomy, _ _ O
pho, _ _ O
are _ _ O
more _ _ O
effective. _ _ O
One _ _ O
gives _ _ O
you _ _ O
the _ _ O
soup _ _ O
without _ _ O
the _ _ O
noodles; _ _ O
floating _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
rich _ _ O
and _ _ O
cloudy _ _ O
broth _ _ O
are _ _ O
ghostly _ _ O
white, _ _ O
billowing _ _ O
won _ _ O
tons _ _ O
that _ _ O
contain _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
beef _ _ O
fillet _ _ O
freely _ _ O
seasoned _ _ O
with _ _ O
black _ _ O
pepper. _ _ O
The _ _ O
other _ _ O
dish _ _ O
is, _ _ O
humbly _ _ O
enough, _ _ O
a _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
soupless _ _ O
pho _ _ O
noodles _ _ O
stir-fried _ _ O
with _ _ O
springy _ _ O
mushrooms, _ _ O
bitter _ _ O
greens _ _ O
and _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
scallions. _ _ O
Its _ _ O
simplicity _ _ O
makes _ _ O
the _ _ O
impact _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
explain _ _ O
until _ _ O
you _ _ O
learn _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
showered _ _ O
with _ _ O
Maggi _ _ O
Seasoning _ _ O
, _ _ O
a _ _ O
soylike _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
invisible _ _ O
secret _ _ O
of _ _ O
many _ _ O
Vietnamese _ _ O
dishes. _ _ O
Nodding _ _ O
toward _ _ O
Saigon, _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Wong _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
rendition _ _ O
of _ _ O
shaking _ _ O
beef _ _ O
by _ _ O
stir-frying _ _ O
tender _ _ O
and _ _ O
chewy _ _ O
marinated _ _ O
hanger _ _ O
steak _ _ O
with _ _ O
potatoes _ _ O
and _ _ O
then _ _ O
throwing _ _ O
a _ _ O
fistful _ _ O
of _ _ O
watercress _ _ O
at _ _ O
it. _ _ O
If _ _ O
you _ _ O
think _ _ O
that _ _ O
sounds _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
French _ _ O
bistro _ _ O
plate, _ _ O
then _ _ O
you _ _ O
are _ _ O
starting _ _ O
to _ _ O
understand _ _ O
how _ _ O
her _ _ O
mind _ _ O
works. _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Wong _ _ O
cooks _ _ O
skillfully, _ _ O
with _ _ O
an _ _ O
appreciation _ _ O
for _ _ O
nuance, _ _ O
and _ _ O
she _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
abuse _ _ O
her _ _ O
freedom _ _ O
by _ _ O
innovating _ _ O
pointlessly. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
possible, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
that _ _ O
she _ _ O
could _ _ O
stand _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
less _ _ O
shy _ _ O
with _ _ O
chiles _ _ O
and _ _ O
herbs. _ _ O
The _ _ O
table _ _ O
salad _ _ O
of _ _ O
greenery _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
wrapped _ _ O
around _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
offers _ _ O
no _ _ O
herbs _ _ O
other _ _ O
than _ _ O
mint _ _ O
and _ _ O
basil, _ _ O
and _ _ O
you'll _ _ O
run _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
lettuce _ _ O
before _ _ O
the _ _ O
fourth _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
dressed. _ _ O
The _ _ O
green _ _ O
papaya _ _ O
salad _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
too _ _ O
innocuous, _ _ O
and _ _ O
while _ _ O
her _ _ O
version _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
street _ _ O
snack _ _ O
of _ _ O
grilled _ _ O
corn _ _ O
in _ _ O
fish _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
real _ _ O
success, _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
chiles _ _ O
would _ _ O
have _ _ O
more _ _ O
impact _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O
chile _ _ O
threads _ _ O
Ms. _ _ O
Wong _ _ O
balances _ _ O
on _ _ O
top. _ _ O
(Incidentally, _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
at _ _ O
Van _ _ O
Da _ _ O
makes _ _ O
a _ _ O
fine _ _ O
hot _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
milder _ _ O
and _ _ O
less _ _ O
acidic _ _ O
Sriracha, _ _ O
but _ _ O
servers _ _ O
never _ _ O
seem _ _ O
to _ _ O
remember _ _ O
to _ _ O
mention _ _ O
it _ _ O
until _ _ O
the _ _ O
end _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
meal.) _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
just _ _ O
three _ _ O
desserts. _ _ O
By _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
you _ _ O
order, _ _ O
one _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
may _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
86ed. _ _ O
With _ _ O
luck, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
the _ _ O
che _ _ O
will _ _ O
have _ _ O
survived. _ _ O
In _ _ O
Vietnam, _ _ O
che _ _ O
is _ _ O
thought _ _ O
of _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
drink _ _ O
even _ _ O
though _ _ O
it _ _ O
can _ _ O
take _ _ O
the _ _ O
form _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
pudding, _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
does _ _ O
here, _ _ O
where _ _ O
warm _ _ O
pearls _ _ O
and _ _ O
threads _ _ O
of _ _ O
tapioca _ _ O
are _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
in _ _ O
coconut _ _ O
milk _ _ O
with _ _ O
cubes _ _ O
of _ _ O
soft _ _ O
taro. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
just _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
qualify _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
dessert. _ _ O
A _ _ O
black _ _ O
dust _ _ O
darkens _ _ O
the _ _ O
surface: _ _ O
black-sesame _ _ O
brittle, _ _ O
ground _ _ O
to _ _ O
powder. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
a _ _ O
single _ _ O
dessert _ _ O
qualifies _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
impressive _ _ O
feat _ _ O
inside _ _ O
Van _ _ O
Da's _ _ O
tight _ _ O
quarters. _ _ O
Through _ _ O
the _ _ O
miracle _ _ O
of _ _ O
careful _ _ O
design, _ _ O
the _ _ O
space _ _ O
almost _ _ O
never _ _ O
feels _ _ O
cramped, _ _ O
but _ _ O
this _ _ O
is _ _ O
still _ _ O
an _ _ O
intimate _ _ O
restaurant. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
basement _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
seating _ _ O
area _ _ O
laid _ _ O
out _ _ O
as _ _ O
efficiently _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
cockpit _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
fighter _ _ O
jet; _ _ O
above _ _ O
it, _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
top _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
staircase, _ _ O
is _ _ O
an _ _ O
even _ _ O
smaller _ _ O
seating _ _ O
area _ _ O
sharing _ _ O
a _ _ O
room _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
window-facing _ _ O
dining _ _ O
counter, _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
bar. _ _ O
The _ _ O
cocktails _ _ O
that _ _ O
roll _ _ O
off _ _ O
that _ _ O
bar, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
gin-and-celery _ _ O
duet _ _ O
called _ _ O
the _ _ O
White _ _ O
Tiger, _ _ O
are _ _ O
much _ _ O
more _ _ O
sharply _ _ O
drawn _ _ O
than _ _ O
the _ _ O

Talking _ _ O
about _ _ O
how _ _ O
good _ _ O
the _ _ O
chef _ _ O
Thomas _ _ O
Keller's _ _ O
new _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
is _ _ O
would _ _ O
be _ _ O
easier _ _ O
if _ _ O
it _ _ O
weren't _ _ O
also _ _ O
painfully _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
step _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
city's _ _ O
mood. _ _ O
TAK _ _ B-EST
Room _ _ I-EST
is _ _ O
so _ _ O
determined _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
"timeless," _ _ O
as _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Keller _ _ O
has _ _ O
often _ _ O
called _ _ O
it, _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
seems _ _ O
clueless. _ _ O
TAK _ _ B-EST
Room _ _ I-EST
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
March, _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
11 _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
inside _ _ O
the _ _ O
720,000-square-foot _ _ O
mall _ _ O
at _ _ O
20 _ _ B-LOC
Hudson _ _ I-LOC
Yards. _ _ I-LOC
Parts _ _ O
of _ _ O
Hudson _ _ B-LOC
Yards _ _ I-LOC
are _ _ O
still _ _ O
under _ _ O
construction, _ _ O
but _ _ O
enough _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
finished _ _ O
for _ _ O
most _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
to _ _ O
figure _ _ O
out _ _ O
that _ _ O
this _ _ O
fistful _ _ O
of _ _ O
glass _ _ O
needles _ _ O
stabbed _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
West _ _ B-LOC
Side _ _ I-LOC
wasn't _ _ O
built _ _ O
for _ _ O
them. _ _ O
Just _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
helipad _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
offered _ _ O
to _ _ O
build _ _ O
for _ _ O
Amazon _ _ O
crystallized _ _ O
anger _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
cruddy _ _ O
state _ _ O
of _ _ O
our _ _ O
subways, _ _ O
the _ _ O
glittering _ _ O
new _ _ O
home _ _ O
on _ _ O
10th _ _ B-LOC
Avenue _ _ I-LOC
for _ _ O
global _ _ O
luxury _ _ O
brands, _ _ O
investment _ _ O
funds, _ _ O

business _ _ O
travelers _ _ O
and _ _ O
hunters _ _ O
of _ _ O
seven- _ _ O
or _ _ O
eight-figure _ _ O
apartments _ _ O
spurred _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
to _ _ O
ask, _ _ O
What's _ _ O
in _ _ O
it _ _ O
for _ _ O
us? _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Keller's _ _ O
answer _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
that _ _ O
looks _ _ O
and _ _ O
acts _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
millionaire's _ _ O
hangout _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
old _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorker _ _ O
cartoon. _ _ O
It _ _ O
charges _ _ O
like _ _ O
one, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
with _ _ O
adjustments _ _ O
for _ _ O
inflation. _ _ O
An _ _ O
eggplant _ _ B-DISH
Parmesan _ _ I-DISH
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
least _ _ O
expensive _ _ O
main _ _ O
course, _ _ O
at _ _ O
$30, _ _ O
followed _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
New _ _ B-DISH
Zealand _ _ I-DISH
salmon _ _ I-DISH
for _ _ O
$42. _ _ O
After _ _ O
that, _ _ O
please _ _ O
turn _ _ O
off _ _ O
all _ _ O
electronic _ _ O
devices _ _ O
and _ _ O
place _ _ O
your _ _ O
tray _ _ O
tables _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
upright, _ _ O
locked _ _ O
position, _ _ O
because _ _ O
we _ _ O
are _ _ O
going _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
$66 _ _ O
and _ _ O
$75 _ _ O
before _ _ O
reaching _ _ O
a _ _ O
cruising _ _ O
altitude _ _ O
of _ _ O
$85. _ _ O
Look _ _ O
down _ _ O
there _ _ O
-- _ _ O
don't _ _ O
the _ _ O
people _ _ O
look _ _ O
just _ _ O
like _ _ O
ants? _ _ O
TAK _ _ B-EST
Room's _ _ I-EST
timing _ _ O
is _ _ O
off _ _ O
in _ _ O
other _ _ O
ways, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
Hudson _ _ B-LOC
Yards _ _ I-LOC
has _ _ O
stirred _ _ O
up _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers' _ _ O
latent _ _ O
resentment _ _ O
of _ _ O
chain _ _ O
stores _ _ O
from _ _ O
beyond _ _ O
the _ _ O
Hudson, _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
what _ _ O
does _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Keller _ _ O
offer _ _ O
them _ _ O
but _ _ O
a _ _ O
clone _ _ O
of _ _ O
his _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
in _ _ O
Florida, _ _ B-LOC
the _ _ O
Surf _ _ B-EST
Club _ _ I-EST
? _ _ O
The _ _ O
name _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
changed, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
menus _ _ O
are _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
identical; _ _ O
they _ _ O
glorify _ _ O
the _ _ O
strait-laced, _ _ O
spice-free _ _ O
food _ _ O
that _ _ O
rich _ _ O
white _ _ O
Americans _ _ O
used _ _ O
to _ _ O
feed _ _ O
on _ _ O
when _ _ O
nobody _ _ O
was _ _ O
shaming _ _ O
them _ _ O
into _ _ O
being _ _ O
adventurous. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
food _ _ O
of _ _ O
"21," _ _ O
of _ _ O
three-martini _ _ O
lunches, _ _ O
steakhouses _ _ B-TYPE
and _ _ O
country _ _ B-TYPE
clubs: _ _ I-TYPE
prime _ _ B-DISH
rib _ _ I-DISH
and _ _ O
Dover _ _ B-DISH
sole, _ _ I-DISH
iceberg _ _ B-FOOD
lettuce _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O

Rockefeller. _ _ I-DISH
Of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
being _ _ O
a _ _ O
Thomas _ _ O
Keller _ _ O
production, _ _ O
TAK _ _ B-EST
Room _ _ I-EST
serves _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
refined, _ _ O
meticulous _ _ O
country _ _ B-TYPE
club _ _ I-TYPE
food _ _ O
you've _ _ O
ever _ _ O
seen. _ _ O
Most _ _ O
of _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
very _ _ O
good, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
few _ _ O
things _ _ O
are _ _ O
so _ _ O
inexplicably _ _ O
delicious _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
the _ _ O
sensation _ _ O
of _ _ O
slipping _ _ O
the _ _ O
knots _ _ O
of _ _ O
gravity _ _ O
and _ _ O
floating _ _ O
an _ _ O
inch _ _ O
or _ _ O
so _ _ O
above _ _ O
your _ _ O
seat. _ _ O
The _ _ O
entrance _ _ O
is _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
fifth _ _ O
floor, _ _ O
just _ _ O
past _ _ O
Neiman _ _ O
Marcus. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
action _ _ O
is _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
sixth _ _ O
floor, _ _ O
up _ _ O
a _ _ O
Deco-cubist _ _ O
staircase _ _ O
so _ _ O
grand _ _ O
that _ _ O
you _ _ O
may _ _ O
feel _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
underdressed _ _ O
unless _ _ O
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
Carole _ _ O
Lombard _ _ O
on _ _ O
one _ _ O
arm. _ _ O
(There _ _ O
is _ _ O
no _ _ O
dress _ _ O
code.) _ _ O
At _ _ O
the _ _ O
top, _ _ O
you _ _ O
find _ _ O
yourself _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
lounge _ _ O
where _ _ O
a _ _ O
pianist _ _ O
and _ _ O
upright _ _ O
bassist _ _ O
glide _ _ O
through _ _ O
satiny _ _ O
jazz _ _ O
standards. _ _ O
Bartenders _ _ O
whip _ _ O
up _ _ O
streamlined, _ _ O
uncomplicated _ _ O
drinks _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
either _ _ O
genuine _ _ O
classics, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
Pendennis _ _ B-DISH
Club, _ _ I-DISH
or _ _ O
modern _ _ O
drinks _ _ O
built _ _ O
along _ _ O
classic _ _ O
proportions, _ _ O
like _ _ O
the _ _ O
Tritter _ _ B-DISH
rickey, _ _ I-DISH
a _ _ O
tall, _ _ O
fizzy _ _ O
gin _ _ O
number _ _ O
that _ _ O
shimmies _ _ O
with _ _ O
absinthe. _ _ O
Around _ _ O
sunset, _ _ O
when _ _ O
pink _ _ O
light _ _ O
trickles _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
western _ _ O
windows, _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
pleasant _ _ O
room _ _ O
within _ _ O
a _ _ O
mile _ _ O
for _ _ O
fighting _ _ O
vainly _ _ O
the _ _ O
old _ _ O
ennui _ _ O
. _ _ O
They _ _ O
let _ _ O
people _ _ O
eat _ _ O
in _ _ O
this _ _ O
room, _ _ O
too, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
tempting. _ _ O
But _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
more _ _ O
to _ _ O
see, _ _ O
room _ _ O
after _ _ O
room, _ _ O
all _ _ O
laid _ _ O
out _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
London _ _ O
interior-design _ _ O
firm _ _ O
David _ _ O
Collins _ _ O
Studio. _ _ O
There _ _ O
are _ _ O
leather _ _ O
banquettes _ _ O
deep _ _ O
enough _ _ O
to _ _ O
lose _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
child _ _ O
in. _ _ O
Facing _ _ O
them _ _ O
are _ _ O
mohair-velvet _ _ O
chairs _ _ O
that _ _ O
swivel _ _ O
so _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
quietly _ _ O
surveil _ _ O
the _ _ O
room _ _ O
without _ _ O
craning _ _ O
your _ _ O
neck. _ _ O
Each _ _ O
table _ _ O
gets _ _ O
a _ _ O
white _ _ O
linen _ _ O
cloth _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
flickering _ _ O
oil _ _ O
lamp _ _ O
behind _ _ O
a _ _ O
white _ _ O
porcelain _ _ O
shade. _ _ O
The _ _ O
other _ _ O
colors _ _ O
are _ _ O
black _ _ O
walnut, _ _ O
midnight _ _ O
blue _ _ O
and _ _ O
law-firm _ _ O
green. _ _ O
At _ _ O
some _ _ O
point _ _ O
a _ _ O
captain _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
crisply _ _ O
tailored _ _ O
suit _ _ O
will _ _ O
deposit _ _ O
the _ _ O
wine _ _ O
list. _ _ O
It _ _ O
mostly _ _ O
avoids _ _ O
the _ _ O
latest _ _ O
fashions, _ _ O
like _ _ O
a _ _ O
croquet _ _ O
party _ _ O
on _ _ O
Nantucket. _ _ O
Later _ _ O
there _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
preamble _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu. _ _ O
Under _ _ O
the _ _ O
day-to-day _ _ O
care _ _ O
of _ _ O
Jarrod _ _ O
Huth, _ _ O
TAK _ _ O
Room's _ _ O
chef _ _ O
de _ _ O
cuisine, _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
a _ _ O
continental _ _ O
theme _ _ O
and _ _ O
an _ _ O
à _ _ O
la _ _ O
carte _ _ O
format. _ _ O
Highlights _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
pointed _ _ O
out, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
prime _ _ O
rib _ _ O
will _ _ O
certainly _ _ O
be _ _ O
mentioned, _ _ O
as _ _ O
will _ _ O
the _ _ O
restored _ _ O
1930s _ _ O
silver _ _ O
trolley _ _ O
on _ _ O
which _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
ferried _ _ O
from _ _ O
table _ _ O
to _ _ O
table. _ _ O
Here _ _ O
comes _ _ O
a _ _ O
French _ _ O
onion _ _ O
dip _ _ O
surrounded _ _ O
by _ _ O
newly _ _ O
fried _ _ O
potato _ _ O
chips _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
dark _ _ O
without _ _ O
a _ _ O
hint _ _ O
of _ _ O
charring. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
TAK _ _ O
Room _ _ O
in _ _ O
one _ _ O
extremely _ _ O
crunchy, _ _ O
lusciously _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
bite: _ _ O
an _ _ O
hors _ _ O
d'oeuvre _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
age _ _ O
of _ _ O
Naugahyde _ _ O
and _ _ O
polyester, _ _ O
transformed _ _ O
into _ _ O
something _ _ O
so _ _ O
good _ _ O
and _ _ O
pure _ _ O
it's _ _ O
beyond _ _ O
reproach. _ _ O
The _ _ O
Parker _ _ O
House _ _ O
rolls _ _ O
are _ _ O
gravity-defying _ _ O
orbs _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
soft _ _ O
cultured _ _ O
butter _ _ O
that, _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
evening's _ _ O
best _ _ O
magic _ _ O
trick, _ _ O
rises _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
custom-made _ _ O
dish _ _ O
in _ _ O
six _ _ O
identical _ _ O
ridged _ _ O
curls _ _ O
, _ _ O
like _ _ O
shrimp _ _ O
performing _ _ O
a _ _ O
Busby _ _ O
Berkeley _ _ O
routine. _ _ O
Bespoke _ _ O
flourishes _ _ O
like _ _ O
that _ _ O
are _ _ O
a _ _ O
TAK _ _ O
Room _ _ O
hallmark; _ _ O
see _ _ O
also _ _ O
the _ _ O
oyster _ _ O
crackers, _ _ O
like _ _ O
down _ _ O
pillows _ _ O
shrunk _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
size _ _ O
of _ _ O
Chiclets, _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
silk-smooth _ _ O
New _ _ O
England _ _ O
clam _ _ O
chowder _ _ O
that _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
likable _ _ O
appetizers _ _ O
and, _ _ O
at _ _ O
$16, _ _ O
the _ _ O
best _ _ O
value. _ _ O
Another _ _ O
hallmark, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
is _ _ O
unevenness. _ _ O
Avocado _ _ O
Louie _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
bouquet _ _ O
of _ _ O
other _ _ O
vegetables _ _ O
is _ _ O
thrillingly _ _ O
right, _ _ O
thanks _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
Thousand _ _ O
Island _ _ O
dressing _ _ O
that _ _ O
crackles _ _ O
with _ _ O
energy; _ _ O
the _ _ O
Caesar _ _ O
salad, _ _ O
made _ _ O
while _ _ O
you _ _ O
watch, _ _ O
has _ _ O
almost _ _ O
no _ _ O
personality. _ _ O
Grated _ _ O
Parmesan _ _ O
and _ _ O
anchovies _ _ O
vanish _ _ O
into _ _ O
it _ _ O
without _ _ O
a _ _ O
trace, _ _ O
along _ _ O
with _ _ O
dull _ _ O
croutons _ _ O
that _ _ O
could _ _ O
take _ _ O
some _ _ O
pointers _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
oyster _ _ O
crackers. _ _ O
Something _ _ O
called _ _ O
"warm _ _ O
soft _ _ O
boiled _ _ O
egg" _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
quietly _ _ O
joyous _ _ O
celebration _ _ O
of _ _ O
luxurious _ _ O
flavors _ _ O
and _ _ O
textures, _ _ O
the _ _ O
yolk _ _ O
running _ _ O
like _ _ O
lava _ _ O
over _ _ O
a _ _ O
buckwheat _ _ O
blin _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
heap _ _ O
of _ _ O
warm _ _ O
osetra _ _ O
caviar _ _ O
in _ _ O
crème _ _ O
fraîche. _ _ O
(Yes, _ _ O
warm. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
wonderful.) _ _ O
And _ _ O
the _ _ O
chilled _ _ O
prawn _ _ O
cocktail _ _ O
is _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
my _ _ O
platonic _ _ O
ideal _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
dish _ _ O
from _ _ O
now _ _ O
on. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
crab _ _ O
cake _ _ O
had _ _ O
very _ _ O
little _ _ O
crab _ _ O
flavor, _ _ O
on _ _ O
two _ _ O
different _ _ O
nights, _ _ O
although _ _ O
it _ _ O
contained _ _ O
almost _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
else. _ _ O
Lobster _ _ O
thermidor _ _ O
(now _ _ O
there's _ _ O
a _ _ O
name _ _ O
I've _ _ O
not _ _ O
heard _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
long, _ _ O
long _ _ O
time) _ _ O
is _ _ O
so _ _ O
tender, _ _ O
its _ _ O
sauce _ _ O
so _ _ O
fluffy _ _ O
and _ _ O
rich, _ _ O
that _ _ O
eating _ _ O
it _ _ O
becomes _ _ O
an _ _ O
intimate _ _ O
act. _ _ O
Dover _ _ O
sole _ _ O
meunière, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
has _ _ O
neither _ _ O
the _ _ O
crisped _ _ O
skin _ _ O
nor _ _ O
the _ _ O
juicy _ _ O
flesh _ _ O
that _ _ O
can _ _ O
make _ _ O
this _ _ O
fish _ _ O
so _ _ O
alluring. _ _ O
Yes, _ _ O
life _ _ O
cannot _ _ O
be _ _ O
one _ _ O
giant _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
dancing _ _ O
butter-shrimp. _ _ O
Still, _ _ O
the _ _ O
gap _ _ O
between _ _ O
great _ _ O
and _ _ O
non-great _ _ O
items _ _ O
-- _ _ O
nothing _ _ O
comes _ _ O
close _ _ O
to _ _ O
bad _ _ O
-- _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
too _ _ O
wide _ _ O
and _ _ O
comes _ _ O
into _ _ O

a _ _ O

too _ _ O
often. _ _ O

which _ _ O
could _ _ O
not _ _ O
be _ _ O
any _ _ O
more _ _ O
moist _ _ O
without _ _ O
breaking _ _ O
several _ _ O
laws _ _ O
of _ _ O
chemistry. _ _ O
Others _ _ O
will _ _ O
wish _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
had _ _ O
more _ _ O
concentrated _ _ O
beef _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
flaps _ _ O
and _ _ O
handles _ _ O
had _ _ O
not _ _ O
been _ _ O
trimmed _ _ O
off, _ _ O
perhaps _ _ O
in _ _ O
pursuit _ _ O
of _ _ O
some _ _ O
Kellerian _ _ O
quest _ _ O
for _ _ O
bovine _ _ O
symmetry. _ _ O
A _ _ O
large _ _ O
number _ _ O
will _ _ O
settle _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
roast _ _ O
chicken _ _ O
for _ _ O
two. _ _ O
The _ _ O
meat _ _ O
is _ _ O
juicy _ _ O
but _ _ O
not _ _ O
gushy, _ _ O
the _ _ O
flavor _ _ O
full _ _ O
but _ _ O
not _ _ O
salty, _ _ O
the _ _ O
jus _ _ O
dark _ _ O
but _ _ O
not _ _ O
over-reduced. _ _ O
After _ _ O
the _ _ O
chicken, _ _ O
the _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Alex _ _ O
McClenaghan, _ _ O
can _ _ O
offer _ _ O
a _ _ O
highly _ _ O
refined _ _ O
coconut _ _ O
cake _ _ O
or _ _ O
an _ _ O
urbane _ _ O
lemon _ _ O
meringue _ _ O
tart, _ _ O
but _ _ O
you'd _ _ O
almost _ _ O
have _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
insane _ _ O
not _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
the _ _ O
chocolate _ _ O
cake. _ _ O
Certainly _ _ O
a _ _ O
close _ _ O
relative _ _ O
of _ _ O
devil's _ _ O
food _ _ O
cake, _ _ O
his _ _ O
version _ _ O
weaves _ _ O
dark-chocolate _ _ O
cremeux _ _ O
between _ _ O
its _ _ O
many, _ _ O
many _ _ O
layers, _ _ O
all _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
wrapped _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
dark-chocolate _ _ O
frosting. _ _ O
And _ _ O
there _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
regulars, _ _ O
because _ _ O
the _ _ O
rewards _ _ O
of _ _ O
TAK _ _ O
Room, _ _ O
if _ _ O
you _ _ O
can _ _ O
find _ _ O
them _ _ O
and _ _ O
pay _ _ O
for _ _ O
them, _ _ O
are _ _ O
as _ _ O
intense _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
chocolate _ _ O
in _ _ O
that _ _ O
cake. _ _ O
The _ _ O
core _ _ O
audience _ _ O
may _ _ O
turn _ _ O
out _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
travelers _ _ O
on _ _ O
loan _ _ O
from _ _ O

Surf _ _ O

One _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
ways _ _ O
people _ _ O
pretend _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
sophisticated _ _ O
about _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
these _ _ O
days _ _ O
is _ _ O
by _ _ O
claiming _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
City _ _ I-LOC
dining _ _ O
scene _ _ O
has _ _ O
lost _ _ O
its _ _ O
edge. _ _ O
The _ _ O
sheer _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
-- _ _ O
about _ _ O
27,000, _ _ O
according _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
health _ _ O
inspectors _ _ O
-- _ _ O
makes _ _ O
the _ _ O
argument _ _ O
absurd. _ _ O
How _ _ O
many _ _ O
of _ _ O
them _ _ O
are _ _ O
slipping? _ _ O
All _ _ O
of _ _ O
them? _ _ O
Just _ _ O
the _ _ O
first _ _ O
20,000 _ _ O
or _ _ O
so? _ _ O
In _ _ O
reality, _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
gripe _ _ O
about _ _ O
the _ _ O
state _ _ O
of _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York _ _ I-LOC
restaurants _ _ O
are _ _ O
usually _ _ O
talking _ _ O
about _ _ O
a _ _ O
sliver _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
slice _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
fraction, _ _ O
probably _ _ O
around _ _ O
50 _ _ O
places _ _ O
whose _ _ O
names _ _ O
are _ _ O
in _ _ O
steady _ _ O
circulation, _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
newest _ _ O
weighing _ _ O
most _ _ O
heavily _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
results. _ _ O
The _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
really _ _ O
good _ _ O
ones _ _ O
is _ _ O
higher _ _ O
than _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
can _ _ O
count. _ _ O
Places _ _ O
that _ _ O
other _ _ O
cities _ _ O
would _ _ O
brag _ _ O
about _ _ O
get _ _ O
lost _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
crowd _ _ O
here. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chef _ _ O
Günther _ _ O
Seeger, _ _ O
for _ _ O
instance, _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
national _ _ O
star _ _ O
when _ _ O
he _ _ O
cooked _ _ O
in _ _ O
Atlanta. _ _ B-LOC
The _ _ O
tasting-menu _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
he _ _ O
opened _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
West _ _ B-LOC
Village _ _ I-LOC
three _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago _ _ O
should _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
a _ _ O
major _ _ O
destination, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
after _ _ O
he _ _ O
dropped _ _ O
the _ _ O
prices. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Seeger _ _ O
can _ _ O
make _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
bend _ _ O
to _ _ O
his _ _ O
will _ _ O
almost _ _ O
without _ _ O
touching _ _ O
them. _ _ O
His _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
outshone _ _ O
that _ _ O
of _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
city's _ _ O
more _ _ O
famous _ _ O
chefs, _ _ O
who _ _ O
whip _ _ O
their _ _ O
ingredients _ _ O
harder _ _ O
with _ _ O
far _ _ O
less _ _ O
payoff. _ _ O
Yet _ _ O
he _ _ O
struggled _ _ O
to _ _ O
put _ _ O
Günther _ _ B-EST
Seeger _ _ I-EST
NY _ _ I-EST
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
map. _ _ O
I _ _ O
reviewed _ _ O
it, _ _ O
but _ _ O
some _ _ O
other _ _ O
critics _ _ O
didn't, _ _ O
and _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
it _ _ O
closed, _ _ O
last _ _ O
month, _ _ O
Chris _ _ O
Crowley _ _ O
of _ _ O
Grub _ _ O
Street _ _ O
wrote _ _ O
, _ _ O
"it _ _ O
wasn't _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
you _ _ O
heard _ _ O
a _ _ O
lot _ _ O
of _ _ O
food _ _ O
geeks _ _ O
talk _ _ O
about." _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Seeger _ _ O
complained _ _ O
to _ _ O
one _ _ O
acquaintance _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
couldn't _ _ O
even _ _ O
get _ _ O
on _ _ O
a _ _ O
list _ _ O
of _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC
York's _ _ I-LOC
100 _ _ O
best _ _ O
restaurants. _ _ O
Of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
good _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
fail _ _ O
everywhere, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it's _ _ O
hard _ _ O
to _ _ O
imagine _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Seeger _ _ O
vanishing _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
crowd _ _ B-LOC
in _ _ I-LOC
San _ _ I-LOC
Francisco, _ _ I-LOC
Chicago _ _ B-LOC
or _ _ O
Los _ _ B-LOC
Angeles. _ _ I-LOC
Considered _ _ O
and _ _ O
rejected, _ _ O
maybe. _ _ O
But _ _ O
overlooked? _ _ O
Not _ _ O
likely. _ _ O
I'm _ _ O
not _ _ O
sure _ _ O
that _ _ O
any _ _ O
words _ _ O
of _ _ O
mine _ _ O
could _ _ O
have _ _ O
persuaded _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
to _ _ O
cuddle _ _ O
up _ _ O
to _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Seeger, _ _ O
who _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
cuddly. _ _ O
But _ _ O
I _ _ O
wish _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
found _ _ O
ways _ _ O
to _ _ O
remind _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
that _ _ O
his _ _ O
breathtakingly _ _ O
pure _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
was _ _ O
there _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
enjoyed _ _ O
while _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
still _ _ O
true. _ _ O
Which _ _ O
brings _ _ O
us, _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
circuitous _ _ O
and _ _ O
not _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
well-paved _ _ O
route, _ _ O
to _ _ O
Anthony _ _ O
Mangieri _ _ O
of _ _ O
Una _ _ B-EST
Pizza _ _ I-EST
Napoletana _ _ I-EST
. _ _ O
Using _ _ O
naturally _ _ O
leavened _ _ B-FOOD
dough _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
short _ _ O
shopping _ _ O
list _ _ O
of _ _ O
ingredients, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri _ _ O
makes _ _ O
what _ _ O
is _ _ O
unmistakably _ _ O
the _ _ O
finest _ _ O
sit-down _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
five _ _ O
boroughs. _ _ O
(I _ _ O
doubt _ _ O
he _ _ O
has _ _ O
any _ _ O
rivals _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
stand-up _ _ O
joints, _ _ O
either, _ _ O
but _ _ O
slice _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
different _ _ O
game.) _ _ O
Two _ _ O
years _ _ O
ago, _ _ O
I _ _ O
posited _ _ O
that _ _ O
Razza, _ _ O
a _ _ O
pizzeria _ _ O
in _ _ O
Jersey _ _ O
City, _ _ O
made _ _ O
"the _ _ O
best _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
in _ _ O
New _ _ O
York." _ _ O
I _ _ O
don't _ _ O
regret _ _ O
writing _ _ O
that, _ _ O
but _ _ O
I _ _ O
would _ _ O
like _ _ O
to _ _ O
point _ _ O
out _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri _ _ O
was _ _ O
not _ _ O
cooking _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
and _ _ O
that _ _ O
Razza's _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Dan _ _ O
Richer, _ _ O
has _ _ O
said _ _ O
that _ _ O
he _ _ O
began _ _ O
taking _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
seriously _ _ O
only _ _ O
after _ _ O
he _ _ O
met _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri. _ _ O
Una _ _ O
Pizza _ _ O
Napoletana _ _ O
saw _ _ O
a _ _ O
rush _ _ O
of _ _ O
curious _ _ O
pie-eaters _ _ O
after _ _ O
it _ _ O
opened _ _ O
on _ _ O
Orchard _ _ O
Street _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
a _ _ O
year _ _ O
ago. _ _ O
But _ _ O
the _ _ O
last _ _ O
few _ _ O
times _ _ O
I've _ _ O
gone, _ _ O
there _ _ O
were _ _ O
too _ _ O
many _ _ O
unclaimed _ _ O
chairs _ _ O
and _ _ O
bar _ _ O
stools. _ _ O
When _ _ O
Anthony _ _ O
Mangieri _ _ O
is _ _ O
making _ _ O
pizza, _ _ O
the _ _ O
right _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
empty _ _ O
seats _ _ O
is _ _ O
zero, _ _ O
as _ _ O
any _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorker _ _ O
who _ _ O
waited _ _ O
in _ _ O
line _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
old _ _ O
Una _ _ O
Pizza _ _ O
Napoletana, _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
East _ _ O
Village _ _ O
from _ _ O
2004 _ _ O
to _ _ O
2009, _ _ O
could _ _ O
tell _ _ O
you. _ _ O
Press _ _ O
interest _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
new _ _ O
place _ _ O
has _ _ O
died _ _ O
down, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
So _ _ O
when _ _ O
I _ _ O
heard _ _ O
a _ _ O
rumor _ _ O
that _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri _ _ O
was _ _ O
thinking _ _ O
of _ _ O
leaving _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
and _ _ O
taking _ _ O
his _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
with _ _ O
him, _ _ O
I _ _ O
was _ _ O
unnerved, _ _ O
to _ _ O
put _ _ O
it _ _ O
mildly. _ _ O
Asked _ _ O
about _ _ O
it, _ _ O
he _ _ O
told _ _ O
me _ _ O
he _ _ O
was _ _ O
considering _ _ O
it _ _ O
but _ _ O
hadn't _ _ O
made _ _ O
up _ _ O
his _ _ O
mind. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri _ _ O
has _ _ O
left _ _ O
New _ _ O
York _ _ O
before, _ _ O
and _ _ O
I _ _ O
didn't _ _ O
like _ _ O
it _ _ O
then, _ _ O
either. _ _ O
This _ _ O
time, _ _ O
I _ _ O
wasn't _ _ O
going _ _ O
to _ _ O
let _ _ O
him _ _ O
get _ _ O
away _ _ O
without _ _ O
a _ _ O
fight. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
true _ _ O
that _ _ O
my _ _ O
review _ _ O
of _ _ O
Una _ _ O
Pizza _ _ O
Napoletana _ _ O
last _ _ O
year _ _ O
was _ _ O
decidedly _ _ O
mixed. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
true, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
that _ _ O
almost _ _ O
every _ _ O
criticism _ _ O
I _ _ O
made _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
addressed. _ _ O
It _ _ O
has _ _ O
gone _ _ O
from _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
confounding _ _ O
pizzerias _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
to _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
enjoyable. _ _ O
The _ _ O
problem _ _ O
with _ _ O
Una _ _ O
Pizza _ _ O
a _ _ O
year _ _ O
ago _ _ O
was _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
trying _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
two _ _ O
things _ _ O
at _ _ O
once. _ _ O
It _ _ O
was, _ _ O
of _ _ O
course, _ _ O
a _ _ O
Neapolitan _ _ O
pizzeria, _ _ O
serving _ _ O
classic, _ _ O
unadorned _ _ O
pies _ _ O
baked _ _ O
for _ _ O
about _ _ O
two _ _ O
minutes _ _ O
inside _ _ O
a _ _ O
wood-burning _ _ O
oven _ _ O
shaped _ _ O
like _ _ O
an _ _ O
igloo. _ _ O
But _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
also _ _ O
a _ _ O
cutting-edge _ _ O
Lower _ _ O
East _ _ O
Side _ _ O
experiment. _ _ O
At _ _ O
the _ _ O
instigation _ _ O
of _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri's _ _ O
partners, _ _ O
the _ _ O
chefs _ _ O
Fabian _ _ O
von _ _ O
Hauske _ _ O
Valtierra _ _ O
and _ _ O
Jeremiah _ _ O
Stone, _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
brought _ _ O
forth _ _ O
appetizers _ _ O
that _ _ O
had _ _ O
rarely _ _ O
if _ _ O
ever _ _ O
been _ _ O
asked _ _ O
to _ _ O
live _ _ O
under _ _ O
one _ _ O
roof _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
pizza. _ _ O
There _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
jellylike _ _ O
mass _ _ O
of _ _ O
raw _ _ O
lobster _ _ O
inside _ _ O
a _ _ O
ring _ _ O
of _ _ O
chickpeas, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
rust-colored _ _ O
puddle _ _ O
of _ _ O
'nduja _ _ O
under _ _ O
raw _ _ O
turnips _ _ O
and _ _ O
nasturtium _ _ O
leaves. _ _ O
The _ _ O
wine _ _ O
list _ _ O
was _ _ O
virtually _ _ O
a _ _ O
treatise _ _ O
on _ _ O
natural _ _ O
wines, _ _ O
a _ _ O
long _ _ O
document _ _ O
full _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
names _ _ O
of _ _ O
eccentric _ _ O
producers _ _ O
and _ _ O
obscure _ _ O
European _ _ O
villages. _ _ O
In _ _ O
another _ _ O
restaurant, _ _ O
all _ _ O
this _ _ O
would _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
the _ _ O
departure _ _ O
point _ _ O
for _ _ O
some _ _ O
adventurous _ _ O
evenings. _ _ O
But _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
pizzeria _ _ O
it _ _ O
led _ _ O
to _ _ O
some _ _ O
peculiar _ _ O
pairings, _ _ O
made _ _ O
the _ _ O
check _ _ O
a _ _ O
bit _ _ O
higher _ _ O
than _ _ O
you _ _ O
wanted _ _ O
and _ _ O
resulted _ _ O
in _ _ O
long _ _ O
waits _ _ O
before _ _ O
you _ _ O
were _ _ O
finally _ _ O
allowed _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat _ _ O
the _ _ O
delicious _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
you'd _ _ O
come _ _ O
for. _ _ O
Over _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
year, _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
von _ _ O
Hauske _ _ O
and _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Stone _ _ O
have _ _ O
stepped _ _ O
aside, _ _ O
letting _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri _ _ O
call _ _ O
the _ _ O
shots. _ _ O
The _ _ O
wines _ _ O
on _ _ O
offer _ _ O
now _ _ O
number _ _ O
about _ _ O
15. _ _ O
They _ _ O
are _ _ O
still _ _ O
a _ _ O
likably _ _ O
eccentric _ _ O
lot, _ _ O
but _ _ O
picking _ _ O
one _ _ O
doesn't _ _ O
feel _ _ O
like _ _ O
studying _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
master _ _ O
sommelier _ _ O
exam. _ _ O
The _ _ O
appetizers _ _ O
are _ _ O
simpler _ _ O
and _ _ O
less _ _ O
expensive: _ _ O
a _ _ O
plate _ _ O
of _ _ O
marinated _ _ O
white _ _ O
anchovies, _ _ O
a _ _ O
dish _ _ O
of _ _ O
warm _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
olives _ _ O
or _ _ O
a _ _ O
bowl _ _ O
of _ _ O
Little _ _ O
Gem _ _ O
lettuce _ _ O
with _ _ O
sunflower _ _ O
seeds _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O
Caesarish _ _ O
dressing. _ _ O
I _ _ O
do _ _ O
miss _ _ O
the _ _ O
tiramisù _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
opening _ _ O
menu, _ _ O
but _ _ O
the _ _ O
new _ _ O
cannoli _ _ O
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
ricotta _ _ O
-- _ _ O
a _ _ O
blend _ _ O
of _ _ O
domestic _ _ O
cow's _ _ O
milk _ _ O
and _ _ O
Italian _ _ O
sheep's _ _ O
milk _ _ O
-- _ _ O
are _ _ O
nearly _ _ O
as _ _ O
good. _ _ O
It's _ _ O
common _ _ O
for _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
to _ _ O
trim _ _ O
its _ _ O
sails, _ _ O
but _ _ O
this _ _ O
one _ _ O
has _ _ O
trimmed _ _ O
its _ _ O
prices, _ _ O
too. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
beginning _ _ O
the _ _ O
five _ _ O
regular _ _ O
pizzas _ _ O
were _ _ O
all _ _ O
$25; _ _ O
now _ _ O
they _ _ O
range _ _ O
from _ _ O
$19 _ _ O
to _ _ O
$25, _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O
extra-complicated _ _ O
Friday _ _ O
and _ _ O
Saturday _ _ O
pizzas _ _ O
are _ _ O
priced _ _ O
at _ _ O
$26. _ _ O
I _ _ O
liked _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Mangieri's _ _ O
pies _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
East _ _ O
Village, _ _ O
I _ _ O
liked _ _ O
them _ _ O
more _ _ O
when _ _ O
he _ _ O
came _ _ O
back _ _ O
to _ _ O
town, _ _ O
and _ _ O
it's _ _ O
possible, _ _ O
just _ _ O
possible, _ _ O
that _ _ O
they've _ _ O
improved _ _ O
over _ _ O
the _ _ O
past _ _ O
year. _ _ O
He _ _ O
is, _ _ O
like _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Seeger, _ _ O
a _ _ O
minimalist. _ _ O
He _ _ O
lets _ _ O
you _ _ O
notice _ _ O
each _ _ O
ingredient: _ _ O
the _ _ O
little _ _ O
ping _ _ O
of _ _ O
sourness _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
Campanian _ _ O
buffalo _ _ O
mozzarella, _ _ O
for _ _ O
instance. _ _ O
Or _ _ O
the _ _ O
unruly, _ _ O
windswept-hillside _ _ O
aroma _ _ O
of _ _ O
dried _ _ O
Sicilian _ _ O
oregano. _ _ O
The _ _ O
precise _ _ O
crunch _ _ O
of _ _ O
each _ _ O
unrefined _ _ O
Trapani _ _ O
sea-salt _ _ O
crystal _ _ O
waiting _ _ O
to _ _ O
dissolve. _ _ O
The _ _ O
crust _ _ O
is _ _ O
so _ _ O
tender _ _ O
it _ _ O
barely _ _ O
fights _ _ O
fork, _ _ O
knife _ _ O
or _ _ O
teeth. _ _ O
Some _ _ O
diners _ _ O
will _ _ O
wish _ _ O
it _ _ O
put _ _ O
up _ _ O
more _ _ O
crackly _ _ O
resistance. _ _ O
You _ _ O
inhale _ _ O
it _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
as _ _ O
much _ _ O
as _ _ O
you _ _ O
eat _ _ O
it. _ _ O
When _ _ O
you _ _ O
have _ _ O
finished, _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
popular _ _ O
pizzas _ _ O
in _ _ O
town _ _ O
will _ _ O
seem _ _ O
tough, _ _ O
leathery, _ _ O
overworked. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
if _ _ O
this _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
the _ _ O
style _ _ O
you _ _ O
crave, _ _ O
you'll _ _ O
know _ _ O
that _ _ O
it's _ _ O
the _ _ O
work _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
baker _ _ O
who _ _ O
has _ _ O
spent _ _ O
years _ _ O
listening _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
dough. _ _ O
There _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
place _ _ O
for _ _ O
people _ _ O
who _ _ O
are _ _ O
as _ _ O
obsessed _ _ O
with _ _ O
pizza _ _ O
as _ _ O

Good _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
don't _ _ O
rain _ _ O
down _ _ O
from _ _ O
nowhere, _ _ O
but _ _ O
Crown _ _ B-EST
Shy _ _ I-EST
came _ _ O
close. _ _ O
No _ _ O
doubt _ _ O
it _ _ O
went _ _ O
through _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
birth _ _ O
pangs _ _ O
as _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
others. _ _ O
As _ _ O
far _ _ O
as _ _ O
I _ _ O
can _ _ O
tell, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
it _ _ O
simply _ _ O
materialized _ _ O
one _ _ O
morning _ _ O
this _ _ O
March _ _ O
at _ _ O
70 _ _ B-LOC
Pine _ _ I-LOC
Street, _ _ I-LOC
and _ _ O
was _ _ O
open _ _ O
for _ _ O
business _ _ O
that _ _ O
afternoon _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
time _ _ O
the _ _ O
financial _ _ O
district's _ _ O
elevators _ _ O
began _ _ O
disgorging _ _ O
traders, _ _ O
bankers _ _ O
and _ _ O
analysts _ _ O
in _ _ O
search _ _ O
of _ _ O
5-o'clock _ _ O
refreshment. _ _ O
One _ _ O
reason _ _ O
it _ _ O
seems _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
crept _ _ O
up _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
city _ _ O
is _ _ O
that _ _ O
it's _ _ O
a _ _ O
large, _ _ O
well-capitalized, _ _ O
big-time _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
kind _ _ O
that _ _ O
only _ _ O
established _ _ O
groups _ _ O
seem _ _ O
able _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
ground _ _ O
these _ _ O
days. _ _ O
Yet _ _ O
Crown _ _ B-EST
Shy _ _ I-EST
doesn't _ _ O
come _ _ O
from _ _ O
Danny _ _ O
Meyer, _ _ O
Andrew _ _ O
Carmellini _ _ O
or _ _ O
any _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
usual _ _ O
suspects. _ _ O
Its _ _ O
two _ _ O
main _ _ O
players _ _ O
were _ _ O
recruited _ _ O
after _ _ O
talks _ _ O
among _ _ O
April _ _ O
Bloomfield, _ _ O
Ken _ _ O
Friedman _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
building's _ _ O
developer _ _ O
fell _ _ O
apart _ _ O
in _ _ O
2016, _ _ O
before _ _ O
accusations _ _ O
of _ _ O
sexual _ _ O
harassment _ _ O
engulfed _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Friedman. _ _ O
Crown _ _ B-EST
Shy's _ _ I-EST
chef, _ _ O
James _ _ O
Kent, _ _ O
used _ _ O
to _ _ O
run _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
NoMad _ _ B-EST
, _ _ O
and _ _ O
his _ _ O
partner, _ _ O
Jeff _ _ O
Katz, _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
managing _ _ O
partner _ _ O
at _ _ O
Del _ _ B-EST
Posto _ _ I-EST
. _ _ O
Neither _ _ O
exactly _ _ O
fell _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
turnip _ _ O
truck _ _ O
last _ _ O
week. _ _ O
As _ _ O
a _ _ O
team, _ _ O
though, _ _ O
they're _ _ O
unproven, _ _ O
and _ _ O
as _ _ O
they _ _ O
went _ _ O
through _ _ O
construction _ _ O
and _ _ O
hiring, _ _ O
the _ _ O
drumbeat _ _ O
of _ _ O
publicity _ _ O
was _ _ O
more _ _ O
muted _ _ O
than _ _ O
it _ _ O
might _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
if _ _ O
marquee _ _ O
names _ _ O
had _ _ O
led _ _ O
the _ _ O
project. _ _ O
Then _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
Crown _ _ B-EST
Shy's _ _ I-EST
location, _ _ O
a _ _ O
sprawling, _ _ O
soaring, _ _ O
street-level _ _ O
space _ _ O
that, _ _ O
as _ _ O
far _ _ O
as _ _ O
anyone _ _ O
recalls, _ _ O
has _ _ O
never _ _ O
held _ _ O
a _ _ O
restaurant _ _ O
before. _ _ O
Many _ _ O
New _ _ O
Yorkers _ _ O
have _ _ O
seen _ _ O
the _ _ O
1932 _ _ O
building's _ _ O
distinctive, _ _ O
hulking, _ _ O
pyramidal _ _ O
silhouette _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
skyline, _ _ O
but _ _ O
until _ _ O
recently, _ _ O
when _ _ O
the _ _ O
offices _ _ O
on _ _ O
its _ _ O
67 _ _ O
stories _ _ O
were _ _ O
repurposed _ _ O
as _ _ O
expensive _ _ O
apartments _ _ O
and _ _ O
hotel _ _ O
rooms, _ _ O
not _ _ O
many _ _ O
had _ _ O
encountered _ _ O
the _ _ O
frenzied _ _ O
exuberance _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
lobby, _ _ O
which _ _ O
makes _ _ O
use _ _ O
of _ _ O
polished _ _ O
marble _ _ O
in _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
five _ _ O
contrasting _ _ O
colors. _ _ O
It _ _ O
looks _ _ O
like _ _ O
something _ _ O
Bernini _ _ O
would _ _ O
have _ _ O
designed _ _ O
if _ _ O
he'd _ _ O
lived _ _ O
to _ _ O
see _ _ O
the _ _ O
Jazz _ _ O
Age. _ _ O
Depending _ _ O
on _ _ O
which _ _ O
entrance _ _ O
you _ _ O
use _ _ O
-- _ _ O
the _ _ O
revolving _ _ O
doors _ _ O
are _ _ O
crowned _ _ O
with _ _ O
aluminum _ _ O
reliefs _ _ O
of _ _ O
Art _ _ O
Deco _ _ O
flowers _ _ O
being _ _ O
pollinated _ _ O
by _ _ O
elongated _ _ O
stylized _ _ O
butterflies _ _ O
-- _ _ O
you _ _ O
may _ _ O
want _ _ O
to _ _ O
allow _ _ O
an _ _ O
extra _ _ O
five _ _ O
or _ _ O
10 _ _ O
minutes _ _ O
to _ _ O
take _ _ O
it _ _ O
all _ _ O
in _ _ O
before _ _ O
you _ _ O
eat. _ _ O
Above _ _ O
all, _ _ O
it's _ _ O
the _ _ O
extent _ _ O
to _ _ O
which _ _ O
Crown _ _ B-EST
Shy _ _ I-EST
already _ _ O
has _ _ O
its _ _ O
act _ _ O
together _ _ O
that _ _ O
makes _ _ O
you _ _ O
ask: _ _ O
Where _ _ O
did _ _ O
this _ _ O
place _ _ O
come _ _ O
from? _ _ O
The _ _ O
whole _ _ O
operation _ _ O
radiates _ _ O
confidence _ _ O
from _ _ O
start _ _ O
to _ _ O
finish. _ _ O
The _ _ O
finish _ _ O
brings _ _ O
real _ _ O
desserts _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
real _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
chef, _ _ O
Renata _ _ O
Ameni. _ _ O
She _ _ O
comes _ _ O
to _ _ O
Crown _ _ B-EST
Shy _ _ I-EST
fresh _ _ O
from _ _ O
Manresa, _ _ B-EST
in _ _ O
Los _ _ B-LOC
Gatos, _ _ I-LOC
Calif _ _ I-LOC
., _ _ I-LOC
and _ _ O
before _ _ O
that, _ _ O
she _ _ O
put _ _ O
in _ _ O
half _ _ O
a _ _ O
decade _ _ O
at _ _ O
Eleven _ _ B-EST
Madison _ _ I-EST
Park _ _ I-EST
. _ _ O
Her _ _ O
desserts _ _ O
at _ _ O
Crown _ _ B-EST
Shy _ _ I-EST
look _ _ O
uncomplicated, _ _ O
and _ _ O
you _ _ O
don't _ _ O
realize _ _ O
how _ _ O
intelligently _ _ O
they've _ _ O
been _ _ O
put _ _ O
together _ _ O
until _ _ O
you _ _ O
start _ _ O
to _ _ O
eat _ _ O
one. _ _ O
There's _ _ O
a _ _ O
milky-white _ _ O
yogurt _ _ B-DISH
cheesecake _ _ I-DISH
under _ _ O
tender _ _ O
spring _ _ B-FOOD
strawberries, _ _ I-FOOD
with _ _ O
smooth _ _ O
strawberry _ _ B-FOOD
sorbet _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
center _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
pistachio _ _ B-FOOD
crumble _ _ I-FOOD
sprinkled _ _ O
over _ _ O
that. _ _ O
Her _ _ O
chocolate _ _ B-DISH
tart _ _ I-DISH
gives _ _ O
her _ _ O
a _ _ O
chance _ _ O
to _ _ O
show _ _ O
off _ _ O
about _ _ O
half _ _ O
a _ _ O
dozen _ _ O
different _ _ O
effects _ _ O
she _ _ O
can _ _ O
work _ _ O
with _ _ O
chocolate, _ _ B-FOOD
starting _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
crunchy, _ _ O
crumbly, _ _ O
almost _ _ O
salty _ _ O
chocolate _ _ B-FOOD
crust, _ _ I-FOOD
moving _ _ O
on _ _ O
to _ _ O
a _ _ O
soft, _ _ O
soufflé-like _ _ O
filling _ _ O
and _ _ O
ending _ _ O
with _ _ O
curls _ _ O
of _ _ O
dark _ _ B-FOOD
chocolate. _ _ I-FOOD
Ms. _ _ O
Ameni's _ _ O
side _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
kitchen _ _ O
is _ _ O
also _ _ O
responsible _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
savory _ _ O
churros _ _ B-FOOD
filled _ _ O
with _ _ O
Gruyère _ _ B-FOOD
sauce _ _ I-FOOD
-- _ _ O
the _ _ O
menu _ _ O
calls _ _ O
them _ _ O
fritters, _ _ B-DISH
they _ _ O
taste _ _ O
like _ _ O
gougères _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
texture _ _ O
is _ _ O
something _ _ O
else _ _ O
entirely. _ _ O
Also _ _ O
her _ _ O
work: _ _ O
the _ _ O
miniature _ _ O
loaf _ _ O
of _ _ O
pull-apart _ _ B-FOOD
bread _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
appears _ _ O
after _ _ O
you _ _ O
order. _ _ O
With _ _ O
dried _ _ B-FOOD
olives _ _ I-FOOD
on _ _ O
top _ _ O
and _ _ O
olive _ _ B-FOOD
tapenade _ _ I-FOOD
between _ _ O
every _ _ O
skinny _ _ O
slice, _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
memorable _ _ O
parts _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
meal. _ _ O
Even _ _ O
the _ _ O
obligatory _ _ O
scoops _ _ O
of _ _ O
ice _ _ B-FOOD
cream _ _ I-FOOD
that _ _ O
restaurants _ _ O
seem _ _ O
required _ _ O
to _ _ O
offer _ _ O
aren't _ _ O
allowed _ _ O
to _ _ O
leave _ _ O
her _ _ O
pastry _ _ O
station _ _ O
until _ _ O
they've _ _ O
been _ _ O
turned _ _ O
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
composed _ _ O
dessert, _ _ O
and _ _ O
not _ _ O
some _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
slapdash _ _ O
sundae _ _ B-FOOD
, _ _ O
either. _ _ O
Satsuma _ _ B-FOOD
ice _ _ I-FOOD
cream _ _ I-FOOD
gets _ _ O
to _ _ O
wear _ _ O
a _ _ O
toasted _ _ O
turban _ _ O
of _ _ O
marshmallowy _ _ B-FOOD
meringue _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
some _ _ O
cracked _ _ O
honeycomb _ _ B-FOOD
candy _ _ I-FOOD
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
side. _ _ O
The _ _ O
effect _ _ O
is _ _ O
witty _ _ O
and _ _ O
delicious, _ _ O
progressing _ _ O
from _ _ O
purely _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
to _ _ O
bittersweet _ _ O
to _ _ O
tart _ _ O
and _ _ O
bittersweet. _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Kent's _ _ O
savory _ _ O
dishes _ _ O
pursue _ _ O
the _ _ O
same _ _ O
strategy. _ _ O
This _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
say, _ _ O
they _ _ O
regularly _ _ O
over-deliver, _ _ O
starting _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
iced _ _ B-DISH
Wellfleet _ _ I-DISH
oysters _ _ I-DISH
dressed _ _ O
with _ _ O
cucumber _ _ B-FOOD
jelly, _ _ I-FOOD
diced _ _ O
cucumbers, _ _ B-FOOD
grains _ _ O
of _ _ O
jalapeño _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
microleaves _ _ O
of _ _ O
purple _ _ B-FOOD
shiso. _ _ I-FOOD
An _ _ O
almost _ _ O
absurdly _ _ O
creamy _ _ O
purée _ _ O
of _ _ O
white _ _ B-FOOD
bean _ _ I-FOOD
hummus _ _ I-FOOD
under _ _ O
a _ _ O
fiery _ _ O
red _ _ O
slick _ _ O
of _ _ O
melted _ _ B-FOOD
'nduja _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
probably _ _ O
meant _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
shared, _ _ O
but _ _ O
as _ _ O
soon _ _ O
as _ _ O
I'd _ _ O
tasted _ _ O
it _ _ O
I _ _ O
came _ _ O
up _ _ O
with _ _ O
other _ _ O
ideas, _ _ O
as _ _ O
my _ _ O
dinner _ _ O
guests _ _ O
will _ _ O
testify. _ _ O
Two _ _ O
tartares _ _ B-FOOD
show _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Kent's _ _ O
talent _ _ O
for _ _ O
carrying _ _ O
bright _ _ O
new _ _ O
ideas _ _ O
with _ _ O
him _ _ O
into _ _ O
well-traveled _ _ O
territory. _ _ O
In _ _ O
the _ _ O
first, _ _ O
he _ _ O
laces _ _ O
hand-chopped _ _ O
raw _ _ B-FOOD
beef _ _ I-FOOD
with _ _ O
toasted _ _ B-FOOD
walnuts _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
earthy _ _ O
rye _ _ B-FOOD
croutons; _ _ I-FOOD
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
other, _ _ O
chopped _ _ O
raw _ _ B-FOOD
snapper _ _ I-FOOD
is _ _ O
sprinkled _ _ O
with _ _ O
individual _ _ O
juice-filled _ _ O
vesicles _ _ O
of _ _ O
grapefruit, _ _ B-FOOD
lime, _ _ B-FOOD
lemon _ _ B-FOOD
and _ _ O
orange _ _ B-FOOD
that _ _ O
pop _ _ O
between _ _ O
your _ _ O
teeth, _ _ O
a _ _ O
kind _ _ O
of _ _ O
instant, _ _ O
interactive _ _ O
ceviche. _ _ B-FOOD
Maybe _ _ O
one _ _ O
or _ _ O
two _ _ O
ideas _ _ O
should _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
left _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
side _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
road. _ _ O
The _ _ O
chicken _ _ B-DISH
liver _ _ I-DISH
ragù _ _ I-DISH
tossed _ _ I-DISH
with _ _ O
housemade _ _ O
cavatelli _ _ B-FOOD
doesn't _ _ O
need _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
so _ _ O
sweet _ _ O
with _ _ O
sherry; _ _ B-FOOD
a _ _ O
rough _ _ O
pesto _ _ B-FOOD
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
fine _ _ O
use _ _ O
for _ _ O
fresh _ _ O
chickpeas, _ _ B-FOOD
but _ _ O
isn't _ _ O
there _ _ O
a _ _ O
better _ _ O
partner _ _ O
for _ _ O
it _ _ O
than _ _ O
shaved _ _ O
jicama? _ _ B-FOOD
All _ _ O
is _ _ O
forgiven _ _ O
when _ _ O
Mr. _ _ O
Kent _ _ O
turns _ _ O
a _ _ O
mainstay _ _ O
like _ _ O
grilled _ _ B-FOOD
chicken _ _ I-FOOD
into _ _ O
a _ _ O
main _ _ O
course _ _ O
as _ _ O
exciting _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O
one _ _ O
at _ _ O
Crown _ _ B-EST
Shy, _ _ I-EST
which _ _ O
keeps _ _ O
the _ _ O
sunshine _ _ O
brightness _ _ O
of _ _ O
its _ _ O
citrus _ _ B-FOOD
marinade, _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ O
is _ _ O
served _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
purée-slash-hot _ _ B-FOOD
sauce _ _ I-FOOD
of _ _ I-FOOD
fermented _ _ I-FOOD
hot _ _ I-FOOD
and _ _ I-FOOD
sweet _ _ I-FOOD
peppers. _ _ I-FOOD
The _ _ O
vivid _ _ O
orange _ _ O
of _ _ O
that _ _ O
hot _ _ B-FOOD
sauce _ _ I-FOOD
almost _ _ O
matches _ _ O
the _ _ O
marble _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
lobby. _ _ O
But _ _ O
Crown _ _ B-EST
Shy's _ _ I-EST
two _ _ O
big _ _ O
dining _ _ O
rooms _ _ O
and _ _ O
extended _ _ O
bar _ _ O
are _ _ O
a _ _ O
little _ _ O
more _ _ O
restrained, _ _ O
dominated _ _ O
by _ _ O
cream _ _ O
tones, _ _ O
blond _ _ O
wood _ _ O
tables, _ _ O
and _ _ O
chairs _ _ O
with _ _ O
saddle-brown _ _ O
leather _ _ O
seats _ _ O
and _ _ O
backs. _ _ O
The _ _ O
only _ _ O
echoes _ _ O
of _ _ O
grandeur _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
enormous _ _ O
windows _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O
ceiling _ _ O
high _ _ O
up _ _ O
overhead. _ _ O
The _ _ O
wine _ _ O
list _ _ O
is _ _ O
one _ _ O
to _ _ O
get _ _ O
lost _ _ O
in. _ _ O
Finance _ _ O
wizards _ _ O
with _ _ O
bonuses _ _ O
to _ _ O
expunge _ _ O
can _ _ O
certainly _ _ O
do _ _ O
that, _ _ O
but _ _ O
it's _ _ O
great _ _ O
to _ _ O
see _ _ O
lots _ _ O
of _ _ O
bottles _ _ O
under _ _ O
$100 _ _ O
on _ _ O
almost _ _ O
every _ _ O
page. _ _ O
Anyone _ _ O
who _ _ O
knows _ _ O
what _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O
wines _ _ B-FOOD
cost _ _ O
wholesale _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
able _ _ O
to _ _ O
locate _ _ O
any _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
good _ _ O
deals, _ _ O
but _ _ O
even _ _ O
the _ _ O
unschooled _ _ O
will _ _ O
notice _ _ O
the _ _ O
value _ _ O
regions. _ _ O
They _ _ O
jump _ _ O
off _ _ O
the _ _ O
page: _ _ O
Portugal, _ _ B-LOC
Greece _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
New _ _ B-LOC

for _ _ O
instance, _ _ O
along _ _ O
with _ _ O
vast _ _ O
stretches _ _ O
of _ _ O
Germany _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
pockets _ _ O
of _ _ O
Spain, _ _ B-LOC
France _ _ B-LOC
and _ _ O
Italy. _ _ B-LOC
With _ _ O
so _ _ O
many _ _ O
strengths, _ _ O
Crown _ _ B-EST
Shy _ _ I-EST
must _ _ O
have _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
one _ _ O
thing _ _ O
wrong _ _ O
with _ _ O
it. _ _ O
And _ _ O
yes, _ _ O
it _ _ O
does. _ _ O
Obviously _ _ O
that _ _ O
name _ _ O
is _ _ O
ridiculous. _ _ O
Knowing _ _ O
that _ _ O

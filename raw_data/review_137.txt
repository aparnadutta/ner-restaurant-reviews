 First, the bad news. The restaurant under my microscope today is in a basement. It is closed four nights out of seven. Its sole offering is a $100 tasting menu that is not posted in advance. Substitutions are not allowed. And the name is impossible to say with a straight face: Le Restaurant. Now the good news. The basement, under a food market in TriBeCa called All Good Things , is a cozy place. The blond furniture, the pair of white candles suspended from a long row of wooden coat pegs, and the smell of wood smoke all transport you out of New York to some other place -- maybe a soothing, if somber, cabin by a Swedish lake. In the coming weeks, the narrow window of dinner service will be thrown open to five nights. Finally, if you are an omnivore, if you dream about uncommon ingredients and pure, focused flavors, then Ryan Tate's tasting menus are absolutely worth it. A dinner in April began with salmon mousse sandwiched between airy fennel-seed meringues. The flavors were gentle, but they got my attention, and the next course drew me in deeper. Here were gooseneck barnacles, long tubes ending in multifaceted beaks; they looked like the sawed-off legs of a Victorian piano. Swiped in melted butter and chopped spring garlic, the barnacles tasted a bit like the necks of steamer clams, but they were far more tender and much sweeter. Half of a roasted bird showed up next, its one leg stretched out, its foot curled in. It was a woodcock, one of the most prized game birds. That foot was weird but the meat was good, ruddy, juicy and strong. Just before dessert, I had my first bite of water buffalo. The soft and mild roasted loin wasn't as deeply satisfying as beef or bison, but still I went home wondering why we Americans eat the same three or four species almost every night and then complain that the main course wasn't as interesting as the appetizer. Mr. Tate, Le Restaurant's chef and a partner, wonders, too. "I'm always looking for alternatives to the status quo of beef, chicken, lamb," he said in a phone interview. "These are things we've all tasted hundreds of times if we're carnivores." In his last job, he got a glimpse of the status quo repeated indefinitely. He was the chef de cuisine of Savoy , in SoHo, when Ed Levine proclaimed on the Serious Eats blog that Savoy's cheeseburger "deserves a place in New York's burger pantheon." Suddenly almost every customer wanted dinner on a bun. At Le Restaurant, which he opened in March, variety reigns. Mr. Tate aims to revise at least half the menu every day. He has a second job that helps him do this, as the food buyer of All Good Things, ordering sea creatures, meats and odd lettuces that often end up in his kitchen. Tasting menus ask a lot of customers, but at Le Restaurant, we are rewarded with ingredients that would be hard to sell à la carte. Mr. Tate works in a contemporary mode, mixing new techniques with very old ones. Vegetables are at least as prominent as meat and fish. Flavor is pulled from within far more often than it is applied to the surface by, say, spices and herbs. Chefs who study enough photographs of this cooking style can imitate the look, but not the taste, which ought to seem as if it comes from a time when flavors were more pure. That requires determination and, maybe, secret knowledge. A few weeks ago at Le Restaurant, I ate skate so rich and tender I thought Mr. Tate had found a part of the piscine anatomy that nobody had noticed before. A soft fennel broth and bursting sections of pink grapefruit made fine partners for the skate, but the important alchemy had happened in the pan, when the fish was stewed in olive oil blended with dried, air-cured black olives. The sweet, tangy ingredient that made a bowl of long agnolotti with peas and a warm, nearly liquid egg so seductive? House-made cheese, slowly evaporated until it had shrunk to a dense, caramelized brick that was shaved over the pasta. In the style made famous by Noma in Copenhagen , some courses are served by the cooks who made them. When the man at the end of the plate is Amadou Ly, the pastry chef and a veteran of Mas and Tocqueville , it's a sure bet that something delicious is in store. It might be as plain as a candied chestnut and a spoonful of puréed, maple-spiked sweet potatoes with a little brown butter, or a more complex grouping of sweet strawberries, oil of mint, little beads filled with liquefied chocolate and panna cotta infused with lemon verbena. Whatever it is, Mr. Ly's desserts have a gentle, natural spirit that feels right after Mr. Tate's savory courses. There is a little more bad news. (There always is.) The greeting and the first few minutes of my meals were so rocky that I wasn't completely sure I was in a restaurant, let alone Le Restaurant. One night, I showed up without a reservation. The Web site had said walk-ins were welcome at the counter, but nobody seemed to know what to do with me. An employee in the market asked what I wanted and told me to wait at the top of the stairs. Five minutes went by. Finally, I started down on my own and was met halfway by a host. He seemed surprised and not entirely pleased to see me there. "Do you have any seats at the counter?" I asked. He gave me the same look that a butler answering the door in a dark old mansion on a hill gives a solitary traveler whose car has broken down. "I'm not sure we can accommodate you," he said. Silently, he turned and descended the stairs. He really should have been carrying a torch, but I followed him anyway. Eight stools were lined up at the counter. Seven were empty. Still without speaking, he pointed at one and walked away. Somewhere in the night, a wolf howled. But there is more good news: once I was settled in, service was unfailingly smooth and professional. I received sound advice on wines, which I appreciated because at Le Restaurant you never know what's coming next. Menus, handwritten on construction paper, don't arrive until dinner is over. As for the name, Mr. Tate said that he and Kyle Wittels, who owns All Good Things, called the place Le Restaurant "to be somewhat funny." So if you laugh, at least you'll be laughing with them.

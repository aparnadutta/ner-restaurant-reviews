 Nobody goes to Rome for the pizza. Rectangles of pizza bianca cut with scissors on the Campo de' Fiori from long planks shaped like diving boards, yes, but not for regular pizza. The standard circular pie is something travelers eat only after saltimbocca, puntarelle, spicy tripe, salt cod fritters, semolina gnocchi, porchetta, artichokes fried alla giudia and the holy pasta trinity of cacio e pepe, amatriciana and carbonara have all been checked off the list. It is food for the fifth night of vacation. And now the chef Nick Anderer has come to make this lesser stop on Rome's culinary pilgrimage route the main event of his new pizzeria, Marta . For the last five years Mr. Anderer has been a faithful custodian of the more famous Roman landmarks at Maialino , in the Gramercy Park Hotel. Marta, opened in September, is a continuation of that project, a spinoff that might have found a space next door if Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group had not decided to place it about a half-mile away in the soaring, stately lobby of the Martha Washington Hotel. Marta has Roman appetizers and entire Roman dishes repurposed as toppings for pizzas with thin crusts in the Roman style. Hold on, you say. Thin-crust pies are wall to wall around here. It is the house style of New York, a city to which people actually do travel for pizza. The style came from Naples with America's earliest pizzaioli more than a century ago, and it's been rejuvenated by modern obsessives who precisely calibrate their flour blends. What do we have to learn from Rome? Let's keep local pride in check for a minute. Marta's crusts are even thinner than what we think of as thin. Cooks in gray baseball caps press the dough flat with rolling pins on a marble counter. Slipped onto the floor of one of the hulking ovens whose black-tiled chimneys disappear into the hotel's second floor, the pies bake next to flickering stacks of firewood. The crust at first-rank Roman pizzerias like Da Remo in Testaccio is often compared to a cracker, but crackers crumble. This doesn't. It is more like the crust on a loaf of peasant bread from which all the soft crumbs have been stripped. It is durably crisp, unbendingly flat, and when you hold a slice by the edge, the rest of it juts out above the table like a cliff. Because everything I know about cliffs was learned from Wile E. Coyote, I kept waiting for the tip on each Marta slice to give way, but it never did. The pleasure of biting down on this pizza is both physical and auditory. The noise detonates along the jaw and plows right into the inner ear. Every bite sounds and feels like that. There is no soupy middle of steamed dough under wet tomatoes. It's pure crunch, all the way. What you lose with this style is the soft, springy, baguette-like curls at the edges of a Neapolitan pizza. The outer crusts of a Marta pie don't puff up; they stay hard and round, like grissini. When a pizza crust is all crackle, what's on top has to bring the flavor. This is where you see Mr. Anderer thinking like a cook. He has a great pizza-fied version of carbonara, with dots of egg and grated pecorino over crumbled, starchy potatoes and baconlike curls of guanciale. For a while, he was doing an enjoyable two-dimensional trippa alla Romana, too, spreading the rich, chile-boosted tomato sauce around the pie and arranging tender, not too chewy bands of tripe on top. In a more classical vein, the margherita, spread with flavorful tomatoes that are more pulp than sauce and punctuated with mozzarella, is superb. At $16, the buffalo mozzarella, richer and with a faint taste of the barnyard or wherever it is water buffaloes pass the time, is worth the $4 upgrade from the cow's milk variety. And if $18 seems high for a funghi pizza, note that the funghi in question are quartered chanterelles and frilly hen-of-the-woods, seasoned with thyme and just enough salt. Like almost all the toppings, the mushrooms are beautifully cooked with an insinuation of smoke; only the shoulder ham, layered between fontina and arugula, seemed to want more time in the oven, or maybe it needed to be sliced thin, so the edges could crisp and curl. Few pizzerias invest heavily in atmospherics, because pizza and the people who love it come and go in a few minutes. Still, it's a surprise just how little atmosphere the Union Square Hospitality Group has tried to conjure at Marta. The dining room, with its majestic high ceilings and blocky fluted columns, has the cold, empty monumentality of a 19th-century bank. There's some energy at the counter that faces the ovens, but very little in the rows of square tables behind it. The restaurant is open to the hotel lobby, and after a while, the comings and goings can make you feel as if you're eating in the waiting room of a train station. Lingering over a long series of courses is not advised. Marta works best when treated as a pizzeria, not a restaurant. Main courses are available, but they are not as trustworthy as the pies. Pork ribs managed to be both charred and undercooked, while a slow-roasted short rib needed a more potent infusion of flavor than gremolata could give it. The mixed grill of lamb chops, ribs and sausage was a magnificent exception, but in general the larger plates are best for those who can't eat pizza. (Marta does not make gluten-free dough.) A quick appetizer while the pizza bakes is absolutely recommended, though. Wood smoke wraps around rabbit meatballs, heavily peppered and herbed. The kitchen does fine work with hot oil, swathing vegetable fritters or seafood fritto misto in a translucently thin, light-gold batter and gently browning the bread crumbs around green supplì shaped from very good basil risotto. After pizza, there is an affogato that is exactly right, an ice cream sandwich that's harder to like than it should be (the salted chocolate cookies could be thinner or softer, the pistachios crisper) and a cup of tiramisù that's bracingly drenched in espresso. It costs just $5, which is helpful because pizza and fried food both need bubbles. Marta has a few Italian sparkling wines, but the real action is in the stockpile of nearly 40 Champagnes, from a $66 Roger Pouillon Cuvée de Réserve to some $300-plus vintage treats. Nobody goes to Rome for Champagne with pizza, either, but this isn't Rome.

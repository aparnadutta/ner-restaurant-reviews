Good news was rare, but she got some a few weeks ago from an unexpected corner: She had won an award for outstanding design from the James Beard Foundation. A design award? Ms. Chemla, the principal owner of Carissa's the Bakery, on Pantigo Road in East Hampton, N.Y., was responsible for the look of the interior, but she isn't an architect. To learn how to make a floor plan, she had walked into dining rooms, kitchens and bars across Manhattan with a tape measure. The news came as a surprise for another reason. In August, the foundation had issued a news release stating that, beyond some awards it had announced in May, it would not be disclosing winners in any other categories, presumably including the one Ms. Chemla was in the running for. \"The uncertainty of this time for our industry is already a hard reality and considering anyone to have won or lost within the current tumultuous hospitality ecosystem does not in fact feel like the right thing to do,\" Clare Reichenbach, the foundation's chief executive, said in the release. That seemed to be the end of that. Except it wasn't. The email Ms. Chemla received in September came from the architect James Biber, the chairman of the design awards committee. He congratulated her on her win in what was a new category this year, Outstanding Design of Alternative Eating and Drinking Places. Mr. Biber sent similar emails to the winners in the two other categories he oversaw. He added a caveat: Although their victories were real, Mr. Biber said, \"the Beard Foundation will not be publicly announcing the awards.\" Nonetheless, the winners were told they could, if they wished, mention the distinction \"as part of your own office P.R. efforts.\" How do you publicize an award from a group that doesn't want to admit that you've won? Ms. Chemla wasn't quite sure, so she asked Mr. Biber for clarification. A week later, a foundation employee emailed her and the other winners. The message turned the previous one on its head: The foundation would be releasing the results of the design awards after all, but the winners were asked to stay quiet about it until a virtual ceremony on Sept. 25. On Monday morning, in response to questions from The New York Times about the design awards, an official at the foundation said in an email that the honorees would be announced later in the day. Some nominees and winners have had a hard time keeping up with these switchbacks and swerves. \"To say it's been a bumpy ride hardly sums it up,\" said Joe Sundberg, an owner of Rupee Bar , in Seattle, which won the award for Outstanding Design for restaurants with 75 seats or fewer. For one of Mr. Sundberg's partners, Rachel Johnson, knowing that other restaurants will never find out if they won a Beard this year makes it a little hard to process Rupee Bar's good fortune. \"I don't understand why they had the design and media awards and not the others,\" Ms. Johnson said. \"I feel like they shouldn't have done any of them. It's just so confusing for everybody.\" Confusion may be the one outcome of the 2020 James Beard Awards that everybody can agree on. The foundation announced the results of its Book, Broadcast Media and Journalism Awards in May, when it still seemed possible that the remaining awards could be handed out in a gala ceremony in September. (This reporter has received six of them. He also served on the committee that oversees the restaurant awards in 2005 and 2006.) Over the summer, though, people involved in the restaurant awards say that urgent meetings were taking place behind the scenes. Some nominees had asked to be taken out of consideration. Others had fallen under suspicion of behavior that might reflect poorly on the awards. And, according to several people close to the awards, at least one foundation employee had raised a concern that no Black people had won any of the restaurant awards. Before a decision on how to proceed could be reached, the foundation announced that no further awards would be given out this year. Some nominees supported the decision. Others found it perplexing , like Katie Button , who was nominated this year in the category Best Chef: Southeast. Subsequent clarifications, revelations and responses to emails that Ms. Button sent to the foundation only deepened her concerns, as did hearing an account of the twisting, turning path of the design awards. \"It's another way of not telling the whole truth,\" she said. \"The stories of what's happening and the whys just haven't been adding up.\" Ms. Button, who added that she had found some Beard Foundation programs very helpful in her professional development, applauded the organization for its decision to conduct an audit of the awards process to root out systemic bias. \"Everybody can sympathize that this is a difficult situation and that they are trying to do their best,\" she said. \"But when somebody is trying to do their best, they need to own all the mistakes and problems along the way, and lay them out for the public, and not be afraid of what happens after that.\" Elaborating on the decision to announce the design award winners, Mitchell Davis, the foundation's chief strategy officer, wrote in an email today: \"As you know, the winners of these awards are design firms, not restaurants or chefs. There is a separate committee governing these awards and in turn, a separate set of criteria. The design awards short list did not experience the same issue with integrity due to nominee withdrawals after the voting concluded, so these honorees are being announced.\" For this article, Rupee Bar's designer, Heliotrope Architects, declined to confirm its win, citing the foundation's request for silence. So did ORA and Klein Agency, the two firms responsible for Auburn , a Los Angeles restaurant that was given the award in the 76-seats-and-over category. Both wins were confirmed by other people who had been told about the results. Mr. Sundberg, Ms. Johnson and another partner built much of Rupee Bar themselves with help from Mr. Sundberg's father, a builder. They fashioned dark wood, brass, polychromatic tile and plaster painted peacock blue into an exuberant lounge that radiates a lack of interest in midcentury minimalism. Few customers are lured by that interior these days, or even have a chance to see it; Rupee Bar has survived mainly on to-go sales for months. Still, having the design honored by restaurant world's most influential awards couldn't hurt. \"Any kind of recognition like this does move the needle,\" Ms. Johnson said. \"It definitely wouldn't have been a hindrance, and probably would have been a help.\" Auburn's award may be the last one it will win. In May, Eric Bost, the chef and owner, concluded that the restaurant could not survive the pandemic, and closed it. Amy Brandwein , a nominee for the Best Chef: Mid-Atlantic award this year for her work at Centrolina , in Washington, believes the foundation has worked hard to help the restaurant business grapple with abuse, discrimination and other deep-seated problems. Still, when she talks about the decision not to announce winners this year, the word that keeps coming up is \"sad.\" She said that her sadness is not for herself, but for other nominees who might have won \"a recognition that they will not receive.\" \"Things happen in life,\" Ms. Brandwein said. \"Life's short. And it would be nice if those individuals knew that they had received this.\" After she got the initial email from Mr. Biber, Ms. Chemla added \"2020 James Beard Award winner\" to the Instagram page she maintains for Carissa's. She hasn't taken it down. She is proud of the space she designed. By day, trays of pastry and bread slide in and out of the oven and customers drop by to eat a quick lunch at the stark slab of a communal table inspired by Donald Judd. By night, oil-burning ship lanterns are lighted, an eating counter is restyled as a bar and a relaxed, off-duty rhythm settles over the room. After the ceremony on Friday, her win will presumably be out in the open. But Ms. Chemla has mixed feelings about celebrating. \"It's very bittersweet for me to flatter myself\" by publicizing the award, she said, \"when others are equally deserving and will not be rewarded.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

But if you do decide to eat inside a restaurant, try to go at an hour when it's less crowded. Before you sit down, take a quick look around. If the management doesn't seem to be taking things like airflow and masks seriously, public health experts suggest eating somewhere else. \"A poorly ventilated indoor space with people talking is the virus's dream,\" said Lindsey J. Leininger, a clinical professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. Stuffy, stale air. Crowds standing around the host station or anywhere else. (Outdoor host stands are a good idea.) Tables that are too close together. The distance between customers who aren't seated together should be at least six feet, although some experts, like Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech, recommend 10 feet. Noise. People who talk when not wearing a mask are a risk. People who talk loudly, shout or sing without a mask are a bigger risk. Servers who linger at the table, or who drop their masks at any time. Windows and doors that are open to let in fresh air. Window fans that face out. (Beware of fans that face in and of floor fans, which could move virus-laden particles around the dining room.) Portable air purifiers with HEPA filters. Movable partitions, although they are not an invincible force. Carafes of water on the table, ordering by app and other ways of speeding up or avoiding interactions with servers.

Seegal, the committee charged that employees of the organization had \"compromised the integrity\" of the awards by trying to alter the established voting process this summer, after the voting had already taken place. The foundation suggested changing the procedure after a staff member expressed a concern that no Black people had won in any of the 23 categories. The statement, obtained by The New York Times, added that the foundation's \"subsequent lack of transparency undermines our confidence\" in a coming review of systemic bias in the awards process. The committee, which is made up of journalists, editors and other prominent figures in the food media, also accused the foundation of acting in ways that \"negatively reflect on the professional reputations\" of the committee members. The awards, considered the most prestigious and influential in American culinary circles, are presented in a black-tie ceremony in Chicago each May. This spring, as the coronavirus pandemic brought the restaurant business to a near-standstill, the event was postponed until September. Then, in August, the organization, a nonprofit group, made an unusual decision: It would name no winners for its restaurant and chef awards, beyond a handful that had already been announced, citing the pandemic, among other reasons. Next year, there would be no awards at all. The foundation would use the down time for an audit that would look for ways of making the awards more inclusive of people and groups who had often been left behind by the restaurant industry. The awards are supposed to return in 2022. Last month, though, several committee members, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement, told The Times that the foundation's decision had come after several weeks of behind-the-scenes turmoil . After a vote, in May, on a ballot that listed about five nominees in each category, the foundation received accusations against several of the nominees, varying in seriousness and specificity. On a phone call in July that was arranged to discuss the new allegations, \"a Foundation employee revealed that there were not any Black people among this year's winners,\" the statement from the restaurant-awards committee said. \"Apparently in response, the Foundation proposed a revote.\" The proposal was to strike nominees who had come under fire, and to send a revised ballot to a much smaller group of voters than before. Ballots would go to the awards committee itself and the 200 or so regional judges they select, but not to the largest bloc, the hundreds of past awardees whose vote is a perk of having won. The committee \"unanimously rejected the attempt to alter established Awards procedure to obtain a different result,\" the statement said. As for the foundation's disclosure that there were no Black winners, the statement called it \"incredibly disappointing.\" But learning anything at all about who had won, even in the form of demographic data, was in itself \"shocking,\" the statement said, given that under the rules of the awards, all results are supposed to be kept confidential. The foundation's leaders have given versions of events that seem to be at odds with the one presented by the committee. In August, after The Times reported on the backstage discussions, Clare Reichenbach, the foundation's chief executive, denied that there was a list of winners to be revealed. \"There was no final vote on the winners,\" she said. The committee statement, signed by all 20 members, concludes by asking the foundation to acknowledge that a list of winners for 2020 exists, to confirm that \"demographics\" played a part in the decision not to release the list, and to explain, in essence, who at the foundation knew what about the winners, and when they knew it. (This reporter served on the restaurant awards committee in 2005 and 2006, and has received six of the foundation's journalism awards.) Ms. Reichenbach said in a statement on Wednesday that the withdrawal of several nominees after the voting \"compromised the original list of winners and it was our understanding that, therefore, there would be a revote. We thought it best, based on input from committee members and given the dire state of the industry, to change the approach to the Awards this year and next in recognition of these extraordinary times.\" She said the review of the way the awards are run would include new procedures \"to reallocate votes in the event nominees withdraw.\" Through a publicist for the foundation, Mr. Seegal said that Ms. Reichenbach's statement reflected his views as well.

This article has been updated to note that Pete Wells served on the James Beard awards' restaurant committee for two years.) The James Beard Foundation's declaration last week that it would not announce the winners of this year's major restaurant and chef awards startled Blake Spalding and Jen Castle, the two chefs who own Hell's Backbone Grill & Farm in Boulder, Utah. The week before, Ms. Spalding and Ms. Castle had taped a short video at the foundation's request in which they pretended to accept the award they had been nominated for, Best Chef Mountain. Told to give a 30-second acceptance speech, they thanked their employees, then clapped and laughed for 90 seconds, as if they had just won. All the nominees were being asked to make a video like this, they were told. Still, they allowed themselves to get their hopes up. Then they got a mass email from the foundation, calling the whole thing off. \"We were really gutted,\" Ms. Spalding said. \"It was a really demoralizing and wrenching thing to be so close and have them be, \u2018Never mind.' \" She was not the only one taken by surprise. Several people on the volunteer committee that administers the restaurant awards said they learned about an hour before the announcement that there would be no new winners this year because they seemed \"minor\" compared with the hardships restaurants now face. The foundation's news release said the decision not to name winners in 2020 or 2021 had been made \"after serious deliberation and consultation with members of the industry, Award committees, JBF staff, and partners.\" But the days leading up to the decision were so frantic that many people close to the awards say they aren't quite sure what had happened. With the winners' names to be broadcast at a virtual ceremony set for late September, the foundation struggled to stay on schedule as the ground shifted beneath its feet. Restaurant workers were taking to social media to denounce their bosses . The restaurant-going public was rapidly changing its notions of which chef behaviors should be rewarded, which overlooked and which shunned. As Black Lives Matter protests bloomed across the country, patience was growing thin over how few opportunities are given to Black chefs, including the opportunity to win Beard awards. The James Beard Foundation itself was trying to leave behind its origins as a group that celebrated the restaurant industry, and make itself over as one that led the charge for reform. It was a lot to handle. By last week, the foundation's leaders had settled on calling off the rest of the 2020 awards season, which only a few days before had seemed like a remote possibility. The short list of nominees had been announced in May. The final vote had been cast and counted soon afterward. But in July and August, the slate of nominees began to crumble, according to interviews with foundation officials, nominees and members of the committee that administers the restaurant and chef awards. Some chefs took themselves out of the running. The foundation asked others to drop out, having deemed them too controversial because new allegations about their personal or professional behavior had surfaced over the summer. The critics, reporters and other media people on the restaurant awards committee say they were overwhelmed by the number and speed with which chefs were falling under suspicion. At an emergency meeting held on Zoom in late July, a foundation staff member who had seen the final voting results raised a second concern: No Black people had won in any of the 23 categories on the ballot. This would not have been a first for the James Beard awards. The foundation and the restaurant awards committee had promised many times recently, though, to field more diverse slates of candidates. Many observers saw progress. This year, a number of Black chefs were named as semifinalists or nominees. But they had lost in the final round of voting, according to people who were briefed on the racial breakdown of the results. \"The message came through that they knew who the winners were, and the winners didn't look like they want them to look,\" said one committee member, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of concerns about violating the nondisclosure agreement everyone on the panel is required to sign. After some discussion, a suggestion was placed before the committee. \"We proposed removing previous winners\" from the voting body, said Mitchell Davis, the foundation's chief strategy officer. According to the procedures described on the foundation's website, votes on the restaurant and chef awards are given to the 20 members of the restaurant committee, to the 200 or so regional judges they appoint, and to hundreds of people who have won awards in the past. Established in 1990, the awards program embraces several fields, including design, journalism, books and broadcast media. But the prizes that are called the Oscars of the food world are the ones given to chefs and restaurants. (This reporter has received six of the journalism awards, and served on the restaurant awards committee in 2005 and 2006.) The restaurant and chef awards have long mirrored the American restaurant business itself, whose highest slopes of power and prestige have tended to be the preserve of white men cooking food mainly derived from Western Europe. Mr. Davis and others see the voting bloc of previous winners as a possible source of what he calls \"systemic bias.\" But taking them out of the process after the votes had been counted struck many members of the restaurant committee as foul play. \"The committee was like, if the results aren't what we wanted, tough,\" said one member, who asked not to be named because of the nondisclosure agreement. \"We're not going to get into vote rigging.\" There was less resistance to another proposal: a second vote, with the regular group of voters. The ballot would be edited to remove nominees the foundation now saw as problematic. But as summer went on, that list kept getting longer. \"The longer they waited, the more they learned about people,\" another committee member said. In July, Jessica Koslow, a Los Angeles chef, sent a letter to the foundation withdrawing as a candidate for Best Chef California. Her reputation had been bruised by allegations that she had taken credit for others' recipes, misled city health inspectors and allowed furry lids of mold to grow on pots of jam. \"Right now, my presence on the slate will only serve as a distraction,\" she wrote. On social media and in news articles, other nominees were accused of abusing, underpaying or mistreating workers. Additional accusations were made privately to the foundation staff. Several restaurant committee members, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that some of the allegations brought to them were so vague that they weren't sure what the problem was. Lacking the time to investigate each case, the committee asked the foundation staff to follow up. What happened next is in dispute. Committee members say they were waiting for more information about the allegations before making a decision. They also wanted the chefs to have a chance to tell their side of the story. But several chefs who received calls from the foundation say they had no chance to respond, and were given few details about what they were supposed to have done or who said they had done it. Mr. Davis said that in deciding what to do about chefs who fell under suspicion, the foundation was guided by a recently adopted awards criterion that allows chefs to be disqualified for \"allegations of criminal or unethical behavior, or behavior determined to be detrimental or contrary to the integrity and fair perception of the Awards.\" If he or someone else from the foundation called a chef, Mr. Davis said, \"we felt there was enough information to meet our eligibility criteria, which was about the reality that there is some controversy brewing that might affect the integrity of the awards.\" Told that several chefs felt they had no chance to respond to the information against them, Mr. Davis said, \"In questions when people in power are challenged in ways that might undermine that power, not enough weight is given to those who are making those challenges.\" One nominated chef said that a representative of the foundation called two weeks ago to communicate a charge that was both anonymous and nebulous: \"toxic kitchen culture.\" \"I said, \u2018Can you give me an example?' She said, \u2018That's it. Toxic kitchen culture.'\" The chef said the Beard representative suggested withdrawing from the ballot. \"She said, \u2018I'm in P.R., so I can give you a bunch of examples of how to do this.'\" This chef, who spoke anonymously to avoid being tainted by the suspicion of misbehavior, refused to drop out, and remains on the list of nominees. Several other chefs disappeared last week from that list, though, including Rich Landau, Paul Bartolotta, Kristen Essig and Michael Stoltzfus. On the same day, the foundation announced that it would not be disclosing the winners. Another name struck from the record belonged to the California chef David Kinch, a nominee in the Outstanding Chef category. Mr. Kinch wrote in an Instagram post on Aug. 15 that he had \"decided to remove myself from consideration, and potential acceptance of this year's award.\" No \"single event\" had led to the decision, he wrote, but \"the idea of celebrating achievement -- and all that our @manresarestaurant has accomplished -- simply does not feel right in the midst of the ongoing pandemic, and the devastation it has pressed upon our chosen m\u00e9tier and industry.\" In an email, Mr. Kinch said that withdrawing \"was my decision only,\" and that his only communication about it with the James Beard Foundation was sending it a copy of his statement in advance. Asked whether Mr. Kinch could be called a nominee for this year, Mr. Davis said: \"I would say no. I would say the record has been amended.\" Some people who work on the awards say they are concerned by how the foundation handled the allegations against nominees. \"I'm really troubled by the lack of process and transparency,\" said Hanna Raskin, who has been on the restaurant committee for three years. \"What I would like to know is, where is this information coming from and what are the standards? Do we have a list of disqualifiers? To me, it's a really big thing to remove somebody from a list.\" The group's chief executive, Clare Reichenbach, said in a statement on Tuesday that the decision to cancel the awards was not made in haste, but added: \"It is not a secret that we believe that there is work to be done in adapting our Awards policies to have a more fair and equitable playing field. If this means changing the way things have been done in the past, adapting judging privileges that have likely perpetuated bias, and taking a stronger stance on nominee behaviors that violate our guidelines, we are ready to do that for the betterment of the Awards and the community they serve.\" Arguing about the awards is a long-running sport in the food business, but even by those standards the foundation's choice not to name winners has been divisive. \"It makes no sense to me,\" said Alan Richman, a journalist and occasional New York Times contributor who once served on the restaurant awards committee. \"It seems they must have found some intrinsic flaw in the voting. What else could it be? If they found a flaw in the voting, they should say so.\" Ms. Raskin and others feel that the foundation has passed up an easy chance to help restaurants whose survival is threatened by the pandemic. \"What stands out to me about this decision is that the vote was conducted, winners were chosen and those winners weren't allowed to know that they won,\" she said. \"In this time of crisis for the hospitality industry, the foundation had an opportunity to do right by even one person, and decided not to do that for reasons that remain unclear.\" With the traditional Beard awards on pause until 2022, the foundation has said it is taking a year to work with all seven of its awards committees and \"an outside social justice agency\" to settle on new ground rules. The goal, the foundation said, is to \"remove any systemic bias\" and make the rosters of candidates even more diverse. Paola Velez, a pastry chef in Washington, was nominated in the Rising Star Chef category, which recognizes chefs age 30 or younger. When the awards return in 2022, she will be too old to qualify. Even so, she said that she doesn't mind that the world will never know whether she won this year. \"I'm an Afro-Dominican girl from the Bronx,\" she wrote in an email. \"My nomination has inspired so many, including myself. It's not about winning or losing for me.\" In Utah, Blake Spalding has had a harder time accepting that the award she was nominated for will never be given out. \"It feels risky to me to criticize the foundation,\" she said. \"But in a year when they had more women and racially diverse chefs as nominees than ever, why not make every nominee a winner? What does my nomination even mean now that it's been canceled?\" \"I am for a more just restaurant industry and a more just country,\" she said. \"There are a lot of dodgy practices in the restaurant industry that need to be changed. But is this going to change it, canceling the awards?\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

It was something like one of those MasterClasses that everybody is watching these days, except that those run for 20 minutes, and my lesson lasted more than six hours. It may not have been the longest Zoom call in history, but I suspect it set a record for Zoom calls with a strong focus on boneless poultry. It came about because for the past few months Mr. Buford has been on what he calls \"a chicken kick.\" He tends to get preoccupied with a recipe or technique or ingredient and keep coming back to it, over and over, until a new obsession takes hold. Recently he went on a mayonnaise kick, whisking grapeseed oil into egg yolks a drop at a time, sometimes adding the zest of a couple of lemons, a trick he learned when he worked for the chef Michel Richard . Several years ago, Mr. Buford went on a bread kick. He made the dough with flour he brought back from his last trip to France, a flour that he said was \"magical in the way that Bob's flour was magical\" -- Bob being what everybody called Yves Richard, a baker in Lyon who gave Mr. Buford his first apprenticeship after he moved to that city with his family in 2008. He said that as soon as the magical French flour ran out, \"I thought, \u2018There's no point in making bread.'\" The roots of all three kicks are recounted in Mr. Buford's latest book, \" Dirt: Adventures in Lyon as a Chef in Training, Father, and Sleuth Looking for the Secret of French Cooking .\" As in his previous two books, Mr. Buford's reportorial method is to embed himself with his subjects so completely that he becomes almost indistinguishable from them. In \"Among the Thugs,\" he got so caught up in the culture of violent English soccer fans that he was beaten up by the police. (\"It's surprisingly painful to be beaten,\" he said.) Pursuing his interest in Italian cuisine, the subject of \"Heat,\" he spent so much time with the chef Mario Batali that Mr. Batali seemed to forget that he was being watched by a very sharp and observant journalist who was taking notes on his crude patter and sexualized behavior years before multiple women accused him of assault, abuse and harassment. \"Dirt\" is the story of how Mr. Buford tried to understand the food of France by learning to cook it. For this, he moved to Lyon with his wife, Jessica Green , and their twin sons; took classes at the Institut Paul Bocuse , just outside the city; and eventually persuaded the chef Mathieu Viannay to let him volunteer in the kitchen of La M\u00e8re Brazier . The idea was to stay nine months. In Mr. Buford's world, though, departure dates, deadlines and other end points in time are more or less hypothetical. Not flight times -- they turned out to be real, as he learned when he and the boys missed the plane to Lyon that was supposed to begin their new life there, where Ms. Green was already waiting. He writes that his call to her from the airport was \"the nadir of our married life.\" Once they arrived, though, the family did not move back to New York for almost five years. In January, I asked Mr. Buford if we could cook together, making something he had learned in Lyon. At first he was going to have a dinner party. We were still talking in March when dinner parties began to seem unwise and then were banned. We finally settled on a video call. Whenever we talked or emailed, he would suggest different elaborations on the basic theme of poached chicken, and after a while just talking about chicken with Mr. Buford seemed at least as interesting as cooking it. Perhaps he would slide truffle slices under the skin for poulet en demi-deuil, the rarely seen chicken in half-mourning made famous by Eug\u00e8nie Brazier, the chef who founded La M\u00e8re Brazier. I wanted to see that. But I was also intrigued by another dish that had become a signature of Paul Bocuse , who had passed through the kitchen of La M\u00e8re Brazier in the 1950s: poulet en vessie, a whole bird steamed inside a pig's bladder. In \"Dirt,\" Mr. Buford described the appearance of the bladder during cooking with a sense of wonder that stuck with me: \"a beautifully golden, nearly translucent beach ball that some maniac is still insisting on pumping more air into. Also, you can see the chicken!\" One day Mr. Buford called to say that a parcel of bladders had arrived (\"they look like socks\"), but that he had also been talking to a producer at NPR about making chicken en vessie . Would I mind if we cooked something else? I did not mind. We had never exactly settled on poulet en vessie, and the French have so many other ways to cook a chicken. There would be more discussions about chickens before we got together on Zoom, but finally, one day at 2:30 p.m., I clicked a link and Mr. Buford's face appeared on my screen. He was wearing an apron. He had also finished his prep work. I found an apron, tied it on and chopped piles of mushrooms, parsley and bread crumbs as fast as I could. Mr. Buford seemed to be in no hurry. \"We split our duties, and Jessica usually takes over the school nights, because she tends to get food on the table more punctually than I do,\" he said. It was a Friday, though, one of the days when he is allowed to cook, and there was an understanding in the house that dinner might be served on the later side. Almost an hour had passed before we made our first approach to the chickens. Mr. Buford had me nick out the wishbone first. Off went the wing tips, and then he showed me how to slip the point of the knife into the small socket where the wing joins the carcass, running the point of the blade around the hollow place. Without any slicing of meat or sawing of bone, the joint swung free. Then we began exploring the interior of the chicken leg, which becomes a confusing place once you start taking out the bones. I angled my laptop's camera so he had a view of my cutting board. What was lying there looked less and less like a bird. \"It helps to reassemble the chicken every so often so you know where you are,\" he said. His patient manner was nothing like the rushed, barking tone he describes inside La M\u00e8re Brazier. \"Dirt\" depicts the sadism and bullying Mr. Buford experienced in the kitchen, and the sexism and racism shown to other workers. A Malaysian culinary student is taken on as a stagiaire; everybody calls him Jackie Chan. Even Mr. Buford did it until he learned the student's name, Chern Hwei Gan. A female cook, perhaps the first since the days of Eug\u00e8nie Brazier, was addressed as \"Mademoiselle\" for two weeks. After that, all pretense of respect was dropped, and the chef de partie would pretend to \"mount her from behind\" each time she passed. For the epilogue, Mr. Buford tracked them down to see how the mistreatment had affected their careers. Mr. Chern went on to open what Mr. Buford calls a \"witty and anarchic\" restaurant in Dijon . The female cook, though, gave up on restaurant kitchens and went into the fashion business. \"Her cooking spirit had been crushed,\" he writes. \"Dirt\" is more explicit about the damage done by masculine aggression and volatility in the kitchen than \"Heat,\" published in 2006. In that book, Mr. Batali is seen acting coarsely, making sexual suggestions toward at least one female employee. The author's tone, though, is nonjudgmental. I asked Mr. Buford if he regretted that now. \"I think I felt pretty confident in the weight of the observations,\" he said. \"A lot of the observations were not loaded in their presentation but loaded in their content. And I think that's what works.\" The book, which for years remained one of the only pieces of journalism that showed the uglier side of Mr. Batali's bacchanalian drive, caused a rift between the two men. \"Mario hated it, and it took him a long time to get over it,\" he said. \"He described it as \u2018standing naked in front of a mirror for 24 hours.'\" By 4:30, with Mr. Buford's video guidance, I had successfully taken out all the chicken bones that seemed to matter. I'd spread the chicken out like an open paperback and covered it with parsley, mushrooms and bread. Mr. Buford showed me how to tie the bird into a neat bundle with a wrap-and-twist motion that I've seen butchers make but have never been able to copy. \"Now we poach them,\" he said. The trick of this was to keep the stock between 150 and 160 degrees, well below boiling, barely hot enough to decorate the surface of the liquid with slow fingers of steam. The steady, moderate heat of the stock mimics the sous vide method. In fact, chicken breasts are now cooked sous vide with an immersion circulator at La M\u00e8re Brazier. Mr. Buford prefers the older, low-tech method because he gets two delicious things out of one recipe: very tender chicken breasts and double-strength chicken stock. During the lockdown, he began taking it one step beyond, boning several chickens, poaching them and then cooking the stock a second time, with the carcasses. He called it \"chicken squared.\" Earlier, I had asked Mr. Buford how the restaurants of a city once famous for its female chefs -- Brazier was one of many m\u00e8res in Lyon -- had come to be dominated by men such as Bocuse. He pointed to the generation that followed the m\u00e8res, including Bocuse's father and Fernand Point of La Pyramide in Vienne, who went off to train in expensive hotels before coming back to take over the family business. \"In hotels then, you would be taught the brigade system, which would be Escoffier ,\" he said. \"You're learning an expertise that the m\u00e8res didn't have. Also, if you have that training, you're not doing home cooking. You're being taught to do grand cuisine.\" The brigade system became standard in ambitious French restaurants, as did a more stylized form of cooking that took pains to set itself apart from what the m\u00e8res had achieved. It would take several generations for French women to regain what had been taken from them. Now, Mr. Buford said, \"There's a whole generation of female chefs in France who are better at the men's game than the men. They're brilliant and tough and they all had to force their way through the heaps of abuse they faced entering those kitchens.\" By 5:15, both birds were in the pot. Clearly, a glass of wine was called for. Mr. Buford called Ms. Green to join our Zoom cocktail hour. About 20 years ago, when I was writing news releases for The New Yorker, she had worked in the fiction department and Mr. Buford had been the fiction editor. The three of us never had a drink together, though. I had opened a Sardinian vermentino. Mr. Buford and Ms. Green had a long colloquy about whether they had a vermentino in the house from Sardinia or anywhere else. No. A riesling, perhaps? They settled on a Chablis, taking it out to a small patio behind their apartment. Ms. Green is a wine writer and educator. While the couple lived in France, she earned a diploma from the Wine & Spirit Education Trust in M\u00e2con. In the first year, though, she took care of 3-year-old twins while Mr. Buford learned to cook. \"They all the time said no to me,\" Ms. Green said. \"They walked home from the library barefoot one day because I got tired of fighting with them about putting on their shoes. And you were never there.\" This was addressed to Mr. Buford, who nodded. \"This was not a job I would have applied for,\" she said. \"And I did that all over the earth. I spent most of that first year taking them on trips.\" The boys are 14 now. The New Yorker has hired them to make videos of their father's cooking kicks. \"Frederick is the bossy-pants director and George is the genuinely bossy-pants cinematographer,\" Mr. Buford said. \"They're not getting a lot and they've got no rights whatsoever, but they're already talking about what they're going to do with the money. And they're quietly expressing disappointment that I haven't turned in another piece.\" Once a few glasses of wine had been put down, Mr. Buford and I went back to our kitchens. His chicken was nearly cooked. Mine was not. He began to whisking up a variation on sauce supr\u00eame that would incorporate sherry vinegar and mustard made with grape must. \"It's one of the secret weapons I picked up from M\u00e8re Brazier kitchen,\" he said. \"It looks like caviar. I love it.\" In theory, we were going to use the poaching stock for our sauces and for rice pilaf. In reality, there wasn't enough for both things, and we used quarts of stock we had bought from Cascun Farm just in case. The conversation turned back to his family's time in Lyon. Mr. Buford said that they would have become eligible for French citizenship if they had stayed a few more months. I asked him what happened. \"We ran out of money,\" he said. \"I wasn't earning money writing a book that took much, much longer than I thought it was going to take.\" The writing of \"Dirt,\" which he sold to Knopf in 2008, consumed 12 years. By May, when it was published, Mr. Richard had died -- both Mr. Richards, the chef and the bread-baking Mr. Richard known as Bob. So had other subjects and characters in the book. So had its editor, Sonny Mehta. This is all recounted in an epilogue called \"Just About Everybody Dies.\" At 7:30, Mr. Buford told his wife that dinner would be ready in half an hour. He brushed the poached chicken with orange juice and butter to help it brown, and put it into the oven along with a casserole of rice pilaf. I asked if he'd used stock for the rice. \"I used it for the rice and I used other stock for the sauce, but I'm not using it for the zucchini I'm about to do,\" he said. Wait, zucchini? It was about 8:15 when Mr. Buford told Ms. Green that it was time to call the boys for dinner. After Mr. Buford and I hung up, I tried to picture them all sitting down together. When they grew up, the boys would almost certainly remember when they didn't have to go to school for months and their father kept coming up with new ways to poach a chicken. A few days later, according to Mr. Buford, Frederick looked in the refrigerator. Once again, it was full of birds. \"So many?\" he asked. \"Why are we always eating chicken? I hate chicken.\" Recipes: Supr\u00eame de Volaille Fermi\u00e8re \u00e0 la Cr\u00e8me (Chicken Breast in Cream) | Cervelle de Canut (Herbed Cheese Spread) Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

Today, he said that he has resigned from the restaurant in order to seek an opportunity to work as a chef in a restaurant he owns himself. \"Something that profits off of Black and brown dollars should be Black-owned,\" Mr. Onwuachi said. \"It's something that's very, very important to me and something that I want to achieve in the future.\" The InterContinental Hotel Group, which operates Kith and Kin and the hotel in which it sits, the InterContinental Washington D.C. -- The Wharf, is still operating the restaurant. \"We are excited for the future of this innovative, landmark restaurant and look forward to sharing more details soon,\" said James Ryan, general manager of the hotel, in a prepared statement. Mr. Onwuachi said that his decision was not directly related to the pandemic. He said, though, that taking time off from Kith and Kin, which was closed from March until June, gave him time to think about what mattered to him. For three weeks in April, he returned to the Bronx, where he grew up, working with World Central Kitchen to prepare meals that were given away to Mott Haven residents and emergency medical workers. \"It was inspiring to cook for the community,\" he said. \"It wasn't, \u2018Oh the nuances, this curry doesn't have enough anise seed in it.' They were just like, \u2018Thank you for this food.'\" He is not sure where his next restaurant will be located. But he is sure that wherever it is, he will be in the kitchen. \"I'm going to cook, I was born to cook, I have to cook,\" he said. \"But I do need to take some time to think about how to build a better future. And I need ownership to do that.\" He also hopes to resurrect Philly Wing Fry, two outposts of which closed in Washington after gaining some renown for their cheese steaks made from dry-aged rib-eye. For Mr. Onwuachi, Kith and Kin was a chance to dust himself off after an earlier and more rarefied restaurant, the Shaw Bijou, failed less than three months into its run. At Kith and Kin, which opened in 2017, he changed gears. He imbued the menu with historical associations of slavery and the African diaspora, leaning more heavily on home-cooking traditions from West Africa, the Caribbean and New Orleans. When he accepted the Rising Star Chef of the Year award from the James Beard Foundation last year, he called himself \"my ancestors' wildest dreams.\" Esquire named Mr. Onwuachi the Chef of the Year in 2019 and placed Kith and Kin among the best new restaurants, even though the place was two years old by then. \"Sometimes a great restaurant takes a while to hit its stride,\" Jeff Gordinier, the magazine's food and drinks editor, wrote. That same year, Mr. Onwuachi published a memoir, \"Notes From a Young Black Chef.\" The book, which is being made into a movie, discussed racism in the hard-driving kitchens where Mr. Onwuachi had trained, provoking a conversation that has come to seem even more timely in the past few months. Paola Velez, Kith and Kin's executive pastry chef, also resigned last week to take the top pastry positions at two Washington restaurants, Maydan and Compass Rose. She will hold the jobs simultaneously. Ms. Velez, who was nominated for the James Beard Foundation's Rising Star Pastry Chef award this year, said that the pandemic and the ongoing protests about the killings of Black people in police custody had reordered some of her priorities. \"In our industry we are always typically fighting to keep the doors open,\" she said. \"Once the doors were blown off the hinges, I had time on my hands and was able to think things through.\" One of the things she thought through was her desire to \"do things for the betterment of other people.\" In June she and two other pastry chefs founded Bakers Against Racism , an \"online virtual bake sale\" to benefit organizations that try to help Black people and communities. So far, she said, the group had raised nearly $1.9 million. She said she felt that the owners of Maydan and Compass Rose were sympathetic to her career goals and her social aims.

Under an emergency program that began on June 22, about 6,800 establishments have been authorized to serve food and drinks at outdoor tables, turning patches of sidewalks and streets into cheerfully ragtag villages of patio umbrellas, beach canopies, outdoor fans and potted palm trees. Another 2.6 miles of roadway, including several blocks along some of the city's best-known restaurant rows, will be available for eating and drinking from Friday afternoons until Sunday nights starting this weekend, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Thursday. Under the plan, an extension of the city's Open Streets program, portions of 22 commercial strips in every borough will be closed to driving but open for dining. \"Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Little Italy -- Mulberry Street -- think about what is possible if we make them into centerpieces of outdoor dining ,\" Mr. de Blasio said. Many restaurateurs were quick to build street and sidewalk seating areas as soon as it was allowed. But some of the earliest adapters have almost immediately run afoul of the city Department of Transportation, which is overseeing the temporary outdoor cafes. The department's first set of guidelines permitted outdoor seating areas on streets with one or two lanes of traffic, to be set off by \"stanchions, barricades or planters, spaced at maximum 5 feet apart.\" Late last week, though, some new requirements appeared, including one that has caused problems for many owners: All barriers, on any kind of street, have to be at least 18 inches thick. Julie Reiner, who owns two bars on Smith Street in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, said that on Monday, an inspector from the department told her that the enclosures she had built around the bars, Leyenda and Clover Club , did not meet city standards. This surprised her. She had printed the specifications on the department's website and handed them to her contractor, who followed them to the letter, she said. He fashioned matching barriers for her bars and two other restaurants on the street out of wooden garden trellises anchored by paint buckets filled with cement. The inspector informed Ms. Reiner that her breezy latticework barriers were too thin; they had to be at least 18 inches thick. She was given 24 hours to change them. \"My contractor needed to fix four places on the block in 24 hours,\" Ms. Reiner said. The cost to each restaurant of taking apart the original barriers and building new planters was $1,000, or about three-quarters of its average nightly revenue. Losing money because the city changed the guidelines \"is really infuriating after all this,\" she said. In a statement, the Department of Transportation said: \"We've worked closely with the industry and city agencies to find processes that put small businesses back to work and kept New Yorkers safe. This program is a brand-new arrangement, enacted at an unprecedented pace, and restaurants have been generous with their patience. Our adjustments to Open Restaurants have been to make sure this program works safely for everyone.\" Interpretations of the department's guidelines have varied. An informal tour of neighborhoods in Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan this week turned up a wide array of materials used to set off seating, from heavy plastic Jersey barriers to colored tape. Some owners say they lost revenue, too. On Sunday, inspectors handed out cease-and-desist orders to an undisclosed number of restaurants, forcing them to shut down until they brought their seating areas into compliance with the new standards. In the East Village, the sandwich shop Foxface and the dusty nautical bar that adjoins it, the William Barnacle Tavern, had surrounded their in-street dining zone with metal barricades of the kind used to control crowds. On Sunday, an inspector informed an owner of Foxface, Ori Kushnir, that he would have to close until he came up with new, compliant barricades. Mr. Kushnir lost two days of business, he said, in addition to the more than $3,000 he had to spend on new, 18-inch-deep planters. \"Anybody who tried to do the right thing the first time, and is trying to do the right thing now, is spending thousands of dollars on this,\" he said. Restaurateurs say they have also heard mixed messages about whether they can seat customers in parking spaces that are cut off from the sidewalk by a bike lane, known as floating parking spaces. The answer is yes, according to the Department of Transportation. Some restaurateurs say they were told otherwise by inspectors. Frank Prisinzano, the chef and owner of three Italian restaurants in the East Village and Lower East Side, said he hopes he misunderstood the inspector who showed up last weekend. \"I spent close to $25,000 on all three restaurants,\" Mr. Prisinzano said. \"I wanted to do it right.\" While he waits to hear from the city, he said he would continue to seat customers in the floating parking spaces outside Lil' Frankie's on Second Avenue. \"It really is helping,\" he said. Indoor dining, which had been scheduled to return on July 6, was put off indefinitely this week as other cities that had allowed restaurants to reopen began to see alarming surges in new Covid-19 cases. Noting that the delay would hurt the hospitality business, Mr. de Blasio said Thursday that one goal of handing the streets over to diners was to \"give maximum options to restaurants and their employees.\" Mr. Prisinzano has little interest in reopening his dining rooms. \"I don't even want the indoors,\" he said. \"I don't feel comfortable seating people indoors. As long as we can put people outdoors, we can get through the summer.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

After thanking her for her business, the company informed her that it would be happy to send a truck to make personal deliveries to the hotel in Newport, R.I., where she and a friend have been living since March. Now, instead of having blocks of frozen meat shipped overnight, she can get freshly slaughtered Rohan duck breasts, squab and baby poussins brought to her door, along with bunches of ramps and other specialties. Ms. Kramer made a note of this in the spreadsheet where she keeps track of more than 50 high-quality food purveyors who are now selling directly to consumers, many for the first time. Some have lowered or dropped their minimum order requirements, or their delivery fees. Restaurant-supply companies that once sold fresh vegetables to chefs by the case now offer them in packages of 16, eight or four ounces. Items the local Stop & Shop rarely stocks -- wild morels, trays of sea urchin roe, pink hunks of sushi-grade tuna -- have become stars of Ms. Kramer's quarantine kitchen. \"It's not as much that I'm getting stuff I could absolutely never get before, but that I'm cooking with it all the time,\" she said. \"It's becoming the new normal because I now run a restaurant for two.\" While the pandemic has changed myriad aspects of American life in ways we are still starting to see (will anyone ever go back to a desk job?), none may be as pervasive as the new ways we shop and eat. As grocery shopping became a minor tactical operation, home cooks began to think like the chef of a small restaurant that is booked every night. To stock refrigerators and cabinets with supplies for menus planned a week or more in advance, they have turned to many of the same businesses that restaurants used -- from major regional wholesalers to family farms raising asparagus and a herd of goats. Many of these suppliers slapped together their retail operations overnight in March in a desperate attempt to survive the month. Now, as summer nears, these new trade routes may be here to stay. In San Francisco and Washington, D.C., fishmongers who once supplied only restaurants now send their trucks into residential neighborhoods. Midwestern farms that used to take chefs' orders by phone sell their vegetables and cheeses in consumer-friendly quantities through online stores. Restaurants in every major city now offer not just delivery and takeout -- minor lifelines for the industry -- but also boxes of the ingredients used in their kitchens, sometimes with recipes or assembly instructions included. Chefs are boxing up their hummus and selling partly-assembled meals to be finished at home -- all the supplies for beef barbacoa tacos; a clay pot of biryani sealed under a lid of dough that needs half an hour in the oven; cookies with decorating kits; meats that had been aged for expense account spenders, now for you. \"We have been talking for weeks now about how the entire business is going to change forever,\" said Marc Hennessy, the executive chef of Rare , a small steakhouse chain in Washington and Wisconsin that is now selling premium dry-aged cuts of meat butchered to order for home cooks. Retail is now about 30 percent of his business, he said, and \"we plan to keep that going.\" What this all means for home cooks is access to better ingredients, sometimes at better prices, and the demystifying of restaurant dishes in ways that have made replicating them at home all the more easy. \"One thing that customers have taken away from this pandemic is that they can actually fend for themselves at home,\" said Anthony Strong, the owner of the year-old Prairie , a mesquite-grill restaurant in the Mission District of San Francisco that is now a grocery store, which it likely will remain during the daytime. \"I think that should be encouraged.\" Large food distributors are still cautiously sizing up home cooks. Others have embraced them. In normal times, restaurant suppliers are essentially nutritional credit unions, giving clients ingredients in exchange for a promise to pay in 30 days or 60 days, if they didn't go out of business first. Retail customers, though, have a peculiar habit of paying up front. This has proved to be a boon for some companies. \"The cash flow model is incredible,\" said Adrian Hoffman, an owner of Four Star Seafood , in San Francisco, which over a single weekend in March rerouted its fleet of 13 fish trucks from high-end Bay Area restaurants to the home addresses of individual customers. Why not keep supplying them with special soy sauces from Japan, unusual oils and, on special request, eggs, Mr. Hoffman thought, for at least a portion of his trade? \"We certainly don't want to let this go when this is all done,\" he said. \"Selling directly to consumers is almost a better business in that it spits out enough cash to pay off everything we owed.\" Baldor Specialty Foods , a Bronx wholesaler specializing in produce and meat, started with a $250 minimum for home deliveries in March, but quickly dropped it to $200. The company also expanded its delivery zones, which radiate out of Washington, New York and Boston to beach towns stretching from Maryland to coastal New Hampshire. \"To home customers our message is, \u2018We'll travel with you this summer wherever you go,'\" said T.J. Murphy, the chief executive. \"Restaurants were always slow in the summer as it was.\" Home shoppers can now place orders with Baldor for rare and unusual ingredients like finger limes, foraged mushrooms and green almonds. They've also learned to treat the company as a virtual big-box store for bulk items as well as everyday staples like bananas. Retail customers are likely to stay in the mix as restaurants start to come back. \"Just like demand led us here, we think demand is going to lead us to the next chapter,\" Mr. Murphy said. For consumers, the Great Pivot of 2020 has brought access to items like prized oysters that until recently were found only at raw bars. Now they are sold by wholesalers or by the oyster farmers themselves, at prices that can be less than half of the $3 or $4 that restaurants typically charge. Many of these newly popular retailers draw on connections that supermarkets don't have. For Anna Thomas Bates and Anna Landmark, who produce sheep milk cheese at Landmark Creamery in Paoli, Wis., driving their award-winning products to the customer's front door has been \"a huge adventure,\" as Ms. Bates put it. They have been able to help some of their neighbors stay afloat by delivering fresh eggs, organic Desiree potatoes, locally milled spelt and rye flour, grass-fed beef and other products from other farms. This week, they will start taking orders for an assortment of cheeses, including some from other female cheesemakers around the country. These Victory Boxes, which can be shipped nationally, are part of a larger effort to help small cheesemakers and dairy farmers. Many farmers saw their customer base grow rapidly when they started making home deliveries. Nat and Alison Bjerke-Harvey usually sell about half the microgreens and garden vegetables they grow in Manhattan, Kan., to restaurants, and the other half at a farmers' market in town. Both were shut down in March, so the couple began loading their Piccalilli Farm sunflower and pea shoots into the back of their minivan, along with French breakfast radishes, beets and green onions. They quickly reached 200 deliveries a week. On Tuesday mornings, when their online store starts taking new orders, they sometimes sit and watch as items sell out within minutes. \"For a small specialty market in our part of the country, we don't usually have the problem of not being able to meet the demand,\" Ms. Bjerke-Harvey said. Restaurants have often had access to ingredients that their customers didn't know about or couldn't get their hands on. Getting a farmer or cheesemaker or winery to grant an exclusive on some obscure, delicious item used to be a considered a victory for chefs. The pandemic has put those relationships in a different perspective. \"There is this group of farms that relied on us, some of them 100 percent,\" Dan Barber, the chef of Blue Hill , in Manhattan, and Blue Hill at Stone Barns , in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., said. \"It feels like the ultimate expression of support. Then in a moment like this you realize you've created the weakest food chain imaginable.\" To keep cash circulating to the farmers, foragers and fishing crews that depend on Blue Hill, Mr. Barber began selling boxes of fish, meat or seasonal vegetables for curbside pickup. Customers get a grab bag of ingredients both well-known (greenhouse cucumbers) and less familiar (Purple Sword celtuce stalks ). Tucked into the boxes are recipes and background on the crops, including the information that the telltale holes in \"beetle-bitten brassicas\" were left by flea beetles, who have a knack for finding the sweetest plants in the field. As supply-chain disruptions have caused shortages in commodity beef and pork, meat from old livestock breeds raised on pastures has taken its place in some areas where a few small, regional slaughterhouses still remain. Grass & Bone , a butcher shop and restaurant in Mystic, Conn., has been flooded with orders for everything from grass-fed ground beef to lamb hearts and trotters. To supplement these cuts, James Wayman, the chef and an owner, also makes items like garlic-rosemary pork liver mousse, pasta sauces, and kits for tacos and burger For some restaurants, these kits straddle a line between raw ingredients and takeout, giving them something to sell that grocery stores can't. Shouk, a fast-casual Israeli restaurant in Washington, is now selling its hummus, which customers have been clamoring for, as well as falafel kits to \"help you get to the last mile at dinner,\" said Ran Nussbacher, a founder. (At least until this week, when protesters broke a window in the shop.) \"Raw falafel mix is really, really hard to do at home,\" he said. \"We use an industrial strength meat grinder, and a food processor at home won't get the same texture.\" These are all things he assumes customers will crave whenever Shouk's regular business returns to full strength. \"Anything we implement today is only something we think will work in the long term, not just to survive right now,\" Mr. Nussbacher said. Until the virus is brought under control, many restaurants will have to configure their dining rooms in new ways. In March, Good Dog Houston converted its two locations to convenience stores modeled loosely on New York City's bodegas, selling dried pasta and beans, canned tomatoes, paper towels and its own line of hot-dog kits. Last month, when the restaurants were allowed to reopen with strict limitations on indoor seating, they displayed grocery items on tables that they would otherwise have had to remove or leave empty. With the spoils, though, come the troubles. Home cooks, just like chefs, are learning about botched deliveries and products that don't live up to their billing. Ordering from wholesalers can also mean ending up with five liters of balsamic vinegar or carrots the size of a small child. But for Mr. Strong and other restaurateurs, the ability to offer provisions, cooking advice and food delivery is likely going to remain good business. \"We have a dining public that is more fickle than ever,\" he said. \"They bounce around from place to place, post their Yelp review, take a picture of their food and move on. We need real ways to provide for our community and have ways to be more sustainable. And any way we can rethink that, I think, is important.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

When New Yorkers hear the word brisket these days, they tend to think of brick pits, stacks of cordwood, neon Shiner Beers signs, and Willie and Waylon singing in the background. Those associations are relatively recent ones locally, dating to the renaissance of the smoked-meat sciences in Texas and the national fame of pit masters like Aaron Franklin in Austin. Before brisket was synonymous with barbecue, its meaning in the five boroughs was the one that you now encounter mainly around the Jewish holidays: a flat slab of beef breast cooked in a closed, humid environment for hours, at which point it not only falls apart unprovoked but also makes its own gravy. That dish has long been one of the chief attractions at David's Brisket House. Although David's has had many owners and probably other names as well, it is thought that the deli was founded by two Jewish men around the middle of the last century, before most of the remaining Jews in Bedford-Stuyvesant left for the suburbs, back when a Brooklyn deli could announce itself as a brisket residence and everybody would know just what that meant. At David's, braised brisket is sliced and stacked into hero rolls, hard rolls and rye. Some of the locals who meander in from Nostrand Avenue -- although David's has occasionally had bouts of fame and sometimes draws visitors from Manhattan, most of its trade comes from longtime inhabitants of Bedford-Stuyvesant -- prefer their brisket in another of its forms: pickled, as corned beef, or, better yet, brined and smoked under a jacket of pepper and other spices, as pastrami. Still others like to combine multiple brisket treatments in a single sandwich. Fuad Hassan and the other owners of David's imported this formula more or less intact for Pastrami Masters, making one striking change before opening. The storefront they had leased on Grand Street was being vacated by a counter-service Lebanese restaurant called Wafa's Express. There may not have been enough fans of hummus and baba ghanouj to keep Wafa's in business, but there were some fans nonetheless, and Mr. Hassan decided to try to hold on to them by fusing the Lebanese menu, almost in its entirety, to the Jewish deli offerings. Pastrami Masters is not kosher, but it is halal; Mr. Hassan, like the other owners, is a Muslim who was born in Yemen. The mastery of Pastrami Masters does not extend to the actual brining of corned beef or the smoking of pastrami. Like most other deli owners in New York, Mr. Hassan buys both meats from a supplier, although he does cook them on site, and he says he gives the pastrami an extra rubdown of seasoning. One effect of the name Pastrami Masters is that pastrami is now the uncontested star. It is Diana Ross, while the corned beef and brisket are the Supremes. Falafel and hummus are in the backing band. This is roughly how I see the menu, too. The corned beef tends to be steamed slightly too long, until it is a little pallid and spongy. Mustard revives it part of the way. What restores it almost completely is being made into a Reuben. The brisket is soft and juicy, even without extra gravy, but it always seems to be missing something. That something could be pastrami. Stacked one on top of the other, the two meats round each other out; the pastrami makes the brisket more interesting, and loses some of its salty intensity in the process. But the highest use of the brisket at Pastrami Masters is an easily overlooked entry on the menu called the Brooklyn cheese steak: hot brisket, gravy and melted American cheese on a hero roll with fried peppers and onions. This is one of those treasures of bodega cuisine, the food created by unsung meat slicers and egg scramblers using standard ingredients found in and around the deli case. The most celebrated example of bodega cuisine in New York is the chopped cheese , which shares some characteristics with the Brooklyn cheese steak. Unlike a chopped cheese, the Brooklyn cheese steak doesn't have lettuce and tomatoes on it. The crunch of lettuce wouldn't be welcome on top of the brisket, but the savory support of saut\u00e9ed peppers and onions most definitely is, as is the polite sharpness of American cheese. When Pastrami Masters finally trots out its breakfast menu, some time in the next month or so, it will begin offering another classic of bodega cuisine: the pastrami, egg and cheese sandwich. If it is made the same way as the one that David's Brisket House has served for longer than anyone remembers, it will be a compelling way to start the day. Like the other sandwiches, it will be improved if you request thick slices of pastrami. Deli-style rotary slicers are used, and when I haven't specified a thickness, my pastrami has sometimes been sliced too thin. Thicker slices seem to give the sandwich greater resistance, which is important with meat that has been steamed into submission as thoroughly as it has at Pastrami Masters. I wish the pastrami and corned beef were sliced with knives, as they are at Katz's Delicatessen . On the other hand, Pastrami Masters makes sandwiches in four sizes, not just a single one the size of a hiking boot. Neither deli uses rye worth singing about. As for the pastrami, if it were not for the different slicing techniques, I'd call it a tie. The Lebanese food was more convincing before the change of ownership. The falafel lately has been densely packed and gummy; makdous, baby eggplants stuffed with spiced chopped walnuts, have been bland and rubbery; the dips and salads have wanted salt and another squeeze of lemon. Lamb shawarma is still wonderful, though, so thickly seasoned with cloves, pepper, cinnamon and other spices that it is almost furry. And while the kenafeh I had gave the impression of having been stashed in the dessert case too long, the baklava is still sweetly evocative, doused with just enough rose water to give you the sensation of lying on a bed near an open window next to a rosebush on a warm night in June. These are nice embellishments, but when you go to Pastrami Masters your main objective will be one form of brisket or another served in some old-fashioned New York way. This is not, to be clear, a modern, artisanal product of the kind that people now associate with Brooklyn, with meat from weird-looking heritage breeds and Levantine spices that flew to the United States in their own business-class seat. For that kind of pastrami sandwich, now that Harry & Ida's is gone, your best bet is lunch at the new Hometown BBQ in Industry City, where the meat is smoked on site and sliced as thick as dominoes. It is very good, but it has a little more Texas in it than the archetypal skyscraper sandwich from a New York deli, which is what you get at Pastrami Masters. Naturally, a full line of Dr. Brown's canned sodas is available. As always, Cel-Ray with hot pastrami on rye is a beverage pairing as harmonious as Muscadet with oysters.

But in interviews they gave -- always in tandem -- it was clear that they were equal partners and that they agreed about everything from their preferred cooking surface (Teflon) to the ideal art to hang in the dining room (none). They share the job of executive chef at their second restaurant, Le Crocodile , also in Brooklyn. This is probably fortunate for them, given how popular the place has become since it opened in December. It is definitely fortunate for us, because another thing Mr. O'Neal and Mr. Leiber apparently agree about is how the food at a modern New York brasserie should look and taste. The menu's long, single page cascades from one category of appetizer to the next, from shellfish to snails, before arriving, about midway down, at Entr\u00e9es. That's a head fake: the word is used in the French sense, and denotes more appetizers. Ten main courses follow, under Plats Principaux, and then come a dozen desserts that more or less describe themselves: profiteroles, chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me, a cheerfully sour lemon tart. There are so many dishes you're not quite sure at first whether two guys whose best-known creation is a pancake will be able to keep up. They do that and then some. Nearly everything I've had at Le Crocodile has made me want to come back for more. This is not the easiest feat in a genre as thoroughly pawed-over and clich\u00e9-ridden as brasserie food, although to be precise we are dealing here with New York City's peculiar notion of brasserie food. In a New York brasserie you almost never see choucroute, but you may well see Jonah crab salad, which at Le Crocodile, is stirred with yuzukosho mayonnaise and sits on a cushion of avocado pur\u00e9e. It's delicious. So are other cold things from the raw bar: sea scallops in a spicy green pool of parsley juice, herbs and lemon; Wellfleet oysters, their deep pearly cups holding a splash or two of bay water. Despite this distinctly broad-minded understanding of brasserie cooking, though, Mr. O'Neal and Mr. Leiber do get in a lot of recipes that either come from France or make you think of it. Onion soup is mandatory in a place like this, but Le Crocodile makes it pull its own weight. The broth is almost velvety, fortified by lardons, and there are good crunchy mouthfuls of toasted sourdough croutons instead of the usual limp blobs of drowned bread. Pickled mussels, plump and orange, nod distantly to the plate of herring at every other brasserie in France, down to the pickled onions and carrots that ride along. Cold leeks in vinaigrette make an appearance, too, though they've undergone a little remodeling: trimmed into bite-size segments that are stood on end in a foundation of ravigote sauce and then covered with toasted hazelnuts. There's a sort of salade lyonnaise -- I say sort of because the lardons you'd find in Lyon have been replaced by smoked eel. The idea is great; the salad is smokier than the original, and with the wonderful added oily softness of the eel. In its framework, it is not too different from the smoked-herring Caesar found at M. Wells Steakhouse , and before that at the original, too-pure-to-last M. Wells in a stainless-steel diner . Mr. O'Neal cooked in the diner, and was later put in charge of M. Wells Dinette inside MoMA PS1. His cooking still has that half-crazy gleam in its eye, but the characteristic M. Wells urge to drive every dish to the edge of a cliff and then step on the gas is not much in evidence at Le Crocodile. He and Mr. Leiber, whose formative years as a cook were spent at Barbuto under Jonathan Waxman, are at home making food that seems perfectly normal and ordinary right up until you taste it. Le Crocodile slithered into the empty shell in the Wythe Hotel in Williamsburg that was left behind last year when Reynard closed. The industrial bones are the same: the double-height ceilings, well-worn floor planks, big arched windows punched through fortress-thick brick walls. But the interior was altered, hiding the open kitchen that used to dominate the room behind light wood paneling, replacing the bentwood cafe chairs with more comfortable models and adding some round leather booths. The results are dramatic; the room has a little more style and sense of purpose, and a lot more energy. It's a place where people, or at least Brooklynites, want to sit and stay. Even after 10 on a school night, there are salty stacks of pommes frites on every table. These are piled next to either the steak au poivre or the roasted chicken, in which case the poultry and the fries will be slowly soaking up a warm helping of chicken jus and fresh herbs. The bar is still in place, with a new marble top. Also left over from Reynard is an impressive trove of natural wines compiled by Lee Campbell, who was more than a few steps ahead of the pack. Rafa Garc\u00eda Febles now has the keys to the cellar, and has built judiciously on the legacy of Ms. Campbell and her successor, Basile Al Mileik. There's no way to mention natural wines, a modern New York brasserie and a pair of coequal chefs without summoning thoughts of Frenchette . Remarkably, there is very little overlap between them. Le Crocodile looks less McNallyish , and the kitchen is less entranced by organ meats, although somebody back there knows how to prepare sweetbreads, which are puffy and creamy on a small hill of potato pur\u00e9e, set off by charred onions and a fistful of lardons. (They must be on loan from the salade lyonnaise.) Both restaurants sell a lot of frites. The ones at Frenchette are better, but it's close. Both take the science of charcuterie seriously, but Le Crocodile, with almost half a dozen terrines and p\u00e2t\u00e9s to try on any given night, gets the edge. Even the mushroom p\u00e2t\u00e9, smooth as foie gras and held together by what must be a small mountain of butter, is superb. The food at both places shows great skill and self-assurance with very little preening and self-consciousness. You can tell when you eat at Le Crocodile that Mr. Leiber and Mr. O'Neal are cooking things they'd eat if they ever sat down in their own restaurant. That's rarer than you'd think.

This has not stopped Peruvian restaurants from sprouting up there. They line Jamaica Avenue under the shuddering elevated tracks of the J train, which by the time it gets here is nearly at the end of the line. Most are modest in spirit and unprepossessing in appearance. Seen from the outside, Caleta 111 Cevicheria seems to belong to this category, too. It's a narrow sliver of real estate, about as wide as a parking space. Not long ago it was a cellphone repair shop and, before that, a pet grooming service called New Happy Pawz. Your first clue that this cevicheria's ambitions are out of proportion to its square footage is likely to be the sight of the chef, Luis Caballero. He is easy to spot. His chef's jacket is stiff, spotlessly white and double-breasted, and his name is stitched in black below the left shoulder. He brought the jacket with him from Raymi, a bigger and more elaborate Peruvian restaurant near Madison Square Park where he was the sous chef until it closed two years ago. In place of a toque, Mr. Caballero's head is covered by a Panama-style hat with a wide, flat brim. In Peru, where he was born, raised and began his cooking career, this kind of hat is typically worn, with a swagger, by cowboys. The restaurant debuted last fall. Now Mr. Caballero is usually stationed by the front window, behind a counter that runs about two-thirds of the way back, ending in a dining area with seating for about 20 people. In front of him, dozens of limes are spread out. Lime juice jolts through almost every dish that leaves his end of the counter, which is in fact the restaurant's entire kitchen. It allows the dishes known as causas to escape the gravitational pull of the mashed potatoes they are built upon. It is trickled over choritos a la Chalaca, a platter of big, chilled mussels in their green-edged shells under a mound of raw Peruvian salsa. And, of course, lime juice is the main ingredient in the leche de tigre, or tiger's milk, that bathes all of Mr. Caballero's ceviches and makes them stand out from ceviches prepared anywhere else. The lime juice is joined by ginger, the combination that makes Moscow Mules worth drinking. Further assistance is provided by garlic, cilantro, the mighty rocoto pepper and one or two other chiles. There is corvina ceviche made with the sweet-fleshed white fish preferred by Peruvians, and there is shrimp ceviche. There is also an everything ceviche, into which Mr. Caballero will toss the whole fish market: clams, mussels, octopus, squid, shrimp and corvina. And you can have a ceviche built to your specifications, known on the menu as ceviche personalizado. If you do have one personalized, you might skip the squid, which isn't as appealing as the rest of the seafood. Whatever you choose will be outfitted with plantain chips, a few chunks of sweet potato and cancha, salty kernels of toasted Peruvian corn. (One of the best things about ceviche is that it comes with its own bar snack.) Earlier generations of ceviche cooks generally left seafood in its acidic marinade for hours until its flesh turned opaque, as if it had been cooked. Like many of his contemporaries, Mr. Caballero prefers a shorter soak, just long enough to infiltrate the seafood and slightly roughen its slippery texture. The milky liquid that the seafood gives off during its bath is perhaps the most important component of leche de tigre, being the one that transforms it from a marinade into a beverage, and probably the source of its reputation as an aphrodisiac. Some cevicherias serve a few ounces in a shot glass along with the ceviche. At Caleta 111, leche de tigre can be ordered from the menu, where it sits, alone, under the heading Hangover. It contains some marinated corvina but much more of its life-restoring liquid, so much more that it comes in a small glass bowl of the kind that usually provide a home for a Japanese fighting fish. Most ceviche connoisseurs will tell you that the leche de tigre is their favorite part of ceviche. This is how I feel about the leche de tigre at Caleta 111. It is what an energy drink would taste like if energy drinks were any good. Other dishes that hope to live up to the level of the ceviches have their work cut out for them. One that manages it is a seafood stew, aguadito de mariscos. Rounded out with vegetables and rice, it comes to the table bubbling in a hot iron pot. The broth contains so much cilantro paste it is bright green, and it gets a quasi-Japanese flavor from strands of yuyo, the Peruvian seaweed that looks like purple fettuccine with legs. A tamal filled with pork is another strong contender. The pork filling is fatty, which serves as a foil for warm and salty black olives. The ground corn surrounding the pork is exceptionally fluffy and sharp with dried aj\u00ed amarillo peppers. They are not quite spicy, but the rocoto puree on the side is. Sudado de pescado, kingfish in a tart seafood and beer broth, would have been more inviting if the main ingredient hadn't been overcooked. Arroz con mariscos -- rice with seafood -- is cooked in beer, too, seasoned with aj\u00ed amarillo and aj\u00ed panca. The beer is Peruvian, Cusque\u00f1a. Following Peruvian custom influenced by Italians, Parmesan is grated over the top. The menu names four desserts. What it doesn't say is that they are available on weekends only. At the back of the dining room is a screen on which surfing videos play without end. A surfboard is propped up beneath it. The walls are painted the blue that the inside of a wave takes on just before it breaks. Beer is served in plastic cups, as is the excellent chicha morada, a purple punch Mr. Caballero's wife, Yanet, brews each night from corn, pineapples, citrus peels and heavy doses of cinnamon and clove. The cups are out of keeping with the rest of the service pieces, which are more decorative. One plate is shaped like a whale. Another is shaped like a big whale and a baby whale swimming together. Cancha are served in a dish that looks like a spoon rest with the tail of a fish. Other dishes come in heavy, glazed ceramics or iron pots. Caleta 111 is also the first restaurant I've been to where the tables are set with nondisposable metal sporks. After slurping leche de tigre and spearing clams with one, I am prepared to say that ceviche is the spork's highest use.

Many of the restaurants that have been built there have seemed cursed on one level or another, but the latest one sounded uniquely inauspicious, starting with its timing. It opened in November -- the 13th of November. The Tavern by WS , as it's called, faces west on 11th Avenue, offering a last nostalgic glimpse of the West Side railyards before they vanish beneath the second phase of Hudson Yards. (Yes, there's going to be a second phase.) This winter, the restaurant's front door has seemed like the most ferociously wind-battered part of the whole site, no small distinction. It's such a forsaken spot that even the helpful greeters who roam the barren tundra between the buildings giving directions to despondent tourists stare blankly when you say you're looking for the Tavern by WS. Then again, it might be the name. To repeat, it's called the Tavern by WS. If my instinct didn't already tell me to beware of restaurants with bylines, past experience would. But an initials-only byline is even more suspect. Who is this W.S., and why would he, she or they hide behind first letters? Is it Willie Sutton, the succinct bank robber? Will Shortz, the world's only academically accredited puzzle master? Walter Slezak, the Austrian-born character actor? Watermelon Slim, the pseudonymous harmonica player? Wallace Shawn? Wayne Shorter? Whit Stillman? Wanda Sykes? I won't get your hopes up any further, because the real WS isn't a person at all. The initials turn out to stand for Wine Spectator , a magazine whose publisher, Marvin R. Shanken, owns the restaurant together with Steven M. Ross, the developer responsible for Hudson Yards, and Kenneth A. Himmel, another developer, who built the mall across the tundra where David Chang and Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s have their restaurants. Wine Spectator is probably best known for assigning scores to wines on a 100-point scale. Numbers in the 90s can be seen in screaming boldface print on \"shelf talkers,\" those hanging sales pitches that dangle in liquor-store aisles like socks on a clothesline. The notion that a drink produced by sunshine, rain, dirt, vines and yeast can be judged by how close it comes to perfection, signified by a 100 score, never made much sense. Now that many drinkers are turning to quirky, imperfect wines, the Wine Spectator's numerals seem like artifacts from an earlier time. Perhaps this is why the Tavern by WS looks as if its designer, Rockwell Group , finished all its drawings for the dining room around 1999, lost them, rediscovered them last year and decided they were still good to go. The interior's most prominent features are the wine walls. There's one by the host's desk, two behind the bar and more on a mezzanine that seems to have no other purpose. And catwalks, too, because what use is a wine wall without a catwalk? All that's missing to complete the Vegas-in-the-Clinton-era theme are women in bodysuits zipping up and down on cables to collect a Screaming Eagle here, a Harlan Estate there. For a magazine whose current issue has such cover lines as \"Bordeaux 2017: What to Buy\" and \"2017: Another Great Vintage\" (that one is about Oregon pinot noir), these walls seem almost inevitable. Any magazine like Wine Spectator is going to promote wine as a status symbol; this just turns the idea into architecture. The Tavern by WS is very nearly another case of an aging brand getting funky on the dance floor to prove that the old man's still got it. But somewhere in an unseen kitchen behind those walls, a brigade of cooks is working like crazy to keep that from happening. They're led by Eli Kaimeh, who worked for Thomas Keller for 13 years, ultimately as chef de cuisine at Per Se . He was there in 2015, when I reviewed the restaurant , and the cooking seemed to have lost its conviction. At this new restaurant, though, he has a clear sense of what he wants to do and how to do it. The menu is a laundry list of routine American restaurant dishes like grilled salmon, but they're almost all made over in ways that improve them without becoming excessively fiddly, a fate that is never far away in Mr. Keller's restaurants. Mr. Kaimeh has helped turn the Tavern by WS into a good restaurant, despite its owners' efforts to make it look like the opposite. The minestrone has tiny pasta tubes, two types of shell bean, two types of string beans and miniature fried croutons that stay crisp as they float on the surface of very pure and sweet tomato soup. Excellent olive oil has been spilled on top. This minestrone has been cleaned up in too many ways to count, but it still tastes like honest vegetable soup. The Caesar salad looks like a cross-section of an iceberg-lettuce head, which it essentially is, except that every leaf inside it has been somehow painted with a gratifyingly sharp Caesar dressing. The top is golden with toasted chips of Parmesan bread crumbs and grated Parmesan; crisscrossed over this are two anchovies, battered and deep-fried, fish-and-chips style. I have tried telling myself I won't eat the anchovies first, but I always do. The single slab of Nueske's bacon would be worth ordering even if it didn't come with a subtly upgraded spinach salad. (The walnuts are freshly toasted and the shallots are fried.) Lobster ravioli may be a little overcomplicated, but who will complain when the complications include lobster inside the ravioli, outside the ravioli and in the brandy-spiked sauce Am\u00e9ricaine? Although he spent a decade cooking tasting-menu portions, Mr. Kaimeh has a knack for making main courses that are big without being boring. Sea bass gets an herb crust and a really lively vinaigrette of chopped green and black olives. The skin on spatchcocked chicken is good and crunchy, and the sauce supr\u00eame tastes a bit like skin itself, or at least like the golden drippings on a Sunday roast. A lamb shoulder is braised until it simultaneously holds its shape and falls to pieces; it has enough flavor to make up for the somewhat blah heap of cavatelli, which might also be helped by another big spoonful of gremolata. Some stunts backfire. The cucumber jelly shards crumbled over salmon rillettes have a slight back-of-the-fridge taste, and one of the few vegetarian dishes is also one of the few things worth steering clear of: a whole honeynut squash that seems to have had brown butter pumped into it. Stephen Collucci, the pastry chef, treats American desserts affectionately but not indulgently. If a better crust can be supplied, it will be, as with the very thin and crunchy Graham cracker layer under the coconut cream pie, or the tender shortbread holding the excellent lemon meringue tart in one piece. I don't know what to make of the crunchy, underbaked apples in apple pie, but I know that I'd skip it next time in favor of whatever doughnut has captured Mr. Collucci's imagination at the moment. His department also makes the gluten-free bread, which you might want to ask for even if you eat gluten. You will get long golden ingots of rosemary cornbread, or something very like it, and they will be wonderful. Micha\u00ebl Engelmann, who is in charge of alcohol, put together a robust wine list, closing in on 400 choices. Wisely, he doesn't treat the document as the Wine Spectator's greatest hits. It's got a few much-hyped names, but the large number of bottles for under $100 is really something, and nowhere on the list will you see a point score.

The loftlike dining room still looked so much like 1985 that it could have served as a set for \" The Bonfire of the Vanities ,\" in the unlikely event that any studio wanted to remake it. The cooking may not have been in the vanguard any longer, but Mr. Portale was still wringing fresh pleasures out of ideas he had been refining for years. Meanwhile, Victoria Blamey, a chef who cut her teeth in kitchens that practiced the latest avant-garde techniques , was between jobs, taking a long eating tour while she looked for inspiration and a new place to show off her stark, contemporary cooking. Somehow, files containing the fates of these two chefs must have ended up on the desk of some cosmic prankster who decided it would be amusing if they switched places, \"Freaky Friday\" -style. Today, Ms. Blamey is the chef at Gotham and Mr. Portale no longer works there. Since November, he has been found at Portale, a few blocks northwest in Chelsea. When he steps up to the pass of his busy steel kitchen, he looks out on a bright dining room with bleached white-oak floors, marble tabletops and Italian leather chairs on elegantly slender legs of black steel. By 6:30 p.m., very few of those chairs are empty. As the bartender who stirred up one of the restaurant's several Negroni variations for me early one night said, \"When you cook at the same restaurant for 35 years, you're going to have a following.\" The proximate cause of this mixup was Mr. Portale's desire to open a second restaurant while keeping some control of the kitchen at Gotham. The other owners apparently refused , putting Ms. Blamey in charge of the hulking white elephant from the '80s. Mr. Portale then went forward on his own with the second place. Portale is Italian. The food of Italy, in particular its pasta, was one of several running themes on Mr. Portale's menus at Gotham, braided together with French cuisine, strictly seasonal East Coast ingredients and a homegrown predilection for emphatic flavors. This also roughly describes what used to be called New American cuisine , a style founded by Mr. Portale and a handful of other chefs. If you subtract the French recipes but keep some French techniques, it describes his food at Portale. This is not cooking just like Nonna's. Mr. Portale hits the accents harder, and underlines the heartier flavors with reductions and other tactics. His response to Emilia-Romagna's delicate tortellini in brodo is to stuff wads of foie gras, cream and chestnut paste, which melt like hot fudge, into tortellini the size of pinkie rings. In Italy, brodo for tortellini is meant to be a little restrained. At Portale, it is a voluptuous double chicken stock. A similar fate lies in store for another broth, the brodetto di pesce. On the Adriatic, this might be made by boiling the bones of whatever fish will end up in the soup. Mr. Portale's recipe starts with pounding lobster bodies and shrimp shells through a sieve. The broth is the color of a brick and as thick as heavy cream. It verges on a sauce for the gleaming hunk of cod at the center of the bowl, surrounded by wild shrimp and clams. Most of the other main courses are cuts of meat or fish. They're generous and skillfully cooked, but they're often upstaged by the appetizers and pastas and occasionally by the vegetables they share their plates with. The dry-aged sirloin is an impressively tender piece of beef, and it does manage to live up to the standard set by the smashed fingerling potatoes wearing golden jackets of crisp baked Parmigiano-Reggiano. The chicken, which has been brined and cooked sous vide before its skin is browned in a pan, is perhaps not as interesting as its wild mushrooms and dandelion greens. The pork roast could use more roasted Nardello peppers and a more potent orange mostarda. The good news is that we have pretty much come to the end of the bad news, and it wasn't all that bad. Now we can talk about the pasta, which shows the Portale method to its best advantage. A purist would admire the hand-rolled, ridged ricotta cavatelli, but might want a word with Mr. Portale about the sauce. Sauces, actually. There are two, a spicy arrabbiata and a cilantro pesto that sends it whirling in another direction. It's unconventional but logical, too -- essentially tomato sauce with fresh herbs. In midwinter, field-grown tomatoes are scarce at the Union Square Greenmarket, where Mr. Portale was a familiar face before some of his cooks were born. He leans instead into ingredients like mushrooms and cheese, or both at once. Fleshy wild porcini are tossed either with kinky strands of mafaldine glazed with truffle butter, or with cappellacci, little bishop's hats of pasta that break open to let the melted taleggio slip out. The appetizers are high-spirited and showy, like the salad of fennel (raw and roasted) that starts on one side of the plate with a trail of black rice and winds up on the other with shining pieces of citrus. There is also a fritto misto with a thin, light, frilly crust that a Japanese tempura specialist would admire; a hamachi crudo whose curls of raw, pink fish look like waves breaking over bits of oranges and pools of avocado-and-basil pur\u00e9e; and a kale-and-quinoa salad that sounds like penance but ends up being totally charming. The desserts at Gotham tried hard to impress. The ones Kaity Mitchell has devised for Portale are calmer, but that doesn't mean they've given up. The tiramis\u00f9, shaped into a dome and sheathed in a dark chocolate shell, does a straight-faced impression of a tartufo . The pear torta, for its part, seems to have delusions of being an upside-down cake. Whatever it is, I like it. I handed the wine choice over to my guests, who included a natural-wine fan, a winemaker with a lifelong interest in undervalued regions and a former resident of Florence who can still drink like a local. Each of them seemed to play the long and almost entirely Italian list from a different angle and to come out at the end with a bottle that precisely answered their desires. Multiply their satisfaction by the 30 or so other tables; add to that the pleasure of two rooms full of New Yorkers discovering another side to a chef they've admired for years.

Normal people who find a great dish at a restaurant come back and order it over and over, barely noticing that the rest of the menu exists. A restaurant critic who finds a great dish will come back and order all the other stuff. Most of the time this means eating some things that are average or slightly better, and a few that don't click, and then writing a review on the theme of inconsistency. If I were a normal person, I'd go back to a two-month-old West Village restaurant called Anton's every few weeks and get the spaghetti anchoiade each time. I'd twirl the noodles around my fork, noticing how plain and mild they looked. Then I'd start to eat. As I chewed and chewed -- here's a kitchen that knows what al dente means -- I'd start to taste anchovies, as if one small piece had been pounded into invisibility and stirred with the garlic and oil. The anchovy flavor would build. It would magnify. So would my appreciation of the spaghetti. But I am not normal, and I am obliged to report that after digging around at Anton's I found some, you know, inconsistency. The restaurant, the first that the chef Nick Anderer has opened since he left the velvet clutches of the Union Square Hospitality Group, is a low-key homage to old-guard New York specialties and traditions. His menu has no truck with avocado toasts, rainbow bagels and other early-21st-century ephemera. Chicken broth comes in a two-handled bouillon cup that, like many of the floral-patterned plates and bowls at Anton's, looks as if it came from Grandma's china hutch. (The broth is darker than the yellow broths of Grandma's time, though, with a roasted flavor that can handle the shot of amontillado that is tipped into it at the table.) Anton's occupies a squat Federal-era building on the corner of Hudson and West 11th Streets with mullioned windows and five-pointed metal stars that hold its brick facade in place. From just about anywhere in the low-ceilinged, plank-floored dining room you can look across Hudson Street and see the White Horse Tavern . It is the kind of West Village view that makes you hope for snow. Around the interior are framed oil paintings of bottles, cups, fruit and other still-life chestnuts. Some were commissioned from a contemporary artist from Tblisi, Georgia, named Vitali Dvali . Others were picked up secondhand by Mr. Anderer and Natalie Johnson, the general manager and his partner in operating the restaurant; these look as if they have been quietly decorating the back room of some neighborhood restaurant for decades. Nostalgia is a fraught exercise in the Trump era. Reviving historic dishes is one thing, but when an entire restaurant seems to be based on a gauzy dream of a rose-colored past, you hope for some sign that the creators understand that the past wasn't equally dreamy for everybody. To some extent, Anton's menu does this by portraying a history of New York in which appetites have been shaped by immigrants. With an eye on Jewish appetizing stores, he serves a whitefish salad that I might almost call luxurious if we weren't talking about whitefish salad. The chopped liver may have the same inspiration, although it's been made significantly meatier by the addition of chopped chicken hearts and significantly fruitier by a glug of Marsala. The liver is served with white toast and curly parsley, which has waited long enough for its comeback, thank you very much. Mr. Anderer brings together slices of dry-cured country ham from Tennessee with a sweeter and less salty \"city ham\" brined and smoked by the East Village Meat Market on Second Avenue , still owned by the Baczynsky family and one of the last standing relics of Little Ukraine. Since the demise of the great Kurowycky butcher shop , the Baczynskys have been the undisputed ham champions of the East Village. They also make a fine bacon, which Anton's incorporates into the spicy and smoky bucatini Baczynski, essentially a pasta all'amatriciana by way of Kyiv. It is very good, as you would predict if you are familiar with the amatriciana that Mr. Anderer kept on Maialino's menu for his 10 years as chef there. So are the spinach ravioli, along with most of the four or five other pastas, whose ethnic heritage needs no footnote. The angel hair francese could use a brief introduction, though. Gene's Restaurant is known to passers-by on West 11th Street for its Garden State Brickface -style molded stone facade and its faded red awning stretching from the front door to the taxicab; regulars know it for what it calls \"continental cuisine.\" Mr. Anderer is given to ordering chicken francese with a side of angel-hair pasta, a pairing that by the end of the meal results in a nest of noodles coated with garlic, lemon and chicken juices. This is what Mr. Anderer serves as angel-hair francese, approximately, although at Anton's the angel hair is freshly made and is blitzed with fried bread crumbs so it won't be mistaken for noodle soup. It is another Anton's dish that I would make an appointment to eat every few weeks if I were a normal person. As a critic, though, I pressed my luck. I ordered the thin, weak rag\u00f9 with overcooked lasagna noodles. I went for the roasted cauliflower, too, and wondered why the random scattering of chopped apricots, almonds and olives sounded so much more interesting on the menu, where it is called a relish. The onions under hanger steak Lorenz, supposedly \"melted,\" were still quite solid, and kind of strange. The roast chicken and some other main courses were flat-out dull, and the schmaltz potatoes didn't taste like much of anything, not even schmaltz. The service was hard to get a fix on, too. Maybe you will get the jovial, welcoming treatment I got one night when no wish went unfulfilled, no matter how minor. Maybe, as happened to me on a different night, your requests for another appetizer or a side dish will be met with vague nods which could mean \"later,\" or \"much later,\" or \"never.\" This worried me more than the schmaltz potatoes. You can simply stop eating a dud dish, but when some food doesn't show up at all, that's the kind of inconsistency that can keep even normal people away.

I didn't know it was going to change the sushi landscape when I wrote a four-star review of it a few months after it opened, but I knew it was original and unexpected. I also knew that no other omakase meal lobbed out so many thrilling pieces of sushi, or was quite as entertaining. Within a year, its name was a metonym for excellence in the art of raw fish. In 2017, the TV series \"Billions\" used it as the setting for a scene in which a sushi connoisseur upbraids a young moron who is sloshing each piece of nigiri in soy sauce as if he were dunking a mop into a bucket of soapy water. In 2018, a second location opened in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, to predictable wails and moans. Behind the front door, though, the original restaurant had been changing all along, leaning into its popularity, trying to share its wares with as many people as possible. As a result, Sushi Nakazawa is now more accessible than ever. At the same time, some of the qualities that made it so exciting when it was new have been tossed overboard. The great inspiration that Mr. Nakazawa and his business partner, Alessandro Borgognone, had at first was to translate an elite Tokyo-style sushi counter in ways suited to an American audience. They didn't try to make you feel as if you were in a 1,000-year-old Zen temple in Japan. [ Read more about New York's four-star restaurants .] Instead of a muted, all-natural palette of wood and stone, Sushi Nakazawa was done in a stark black-and-white, always in style in New York. The counter was white marble, the plates were glazed with a monochromatic drip pattern that recalled Jackson Pollock, and the stools at the counter were swiveling numbers in black leather that suggested a casino, which in fact is where Mr. Borgognone first spotted them. Mr. Nakazawa put customers who might have felt out of their depth in a hushed, old-school nigiri sanctuary at ease. He was already a minor celebrity from his appearance in the 2011 documentary \" Jiro Dreams of Sushi \" as the downtrodden apprentice who can't make a pan of tamago to his boss's satisfaction. Out on his own, he showed an instinct for the spotlight that the movie barely hinted at. His smile was quick. His laugh was quicker, and was heard every time he successfully startled diners by flicking live shrimp on to their plates. Some traditionalists found Sushi Nakazawa's mix of American and Japanese sensibilities off-putting. But it helped introduce Tokyo-style omakase, in which the chef decided what you would eat based on a close reading of the ocean's seasons and, to some extent, pure whim, to New Yorkers who weren't necessarily students of Japanese culture. You didn't need to know that shiny-skinned fish are called hikari-mono, or that kohada come into season in April to enjoy a meal at Sushi Nakazawa. You just sat back and let it happen. This had a downside, and before long you saw or heard stories of rich young men -- they were always young men -- acting like the cretin on \"Billions.\" (These \"bromakase\" patrons must be the reason Nakazawa's chefs and servers now warn you at the start of the meal to eat every piece in one bite, and never to top sushi with pickled ginger.) Before Nakazawa, the best omakase meals were typically served inside restaurants that did most of their trade in \u00e0 la carte sushi; after Nakazawa, one dedicated omakase parlor after another opened up, and like Nakazawa, many of them were inspired less by Japanese customs than by modern New York stagecraft. That a 21-piece dinner at the counter cost $150 seemed like a deal even in 2013. Today, dinner at the counter is still $150, and it's $30 less in the dining room, although there are some new efforts to upsell. As the cost of other omakase meals has gone up to $400 or more, holding the cost steady is an achievement. It's even more impressive because some parts of the experience have been upgraded. Originally the front door opened directly into the skinny room that holds the sushi counter. In 2015, Sushi Nakazawa took over the space next door on Commerce Street, and now you enter through a lounge where, if you are early for your reservation, you may bide your time perching on a small beige tuffet or leaning against the bar while putting away a glass of Champagne. If your destination is the dining room, you'll find that the chairs there have been replaced with cushier ones. Reservations, which used to be harder to find than West Village street parking, are plentiful now that the restaurant has added lunch service and stays open seven days a week instead of five. This is a net gain for patrons, but it comes at a cost. Mr. Nakazawa can no longer work every shift, as he once did. When he's absent, it doesn't much change the dining-room experience. But the counter is far more interesting when he is behind it. To keep up with the increased traffic, Mr. Nakazawa has made his production line more efficient. Rather than slicing each piece of fish to order, chefs do it before each seating begins. This gives you less to watch, but it speeds up the meal and doesn't seem to harm the sushi much, with one exception. One of my strongest impressions from the restaurant's early days is the flavor of the live shrimp -- the same ones Mr. Nakazawa liked to launch at unsuspecting customers before killing them, shelling them and laying them over a parcel of warm rice. Each time I ate one, I felt the room spin. The lusterless, pre-killed spot prawns I've had there recently were no substitute at all. I doubt advance slicing was the reason the scallop with yuzukosho on its underside, like a concealed weapon, seemed less vividly seasoned than it used to be. Nor did it have anything to do with what's happened to the tamago, which used to be a kind of whipped custard with a haunting savory finish and is now more like a blandly sweet yellow spongecake. Some pieces still took me on a quick thrill ride: the rich golden-eye snapper, or kinmedai, warmed with a torch and sprinkled with sea salt and lemon juice; the creamy Spanish mackerel and the firmer, slightly metallic-tasting horse mackerel; the hay-smoked wild yellowtail that tastes like tuna prosciutto. There were, however, few surprises or rarities. Spots in the lineup that could have been given to delightful character actors of the sushi stage are taken up by overexposed stars, like the four cuts of tuna and two species of salmon I was served last month. If you want to add something different to the roster, your choices are caviar, Wagyu beef and truffles. It's become a greatest-hits menu. I can't say the changes are a surprise. Sushi Nakazawa's populism was one of the things I most liked about it from the start. I'm glad that more people can get in now, and that they will be paying more or less what I paid the first time I went. The temptation to angle prices higher and higher out of reach must be a strong one, given how many places in New York seem unable to resist. Up there in the stratosphere where Sushi Nakazawa's elite new competitors hold court, there's a price to be paid, too, in empty seats, eerily hushed dining rooms and customers who don't seem to think there's anything odd about having the whole place to themselves.

You go there for Lamoon's mango salad dotted with ant eggs , and Ayada's chile- and garlic-laden raw shrimp . At first the four-month-old restaurant Thai Cook doesn't seem to fit that description, although it sits across Broadway from the cluster of restaurants that contains Lamoon. \"Manhattan Thai food,\" a Jackson Heights friend pronounced soon after the first dishes arrived. This was premature, and she took it back once we'd tried the hot dog salad. Hot dog salad is not the dish's Thai name, of course. Yum is the word for salad, which in the central part of Thailand means red onions or shallots, cilantro, fresh chiles and so on (the ones at Thai Cook have chrysanthemum greens), dressed with lime juice and fish sauce. This particular yum was yum sai krok, translated as \"sausage salad.\" The sausage in question was skinny, pink and a little salty, like a hot dog, although it is in fact made by a Vietnamese butcher in California. I think it may be the saltiness that makes Thai Cook's sausage salad so compelling, although I wouldn't discount the fresh red and green bird's-eye chiles that had been lightly smashed so that even if you avoided eating a whole one you couldn't avoid eating some of its fiery shrapnel. In any case, the hot dog salad was enough to change my friend's mind about Thai Cook. As for me, I already knew the place was anything but ordinary. It's true that the menu shares things in common with garden-variety Thai restaurants around Manhattan and, for that matter, many other American cities. There are, first of all, the yums, although not every takeout Thai menu will offer a yum made with pork liver, or with a translucent sphere of preserved egg yolk, or with another kind of sausage called moo yor that is wide and pale, more boudin blanc than frankfurter. And it's reasonably certain that Thai Cook is the only restaurant in the city where you can order \"Yum What the Heck,\" a riotous assembly of all the preceding ingredients plus squid, steamed mussels and the uncooked claws of blue crabs. The yums and some other features of Thai Cook's menu look familiar because the restaurant's chef, Boonnum Thongngoen, makes dishes from Bangkok. (She grew up outside the city, where her mother was a cook for the Royal Thai Navy and her husband was a partner in several restaurants.) Bangkok supplied most of the recipes for the first wave of Thai restaurants in the United States, and for some New Yorkers, Bangkok-style cuisine is still synonymous with Thai food. For others, it refers to dishes that have been degraded by careless cooking, grown dull through excessive familiarity, and been turned into old news by the chile-pummeled larbs of Isan, the fragrant khao soi of Chiang Mai, and other specialties that chefs from parts of Thailand far from Bangkok have brought to New York, and to Elmhurst in particular. There are reasons the food of central Thailand has spread so widely, though, and you'll remember them when you are in Ms. Thongngoen's hands. She runs a restaurant in Brooklyn that has a more expansive menu, Am Thai Bistro , but at Thai Cook she restricts herself to Bangkok street food. She almost has to, because of the limitations of her kitchen. Along with the rest of the Thai Cook operation, it has been carved out of the dining room of another restaurant. The front door on the left leads to a Chinese hot-pot place called iCook Buffet . The one on the right takes you to Thai Cook, after you walk down a long hall where toy models of tuk-tuks, the three-wheeled taxis of Bangkok, dangle at the end of rainbow-colored Slinkys. Between the restaurants are waist-high partitions and a few tied-back curtains. No wall separates the diners who are dunking enoki mushrooms into boiling chicken broth from the ones spooning out panang curry. Ms. Thongngoen and two or three other cooks are out in the open, too, lined up behind a counter that might have been a service bar in a former incarnation of the space. On the left are two tall wood mortar-and-pestle sets. This is where Ms. Thongngoen stands, shredding papayas and cucumbers with an imposing knife, then hammering them with a small bat she holds in her left hand, mixing in chiles, peanuts, bean sprouts and lime hulls, scraping down the sides with a metal spoon in her right hand as she goes. Bangkok papaya salads do not come at you with a fire hose of heat, like the northern Thai som tums you'll get at nearby restaurants. But you will notice the chiles, as you'll notice the saltiness and sharpness, the way you will when a tom yum has been smashed with care. Slide along the counter of this skeletal kitchen to the right end, and you'll find a couple of induction burners. One of Ms. Thongngoen's deputies, stationed there, prepares the desserts, like soft taro, or pumpkin cubes in warm coconut milk that has more than a trace of salt. She also makes cool emerald-green pearls of pandan tapioca and coconut-milk shaved ice, infused with enough jasmine to affect your dreams; cantaloupe balls and white sheets of fresh young coconut are dropped on top. What's missing from this mise en place? Quite a lot, including the gas burners, woks and deep-fryers that Thai Cook would need to make spring rolls or fried tofu. For appetizers, there are slippery, thickish sheets of steamed tapioca and rice flours -- \"fresh crepe\" on the menu -- folded over chopped pressed tofu with chives and splashed with a soy dressing. Or, less interestingly, something called \"steamed fish,\" which is what it sounds like, with the addition of fried pork skin. But Ms. Thongngoen uses a behind-the-scenes burner to simmer the base for her excellent noodle soups. She also cooks pork or beef into an excellent panang curry, a little thicker than usual, which may be why she calls it \"home style.\" Whole chiles are scattered over the top but, unless you eat one, they won't take over the coconut-milk sauce; the dominant aromatic is lime leaf, sliced into threads. Other curries are worthwhile, but the only one that's as compelling is the clear, sour one called kaeng chuk som in Thai; it is particularly delicious when she makes it with very fresh grouper. The clay-pot noodles, full of pepper and fresh ginger, are nicely done, too, particularly the one made with crab. When it arrives, take the shot glass that comes on the side and pour it over the noodles. It contains a rough, green sauce, like a salsa verde but with the ingredients you think of when you think of Thailand: minced garlic and shallots, fresh chiles cilantro, culantro, lime leaf, fish sauce and lime juice. Ms. Thongngoen calls it millionaire sauce. \"I named it after my husband,\" she said. Is he a millionaire? She laughed. In fact, she said, he lost \"almost a million\" in the restaurant business in Thailand, but when it was over he still had his family's recipe for the sauce.

It had opened in the summer of 2015, and while I'd enjoyed it, gone back on my own and even suggested it to friends, I also thought the food was the least interesting thing about it. In fairness, that was largely because other aspects of the place were unusually interesting. One of the owners is James Murphy of the band LCD Soundsystem , who, after getting New Yorkers to dance while articulating their discontent with the Bloomberg era, was looking for a second act. At the Four Horsemen, Mr. Murphy was responsible for the decision to pour natural wines and for the acoustic environment, which is as close to perfect as you could wish for in a small room full of people who've been drinking, some of them for hours. In retrospect, the arrival of the Four Horsemen looks like a turning point for natural wine. In the early days, people who chased down unfiltered, unsulfured and un-futzed-with bottles from Beaujolais's Gang of Four , Thierry Puzelat in the Loire Valley or La Garagista in Vermont were rare. These people were passionate in evangelizing for the winemaking practices they believed in, but their goggle-eyed radicalism could, at times, make you think of Bolsheviks with corkscrews. The Four Horsemen wrapped the movement's scruffy environmentalist and antiglobalist urges inside a sleek, cosmopolitan style that appealed to the kind of people who had dinner at 38-seat restaurants in Williamsburg. Just when apartment-design bloggers and Instagrammers had become obsessed with the warm, homey Scandinavian quality known as hygge , the Four Horsemen offered a hygge-rich environment, with burlap-coated walls and Opinel steak knives whose wood handles were the color of Christmas lights. Diners who had aged out of late-night dance parties, like the ones where Mr. Murphy used to spin records, could drink a chilled Brouilly while listening to his favorite albums played through a vintage McIntosh preamplifier he'd bought on eBay. In one sign of its ability to appeal to multiple demographics, the Four Horsemen must be the first natural-wine bar to get a review in Pitchfork . After a much-publicized opening, the compressed dining room in back and little horseshoe bar up front were packed whenever I looked through the windows on Grand Street in Williamsburg. The place didn't need my faint praise. It still doesn't, but the food I've eaten at the Four Horsemen since a friend suggested we meet there in October has been more sharply defined than anything I remember having in the early days. Over the past two decades, a style of cooking coalesced in northwestern Brooklyn, made from seasonal and local ingredients but generally built along the relaxed, country-French and Italian lines first laid out by West Coast restaurants like Chez Panisse . Now I am inclined to think that the current keeper of the flame for this style is the Four Horseman's chef, Nick Curtola. A weekend lunch just before Christmas was one of the most satisfying meals I've eaten in a long time -- thoughtfully proportioned, gracefully shaped, intelligently seasonal, quietly festive. The set menu, priced at $32, began with a delicious Waldorf salad, a phrase I've never used before. The celery was shaved to a translucent thinness and the walnuts were fresh enough to crackle, but the key to the whole thing was the mayonnaise, tart and lemony instead of sweet. There was also a potato gratin with a gold lid of baked Fontina and Taleggio on top that you could eat like a potato chip. The centerpiece of lunch was pot roast. These words will not quicken the pulse of many diners born after the Depression, but the pot roast in question was not the stringy gray substance often brought out after church on Sundays, apparently to prolong the period of atonement. It was an elegant, restorative braise of boneless short-rib bundles, thoroughly browned but pink inside, with red carrots and white Japanese turnips in an opaque broth from which every drop of fat had been skimmed. This was, of course, a pot au feu traveling incognito, and the Four Horsemen's by-the-glass list had a match for it, a cheerfully complex Beaujolais from Jean-Louis Dutraive. The menu ended with a yellow ball of eggnog ice cream with rum-spiked caramel and a flurry of sugar-cookie crumbs, a dessert straight from the pastry chef at the North Pole. (In fact, all the pastries are Mr. Curtola's.) The Four Horsemen had been open more than a year and had experimented with brunch before Mr. Curtola settled on $32 set menus for Saturday and Sunday afternoons. Many of these lunch menus have themes. Others simply make sense together. Either way, they are a welcome change from other, preposterously expensive tasting menus that just present a long sequence of dishes without a common thread. And the clarity of Mr. Curtola's cooking now is a welcome change from what I ate in the early days, food that struck me as smart and artful but a little somber. Before opening the Four Horsemen, Mr. Curtola had cycled through some leading European kitchens, including Noma's . Like a number of other local chefs at the time, he seemed to have fallen under the elegant but chilly spell of the New Nordic style. But he also spent several early years working in the smoke-scented, California-Mediterranean kitchen of Camino in Oakland, Calif., and two more later in his career at Franny's in Brooklyn. The forthright, rustic style of those restaurants appears to be reasserting itself now in the dishes on the dinner menu, which is \u00e0 la carte. Other influences are poking through the fabric, too. Peeled, cut-up satsumas are seasoned with sesame oil, cilantro stems, crushed Kampot pepper and pickled Calabrian chile, an electric combination that suggests Chinese cuisine without resembling it in the least. Leaning up against a mound of warm sushi rice, sea urchin and Spanish mackerel tartare are some toasted rectangles of nori, and if they remind you of rolling papers, you're right: you're being invited to make your own temaki . Coating the mackerel is a spicy mayo made with a home-brewed tribute to Sriracha. Vinegar slashes its way through fat and creamy Maine mussels, an unexpectedly alluring cold antipasto. Red algae, more appetizingly known as dulse , is smoked and crumbled over the tuna tonnato, a long-running favorite on the menu, made by spreading the creamy tuna sauce under a sheet of raw yellowfin. Any charcuterie shop would be proud of the supremely smooth and delicately pink chicken-liver mousse. The bread, dense and brown from house-milled whole wheat and rye flours, was good from the start. So was the wine. Justin Chearno, who is both the wine director and an owner, imported almost all of it from France and Italy at first. Like the natural-wine movement itself, though, he has enlarged his map of the world. He now extracts bottles from Slovakia, Australia, Texas and Canada, among other exotic locations. Some of the 650 or so wines on site are woolly and unkempt, others charmingly moody, and a few are models of propriety. Somewhere on the list may be one for you, but if you doubt it, you might ask about the unlisted beers. They're pretty interesting, too.

As you probably guessed, the Equinox Hotel is owned by the Equinox gym people, although they want you to think of them as more than that. These days they are also \"fitness-tourism\" people, with whom you can book a mountain-climbing trek, a surfing expedition or, if that sounds a little too close to nature, a stay inside a 1,000-foot Manhattan tower at the first of what Equinox promises will one day be a constellation of 75 hotels around the world. Rooms start at $700, which seems like a lot of money for a night in a part of town where some New Yorkers won't go during the day. But it does get you access to a spa, three kinds of pools, a herd of SoulCycles and a fitness center, or what I would call a gym. As of August, the hotel also has Electric Lemon. What made me think of that quote by Sartre, or whomever, was the music at the restaurant, which had a fast, insistent, mechanical beat. It sounded a little like the music you hear in those hotels with earth-toned lobbies and bars that call every drink on the menu a \"signature cocktail,\" but that music has more of an \"oontz oontz oontz\" thing going on, while the Electric Lemon playlist has a definite \"feel the burn\" flavor. The music isn't bone-pulverizingly loud, but it's dopey enough to become one of the factors that helps put Electric Lemon in the odd category of good restaurants where you probably won't want to eat. The restaurant is run by the restaurateur Stephen Starr's company, and as you already know if you've been to Le Coucou or Upland (to name two out of about three dozen Starr places), he knows how to find the right pieces and put them all together. That's what he does at Electric Lemon, where he seems to understand that many customers will not self-identify as fitness tourists, and that even those who do might be in the mood, after hopping off the treadmill, for a burger and a glass of pinot noir. But it's an uphill battle; the space seems to fight the restaurant that's trying to live inside it. There is a reasonably big wine list compiled by Natascha Patterer, the beverage manager. If she was daunted by the task of pairing bottles with cardio equipment, she doesn't let it show. She has corralled familiar names and styles, a lot of them from France, along with a few mystery guests. There are even a handful of bottles for less than $50. This is classic Stephen Starr anti-snobbism, and it's a refreshing change from the lists of those sommeliers who spend months trying to get a single bottle from some vigneron who doesn't have a phone and rides a donkey to work. As far as cocktails go, medical authorities have long debated whether a vigorous workout should be followed by a single, perfect martini or a whole row of them. The Equinox Hotel website seems to endorse the latter view, encouraging patrons to \"stop in throughout the day\" for \"a high-intensity series of martinis.\" The last time I had a high-intensity series of martinis it was followed by a high-intensity nap, so I passed. I can, however, tell you that Electric Lemon's bartenders shake up an eye-opening tall drink called a Bucks Bunny out of carrot juice, ginger and Armagnac, a combination that in other hands is likely to lead to explosions. If that sounds like more than you can handle, the website promises that \"an adaptogenic superfood latte\" is available. There's also a tightly coiled mezcal number called \"Kyle Knall, Y'all.\" The name does not evoke Oaxaca, but it does evoke Kyle Knall, Electric Lemon's chef. At his last restaurant, a likable, bourbon-scented spot called Maysville, Mr. Knall mined a Southern vein. In my memory, a lot of the food there was brown, or maybe it just seems that way in contrast with the psychedelic colors he slings around at Electric Lemon. Carrot diamonds jut out of a deep green cilantro-lime marinade for razor clams; sunny yellow broccoli flowers decorate a crushed-potato flatbread covered with grilled broccolini and a young sheep's milk cheese. Mr. Knall paints his plates with radishes, beets, gooseberries, cherry tomatoes and a garden's worth of leaves, and the cheerful palette can put you in a good mood before you've taken the first bite. The flavors are vibrant, too. Mr. Knall seems to have tweaked the dials so that every dish has some acidity or juiciness or herbal freshness, and nothing is especially fatty, either, which seems to be the extent of the kitchen's gestures toward healthy eating. The purple juices of roasted grapes fall over the sweet, scarlet threads of pickled aj\u00ed dulci peppers and heart-shaped mint leaves that decorate a plate of pan-roasted scallops. Small flying saucers of ravioli are stuffed with ground duck. You can even taste the crunchy, golden skin, although you can't feel it, because the filling is completely tender. It's delicious, but the flavor is very wintry and heavy until you hit one of the disks of crisp raw apple tossed with lemon verbena, and then everything lightens up. The kitchen is very good, but it isn't perfect. One night the halibut main course was moderately overcooked and my chicken was seriously dry and splintery. Kelly Nam's desserts are more modern-leaning than the rest of the food, and sometimes more than is good for them. There's a very strange one called the Chocolate Moon Rock that looks like cold lentils and carrots and tastes like an Aero bar. A less strange one that plays with lemon in different forms is called the Electric Lemon Curd. It's perky enough to embody the whole menu on a plate. But Electric Lemon's space takes any spikes of energy the food might cause and flattens them. It's an awkward, narrow area, and while the designers at the Rockwell Group have successfully made a lounge area that would be ideal for a low-key hotel in Las Vegas, the dining room seems to get away from them entirely. It's just a group of tables next to the elevator bank; if the restaurant were an office, this would be the team-building area, and nobody would use it. On one wall is a warped, wavy circus mirror that makes the room look as if it's melting. Meanwhile you're listening to a workout playlist that's probably not yours, or Sartre's, either. Maybe the answer is to wear earbuds. Conversation would be tough, but at least it would complete the gym experience.

It isn't breaking much culinary ground, and dinner there won't last much more than an hour. But its ideas about value are fresh, and it gets things right that other, similar places aren't even paying attention to. It opened eight weeks ago on Carmine Street in Greenwich Village with a considerable publicity push, and it seems to have grown more popular since. Most of the 39 seats are for walk-ins, so reservations are scarce. I've always gone without one, arriving just before the doors open at 5:30 p.m. Every time I return, the line outside seems to have started earlier and grown longer. A good part of the draw is that the menu reads as inexpensive. Temaki is the specialty, seasoned rice under a sushi-like topping, such as chopped yellowtail and scallions; each bundle is held together with a green-black square of nori. Almost all cost $5, $6 or $7, and you could probably make a light dinner out of five of them. Most people will probably eat more than that. They'll want to rummage through the appetizer menu, where some intriguing surprises are waiting, particularly the buttery miso-clam soup and the juicy squid fried in a batter shell that's as fluffy and light as a new down jacket. And they'll probably end the meal with one of the ice-cream sandwiches cleverly dressed up as temaki. But with a modest appetite or a minor act of self-discipline, you can keep your check under $30, before tax and tip. English-speaking sushi bars usually call their temaki hand rolls, although \"hand-rolled sushi\" would be a closer translation. Unlike the spicy tuna maki that are tightly rolled up with a bamboo mat and then sliced into six or eight tidy drums compressed inside a skin of nori, temaki are shaped by fingers and palms, without the aid of any tool. They tend to have a slightly loose, casual appearance; like silk scarves on the shoulders of Parisian women, their nori wrappers seem to have fallen into the right position by accident. Because of this, temaki also have a tendency to unwind themselves, which is why they are generally passed straight across the sushi counter, from the chef's hand to yours and from there, ideally, into your mouth. At most omakase sushi parlors that roll will resemble a small ice-cream cone, with nori serving as the cone. For some reason, New York's leading temaki bars use a different configuration: DomoDomo on West Houston Street, perhaps the first example of the genre, uses an open-ended cylinder that looks like the barrel of a gun. So do the Sugarfish spinoff KazuNori , in NoMad, and the Daigo Hand Roll Bar in the DeKalb Market Hall in Brooklyn. Nami Nori has a temaki construction style of its own. Each square of seaweed is not wrapped or rolled, but softly bent into a U. Warm rice runs down the hollow. On top is what in sushiland is called the neta, the main ingredient. Naturally, yellowtail-scallion is an option, along with spicy tuna, or salmon with avocado or cucumber. Like the California roll, these are well-prepared if a bit tranquil; any one will do if you want to see a familiar landmark at the table. The crab dynamite roll sounds as if it's in that category, but the mall-sushi favorite has been stripped down to its impure essentials: snow crab and tobiko mayonnaise, broiled and pinched together in nori to which grains of puffed rice have been stuck. Korea muscles into the striped-bass temaki with a fiery streak of chojang and a freshening garnish of slivered perilla leaves and daikon. China has made some exciting appearances, lending some XO sauce to the sea-scallop roll and fermented bean-chile sauce to a composition that distinctly evokes mapo tofu. It is one of several vegan temaki, including an irresistible one filled with eggplant pulp broiled with miso. A scattering of gobo chips on top serves the same function as the potato sticks on a Venezuelan hot dog. The temaki arrive slotted into individual wooden holders that keep them from unbending while in transit. Because restaurants believe that people can't consume food without explicit instructions, you are told to \"try\" to eat this square taco in two bites. Try? Take as many bites as you need. For me, it's three or four. The rice will be loose, barely held together by its own stickiness. And it will be seasoned by someone who knows the location of the spot where sweet meets tart. The nori will be so crisp that your teeth will slice through it like razor blades. This will be true whether you have a seat on a rattan stool at either of the two counters or at a whitewashed table in the front window. These are among the small pleasures a very good sushi counter reliably offers, generally at a much higher price. The three friends who dreamed up Nami Nori -- Taka Sakaeda, the executive chef; Jihan Lee, the chef de cuisine; and Lisa Limb, whose title is director of operations -- met when they were working uptown at Masa . One of the most memorable occurrences at that restaurant is the moment when a chef extends a U-shaped temaki filled with chopped toro and scallions to signal that the blizzard of sushi has come to an end. Nami Nori's founders have clearly studied the ways that Masa's attention to minor details like crisp nori and clued-in service contributes to its overall sense of luxuriousness, and they've managed to transfer some of that sense to a restaurant that's busier, less formally Japanese in design and less expensive. (To be fair, every other restaurant in New York is less expensive than Masa.) Of course, Masa also communicates luxuriousness through a nonstop flow of truffles and caviar. White Italian truffles can be added to any of the temaki at Nami Nori for an extra $20, and Kaluga caviar for another $10, as my server kept reminding me the first time I ate there. I was never given the hard sell again, which is lucky, because if it had kept up I would have started wondering how committed the restaurant really is to keeping cheapskates like me happy. Just because the prices are low doesn't guarantee you will have an inexpensive meal. This is what I think of as the Smorgasburg Effect, named after the outdoor markets where almost everything seems to be just a little too small to be lunch. I've spent more than $100 a person at Nami Nori, without the aid of truffles but with the help of alcohol and sea urchin. That was my choice, though, and one secret to the restaurant's early success is that it lets you make those choices. You can easily assemble a vegan meal, or a gluten-free one. Nami Nori is a hospitable place, built to be accommodating. They make you feel welcome, even when they're making you wait for a table.

By the time you've gone a mile, if not sooner, you'll have found every kind of taco that is consumed in New York on this stretch of road in Jackson Heights. Tacos are sold from the windows of takeout taquerias, from sit-down restaurants and bars with neon Modelo signs in the window, from the deli counters of convenience stores, from carts with vertical grills that roast spinning pink towers of marinated pork for tacos al pastor. The most talked-about tacos of the year, though, are sold from a white truck that pulls up each afternoon around dusk in front of an auto mechanic's unusually large and well-groomed parking lot at the corner of Roosevelt and 78th Street. When the truck opens for business, at around 5 p.m. on weekdays and about 1 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays, the men working inside will arrange a trash can, a plastic cooler filled with ice and bottles of Jarritos, and a handful of folding stools on the sidewalk. Signs on either side of the window, illuminated by a long strip of blue light, read \"Beefrria-Landia.\" In fact, the truck is named Birria-Landia . Birria is the filling in those tacos, the foundation of the other items on the extremely short menu, and the reason for the line that starts to take shape at the sidewalk-facing window each afternoon and that dissipates and rematerializes several times until the truck drives away, usually long after midnight. In Mexican culture, birria means different things to different people. To those not talking about food, it signifies trash, a mess, something you're better off not inspecting too closely. In the state of Jalisco, it also means a hunk of goat or other meat massaged with spices and cooked slowly -- formerly in an outdoor pit but these days, chances are, in an oven. Somebody from Zacatecas who hears birria will picture birria de res, beef stew cooked in party-size portions and served on plates or bowls. In Tijuana, and lately in more and more parts of Southern California, when you say birria, people are likely to imagine birria de res, but they will picture it on a taco . The birria at Birria-Landia is Tijuana-style birria de res, beef marinated and cooked in an adobo of hypnotic complexity. The meat, a blend of brisket, shank and top round, is rich and seems to grow softer as you eat it, like a square of chocolate. Chopped to pieces, it is folded into tacos, scattered over tostadas or sandwiched between facing pairs of quesadillas to make mulitas. If this were the whole story, Birria-Landia would still be a respectable addition to Roosevelt Avenue. But it is not the whole story, because Tijuana tradition decrees that the tortillas must first be dipped into the shimmering coppery beef fat that rises to the surface of the stew pot, then warmed on a griddle until they are pliable and electrifyingly red. This brings the birria's spices right into the tortillas, doubling the throb of dried, toasted guajillo and morita chiles, and the minor hints of cinnamon and clove that you can already taste in the beef. The fat dip must be one reason Birria-Landia stands out in New York City, where most of the tortillas could use a little help. Tijuana custom also demands pausing between bites of a birria taco for a sip of birria broth, known as consom\u00e9 and generally given away in a small paper cup. In Los Angeles, where birria de res tacos have recently become an obsession, many people take this an extra step and dunk their tacos into the consom\u00e9. This custom has taken off on social media, which has in turn fueled the rise of birria vendors such as Teddy's Red Tacos, which has one restaurant, two trucks and more than 100,000 Instagram followers . There is no error in dunking your tacos de birria or in keeping them dry, either. What would be a shame would be to miss out entirely on Birria-Landia's consom\u00e9, which is so flavorful and meat-laden it almost overshadows everything else. Whether through long simmering or quick reduction, the broth is about as thick as melted butter. True, they don't give it away. Some traditions simply don't travel to New York. But at $4 for a small cup and $6 for a large one, the consom\u00e9 is a worthwhile expense, particularly because it always seems to include a ladleful or two of meat. Forced to choose just one of the three other things on the menu, I would probably go with the mulitas, mostly because in New York a good mulita is hard to find. A mulita's two tortillas are not as crunchy as the one on a tostada, but they do have the benefit of fixing the beef in place with melted mozzarella. Inside the truck, griddling the tortillas, loading them with birria, splashing it with the sharp and essential tomato-tomatillo salsa, and making change for 10- and 20-dollar bills are Jos\u00e9 Moreno and his partner, his brother Jes\u00fas. They grew up in the Pueblan town of Coatzingo. Puebla is not known for birria. It is, however, known for producing a large number of New York's restaurant cooks, including the Moreno brothers. Jes\u00fas cooked American food -- burgers and so on. Jos\u00e9 specialized in Italian cuisine, working for the greater part of 20 years in restaurants including Lupa , Parm and Del Posto . Two years ago, Jos\u00e9 was sent to California to help open Eataly in Los Angeles , which is where he fell for the beefy charms of Tijuana-style birria de res. His favorite spot was Teddy's. He also drove to Tijuana several times to study at the source. When his turn came to cook meals for the staff at Eataly, he worked on his birria recipe. If it wasn't excellent before the Birria-Landia truck began rolling in June, it is now. The business is already changing in response to its popularity. People kept telling the Morenos that they needed to charge more, and last week they listened. Tacos and tostadas are now $2.50 each instead of $2, and a mulita, formerly $3, now costs $3.50. A second truck is also under discussion, too. A candidate for running it has already emerged. His name is Javier, and he is the third Moreno brother.

Luckily, it's easy to find advice on the internet. Well, not advice as much as rules. So many rules. For instance, Epicurious has \" The 7 Golden Rules of Friendsgiving .\" (Rule No. 3 is \"Sit on the floor.\") Chowhound sets forth \" 9 Rules for Planning a Perfect Friendsgiving ,\" including \"Use nature for your tablescape,\" which apparently you can do by spray-painting \"some of those fall leaves from outside.\" The Kitchn has \" The 10 Essential Rules for Every Friendsgiving Host .\" Rule No. 4, \"embrace technology,\" tells you to coordinate who is bringing which dish by using Google Docs or an online tool called Perfect Potluck . There are 10 Friendsgiving rules in Washingtonian magazine, too. The third, \"Buy bulk booze,\" also happened to be my own impulse when I saw a Friendsgiving article on Thrillist that lays down not rules, but commandments -- 19 of them, including \"Have (Extra) Toilet Paper.\" The good news about some recent Friendsgiving advice from the website Bustle: No rules! The bad news: there are \" 15 Books to Read Before You Host Friendsgiving .\" Among the titles on the syllabus are \" The Gift of Gathering: Beautiful Tablescapes to Welcome and Celebrate Your Friends and Family \" and \"Beautiful Boards: 50 Amazing Snack Boards for Any Occasion.\" By the time you have seen all 50 beautiful snack boards, if not long, long before then, you may ask yourself: How did Friendsgiving, originally a low-key, low-stress get-together with nonrelatives whose company you enjoy, become a bigger pain in the wishbone than Thanksgiving? This is not just a case of the internet making everything worse, although that is also true. Friendsgiving really is getting more complicated in the three-dimensional world. Because the event is gaining popularity and does not have a set date, Friendsgiving invitations can stack up; very popular people may attend two in one week or even one night. Many Friendsgivings are held on the weekends before or after the fourth Thursday in November, so some brave souls go home for the traditional holiday and travel somewhere else for Friendsgiving. Just as there are destination weddings, there are destination Friendsgivings. Guests will pay round-trip airfare and, if they don't stay with the host, the price of a hotel room or short-term rental. For each of the past six years, Barbara Bisoni, the president of a New York City company that sells engagement rings and other jewelry, has put together a Friendsgiving dinner in Paris. The first time, she was going through a breakup, and a friend living in Paris had offered her a place to stay. As a kind of hostess gift, Ms. Bisoni offered to cook an American Thanksgiving dinner. On the day of the meal, about 10 people showed up for turkey and sides prepared in what she calls \"the teeny, tiniest Parisian kitchen you could possibly imagine.\" When she did it again the next year, the guest list and the menu grew. They've kept growing. A friend from New York, \"an amazing cook,\" now comes with her to help make the food, and others come to help eat it. The local butcher, who has been asked to supply bigger and bigger turkeys, recognizes Ms. Bisoni. And before it closed, she was an annual customer at a store in the Marais, called Thanksgiving, that specialized in American ingredients. What the shop didn't carry, she packed in her luggage: cornbread mix, pecans, a turkey baster. While it's hard to feel sorry for the friends whom Ms. Bisoni invites for dinner in Paris, one can muster a little sympathy for James Norton's Friendsgiving guests, particularly because he lives in Minneapolis and has chosen to celebrate the day in February. Mr. Norton and his wife held their first \"Febgiving\" in 2008. \"I get a bit of seasonal blues every year,\" said Mr. Norton, an editor for The Growler magazine. \"So we thought, \u2018Let's take the best holiday and copy-paste it into the worst part of the year, and see if we can get friends to join us for a big feast.' \" For guests flying from out of town for Mr. Norton's smoked turkey and dulce de leche pumpkin pie, \"travel is a snap\" compared with November, he said. \"There are still a lot of logistics, planning and stress involved, but if you put it into February, it's an asset not a liability.\" For those who observe Friendsgiving in November, though, the stress remains. And, because people in their 20s and 30s have been the quickest to embrace the idea, Friendsgiving meals are often hosted by people who are relatively new to entertaining. This helps explain the rise of the rules and commandments, as well as Emily Stephenson's decision to write \" The Friendsgiving Handbook ,\" which Chronicle Books published in August. Ms. Stephenson is the gentlest of rule-givers. Apologetically, she advises a spreadsheet to avoid redundancy if the meal will be a potluck. The year she failed to do this, the feast consisted of 12 salads and five pies. Although Friendsgiving is \"more casual\" than Thanksgiving, she said, \"you still need advice to pull off a dinner for eight-to-however-many people you're having over. And a lot of Thanksgiving advice just doesn't apply.\" Articles about how to tell Aunt Marcia that nobody likes her green-bean casserole, for instance, are of limited relevance to the Friendsgiving host, given that avoiding Aunt Marcia is one of the points of the meal. Not having to weather familial microclimates, in fact, seems to free up vast reserves of energy that enable Friendsgiving hosts to prepare meals that would otherwise be exhausting. Fans of the custom say they throw themselves into celebrations because it's a chance for them and their chosen social group to invest meaning in a day with no prior significance. \"You're not taking over from your mom,\" Ms. Stephenson said. \"You are kicking off this new tradition for your friends.\" Bri Lurie, an epidemiologist who lives in Brooklyn, has survived her share of Friendsgivings. With a group, she rented a house on Long Island one November, and calls the expense \"the happiest money I spent all year.\" She has also passed several Friendsgivings at the home of a friend whose cooking tends toward the goofily surreal, like hot queso flowing in a punch fountain, or lumpia filled with turkey, gravy, stuffing and cranberry sauce. Ms. Lurie thinks that what might strike some people as Friendsgiving excess is just a reflection of cooking culture. \"We're all watching shows on Netflix filmed in high-definition video, and it's so beautiful,\" she said. \"So people are plating their food, and they're very cognizant of the source of their food.\" \"I'm sure it'll come around,\" she said. \"In five years, Friendsgiving will be only things out of a can.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

Mr. Portale was not the first chef at Gotham, but he took the job so soon after the restaurant opened in 1984, and kept doing it for so long, that when he finally left in May his name and its name were almost inseparable. It was Mr. Portale who lured Tom Valenti, Bill Telepan, Tom Colicchio and Wylie Dufresne to work at Gotham early in their careers. Gotham's first three-star review in The New York Times , from Bryan Miller in 1985? Mr. Portale was in charge. Its most recent review, three stars from Sam Sifton in 2011? Mr. Portale was in charge. The three other Times reviews in between? Always Mr. Portale. Always three stars, too. Anyone following a long-running success like that has two choices. She can try not to startle the horses by speaking softly and moving slowly. Or she can get it over with and shoot the horses. Victoria Blamey , who was hired to take over for Mr. Portale at Gotham Bar and Grill, shot the horses. In an interview published in September, speaking of the architectural plating style Mr. Portale was once known for, she said, \"no one wants to see that right now.\" The next day she let loose with a menu that buried every one of her predecessor's dishes (here's your hat, tuna tartare; what's your hurry, seafood salad?) under a heap of her own ideas. No question, Gotham Bar and Grill is in the Blamey era now. Loyal customers are going to have to get out or strap in. Ms. Blamey's new menu is not self-consciously avant-garde, the way Atera's tasting menus were when she was the sous-chef there, but it may be more original. It's certainly not like anything else around town. Her plating style is stark -- not aggressive, but a little severe and occasionally challenging. The flavors aren't like that, though. They're deep and enveloping; they tend to open and change in your mouth, and linger after you swallow, like wine. Take her ceviche. Normally, you know where you stand with a ceviche. You know how the marinade will change the seafood, how the seafood's juices will knock the edge off the citrus and how the chile fits in. The sea scallop ceviche at Gotham is a trickier character. The splayed-open scallops sit in a pale yellow juice that tastes of corn, first sweetly, like a fruit, and then not so sweetly. Then other things enter the picture, smoke and citrus and chiles. The scallops taste like scallops, so of course they're wonderful, but they've also been rolled in chile salt and each one has a pink dot of aged umeboshi paste in the center. There is more to the story, including some charred baby corn whose kernels are the size of poppy seeds, but it should be clear already that you will need to hold on tight if you are going to follow every twist and turn at Gotham. As anyone knows who has eaten the drippily sophisticated burger incorporating bone marrow and American cheese that she invented when she was the chef at Chumley's, Ms. Blamey has a way of using fat to underline her points. Most of the time, this comes off as smart rather than obvious. (With the burger, now available at Gotham's long, much-loved, pink-granite bar, it's both.) Try the Baywater Sweet oysters farmed in the Hood Canal in Washington State; they're creamy enough to bring on a swoon, but instead of the mignonette that might keep the fat in check, Ms. Blamey spoons a cauliflower and white chocolate pur\u00e9e into each silvery shell. Half vegetable and half candy, it even upstages the black pearls of caviar on top. Triangles of foie gras torchon under a translucent layer of black-truffle jelly are really quite fluffy and rich, even by the standards of foie gras torchons. So of course Ms. Blamey serves it with butter -- kombu butter, which goes so well with the warm kombu brioche. If the city's new ban on foie gras ever goes into effect, I already know one place where I'll stop to say goodbye. While the torchon will not win Ms. Blamey many fans among the vegans, the cabbage should. The warm, satiny leaves -- she uses the caraflex variety, tender and virtually ribless -- are dressed with sugary brown juice pressed from charred onions; golden pearls of fregola give the dish the heft of a main course. Although Ms. Blamey is quite clearly a cheerful carnivore, she turns vegetables into compelling events. She amplifies the smokiness of creamy charred Japanese eggplant with a lapsang souchong broth; her dal is made with coconut milk, mustard seeds, fried curry leaves and the care a good Indian cook would put into it. The legumes, though, are the dense, creamy red peas long cultivated by Gullah rice farmers on the Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia. The animals she does cook, and there are quite a few, are ones she believes were sustainably raised or caught from healthy populations. Tilefish, not popular enough yet to be overfished, is on the menu, under a thick coral pelt of caramelized sea urchin from Maine. Oregon Dungeness crab stewed with tomatoes and aj\u00ed dulce peppers, a twist on an abalone dish Ms. Blamey ate in Chile as a girl, is stuffed between layers of puff pastry to make a cross between an empanada and pithivier. Rabbit leg is braised in olive oil and an allium stock flavored with charred fig leaves and seasoned with fish sauce. I learned that later on, in a phone call with Ms. Blamey; at the time, I just knew that I'd rarely had rabbit as rich or as sneakily packed with flavor. The rabbit is served under black lentils. The lentils are augmented with chicken fat. The owners and Ms. Blamey have said they want to entice younger diners to give Gotham a try. Josh Lit, the wine director, does his part by adding five pages of fashionably noninterventionist, sulfur-phobic winemakers like Christian Tschida and Frank Cornelissen to a list that is already as long as a novella . There's a whole page for Joe Swick , a young Oregonian who calls his chardonnay \"Wyd? U up?\" and his field blend \"Only Zuul,\" a \"Ghostbusters\" reference that the list handily decodes with the hashtag #thereisnodana. The interior may be a sticking point in the youth campaign; it hasn't kept up with the pace of change in the kitchen. The walls were freshly painted and the lighting fine-tuned this summer before the new menu was unwrapped, but Gotham is still a time capsule of postmodernist restaurant design motifs from the 1980s, when vast loftlike spaces were automatically exciting. There is still some drama left in the theatrical, multilevel dining room; the parachute chandeliers that show off how far away the ceilings are; and the plants from the garden that press their leaves up against the back door as if they wanted to come inside. But it's not the kind of drama that translates well to Instagram, and so far the new crowd looks a lot like the old crowd. At first you might wonder why a pastry chef with more modern leanings hasn't been recruited. Then you eat Ron Paprocki 's desserts and you stop wondering. Who would wish for vegetable ice creams, shattered cakes and fermented fruit when we could be eating sticks of pain perdu under a crunchy caramel shell, or near-levitating souffl\u00e9s made from the red flesh of Ruby Prince peaches? Mr. Paprocki also makes what must be the greatest tarte Tatin in the city, a ring of apples in a state of collapse on a Frisbee of puff pastry stained with what always seems to be the right amount of burned sugar.

He isn't putting them together in the usual ways, either. The starting point of his menu is Nikkei cuisine, the hybrid style forged by Japanese cooks living in Peru, but Mr. Ramirez hasn't let himself get tied down by it. Certain Llama San dishes have clear Nikkei roots, but have sprouted into something new. Others seem to come from an imaginary Peruvian-Japanese world that Mr. Ramirez dreamed up. There can't be many cevicherias in Lima where the tart and spicy marinade for raw scallops and soft hunks of avocado is made from cherimoya pur\u00e9e. Ripe cherimoya, also known as custard apple, has the miraculous ability to taste like bananas, pears, pineapples and about six other, equally delicious fruits at the same time. And you could probably walk the entire Peruvian coastline without finding a hamachi tiradito whose leche de tigre -- the sauce that is essential in tiraditos as well as ceviches -- is a rich, spicy coconut milk soured with a squeeze of lime. If you added lemongrass and lime leaf at this point you'd have the beginnings of a number of Thai soups, but that's not where this is going. Llama San scatters a few puffs of matcha foam over the plate, between curls of fresh coconut. If you didn't already know that green tea, chiles, coconut and raw fish are quietly thrilling together, you do now. Up and down the menu are flying leaps like this, followed by graceful landings. Mr. Ramirez's confidence has grown since he opened his first restaurant, Llama Inn , in Brooklyn about four years ago. When news got out that he was planning to follow that initial Peruvian outpost with a sandwich shop called Llamita , I worried that his talents might disappear into the fast-casual sinkhole that seems to claim so many chefs these days. (As a budding empire builder, Mr. Ramirez, a native of New Jersey raised by parents from Lima, has at least one thing going for him, an irresistible logo of a llama in a bow tie.) That fear was premature; last summer, when Llamita opened, it turned out to be a more interesting proposition than it had sounded, with homestyle Peruvian cooking at dinner and a wine list that hews to the organic, biodynamic and natural creed. But neither place goes as far as Llama San, which slipped into its unmarked brick facade in September, taking its place between the tattoo studios and dildo boutiques that line the west side of Avenue of the Americas between Waverly Place and Bleecker Street. Sit at the compact bar in the front window, and the drinks menu you're handed tells you right away that this is not going to be a typical postcard from Peru. The Nikkei Martini includes pickled kombu and a \"nori pisco rinse\"; a drink called Flaming Creature, distantly related to an old-fashioned, is made with cacao and miso, and infused with smoke from palo santo wood; and the closest thing to a pisco sour contains matcha, green tea and coconut and is called Quiz\u00e1s, Quiz\u00e1s, Quiz\u00e1s, after the old Cuban song covered by Bing Crosby , among others. While Llama Inn draws all its wines from Spanish-speaking parts of Europe and South America, Llama San claims a larger piece of the globe by specializing in coastal regions: Provence, Catalonia, Corsica, Sicily, New Zealand and so on. And, as at Llamita, low-intervention winemakers are favored. The result is an idiosyncratic read, with potential discoveries on every page. Beyond the bar are two dining rooms. The front is more cramped than the rear, which spreads out a bit before ending in an open kitchen, but in either room the seats and the tables are so close together that you, or at least I, have to inhale to sit down. The d\u00e9cor is spare in a way that you might take for Japanese, particularly after a Flaming Creature or two. You might take the nigiri for Japanese, too, if they weren't topped with tender, plummy duck breast and a sweet mush of cooked banana with fresh cilantro. They come four to an order, but I could have eaten a dozen, leaving behind only the nasturtium leaves that cover them for no reason I could see. Peru has a chile for every occasion, it seems, and Mr. Ramirez knows which ones to use and when. The swirling heat of rocoto chiles, underscored by a sprinkle of togarashi, lights up a bowl of rice noodles outfitted with mushrooms and seaweed. Aj\u00ed panca, purplish and mild, brings some complexity to Llama San's tribute to an izakaya standard, grilled salt-cured mackerel. The same chile turns up in the cream sauce on lobster meat that is paired with an exceptionally fine grilled beef heart rubbed with a classic Peruvian skewer spice mix that includes oregano, cumin and dried aj\u00ed panca. Bright yellow and sunny, the aj\u00ed amarillo is crucial to the flavor of the walnut-thickened yellow sauce that douses a sushi roll filled with a rich stew of chicken thighs. This, in case you haven't recognized it, is how Mr. Ramirez interprets aj\u00ed de gallina, transforming it into a new form while keeping the qualities that make it a comfort-food staple in Peru. Aj\u00ed amarillo is also the secret of another creamy yellow sauce, this one a shrimp stock that turns what could be an invitation to boredom -- soft tofu stuffed with minced shrimp and covered with smashed potatoes -- into a really good time. The savory menu, printed on sheets of Japanese paper as soft as an old dollar bill, hops from success to success. Desserts are less memorable. I recall encountering three of them, and each one seemed to be some kind of semifreddo. I'm not sure Mr. Ramirez knows yet how good the food at Llama San is. If he did, would servers still describe it as \"a family-style, \u00e0 la carte restaurant?\" In any case, the assurance displayed in the kitchen gets a little shaky in the dining room. Every dish is deposited in the middle of the table, often one at a time, so four people may find themselves taking tiny forkfuls from a single plate as they try not to eat the whole thing at once. Repeat this routine for each of the two-to-three-dishes-a-person that servers suggest, and you might be there for hours. There must be a better way, but I am not holding my breath.

I may have to reconsider that, though, in light of how much good it seems to have done a sushi bar called Uogashi . When Uogashi's owners in Japan -- a seafood distributor, according to several employees, although the management has declined to confirm it -- decided the time had come to expand to the United States, they chose a location in the East Village. The space was deep, and the spare blond-wood interior featured a sushi bar along the right wall that had room for at least two dozen seats, starting near the entrance and running nearly all the way to the back of the restaurant. The populism suggested by all those counter seats was reflected in the menu. There were nigiri platters for under $50 and an omakase for less than $100, prices you might see in a neighborhood sushi dispensary with no special pedigree. Apart from the tuna, all the seafood was imported from Japan and seemed unusually fine for the price, although the slices were often two or three sizes too large for the rice, and the individual pieces were on the bland side. My meal at the counter wasn't quite exciting enough to lure me back for a full review, so I shuffled Uogashi off into a roundup of good values on the sushi front that I was writing. After that, Uogashi slipped my mind until last fall, when I woke up to the news that its building had nearly been destroyed by an overnight fire . At first there was hope that fish and rice would be reunited there one day, but eventually word got around that Uogashi had closed for good. Except that it didn't, exactly. With much less drama than attended its demise in the East Village, Uogashi reopened in January on a block of West 51st Street characterized by vintage tenements, low-rise hotels and restaurants catering to the theater-district crowd. The new edition does not appear, at first glance, to be an upgrade. The restroom, a short walk from the dining room in the lobby of an adjoining hotel , has a neglected, unloved feeling. The dining room is boxy, and the tables, which in the first location were partly secluded with rice-paper chandeliers behind hanging curtains, seem to have been wedged in wherever they would fit. The sushi counter has shrunk to nine seats, but still has to accommodate three busy chefs, just as the older, longer one did. The walls are decorated with oversize black-and-white illustrations of fish. The whole place looks as if it could be in the food court of an ambitious supermarket. It's much better than that. Akamutsu, known in English as rosy sea bass, is on the sushi menu now. If you get it, and why wouldn't you, it will be seasoned with a squeeze of sudachi juice and a few flakes of kombu salt, a firm contrast to the lush, pink-tinted flesh, whose oils have been made soft and creamy by a hot swipe with a chef's torch. Kohada has been available lately, too -- gizzard shad, a silver-skinned fish so small that it can take two or three to make one piece of nigiri. At Uogashi it has been briefly salted and vinegared, and has an effect that is something like eating a bite of pickled herring and chasing it with a gulp of very dry, very cold Champagne. Engawa is a fluke's dense and chewy outer perimeter, the muscular edge that sends the rest of the fish fluttering along the ocean floor. A little of that would be good to try, too. Short strips so firm they almost crunch will be piled over rice, seasoned with a dab of the spicy daikon paste called momiji oroshi, and finished with a tiny shard or two of sea urchin. The sushi chefs have had several varieties of urchin lately; you might want try the smaller, sienna-colored lobes of bafun uni from Hokkaido to compare them with the less-intense and creamier Murasaki uni from Maine. The prices are almost as forgiving as they were downtown. Most of the nigiri are either $6 or $8; more prized items such as chu-toro and shiro ebi, the tiny white shrimp that have to be pressed together by the dozen to make a single piece, are $10 each, and a small handful of rare treats like Japanese abalone and sea urchin are $12. A platter of eight pieces of nigiri and a maki roll, chef's choice, is $45, and comes with miso soup and a hot bowl of chawan mushi, savory and smooth. One night when I was sitting at the counter, I watched as two chefs assembled several of those $45 platters while simultaneously handing pieces of sushi across the counter to omakase customers paying $95 and up. The fish, the seasoning, the rice and the hands that put them all together were the same. Their names were Fumitaka Takeshita and Masao Matsumoto, and between them they have been putting fish on top of rice for six decades. For one of those decades, they worked side by side at one of the Sushiden locations in Midtown. Both Sushidens closed last winter, leaving those discerning customers who had appreciated their quiet, serious handiwork bereft. I doubt that more than a few of them have had the means to follow Nozomu Abe, the restaurant's most famous chef, uptown to Sushi Noz , where the fish is stored in insulated cabinets cooled by ice blocks, and a tasting menu costs $175 or $325. Noz is one of many cosseting, forbiddingly priced sushi parlors that have opened in the wake of Sushi Nakazawa , from Sushi Ginza Onodera to Sushi Amane to Noda to Uchu by Ichimura ; each new one makes Nakazawa's $150 omakase look more and more like the recession special at Gray's Papaya . New York may be losing Tad's Steaks and single-screen movie theaters, but at least it has lots of places where you can spend more than $300 on sushi. The low end is even more crowded, with unprepossessing neighborhood places sending out California rolls by the carton. What is harder to find, among sushi bars and many other types of restaurants, is the middle ground. That, though, is where you'll find Uogashi. All the omakases, including the entry-level $95 meal, start with an appetizer; lately it has been tsubugai, a whole whelk broiled and brushed with soy before being tucked back into its shell. The more you pay, the more varied and luxurious the courses become, but even the $95 omakase pauses halfway through for a cocktail glass nearly filled with chilled salmon roe and sea urchin. After a spoonful or two, it can be hard to remember where you are or who you came with. The peripatetic writer A.J. Liebling, who contributed hundreds of articles to The New Yorker, liked to say that he could write better than anyone faster and faster than anyone better. Uogashi, in its new theater district home, may be the equivalent in sushi terms: better than anyone cheaper and cheaper than anyone better.

There is the insistent smell of broiled dry-aged steak that hits me the minute I open the door and sometimes sooner, while I'm still outside on the South Williamsburg sidewalk, producing a raised pulse, a quickening of the senses and a restlessness familiar to anyone who has seen a tiger that has just heard the approach of the lunch bucket. There is the hiss of butter and melted tallow as they slide down the hot platter, past the sliced porterhouse or rib steak and their charred bones, to make a pool at one end. The server will spoon some of this sizzling fat over the meat he has just plated, generally with some line like \"Here are your vitamins.\" There is the thunk of a bowl filled with schlag landing on a bare wood table when dessert is served, and soon after, the softer tap-tap-tap of waxy chocolate coins in gold foil dropped one at a time on top of the check. And after I've paid, there is the unshakable sense that I've been scammed. The last sensation was not part of the Peter Luger experience when I started eating there, in the 1990s. I was acutely aware of the cost back then because I would settle the tab by counting out $20 bills; cash was the only way to pay unless you had a Peter Luger credit card. At the end of the night my wallet would be empty. Because a Peter Luger steak made me feel alive in a way that few other things did, I considered this a fair trade, although I could afford it only once a year or so. I don't remember when the doubts began, but they grew over time. Diners who walk in the door eager to hand over literal piles of money aren't greeted; they're processed. A host with a clipboard looks for the name, or writes it down and quotes a waiting time. There is almost always a wait, with or without a reservation, and there is almost always a long line of supplicants against the wall. A kind word or reassuring smile from somebody on staff would help the time pass. The smile never comes. The Department of Motor Vehicles is a block party compared with the line at Peter Luger. [ Sign up for Sam Sifton's Cooking newsletter for recipes, food writing and culinary inspiration. ] The management seems to go out of its way to make things inconvenient. Customers at the bar have to order drinks from the bartender and food from an overworked server on the other side of the bar, and then pay two separate checks and leave two separate tips. And they can't order lunch after 2:30 p.m., even though the bar and the kitchen remain open. Since its last, two-star review in the Times , written by Frank Bruni in 2007, the restaurant has started taking online reservations. It accepts debit cards, too, which is nice. But the credit card you use to buy a cortado at the cafe or a bag of chips at the bodega will still not buy you a meal at Peter Luger. The servers, who once were charmingly brusque, now give the strong impression that these endless demands for food and drink are all that's standing between them and a hard-earned nap. Signals that a customer has a question or request don't get picked up as quickly; the canned jokes about spinach and schlag don't flow as freely. Some things are the same as ever. The shrimp cocktail has always tasted like cold latex dipped in ketchup and horseradish. The steak sauce has always tasted like the same ketchup and horseradish fortified by corn syrup. Although the fries are reasonably crisp, their insides are mealy and bland in a way that fresh-cut potatoes almost certainly would not be. The sole -- yes, I'm the person who ordered the sole at Peter Luger -- was strangely similar: The bread crumbs on top were gold and crunchy, but the fish underneath was dry and almost powdery. Was the Caesar salad always so drippy, the croutons always straight out of a bag, the grated cheese always so white and rubbery? I know there was a time the German fried potatoes were brown and crunchy, because I eagerly ate them each time I went. Now they are mushy, dingy, gray and sometimes cold. I look forward to them the way I look forward to finding a new, irregularly shaped mole. [ Readers respond to the Pete Wells review of Peter Luger .] Lunch one afternoon vividly demonstrated the kitchen's inconsistency: I ordered a burger, medium-rare, at the bar. So had the two people sitting to my right, it turned out. One of them got what we'd all asked for, a midnight-dark crust giving way to an evenly rosy interior so full of juices it looked like it was ready to cry. The other one got a patty that was almost completely brown inside. I got a weird hybrid, a burger whose interior shaded from nearly perfect on one side to gray and hard on the other. The same issue afflicted a medium-rare porterhouse I was served one night: The fillet was ideal but the other side of the T-bone, the strip, ranged from medium-rare to medium-well. I could live with this; big cuts of meat don't always cook evenly. What gnaws at me every time I eat a Luger porterhouse is the realization that it's just another steak, and far from the best New York has to offer. [ Melissa Clark shows you how to cook a steak at home . ] Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, can put a formidable crust on both sides of the cut; Luger caramelizes the top side only, while the underside is barely past raw, as if it had done all its cooking on the hot platter. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, buy beef that is tender, richly marbled and deeply flavorful; at Luger, you get the first two but not the third. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, age that beef to make flavor grow and intensify and double back on itself; dry-aging at Luger still results in a tender steak, but it rarely achieves a hypnotic or compelling or even very interesting one. But those other restaurants are not Peter Luger, as Friedrich Nietzsche might have said. \"When in this essay I declare war upon Wagner,\" Nietzsche wrote in \" The Case of Wagner ,\" \"the last thing I want to do is start a celebration for any other musicians. Other musicians don't count compared to Wagner.\" I could say the same thing about other steakhouses -- compared to Peter Luger, they don't count. Luger is not the city's oldest, but it's the one in which age, tradition, superb beef, blistering heat, an instinctive avoidance of anything fancy and an immensely attractive self-assurance came together to produce something that felt less like a restaurant than an affirmation of life, or at least life as it is lived in New York City. This sounds ridiculously grand. Years ago I thought it was true, though, and so did other people. The restaurant will always have its loyalists. They will laugh away the prices, the $16.95 sliced tomatoes that taste like 1979, the $229.80 porterhouse for four. They will say that nobody goes to Luger for the sole, nobody goes to Luger for the wine, nobody goes to Luger for the salad, nobody goes to Luger for the service. The list goes on, and gets harder to swallow, until you start to wonder who really needs to go to Peter Luger, and start to think the answer is nobody.

It isn't hiding anything; its glass facade on Orchard Street wants to strike up a conversation so badly that it almost follows you home. The windows are stenciled with cartoon characters and with text-message bubbles that call out in English (\"Hello! New York\"), Spanish (\"que rico!\"), French (\"bon app\u00e9tit\") and Tagalog (\"masarap,\" for delicious). The language lessons continue on the front door, which gives translations for \"tuloy po kayo\" (welcome) and the restaurant's name (gossip), pronounced chiss-miss. In case you miss all of this, a sandwich board straddles the sidewalk, advertising discounted beer, wine and wings at the bar during happy hour (\"5:thirsty\"). If you accept the facade's invitation to benaquitodits (come here here, a repetitive bit of Tagalog slang), the conversation will continue inside. Tsismis, which opened in June, is a chatty restaurant. At times, when one of the owners pulls up alongside your table and expounds on how the chef's interpretation of the dish you're trying to eat differs from what you might find in the Philippines, you may find yourself eyeing the exit. If you've found your way to the menu's strengths, though, odds are you won't want to go anywhere. Kinilaw, a Filipino ceviche in a piercingly sour calamansi and cane vinegar marinade with a jab of bird's-eye chile, is worth sticking around for, especially on those nights when it's made with bay scallops instead of fish. After that, you might look into the fried pork-and-carrot won tons called pinsec frito (or, as the menu has them, pinsit frito). They are typically folded into triangles, but the ones at Tsismis are twisted into little cones that look like Hershey's kisses, though slightly bigger and golden-brown. Once they stop steaming, you can hold them by the cowlick of fried wrapper at the top and swish them around in the sweet chile sauce. Won tons with the same filling flop around in the soup called pancit molo, although these are boiled. There is almost as much ground pork inside them as outside in the broth, which is thick with garlic and chopped scallions. Even if it's well after 5:thirsty and you're not sitting at the bar, Jappy's wings are worth considering. Jappy is the chef, Jappy Afzelius, and he fries those wings with thinly sliced garlic and sends them out to the dining room with a salsa of raw mangoes, charred onions and chiles. The heat of the salsa will not cause your shirt to burst into flames, but it is hot enough to make your memory of Jappy's wings a lasting one. Mr. Afzelius is a native of the Philippines and a graduate of a cooking academy in Manila, which shipped him off to Paris to intern in one of Alain Ducasse's bistros. The Ducasse masterminds then sent him to work at Benoit in New York, after which he turned up as the sous-chef at a Filipino restaurant in Brooklyn that was best known for its $100 doughnut -- ube-filled, Cristal-frosted and gold-leafed. Happily, nothing at Tsismis approaches that level of look-at-me desperation. Mr. Afzelius's cooking is loose, unfussy and liberated. He tosses tradition under the bus when it suits him. The result is Filipino-American drinking food that tends to be charmingly offhand. From time to time, it can lean toward sloppiness. One night the fried milkfish in pritong isda was so overdone that even topping it with calamansi juice, fish sauce and a crisp, juicy spoonful of marinated chayote on top didn't revive it. A version of adobong manok, which Mr. Afzelius makes as a roasted chicken plus a soy-turmeric sauce rather than an all-in-one stew, would have been more successful if the smoked eggplant hadn't been so undercooked it squeaked. But the grilled eggplant on top of the kare-kare was as soft as warm marrow, and the other vegetables -- crisp green beans, bok choy, enoki mushrooms -- made a refreshing counterpoint to the stewed oxtails in thick peanut sauce. Already pungent with shrimp paste, the kare-kare comes with extra on the side that you can add to your heart's content. As they do at Bad Saint in Washington, probably the country's most talked-about Filipino restaurant, Tsismis makes its laing by simmering local kale, rather than the more traditional taro leaves, in coconut milk. And if this version doesn't have the perspective-altering funk of Bad Saint's, it still draws plenty of depth from the shrimp paste and smoked fish in the milk and the big handful of dried baby shrimp dropped on top. By this point, you will probably want to have a glass in your hand. Housemade calamansi soda sounds lovely, but mine was a little flat and weak. In lieu of hard spirits, sake is the backbone of most of the cocktails. They are typically fleshed out with half a dozen other ingredients -- vermouth, Aperol, artichoke liqueur and bitters, in the case of the A La Bira -- which sound at first as if they had been assembled by walking through a liquor store blindfolded, but which after a closer look reveal a degree of inner logic. If this does not pique your curiosity, the list of wines by the glass is almost long enough to qualify Tsismis as a wine bar, although the choices are not as outr\u00e9 as they are across the street at Wildair . In a city crazy for kakigori , patbingsu and other varieties of flavored snow, Tsismis's halo-halo will probably be an instant hit. Mr. Afzelius has the very good idea of putting coconut sorbet where the shaved ice would usually go; from there he goes to town with coconut jellies and what seems like every fresh fruit he can put his hands on. But discerning collectors of Filipino sweets should note that Tsismis serves excellent silvanas. A silvana is either a shrunken cake or a cookie with big ideas, depending on your perspective. It is made of two cashew meringues that are sandwiched together with buttercream and then painted with more buttercream, which holds cashew crumbs to the outside of the whole package. Once frosted and crumbed, it has to be refrigerated or the buttercream will melt before it gets inside your mouth. No gold leaf adorns the silvanas. It would only get in the way.

But I had not come across one that made as much sense to me as the big, sloshing platters you get at old-line Italian-American clam bars like Randazzo's until tripping into a new Greenwich Village restaurant called Babs this summer. Mind you, virtually the only Italian thing about the tagliatelle with clams at Babs was the tagliatelle. The sauce was a mustard beurre blanc, one of those French sauces that all culinary-school students are supposed to be able to make in their sleep. Mustard beurre blanc is often found providing a decorous yellow veil over a chicken breast or salmon fillet. It is not normally poured over noodles. But, tossed with salty French ham and Manila clams smaller than a thumbprint, it made a strangely exciting bowl of pasta that was much more coherent than it sounds. Once I got to know Babs better, I understood that strange excitement is what it does best. Its chef, Efr\u00e9n Hern\u00e1ndez, has talked about Babs as a European grill, and many of the dishes are seared over hot charcoal, but he has a wider frame of reference than that. He was raised in Southern California by immigrants from Mexico, and Mexican cuisine runs through his menu like an underground stream that sometimes gurgles up to the surface. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez is not particularly interested in fusion, though; as far as I can tell, he likes rubbing cultures together to see what color the sparks will be. See, for example, what the menu calls divorced sea bream, a handsome dish that would be splashed around Instagram even more frequently than it already is if the dining tables were lighted by ceiling pinspots rather than disco-era chrome globes that look as if they were salvaged from Regine's . The bream is split, and one side brushed with a red sauce and the other with a green sauce, before it is grilled over charcoal. The dish is an allusion to the two-tone pescado a la talla served at Contramar in Mexico City, itself derived from huevos divorciados, a breakfast of two fried eggs beneath two contrasting salsas. In Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez's kitchen, though, the red adobo at Contramar is replaced by a Catalan romesco, and the parsley salsa becomes a French pistou. But surely the tortilla on its own plate off to one side brings it back to Mexico? Not so fast. According to the menu, it is a taloa, a Basque cornmeal cake that cooks from Bayonne to Bilbao have been griddling for centuries. The taloa at Babs is tender, smooth and floral. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez has been cooking at Babs since it opened in July. He is also the chef at Mimi , a French restaurant a block away that is owned by the same people (Daniel Bennett, his brother Evan, and Louis Levy; they named Babs and Mimi after their grandmothers.) I haven't been back to Mimi since Liz Johnson was the chef . She was aiming for a style that was at once brawny and lavish, and since taking over last year Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez has seemed to continue in that vein while bringing his far-ranging curiosity to bear. As they did at Mimi, the owners have planted a small curved bar right by the door at Babs. The cocktails stirred and shaken there are mostly recognizable relatives of classics, like a martini made with two brands of gin. There's something charmingly self-deprecating about a cocktail list that includes Mount Gay and tonic, which seasoned barflies know as one of the drinks you can safely order in dives that don't do anything else right. The wine list, meanwhile, is mostly French and sticks to the old guard; you can tell it's not trying especially hard to be cool by the way it has just one orange wine, lumped in with the sparkling wines. Only the wine geeks will wish for more, but the rest of us might wish there were as many bottles costing around $50 as there are in the $90 range. The numbers on the menu can sneak up on you, too. My $48 lobster was a small creature that couldn't have weighed much more than a pound. The server brightly suggested dunking its tomalley into the smoked potato pur\u00e9e, and I would have tried it if I had found any tomalley. And while I can imagine happily paying $36 for Babs's lamb chops, I'd want them to be served with something more compelling than the cold, underseasoned \"Basque potato salad\" into which some baby sardines had apparently disappeared without a trace. But there is nothing wrong with the charcoal-grilled swordfish with mint salsa verde, fennel and green olives, and if you ordered the chicken andouille this summer you found Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez knocking cuisines together again, this time with a corn-and-chanterelles risotto under a slow-burning splash of Calabrian chile oil. He shows how well he can work in small strokes with a layered appetizer of raw sea scallops, sweet potato pur\u00e9e and trout roe, seasoned with a briny and fascinating salsa of chopped cucumbers, seaweed and fermented serrano chiles; or the fried cod cheeks, tender and crunchy over an orange slick of romesco aioli. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez's imagination fights against predictability. A crab salad, for instance, doesn't need to be interesting if it is fresh, but the one at Babs is both. It's seasoned with a gribiche that's full of chopped fresh dill, and then it's piled up in a big beehive on top of a smoked potato pancake. Like many small restaurants these days, Babs doesn't offer many desserts, but the ones it does are far more intriguing than average. A fine apple galette is improved by a grating of Swiss-style cheese from Edelweiss Creamery in Wisconsin and by a drizzle of 20-year-old Pedro Xim\u00e9nez sherry, thick as syrup and tasting like chocolate and coffee. Why sherry with Swiss cheese? I don't know, but Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez does. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

Today, we live in the era of the elevated slice joint. Some of them, like Scarr's , grind wheat berries into new flour every day. Many use minuscule quantities of yeast; others abandon commercial yeast altogether in favor of the natural leavening in sourdough starters. There are slice joints that ferment their dough for a day, some that let it bubble away for two days and a few that go in for three days. A new example of the breed, F&F Pizzeria , opened in Brooklyn last week with the help of a baker whose starter dough has traveled internationally and another baker who has decades of experience at the end of a pizza paddle. Among themselves, these new-school pizza makers speak of hydration levels, fermentation periods and digestibility. Many of these slice masters are chasing an ideal version of the foldable, portable triangle sold across linoleum counters in all five boroughs, a search suffused with nostalgia for an era before processed cheese, sweetened sauce and wholesale dough. Others are celebrated for achievements in the square slice, a descendant of the Sicilian, with an airier, less doughy crust; leaders in this style include Corner Slice and Mama's Too . Perhaps the smallest group of all are the bakers who turn their eyes toward Rome, where the slices are rectangular and are known as pizza al taglio. They resemble focaccia more than a $3 slice from Ray's , and it's doubtful that the practitioners of this style even think of themselves as belonging to the elevated-slice movement. But I'd argue that they do belong to it, and that some of the most elevated slices in the area at the moment are the Roman-style ones that Bread and Salt sells inside its bakery and restaurant on Palisade Avenue, up in the Jersey City Heights. At any given time, three to six pizzas sit on the counter. They are oblong and, because they are baked without a pan to shape the dough, they have rounded corners, like a horse track. The crust is noticeably lightweight when you pick it up, an impression that is confirmed by the mouth and, later, the stomach. The interior is honeycombed with air pockets. The underside of each slice is strong enough to carry a relatively heavy load of toppings without bending or collapsing. This structural soundness is key to the pleasure. The toppings on a Bread and Salt slice are not decorations or seasonings, as they often are on round pizza. Each one is the point of its slice: a mix of fresh mushrooms with pepper, parsley and flecks of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano; zucchini shaved into fine threads and showered at the last minute with mint leaves; slices of late-summer red and yellow peppers picked while they still had few faintly bitter streaks of green reaching up their sides; a rough, dark pesto spooned around cherry tomatoes that were roasted until their skins turned black and pulled away from the globes of pulp inside; Concord grapes that blotch the dough with purple like exploded jelly grenades. A chef's hand is at work here, tossing black pepper and rosemary over the grape pizza, adding salt and excellent Sicilian olive oil to the tomato pulp, and hammering basil and hazelnuts for the pesto in a mortar. The hand belongs to Rick Easton, who oversees the pizzas and the nonpizzas and owns the restaurant. He also owned its predecessor, the Bread and Salt that operated in Pittsburgh for all of 2015 plus a few weeks on either side. For a short-lived place, it got a lot of media attention, luring restaurant hunters and recipe gatherers from across the country. By the start of 2016, he had decided to move to New York City. When his first job fell through, he began shopping for a location for Bread and Salt. The real estate market had ideas of its own, as it often does, which is how the incarnation of Bread and Salt that Mr. Easton opened early this summer wound up in New Jersey. In addition to cheaper rents, Jersey City has ordinances that allow customers to show up with bottles of wine or beer and drink them, a handy policy because Bread and Salt's beverage list has nothing more potent than Italian sodas and sparkling water. Each night's menu, written in chalk on a blackboard next to the counter where you order, contains at least as many things that are not pizza as things that are. Generally these other items are modest in size and trattoria-ish in spirit; prepared ahead of time, they need at most five minutes in the oven before a cook will arrange them on a board and carry them to one of the 25 or so seats. I wish the tripe stewed in spicy tomato sauce, the way Romans do it, were available all the time. It is not, but the meatballs almost always are, and they are wonderful, made with enough bread that they are extremely tender in a bright marinara. Another reliable find is a sandwich of some kind, made with plain, untopped pizza. Twice I've had a warm mortadella sandwich there, and both times I was convinced there was no way to improve on it. One dish was denoted on the menu by a single word: beans. I've thought of it nearly every day since, partly because the beans -- scarlet runners -- were perfectly intact but perfectly tender; partly because of the brooding depth they took on from being finished with sweet red peppers that the kitchen dried and fried, an ingredient the Italians call peperoni cruschi; and partly because their broth tasted so good when given a chance to soak into the slice of thick-crusted sourdough bread that came on top. That bread is Mr. Easton's, too. It comes with a lot of things, and it is excellent. Bread and Salt is still settling into New Jersey. Some ingredients may be better when Mr. Easton has had time to infiltrate the local farm scene. In August, when the state was rolling in juicy peaches, he was serving crunchy unripe ones in red wine for dessert. There was also a very strange cantaloupe pudding. By September things were looking up; one day there was a scoop of Tristar strawberry sorbet served with anise-seed-flecked polenta gelato, both made by Superiority Burger. (Mr. Easton is friendly with that restaurant's owner, Brooks Headley , and helped devise the recipe for the focaccia Superiority Burger serves on Fridays.) Although Mr. Easton has a handful of employees, Bread and Salt has some of the blind spots of a one-person operation. It is not the easiest restaurant to communicate with, having an Instagram account but no website or phone. On a recent Sunday, when the restaurant was supposed to open at 1 p.m., a sign on the front door announced that it would be delayed until 1:30. That was the last communiqu\u00e9; the doors were not unlocked until 2. But Mr. Easton has a singular vision, and it is the reason the food is so compelling. Looking around at the place, you're not sure how it can keep going like this. But then the plates start to come out of the kitchen and you don't want them ever to stop.

At first, there was no reason to doubt him. That the man is comfortable with long time horizons was clear to anyone who watched how patiently he studied the science of indirect heat at his first establishment in the neighborhood, Hometown Bar-B-Que . After Hurricane Sandy flooded streets and knocked out power in the area shortly before the scheduled opening in 2012, he gave away smoked briskets, ribs and shoulders to local residents until electricity was restored almost three weeks later, honing his technique all the while. The years rolled by without a drumstick in sight. But as recently as March, it was still possible to take Mr. Durney at his word when he talked about the star attraction of his nearly completed fried-chicken emporium , to be called Red Hook Tavern. The doors were finally unlocked in July, revealing a row of tables under electrified gas lamps and a row of stools in front of a white-oak bar that looks as if it was built to last at least until Van Brunt Street sinks into the sea. Wearing wallpaper and wainscoting and pressed tin, Red Hook Tavern does a straight-faced impression of a whiskey-simmered New York corner bar of a certain age. The attention to detail was to be expected, given how convincingly Hometown conjures a Texas Hill Country barbecue palace. What was something of a surprise, though, was that chickens were not being fried anywhere on the premises. In fact, Red Hook Tavern's star attraction turned out to be a cheeseburger. To be fair, Mr. Durney probably would not have drummed up much enthusiasm had he gone around telling people he was going to open a bar that served hamburgers. New York has so many of those already that the style they typically serve is a recognized subgenre that George Motz calls \"the New York City pub burger.\" According to Mr. Motz, a filmmaker and author whose work explores all things ground-beef-and-bun-related, the hallmarks of a pub burger are a thicker-than-average patty and a relative lack of adornment. It is the plain, sturdy and hunger-calming burger you get at P.J. Clarke's , JG Melon and Fanelli Cafe in Manhattan and at Donovan's Pub in Queens. Mr. Durney has said that he intends the Red Hook Tavern burger as a homage to the one at Peter Luger Steak House . (You might think that Luger traffics in the style known as the steakhouse burger, but most burger taxonomists agree that what it serves, only at the bar and only at lunch, is a pub burger.) Like Peter Luger, Red Hook Tavern employs a toasted and buttered hard roll with a smattering of sesame seeds -- about as many as the stars you can see in the sky over Manhattan on a very clear night. In both places, the patties are made with some portion of dry-aged prime beef, stand about an inch and a half tall, and possess a dark crust that fills your head with the instinct-triggering aromas and flavors whose creation in browned meat was described by Louis Camille Maillard . There are some minor divergences. At Peter Luger, cheese is optional, while the top and sides of the burger at Red Hook Tavern are tightly wrapped in glossy yellow American cheese by default. A thick cross-section of white onion is laid below the top bun at Luger. At Red Hook Tavern, the onion is stationed below the patty, where it helps keep the bottom bun dry, like a coaster. They give you a half-sour pickle spear and fries, too, which are about the same dimensions. The important difference between the burgers, though, is that lately Peter Luger's have tended to be better in memory than in reality, while the Red Hook Tavern's is, right now, one of the few absolutely mandatory burgers in New York City. The kitchen is overseen by Allison Plumer, a chef who has done most of her cooking in Brooklyn. She has an excellent dry-aged steak -- New York strip, naturally -- impressively browned and served with a small cast-iron skillet full of creamed spinach, a touch so right it may qualify as art. It is the kind of detail that makes Red Hook Tavern something more than a place for the locals to get beer and burgers. Another is the golden chicken gravy with a hint of butterscotch that is ladled into a well in the mashed potatoes that come with the half-chicken, which is advertised as simply pan-roasted, although it has the wonderfully stiff shards of skin you get from weighting down the bird as it cooks. Everybody who has eaten at Red Hook Tavern will tell you to get the country-ham-and-Cheddar croquettes on a creamy pool of whole-grain Dijonnaise. Everybody is right, too. Consensus has also formed around the wedge salad, which is clearly not a wedge, but is still a very fine salad, with blue cheese and a thick, Lugeresque bacon slice flopped over individual leaves of romaine. There is considerably less unanimity about the roasted corn, kernels of which you are supposed to wrap in radicchio that you've first smeared with 'nduja; I'm in the camp that thinks it would be a fine dish for another restaurant. There is no restaurant where I'd be glad to see littlenecks steamed with way too much stale, acrid garlic. Of course, there's no correct amount of stale, acrid garlic, but the kitchen really goes all in. There are two desserts. Both are sundaes . They do not have the thematic inevitability of the creamed spinach, but they're put together with more sophistication than average. The truth is, though, that nothing on the menu gives the burger a real run for its money. What does, or at least equals it as a reason to reserve a table a couple of weeks in advance, is the list of drinks Mr. Durney has put together with Jeff Porter and Kenneth Crum. Mr. Durney's enthusiasm for wines made by small, eccentric producers is on view at Hometown, surely the only place on earth where you can drink Milan Nasterec's skin-fermented Moravian pinot noir alongside a taco filled with a slice of barbecued brisket and, in lieu of salsa, a glowing yellow stripe of queso. Mr. Durney indulges his curiosity more deeply at the tavern. Ten grower Champagnes can be had for under $100 a bottle, and there's a $40 sparkling red from Maryland. Darlings of the nonconformist wine movement such as Radikon , Marcel Lapierre and Frank Cornelissen are all given the space you'd expect, but there are also less familiar names like Subject to Change , a Forestville, Calif., outfit that has the peculiar idea of making a bright-toned, low-alcohol zinfandel-syrah blend and calling it Moon Juice. A small number of brews from Other Half, Folksbier and Threes Brewing, leading lights of the Brooklyn suds scene, are on tap, along with uncredited light and dark ales billed as \"A Tribute To McSorleys Ale House.\" McSorley's, famously, has you buy two mugs at once, which Red Hook Tavern doesn't do. It's less well known that McSorley's serves a burger. Like the one at Luger, it's only available at lunch. It is, of course, a pub burger.

When I asked where he wanted to eat, he answered, a bit wistfully, \"Somewhere that speaks of New York, a city I have lost touch with.\" At first, I looked for a place where we could be in the thick of it all. I thought of Bar Pisellino , that narrow glass sarcophagus run by Rita Sodi and Jody Williams, where you drink your sgroppino standing up between the window along Grove Street and the one along Seventh Avenue. People trickle in, eat some olives and a tuna tramezzino, and head out again. Although it's about the size of a subway car, you get the feeling that if you stayed long enough, you'd eventually see everybody you know. But a restaurant that truly speaks of the place New York has become over the past decade or so would be nearly the opposite of Bar Pisellino. This restaurant would not be in the thick of it all. It would be hushed, sheltered, exclusive, admitting no more than a handful of people at a time. It would protect those people, once they were inside, from crowds spilling in from the street, even from the street itself. It would join the steady march of new tasting counters and omakase hideaways. And it would illustrate the growing ease with which New Yorkers of means can glide through and above the fray, slipping from one cloistered room to another in black cars without touching down. That restaurant would be a lot like Frevo , which has been serving suave, $124 tasting menus with a modern-French sensibility in Greenwich Village for the past four months. Frevo is the work of Franco Sampogna, who is the chef, and Bernardo Silva, the manager. Mr. Sampogna is from Brazil and Mr. Silva comes from Portugal; they met 10 years ago while working in restaurants in France, and quickly decided that one day they would open a restaurant in New York City that would give diners \"that feeling of being in your own secluded safe haven,\" as Mr. Sampogna put it. To get into Frevo, you first need to know that Frevo exists. There's no sign. When you arrive at the correct address, what you see is an art gallery with just enough room on its white walls for the six abstract paintings that hang there fairly close together. The paintings are real paintings made by a real artist, Thomas Labarthe, who goes by Toma-L , but the gallery is not entirely a real gallery. If it were, the young woman who sits there keeping an eye on things would stare blankly ahead when you entered, instead of walking up to you with a smile and reassuring you that, yes, you've come to the right place. Then she reaches behind one of the canvases and it swings out on invisible hinges, leaving in its place a doorway through which you can see, illuminated in a large, dark room, a stainless-steel kitchen and a long, curving counter of polished quartzite. You hop up on one of the 18 padded seats, and the door clicks closed. You are in. When the door opens again, typically not for another half an hour, in will walk another set of people who, like you, knew that the gallery was not a normal gallery. Let's say that the misdirection of the gallery and the secret door do not make these newcomers feel sufficiently insulated from the outside world. Frevo gives them the opportunity to sit at a round chef's table in a back corner around which a curtain can be drawn, as in a hospital room. Much of this comes right out of the neo-speakeasy handbook, although Frevo does throw itself into the act with an unusual level of commitment. The gallery, for instance, installed a new batch of Mr. Labarthe's canvases around Labor Day. But each time I went to Frevo, I stared at that curtain. Nobody ever closed it while I was there, but it still reminded me how easy it is now for some New Yorkers to climb into the treehouse and pull the ladder up behind them. I have to admit, though, that I like Frevo more than I like the version of New York that it brings to mind. The pleasures of this secluded safe haven are real, and Mr. Sampogna's cooking is focused and refined. I haven't been able to get his halibut dish out of my mind, for instance. The fish rests on a thin, crisp platform of fried bread shellacked with a dark mushroom marmalade; this miniature mushroom tart drinks up the flavor of the halibut as it goes, in the oven, from raw to that just-cooked state where its flesh slides apart into thick and almost fluffy white flakes. Alongside the fish are bulbs of melted fennel, their spiced cooking juices boiled down to a bittersweet syrup. Mr. Sampogna's opening salvo often involves quinoa doing something quinoa doesn't usually do, and doing it quite nicely. I liked its freshness when it was used in a salad spooned over a demitasse of creamy hummus; I liked its crunch when it was dehydrated and sprinkled over a few mouthfuls of black lentils topped with glistening orbs of smoked trout roe. A dish from early July brought peas, at the tail end of their season, together with a rich pistachio-tarragon cream and white puffs of coconut mousse: light and charming. I wished Mr. Sampogna had exploited summer produce as sensitively when I went back in August and September. His kitchen is small enough that he could respond to the market day by day, but so far this doesn't seem to interest him. Frevo, at $124 for five courses, is not a huge splurge by New York standards, but servers try to inflate the total by pushing supplements. For $30 you can get Kaluga caviar troweled on to your first course; $20 gets you upgraded to a foie gras torchon instead of the less-thrilling mushrooms with gnocchi; it's $18 for a serving of aged Comt\u00e9 before dessert, and another $30 to have white truffles with the cheese. This tactic is not as grating as it is at Per Se , where the supplements are piled onto a base charge of $355, but it is still a snag in the otherwise smooth hospitality provided by Frevo's small crew of servers and cooks. Everyone I've brought to Frevo has fallen under its spell, which is hard to resist. The music is slinky and sinuous. The room has a nocturnal theatricality; sitting at the counter with darkness behind you facing the spotlighted kitchen can feel like attending an extremely elegant campfire. I still think Frevo is a perfect spot to familiarize yourself with the frictionless New York of 2019. Still, when my out-of-town friend arrived, we had our dinner at Bar Pisellino. We were hungry for a taste of the old chaos. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

In fact, dim sum is only a small portion of what the menu offers at Hutong, which opened in Midtown in July. But you would do well to make it a large portion of what you order, because only one or two other restaurants in town can plausibly claim to make dim sum that rivals Hutong's. Where else will you find cooks who have the dexterity to make Wagyu-beef mille-feuilles whose flaky layers of pastry overlap each other by only a few millimeters, like the feathers on a songbird's wing? Who can craft steamed buns that look just like shiitake mushrooms, which happen to be the chief ingredient in their filling? Or who knows the secret that allows the crunchy, chewy, charcoal-black mini-footballs stuffed with pork (in what is known in Sichuan as \"fish-fragrant\" seasoning) to sparkle as if diamond chips had been kneaded into the dough? There is real skill in the kitchen at Hutong. You see it most clearly in the dim sum, but much of the other cooking evinces the kind of discipline, precision and technical mastery that has rarely been seen in this city over the past few decades, to the dismay of eaters who know what Chinese food is capable of. \"While expensive French restaurants in New York can hold their own against many places in Paris, if you want to move beyond steamed dumplings and stir-fries to experience the complexity of Chinese banquet cuisine, the possibilities grow dimmer each year,\" Ruth Reichl wrote in The New York Times in 1998. She gave reasons for the poor showing, including talented chefs being paid more in Hong Kong and China. That is as true as it was 21 years ago, but what has changed is the rise of global Chinese restaurant groups, from the disappointing duck specialist DaDong to the surprisingly solid Hao Noodle outposts and, now, to Hutong. The original Hutong opened in 2003 on the 28th floor of a glass tower overlooking the Hong Kong harbor, but the dining room tries to conjure the atmosphere of Beijing's vanishing premodern alleys, or hutongs, by means of red paper lanterns, carved wooden doors and birdcages. The Manhattan branch makes a different impression. The entrance is on the east side of the circular driveway below the Bloomberg Building between East 58th and 59th Streets. Turn right and you are in a narrow hallway between two soaring glass stacks of wine bottles, every one of them for decorative purposes only. Turn left and you are in a glittering, soaring, hard-edge dining room. The inspiration seems to be Art Deco with a pinch of cocaine; the blue leather banquettes, beveled mirrors and chandeliers of mirror-polished steel could come from the set of a nightclub in some cross between \" Scarface \" and \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\" A guest who has lived in China allowed his eyes to adjust to the glinting light as he looked toward the ceiling, which seemed to be far away. \"It's very \u2026 yin,\" he said. Hutong is ostensibly a Northern Chinese restaurant. This is more apparent in Hong Kong than in Manhattan, where the menu has been pruned to about half the size. Lamb, a mainstay in the northern provinces, was represented in August by a single dish, cumin-speckled ribs roasted languorously to a mind-altering tenderness. By the time of my last visit, lamb had ambled off the menu entirely. The most famous preparation from northern China, Peking duck, arrived at my table worse for wear and tear, carved haphazardly, with blobs of unmelted fat clinging to limp skin. The second course, a dark-meat stir-fry to be folded in iceberg lettuce, was more skillfully done, but the sting of paying $84 for a whole duck with uncrisp skin lingered. Much of what hasn't been trimmed from the Hong Kong menu comes from Sichuan. So does Fei Wang, the executive chef of the New York branch, and a native of Chengdu. Most recently seen running the kitchen of the Hutong in London, Mr. Wang weaves chiles -- fresh, dried, roasted, pickled, name it -- into nearly everything. In the dish known as Red Lantern, the whole dried peppers the size of cherries are mostly decorative; fried soft-shell crabs are buried under the chiles in a pan with an arcing bamboo handle, like jelly beans in the plastic grass of an Easter basket. The ground spices on the crabs' shatteringly brittle crust -- lightly sweet and more aromatic than searingly hot -- may remind you of a Chinese rice-cracker snack you grew up on, or it may make you think of Old Bay. Fermented chiles provide an electric buzz, and a modicum of heat, to the steamed halibut that arrives boxed up inside a red bell pepper and sitting on a nest of rice noodles. (The pepper opens into a six-pointed star that gives the dish its name, halibut red star noodles.) Kou shui chicken is nearly submerged in an orange lake of excellent chile oil, although the adroit way the oil is balanced by rice vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger and other flavors is what gives Hutong one of the city's most impressive versions of this traditional cold dish. If Hutong has another appetizer that equals it, I haven't found it yet. I did, however, have a cryptic encounter with a log-cabin stack of okra doused in a sweet wasabi sauce, and an inconclusive rendezvous with some steamed asparagus stalks whose tips were enrobed in white sesame sauce; it was as if somebody had tried to replicate strawberries dipped in white chocolate without access to strawberries or white chocolate. You could attempt to unknot these mysteries. Then again, you could simply begin your meal with dim sum. And then, after picking your way through the chile-besotted main courses, you could end it that way, too. There is a dessert that mimics the shape of a steamed bun, pleated and twisted into a pucker at the top. It is made of white chocolate, the wrapper on this trompe l'oeil bao, and filled with white sesame cream and a core of bittersweet salted caramel. Alongside it is a single scoop of ice cream made from lightly sweetened soy milk. The soy milk is extremely fresh. I don't mean that the carton won't expire for another three weeks; I mean that somebody in the kitchen was squeezing the soybeans shortly before the ice cream was frozen. This is a snack from a Chinese childhood, bread and a glass of milk, and it would be hard, after several courses of spice, to think of anything more welcome.

He began with a counter in the Gansevoort Market food hall called Mission Ceviche ; there is now another in Canal Street Market and a third is supposed to open in Norwalk, Conn., later this year. At all locations, the stock-in-trade is citrus-marinated raw fish with sweet potatoes and kernels of chubby Andean corn, in both its soft and crunchy forms. This is of course the standard Peruvian formula, but Mr. Ch\u00e1vez had the inspiration of serving his ceviche in a clear plastic bowl over a base of salad, rice or, for a dollar more, quinoa. The supplemental ingredients make a plausible desk lunch out of a dish that some New Yorkers still aren't quite sure what to do with. The surprising thing about Mission Ceviche's salad bowls is that they taste like real Peruvian food. The raw fish is firm and cold and neatly cut up into solid pieces that hold their shape. The leche de tigre marinade in Mr. Ch\u00e1vez's \"ceviche cl\u00e1sico\" is a bright and precise cocktail of lime and rocoto chiles, although you might wish that the rocotos had been applied with a little less restraint. You get a higher-caliber shot of spice, this time from aj\u00ed amarillo chiles, in the ceviche mixto, a combination of octopus, shrimp and fluke enveloped in a creamy, goldenrod-colored leche de tigre. The cl\u00e1sico is accessorized with sweet potato pur\u00e9e; the mixto gets avocado pur\u00e9e, too. The pur\u00e9es are piped out of pastry bags like buttercream roses on a wedding cake, and they are delicious. When I wandered into the Gansevoort Market location in February, it seemed clear that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez could run an interesting restaurant if he ever decided to put his food into something other than recyclable salad bowls. Then, at the beginning of the summer, he did just that, opening a sit-down restaurant on the Upper East Side with real plates and bowls. The new space is not particularly large or lavish, but compared with the earlier efforts, Mission Ceviche Restaurant & Bar is a palace. There is seating for 65 or so people beneath a wall sculpture of a fish that glows from behind and a pink neon sign that reads \"tiger milk effect,\" probably a reference to the belief that drinking leftover leche de tigre can put extra topspin on sexual performance. The menu now paints a slightly fuller picture of Peruvian cuisine, extending into new foods including the grilled skewers known as anticuchos. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez dresses up the country's most popular anticucho, grilled beef heart, brushing it with a creamy rocoto sauce and serving it with newly fried blue potato chips and kernels of choclo corn. The trio of rocoto, blue potatoes and choclo is so solidly Peruvian that it can withstand the chimichurri that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez brings in, by way of Argentina, as a final touch. He clearly has a soft spot for chimichurri because he deploys it again with the shrimp anticuchos (the shrimp are very big and look even bigger because they're grilled with their heads on), served with a squirt of huanca\u00edna, the spicy yellow cheese sauce that is something like Peru's version of queso dip. My favorite anticucho is a more straightforward situation, grilled scallops under arugula, lime zest and a smooth Parmesan fondue. But Mr. Ch\u00e1vez has the ability to put several flavors in motion at once and keep his balance, as evidenced by the beef-heart skewer and his octopus causa. This is, reduced to bare bones, a tendril of octopus curled around a disc of mashed potatoes. But the potatoes, seasoned with lime and yellow chiles, are coated in a smooth lavender-colored sauce made from Peruvian black olives; the octopus has been rubbed with cumin, oregano and aj\u00ed panca paste and grilled to a crackle; the plate is decorated with a few wobbly curls of paper made with purple Peruvian potatoes. Mission Ceviche's servers, while eager to be helpful, have a habit of singling out the most obvious dishes -- the classic ceviche, the octopus leg -- and pushing them so hard you might suspect the rest of the menu is a minefield. It isn't. There is nothing to avoid unless the kitchen brings back the bizarre strawberry-kiwi ceviche that showed up as a special one night. If you are being herded into getting the \"Peruvian paella,\" you should know that the other three main courses are also worth looking into, like the aj\u00ed de gallina, shredded chicken breast in a creamy aj\u00ed amarillo sauce that is both soothing and spicy; or the seco norte\u00f1o, a slowly braised short rib in cilantro sauce. All are larger than average, too. Still, nothing on the menu quite rivals the ceviches. They are served, yes, without lettuce or rice, and they are better for it. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez's creative engine seems to have a high idle, and he has come up with different ways to present dishes that are also on the menu at the fast-casual counters. The \"Nikkei\" ceviche, for instance -- tuna in a kind of modified ponzu sauce seasoned with aj\u00ed amarilllo and togarashi -- now comes with watermelon and a bloop of ginger foam that would never survive a trip from the food court back to the office. Neither would the odd but intriguing attempt at a vegetarian ceviche where the fish is replaced by shiitakes and the leche de tigre takes the form of snow, frozen by liquid nitrogen. The art of ceviche-making has at least as much in common with mixology as with cooking, so it is no surprise that the cocktails are well calibrated and sing out with fresh lime. There is a twist on the pisco sour made with passion-fruit juice and another with the purple-corn drink chicha morada, although neither quite achieves the bracing elegance of the original. And it's nice to see the less well-known chilcano, a pisco highball made with lime juice and ginger ale. (Would ginger beer be better?) Chicha morada appears again in the raspadilla dessert. This time it is a syrup poured over shaved ice and sprinkled with lucuma foam. When I had the raspadilla, it was sprinkled with candied pecan crumbs but in a phone interview on Monday Mr. Ch\u00e1vez said he had replaced the nuts with crumbled Oreos. This, it hardly needs pointing out, was not exactly a staple in the diet of the Incas. \"What can I say?\" he asked. \"I just really like Oreos.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

The city is not yet in the same league as, say, Chongqing, where the dish is said to have originated and where an association dedicated to keeping track of such things says there are about 50,000 places to eat it. New York, by my count, has a mere two or three dozen, most of them in the sections of Brooklyn, Queens and Lower Manhattan that have considerable Chinese populations. But new hot pot restaurants seem to arrive every few weeks, with some independent operators among a growing number of chains from China. Downtown Flushing, Queens, has Little Sheep Hot Pot , founded in Inner Mongolia and one of the first hot pot purveyors in New York to move beyond the all-you-can-eat model, which led to widespread improvement in ingredient quality; Mister Hotpot, known among the city's pig worshipers for its creamy, ivory-toned pork-bone broth; and Liuyishou Hot Pot , a Chongqing-based concern where the spiced beef tallow that is an essential component of Sichuan hot pot is molded into the shape of a smiling, bow-tied cow. Farther south in Flushing is Niu Pot , the city's best hot pot establishment by several measures, including the number and complexity of its broths. Niu Pot cooks a very good winter-melon soup and serves it inside the melon's hollow shell, although it is most widely known for serving marbled slices of raw beef wrapped tightly around a Barbie doll , like a dress for Lady Gaga . In Manhattan, hot pot outposts have been planted along the Bowery in a line advancing toward Chinatown, starting with Zhen Wei Fang . If there had been a hot pot restaurant in \"Blade Runner,\" it would have looked like Zhen Wei Fang, an import from Miami that has private booths, simultaneous videos projected side by side on the walls and a robot host by the entrance. (Adding to the sense of a future gone awry, the robot wasn't working the last time I went.) A few blocks south is Tang Hotpot , probably the most luxe hot pot in the city. The menu is illustrated with still-life ingredient photographs that look as if Vermeer painted them, and the pictures aren't that far off from reality. Almost all of these emporiums offer Sichuan hot pot, a broth covered in a deep slice of chile oil in which dried red chiles, Sichuan peppercorns and various other spices churn around like the remains of toy sailboats after a hurricane. But Da Long Yi Hot Pot, which opened in May in a second-story space above Canal Street, has the advantage over most of its competitors of having originated in Sichuan. Its home base, from which more than 200 Da Long Yis have issued, is the provincial capital of Chengdu. Chongqing was administratively sheared from the rest of the province in 1997. Although you key your name into a touch pad at the top of the stairs to get on Da Long Yi's waiting list, and you learn that your table is ready from an automated text, you order by penciling an X on the paper menu, in a box next to the item you want. The menu also suggests the length of time each item should be held down in the boiling soup. It goes without saying that you will want a Sichuan hot pot at Da Long Yi. You will be asked whether you want it mild, medium or spicy, although in my experience there isn't much difference. A more important question is whether you will cook your meal in Sichuan broth alone; in a split pot with Sichuan broth on one side and either tomato or mushroom broth, neither of them spicy, on the other; or in a three-chambered pot with some of each. The narrow range of choices can be an advantage for a novice hot potter, who might be swamped by the maximalist menus at Tang or Niu Pot. The split pots make Da Long Yi a good place to take somebody with a low tolerance for heat, although as a practical matter it is impossible to eat a Sichuan hot pot meal without ingesting at least a spoonful or two of chile oil. Old hands know that the oil tends to pool away from the region of the broth that is bubbling most furiously, and ingredients that, after cooking, are removed from the pot in this area will emerge relatively clean. Whether this is desirable varies from eater to eater and from ingredient to ingredient. Deeply furrowed, folded or layered foods -- the Kungfu beef tripe spread out on a mound of chipped ice; the tofu skins; the fried dough sticks known as youtiao or, on Da Long Yi's menu, \"fried bun\" -- retain spicy oil in quantities that may become challenging. Extremely smooth items, like the hard-cooked quail eggs, the rabbit kidneys speared on a toothpick, or the long and surprisingly slippery tubes of duck intestine, on the other hand, can survive a trip through the deepest patch of chile oil without any appreciable damage. You can, if you like, follow the custom of Chengdu or Chongqing by focusing on ingredients that are prized more for feel than flavor. The duck intestines, for instance, which quickly contract in the hot broth and come out about 30 seconds later with the texture of barely cooked squid. Or the pale ivory sheets of flattened artery, which after cooking about twice as long have a long-lasting chew that reminds me of geoduck. On the other hand, more flavorful ingredients, once they've cooked for a few minutes, can help punch up the broths, which aren't quite as deep or complex as they are at some other hot pot providers. This does not apply to the lengths of corn on the cob, which don't taste like anything to begin with. And I would avoid the \"vegetable platter,\" which was more like a lettuce platter. But it is useful to keep in mind that if you toss sliced king oyster mushrooms, or crown daisy greens, or bands of kelp tied into knots, or even the Hershey's Kiss-shaped fish balls with gooey orange roe inside, into the soup and forget about them for a while, both the ingredients and the soup will rise to the occasion. Some ingredients, though, you hold in your chopsticks, watching for 30 seconds or a minute until you can see they're ready. The marble tiles of Wagyu rib are in this category, and the New Zealand lamb shaved as thin as prosciutto, and the Kurobuta pork belly from Japan. The whole prawns on wooden skewers will be tender and running with juices in just over a minute. The sweet, small flounder fillets might need twice that. Even if you are careful to pull these bites out in the bubbling center of the pot, away from the oil, the chiles and Sichuan peppercorns will catch up with you sooner or later. They build up on your tongue, they slowly infiltrate your dipping sauce, and the mala tingle will take over. There is no fighting it at that point, of course, though a bowl of white rice is a good investment in the future. And when conversation at the table has stopped completely, when the water you keep pouring into sadistically small cups won't help any more, there is one thing that will: fresh watermelon juice, sold by the carafe.

The cooking there is hard to pin down, geographically. Stopping in a few weeks ago, I ate Low Countryish wild red shrimp on grits, with sweet corn off the cob and a potent saffron-lobster sauce. More recently, I had skinless pork sausage inspired by sai ua, the spicy and tangy specialty identified with the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai. The soft tripe I enjoyed the other weekend had been simmered with 'nduja, the fiery and malleable Calabrian sausage, and then covered with a few thin shingles of shaved pecorino. If I had started hanging around at Foxface sooner, especially during the cold months after its opening, in February, I might have run into a wider variety of cuisines and main ingredients. I did manage to get some of the elk osso buco while that was still on the menu. I never got to try the wild hare, though, stewed in red wine with a bit of chocolate and thickened with its own blood, a formula that students of very old-guard French cooking will recognize as li\u00e8vre \u00e0 la royale. Nor did I make it in time for the venison, left to bubble for hours in white wine with mushrooms and dark juniper berries. The Foxface dish I may never forgive myself for missing, though, is the kebabs served with preserved lemons and tahini, because the kebabs were made from ground lamb and camel. Although these foods may lack any unifying cultural background, they did have one thing in common: They were all served on rolls. Apart from an occasional salad or soup, everything cooked at Foxface arrives in sandwich form. And with the exception of a muffuletta that briefly manifested a few months back, every sandwich at Foxface is filled with hot, cooked meat or seafood or vegetables. In Mexico, certain taco stands specialize in tacos de guisado, tortillas filled with one kind of stew or another. Most of Foxface's offerings are, in effect, sandwiches de guisado. Which reminds me of another impressive Foxface sandwich, a magenta and green tangle of cilantro stems and pickled onions pressed into an engagingly tart pile of pork, marinated in sour orange juice and roasted very slowly under a banana leaf in emulation of cochinita pibil from the Yucat\u00e1n. There is no guarantee that any of these items will be available when you go to Foxface. The menu is printed daily and taped up next to the window on St. Marks Place where most of the business is transacted. Sometimes a new sandwich appears after the printed menu has already been posted, so it will be written out by hand on a card that has in its upper left corner the restaurant's logo, a drawing of an elegant fox in cat's-eye glasses with a cigarette holder in one gloved hand. The sandwiches have names like It's What's 'Nside (for the tripe with 'nduja) or 120 BPM (bison heart with tahini and \"many spices\"). The Smoking Fox is sold every day. It is filled with smoked pork rib the color of a dry ros\u00e9, separated from the bones and covered with coleslaw, pickles and a few splashes of habanero-orange vinegar. Your mind, of course, goes either to Memphis or to the McRib , and neither is exactly wrong, but the meat is of a superior grade and is smoked with the attention to timing and nuance that characterizes Foxface's cooking. It's a great sandwich. To place an order, you lean in to the window and speak with Sivan Lahat, who owns and runs Foxface with Ori Kushnir, her partner in life and in sandwiches. They immigrated to New York from Israel almost 20 years ago and have lived here ever since, apart from a brief flirtation with the Midwest and a longer experimental period in Tokyo. While they were in Japan, they operated a pop-up restaurant, which is the closest either of them came to running a food business before opening Foxface. Like the fox in the logo, Ms. Lahat has coppery hair and wears cat's-eye glasses. She prepares the orders in the room behind the window, which measures 48 square feet. Inside the building, under the stairs, Foxface has a second room. Mr. Kushnir thinks it could be as large as 14 square feet. A variety of equipment is stowed in the two rooms, including three induction burners, a roaster, a smoker and a dishwasher. After business hours, some of it comes out as Mr. Kushnir supervises the more time-consuming roasts and stews. He describes the food that he and Ms. Lahat cook as \"dishes we like to eat, reimagined as sandwiches.\" I like to eat a lot of the same dishes, as it happens, but they have been hard to come by lately, especially those shapeless brown stews that are so out of style. Following some of the world's most influential chefs and shamed, perhaps, by the unflattering lenses of a million amateur photographers, restaurants have shifted away from plain and plain-looking cooking. The subtlety and the thrill of plain cooking comes from searing, simmering, reducing, skimming and so on. All the people who own Instant Pots know this, but the segment of the restaurant scene with artistic leanings has forgotten it, focusing instead on plating, arranging six or seven things in some photogenic design and hoping they will cohere. Slapping a roll on it is one way to get a shapeless brown stew ready for its close-up, although it has to be said that on the mean streets of Instagram, an elk osso buco sandwich is no match for a rainbow unicorn ice cream sundae. Because space is at a premium, there is no room to sit and eat your Smoking Fox at Foxface itself. You can, however, take it to a table a few steps away inside an adjoining business called the William Barnacle Tavern . This is a reassuringly gloomy bar that is said to have originated as a speakeasy. Model ships and other nautical paraphernalia are strewn about, references to the rumrunning operation a former owner of the building presided over during Prohibition. (The stairs that Foxface's dishwasher is housed below lead to an exhibition space called the Museum of the American Gangster .) The bar's current owner has resisted some modern conveniences. Most of the lighting at night comes from small candles, and all of the music is provided by old films -- of Irish folk recitals, Cab Calloway concerts -- that run in looping, watery projections on the back wall. All Foxface sandwiches are presented in a trim little white box that can be unfolded into a place mat. You can purchase an Italian fruit soda for $3 from Foxface, or buy alcohol from the tavern. The beer is not expensive, but the specialty of the house is absinthe. Most patrons drink theirs diluted with ice water poured from a four-spigot absinthe fountain at the end of the bar. The bartender will make absinthe cocktails, too, including the one Ernest Hemingway supposedly invented that is just absinthe and Champagne in a big glass . He called it Death in the Afternoon, and it is what I intend to drink if I ever get my hands on that camel sandwich.

Nearly every place Mr. McNally has built since then has been a firm rejection of all that is fashionable in food, and each one has been, at least in its first few months, the most fashionable restaurant in town. The one he opened in early June in the meatpacking district, Pastis , was assembled partly from the salvaged bones of a nearby restaurant he closed five years ago, Pastis. (He salvaged the name, too.) The onion soup, the meaty snails sloshing around in the divots of a black iron snail pan with what must be half a pint of garlic butter, and a few other old war horses from the original menu have been summoned for one more joust on the battlefield. In short, the new Pastis takes almost everything straight from the old Pastis , which in turn took almost everything from the stodgiest, least trend-conscious sort of French cafes and brasseries. Needless to say, reservations are harder to come by than at any other New York restaurant that's opened this year. The paradox of this is that Pastis is really meant for those nights when you decide to cancel your reservations at the little nine-seat tasting counter where the menu is inspired by Kieslowski's \"Decalogue.\" It is for those times when you get an urge to eat a Gruy\u00e8re omelet after 10 p.m., cooked medium-rare, flecked with herbs, skillfully rolled and staunchly backed up by a cold white from the Savoie. Urges like that do not typically announce themselves three weeks in advance, and they don't tend to survive exposure to rooms filled with people who have read about Pastis on the blogs but haven't yet figured out what it is for. For much of his life, Mr. McNally has been chipping, cracking, distressing and weathering interiors that are the architectural equivalent of rumpled sweaters two sizes too large. Perhaps the largest and certainly the most rumpled of all is Pastis. It doesn't have the corner entrance it had at its former address, or the long communal table that sliced through the front room like a surfboard. And the shelves of cigarette packs are definitely gone. ( You could still smoke in restaurants in 1999, when Pastis opened.) But the magazine racks are back, along with the overhead fans turning steadily below a stamped tin ceiling. Once again the walls are covered with chipped subway tiles, white, framed by black grout. The chairs still don't match. The ambient light is the color of a Scotch and soda and makes everybody look the way they do after you've drunk one. On an antique mirror, or one that looks like an antique, someone has scrawled a menu of desserts, almost none of which Pastis actually serves. You can, however, get an energetically whisked dark-chocolate mousse under shaved curls of chocolate, or a baba au rhum so drenched in booze that it might spontaneously combust if it weren't being restrained by a white dune of whipped Chantilly cream. The most significant change from the first Pastis to the second happened offstage. Mr. McNally, who had a stroke two years ago, has brought on the restaurateur Stephen Starr as a partner who, essentially, manages everything except the design. Familiar faces from La Mercerie and other Starr enterprises work alongside loyal retainers from the McNally empire. The McNally troops are exquisitely poised, self-assured, able to spot a misplaced butter knife from across the street. The Starr cadre is more casual, and occasionally a server will ask your opinion of \"the flavors so far,\" a question that has surely never been uttered at Minetta Tavern . Mr. Starr has oversight of the wine list, which is less conservative than a typical McNally lineup, and of the food, which has not been a strong suit of the McNally organization since the chefs Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr went out on their own. Pastis's chef, Michael Abt, was until recently in charge of the kitchen at the Washington restaurant Le Diplomate , which Mr. Starr owns. Better qualifications would be hard to conjure, given that Le Diplomate is essentially an imitation McNally restaurant. Taking his cues from the old days, Mr. Abt is putting out simple, unadorned, hunger-obliterating French cuisine drawn from the era before supermarkets and fast food. The salad of pickled herring and carrots with boiled potatoes might come straight from Brasserie Lipp . The country p\u00e2t\u00e9 is laden with chicken livers and riddled with soft white pork fat in gobs the size of gumdrops, although it could stand more salt, and I'd be happy to trade the slab of butter that comes with it for a pot of mustard. The p\u00e2t\u00e9 is made in house, as is the gorgeously smooth boudin blanc. With the boudin, you want pur\u00e9ed potatoes that are almost liquid. That is what you get. You might argue that, when it offers chilled king crab legs to be dipped in aioli, this unextravagant cafe breaks character. Does the same apply to garnishing sardines served in the can with an ingot of prized, costly butter made by Jean-Yves Bordier? Maybe. I thought, in any case, that the sardines and the olive oil they are packed in tended to talk over the butter. The half roast chicken is not in the same class as the birds that Antoine Westermann cooked when he was still at Le Coq Rico , but it is probably as good a roast chicken as any normal restaurant can produce. The duck in olives, though, is misconceived; the sauce is thin, acrid and one-dimensional instead of head-spinningly rich, the way it is at Allard in Paris . The seafood -- the trout amandine with its saut\u00e9ed skin taut beneath its armor of toasted almonds; steamed mussels in a lemon broth that's satiny with melted butter; an entire steamed branzino with enough crisp summer vegetables to make a salad -- is very appealing, though that won't stop the people who are going to get steak frites without even a glance at the menu. Those people may get fries that are crunchy and golden, or they might end up with a limp, oily batch, or they may get both in the same night, as I did. At the length of 20 years, memories are untrustworthy, but I'm reasonably sure the food at Pastis is better than it used to be. The wine is certainly more interesting. What's gone, and won't be back now that the surrounding addresses have been taken over by shops like Loro Piana, Sephora, Herm\u00e8s and RH, is the pure downtown electricity Pastis once generated. Sharing real estate with meat cutters in blood-smeared aprons and prostitutes in dresses as tight as the skins on a boudin blanc, Pastis did a drop-dead perfect imitation of the coolest restaurant in France. The French part was fake, but the cool was real. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

Rezd\u00f4ra doesn't. A few steps down from the sidewalk, on the same block of East 20th Street as Gramercy Tavern and the brownstone where Teddy Roosevelt was born, Rezd\u00f4ra lists a \"regional pasta tasting\" for $90 on its menu. The region in question is Emilia-Romagna, whose refinements in the art of rolling and saucing noodles are admired even by Italians from other parts of the country. Chances are that most of the five pastas in the tasting are exactly the ones you picture when you think about Emilia-Romagna, starting with tortellini in brodo. This would seem to make it an easy sell, and yet servers at Rezd\u00f4ra never tried to sell me on the tasting. Until I asked about it one night, I had never seen the separate menu card that describes each course. With some hesitation, I ordered it. Every one of the pastas was excellent, and one or two would be worth walking a long distance for. After the fifth course was gone, it slowly dawned on me that Stefano Secchi, Rezd\u00f4ra's chef and one of its owners, had just laid down a straight flush. The tortellini were penny-size hoops rolled around minced and blended pork in a parcel just big enough to suggest the idea of meat. \"This is a special broth made from older chickens,\" a server said as he poured a steaming liquid from a kettle over the tortellini. It was the color of turkey gravy. The broth spent about half a day on the burner; drew some of its power from melted Parmigiano-Reggiano; and was more intense than canned chicken broth in roughly the same way that a dry-aged rib-eye is more intense than a McDonald's all-beef patty. This was followed by a smooth, almost fluffy tomato-basil sauce over maccheroni al pettine, delicate tubes with ridges they get from being rolled by hand along a comb made for the job. Three straw-colored blobs that looked like melted Brie turned out to be a glossy and wonderful fonduta made from Parmigiano-Reggiano. From there it was on to tortelloni, each about three bites big, filled with plush fresh ricotta and shiny with melted brown butter in which a few sage leaves had been bubbled. If we are talking about Emilia-Romagna we have to talk about rag\u00f9, and that was the next course, tossed with slim ribbons of tagliolini. Some people will find the rag\u00f9 saltier than they like. Almost everyone will find it more tender and smooth than the last 20 or 30 rag\u00fas they ate. The tour winds down with round, meat-filled anolini, a branch of the ravioli family that resides in Parma. They are served in something called crema di Parmigiano; you will not be far off if you imagine an Alfredo sauce cooked for one of the more sybaritic Roman emperors. This is not Rome, though, and the sauce gets the tart counterpoint it needs from an inky, 25-year-old balsamic vinegar poured straight from the bottle. Mr. Secchi blew into town in May on a small gust of publicity whipped up over his time at Osteria Francescana , the Modena workshop where Massimo Bottura reconfigures the touchstone flavors of the region in dishes with names like \"memories of a mortadella sandwich.\" Mr. Bottura's approach to menu writing seems to have rubbed off on Mr. Secchi more than his experimental urges did. At Rezd\u00f4ra, you are unlikely to catch the kitchen using any overtly modernist techniques, but you may well encounter \"cherry season in Vignola,\" a pleasant if somewhat too soupy plate of stracciatella with toasted almonds, almond milk and cherries both sweet and sour; or \"cow grazing in Emilia-Romagna,\" a sirloin basted with butter whose richness is modulated by a sauce of sweet red peppers; or \"Grandma walking through forest in Emilia,\" a transfixing plate of mushroom pur\u00e9e, slivered snap-pea pods and little hats of spinach pasta filled with braised leeks. If we are tracing influences, though, Mr. Secchi's cooking at Rezd\u00f4ra seems to have been molded at least as deeply by his time working at the pasta station of another restaurant in Modena, Hosteria Giusti . Laura Galli Morandi, Giusti's chef, steadfastly defends the style of the local nonna tradition that Mr. Secchi channels in his pasta tasting and other parts of his menu. Like a meal in Giusti's four-table dining room, one at Rezd\u00f4ra can and probably should start with prosciutto and other manifestations of salted pork draped over warm pillows of fried dough called gnocchi fritti. Before leaving Italy, Mr. Secchi also cooked at Antica Moka in Modena and All'Enoteca in the Piedmont; after coming back home to Dallas, where he grew up, he ran the kitchens of two restaurants his parents own there. Still, I suspect the Bottura connection is responsible for the speed with which the bar stools fill up when the restaurant opens at 5:30 each night, for the difficulty of reserving one of the other 48 seats, and for the way would-be customers collect in eddies outside the door to strategize. Not much about the interior is likely to lure crowds; with its brick walls, timbered ceiling and bare wood tables, it looks like any number of Manhattan restaurants that emulate the trattorias, enotecas and osterias of Italy. And of course, people who eat at Rezd\u00f4ra have a way of becoming repeat customers. They come back even though it is still a young restaurant and occasionally makes a young restaurant's mistakes. One night, the stewed cannellini beans placed alongside black sea bass and black garlic zabaglione were still crunchy; the rock shrimp served with strozzapreti could have been a little less tough and tasted a little shrimpier. And some of the original pastas aren't quite as stunning as the classics, but then every grandmother in Emilia-Romagna could have told you that. Mr. Secchi is still one of the most appealing new talents in years to enter the city's Italian restaurant scene, the kind of cook who can unite ordinary people who just like to eat pasta and the fanatics who collect menus from Osteria Francescana. (The date-stamped copy of the regional tasting menu that's given out at the end of the night, signed by Mr. Secchi and his kitchen crew, must be for this crowd.) He also has the good luck to come along when some of the figures who dominated New York's Italian landscape for the past two decades or so have either disappeared or gone into hibernation. There is one more workplace that I hope has left a mark on Mr. Secchi: his parents' restaurants in Texas, both of which are called Ferrari's Italian Villa & Chop House . The first has been in business since 1983, a life span that any restaurateur would envy. The odds are against Rezd\u00f4ra's being around 36 years from now, but Mr. Secchi and his business partner have made one move that tends to be associated with longevity in New York restaurants. They bought the building. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

The tuna tartares start to run together; we can't recall whether it's served in lettuce cups with threads of shiso at Perry St. or at JoJo . At some point it's hard to recall what makes the chicken breast inside a resoundingly crunchy Parmesan crust at Nougatine different from the Parmesan-crusted chicken at the Mark. With his partner, Phil Suarez, Mr. Vongerichten has founded scores of new restaurants around the world. Nearly 40 of them are still up and running, 15 in New York. Devising menus for each new place, he repeats himself occasionally, but more often he rearranges old patterns. Lime juice is traded for yuzu, cherry vinegar comes in for balsamic. Almost always, the result is a dish that is similar enough to his past work to be recognizably Vongerichtenesque but different enough to seem fresh. Maybe he can keep track of it in his head, but for the rest of us it would be really useful to have a family tree of every dish he ever invented, with its parentage and offspring. Something like 23andMe , it could tell you which strands of kitchen DNA are shared by which Vongerichten restaurants -- 23andV.

One is the Paris Caf\u00e9 , a casual, all-day proposition inside Eero Saarinen's T.W.A. terminal at Kennedy International Airport, now gloriously resurrected as the TWA Hotel. The second is a polished seafood house that sits out in the East River on the end of Pier 17, next to the wreck of the old Fulton Fish Market; it's called the Fulton . Because I've been to both so recently, I can report confidently that the Fulton slices deep-red strawberries over strawberry ice cream and a sorbet made from strawberries and red wine to make its strawberry sundae, while the one at the Paris Caf\u00e9 substitutes dried strawberries. That version isn't bad, but there is an undeniable difference between fresh summer berries and dehydrated ones, and that difference suggests the quality gap between the two restaurants. The best reasons to go to the Paris Caf\u00e9 are Saarinen's glass walls, gliding curves and suspended catwalk, although the dining areas are swell, too, smartly evoking Raymond Loewy's original design for the space, which looked like a coffee shop on the moon. The place has some likable pizzas and salads, and it vaults clear over the other restaurants at the airport. But the recipes seem designed not to push the kitchen too hard, the menu is even more Vongerichtenesque than usual, and any dishes involving fruits or vegetables will make you wonder whether the produce truck drove to La Guardia instead. The Fulton, though, is a grown-up production. Under the day-to-day command of Noah Poses, the executive chef, it is easily the best seafood restaurant to open in Manhattan since the Pool , and easier to afford. Yes, a handful of items on the menu have that glassy-eyed stare, but almost everything else comes through. To get to the Fulton, you have to walk almost all the way to the end of the pier, where some tall planters cordon off the Fulton's outdoor tables. All the tables, indoors and out, have a view of the Brooklyn Bridge, but the best backdrops are inside and upstairs, where you can see that you're surrounded by water. Mentioning the view as a selling point will make some New Yorkers cringe. But Pier 17's developer, clearly hoping to erase the stigma, has recruited David Chang, Andrew Carmellini and Mr. Vongerichten. Day trippers and tourists will love the Fulton, in any case, and they will be right. True, the outdoor patio feels like the beachside bar of some island resort, with soft-core club music playing and servers carrying too-small trays slinking around in long skirts. Once you get inside, though, the tension in the open kitchen lets you know this is, in fact, New York. Running a seafood house gives Mr. Vongerichten an opening to lead with one of his strong suits, raw fish. The sea trout tartare is stirred with raw oysters and horseradish, which creates the uncanny momentary illusion that you're eating beef. White ponzu, made from white soy sauce, is the centerpiece of a platter of iced sashimi. Local fluke, taking a bath in habanero vinaigrette, is topped with mint and Sichuan buttons; even if you know what's coming -- Sichuan buttons are the flower buds of the toothache plant, which when chewed, produce a numbing and cooling sensation -- the dish is a surprise. The Fulton's Manhattan clam chowder is spicy, thick with potatoes and a healthy portion of clams. It's the rare version that tastes as good as it sounds, although purists will deduct one point for the absence of oyster crackers. There's a very intriguing sesame-poppy crust on the soft-shell crabs; you have just enough time to register the seeds before a potent green salsa of coriander and jalape\u00f1o kicks in. Few chefs are as skilled at using acidity, heat and salt to bring definition to a dish. So it's a surprise to realize how generic the Fulton's fish stew is, or to wonder what the ingredient is that throws the red snapper ceviche in watermelon juice out of whack. A separate menu card lets you know that most of the seafood in the main courses can be ordered \"simply cooked.\" I was never curious enough to try it, being too distracted by the salmon in a cumin-coriander seed crust so fragrant it turns heads; the sea bass and carrots in a life-affirming pool of lemon-turmeric sauce; and the detailed-oriented fish and crisps, a brick of flounder kept at scalding temperature by a leakproof and supernaturally crunchy buckwheat batter. Served with mashed fresh peas, it could almost pass for English if it didn't come with saffron aioli. Most distracting of all is the whole black bass baked inside a fish-shaped pastry lavishly decorated with golden scales, fins, gills and other parts the bass itself won't be needing anymore. It takes a good 10 minutes to unveil it, fillet it and then plate it together with slices of crust, some tomato concass\u00e9 and a sauce choron, and I doubt many movies playing in theaters now can rival it for entertainment. Wonderful as it is to see one of the showpieces of pre-nouvelle cuisine given so much attention, you could ask whether whole fish en croute really makes sense after, say, kale salad. Mr. Vongerichten's technical approach may let him generate a menu full of smart, reliably pleasurable food, but it doesn't guarantee that it will all hang together. The pastry menu does, though, by sneakily staying true to classic American desserts. What's sold as Meyer lemon pudding turns out to be more like a lemon meringue tart with a quick, pulsing acidity; the apricot pie is more like a crisp, with oatmeal streusel on top; and the highlight of the strawberry sundae isn't the fresh fruit but the strawberry ice cream, its flavor straight out of the summertime ice cream shacks in a thousand vacation towns.

If Darryl and Melissa Burnette had been able to afford to rent a space bigger than 275 square feet for their restaurant, Belle Harlem , Mr. Burnette might do the cooking behind a wall instead of behind a counter. Ms. Burnette, his wife and business partner, might spend all night going in and out a swinging kitchen door instead of paying attention to the customers sitting at the 12 seats in the restaurant's single room. At this point, after three years in business, Belle Harlem might be run by employees, and the Burnettes might come in a few times a week to keep an eye on things. Instead they have a paid staff of one. His name is Alex Geudelekian. He was eating dinner there one night, noticed that the weeds were growing up around Mr. Burnette's ankles, asked if he needed help, and has been the sous-chef ever since. The smell of foie gras gravy with duck breast being seared on one of the three induction burners might not rush up to meet you when you step through the door, on the opposite side of Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard from Striver's Row. You might not hear the hiss of chicken being fried inside buttermilk batter before it is arranged between standing partitions of pizzelle and tied together by an amber river of truffled maple syrup warmed with jalape\u00f1os and bananas. If you didn't hear the low roar of a Searzall torch as it warms a plate and then melts and browns a patch of Cheddar, you might not know that you're about to be served Mr. Burnette's cheese-steak crostini. (These are small toasts stacked with seared filet and melted cheese, and in between are onions that have been caramelized until they're sweet enough to be a dessert topping. The Cheddar would cause every Philadelphian who lives within 10 blocks of East Passyunk Avenue to pick up the nearest blunt object, but it makes a certain amount of sense when you taste it.) Some of Belle Harlem's space limitations are, in fact, a little constricting. When the place is full, some customers have to ride sidesaddle, their knees angled away from the counter, because if they faced it head-on they'd cut off the narrow path to the restroom in the back. But 275 square feet are what the Burnettes have to work with, and they have made this shallow sliver into something rare not just in Harlem but in all Manhattan. One of the peculiarities of dining in the city, circa 2019, is that the more high-functioning a restaurant is, the less likely you are to encounter a proprietor. There are exceptions, of course, but often the most successful restaurateurs are very busy people, so they leave their dining rooms in the hands of professional managers. Proprietors aren't always as smooth as professionals, but they are as attuned to what goes on in their dining rooms as new parents are to the noises coming from a bassinet. I never quite felt as if I were attending a dinner party in the Burnettes' apartment, which is the feeling they say they're going for, but I always knew I was in a place that somebody cared about. Their original plan was to feed everyone the same meal -- a tasting menu. \"We found out pretty quickly Harlem wasn't ready,\" Mr. Burnette said in an interview. How quickly? \"We tried one night.\" Belle Harlem rolled out an \u00e0 la carte menu the next day. It stuck. The first half is given to smaller plates, although one of the hallmarks of the restaurant is that the Burnettes don't serve anything truly small. They want you to eat. Two people could get away with ordering one main course and two appetizers, though I'd urge anyone going to Belle Harlem not to overlook dessert. These introductory dishes are where Mr. Burnette takes casual American vernacular food like chicken and waffles out for a stroll. His fried chicken has a convoluted, frilly crust, with plenty of golden surface area for the jalape\u00f1o-banana syrup to get lost in. The pizzelles are a new idea of his, replacing the regular waffles he used to make, and they work best when he cooks them to a dark crisp. This is also where you'll find the cheese-steak crostini, as well as spring rolls stuffed with macaroni and cheese -- kid food in a fried shell, yes, but a bacon marmalade with fresh dill makes it unexpectedly complex, a chef's dish. The bottom of the menu is more substantial: The pan-seared, smoked pork tenderloin, for instance, is bigger than what usually crosses a 12-seat tasting counter. This month, Mr. Burnette is laying the barrels of pork over a cherry compote with basil leaves, with a few snap peas for added sweetness. He brings a keen sense of what to do with ingredients as they come into season to the vegetables he grows on the roof of the Burnettes' apartment building, a block away. The tiny yields of an urban garden wouldn't satisfy a larger restaurant, but they can shuffle right onto the menu at Belle Harlem, and shuffle off again when they're all gone. This month, there are thin bands of zucchini under the beef tenderloin, and young, soft favas around the lobster salad. There are more favas over pan-seared dorade and garden chives, with the almost transparently thin noodles tossed with butter and cream and tucked under the fish fillet. Mr. Burnette, who is black and who grew up in rural southwestern Virginia, has said he worked up the nerve to move north for culinary school after seeing the chef Marcus Samuelsson on television . (\"I thought, hell, if he could do it, I could do it, too.\") Sometimes today, in his restaurant less than a mile away from Mr. Samuelsson's Red Rooster Harlem , he reaches back to his childhood for ideas. A dessert in a glass called the Triflin' Ho-Ho is an acknowledged homage to Hostess cakes, although there is an English trifle in the mix, too, as well as a trace of Spice Market , where Mr. Burnette once worked. The chocolate in the broken shards of cake pulses, intriguingly, with Urfa pepper; its heat rubs up against the passion-fruit cream, brandied cherries and whipped cream that fill the glass. A year ago, Belle Harlem eliminated tips and raised prices. If you take that into account, check totals can still seem high, especially if you happen to be served pale, limp housemade potato chips or a $42 duck breast with a bitter arugula sauce and a poached pear that tastes like alcohol. The margins must be tight. At times you almost hear them squeak, as when Ms. Burnette anxiously reminds you that you were a few minutes late and suggests you order quickly so she can turn the seat in time for the next reservation. A professional manager might have brought a more soothing manner to the exchange. But a manager might not be as genuinely happy to see a party of three walk in without a reservation just when three seats had opened up, and might not smile as widely when told that the sparkling ros\u00e9 is fantastic with the lobster salad, and would she mind pouring another glass? No, she doesn't mind at all. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

One of several operations he is running in the new Times Square Edition hotel, it is clad in paneling on the walls and ceilings. Velvet curtains and banquettes are the slightly alarming color of a blue macaw's tail feathers. Wooden blinds are usually snapped shut against the strobes of 47th Street and Seventh Avenue. To get to your table, you must first pass between two identical Champagne trolleys. An iced reservoir in the center of each is loaded with about half a dozen bottles that range in price from a Blanquette de Limoux for $26 a glass to a 2006 brut from Dom P\u00e9rignon for $66 a glass. Before you sit down, you've already learned that wine is front and center, literally and figuratively; that it is more likely to come from classic, mannerly European estates than, say, Macedonian villages still using amphoras that Odysseus drank from; that the ideal customer is not likely to get up and walk out upon being offered a $66 aperitif; and that the restaurant expects to attract so many of these customers that a single Champagne trolley is not enough. Which is to say that Marriott International and the hotelier Ian Schrager installed 701West on the 11th floor of the Edition for people who still think a leisurely, three-course dinner with a few interesting bottles and some of the customary niceties is worth spending money on. It belongs to a species of restaurant that is no longer in great supply in Manhattan, let alone on the intersection where the green neon of the Olive Garden faces off across Seventh Avenue against the giant candy bars of Hershey's Chocolate World. It also marks Mr. Fraser's first arabesques on the stage of formal dining since Dovetail closed last year. These are early days for 701West, but so far I've found the cooking more original and appealing than Dovetail's in its final phase. As you know if you've tried the fried-cauliflower buns at Nix, or the ramen-style boiled eggs at the Loyal whose yolks are red with a film of jellied chile oil, Mr. Fraser has a playful, imaginative streak. He needs it at 701West, where there is no real theme beyond wine and style. But there is enough creativity across the menu, on which he collaborates with the chef de cuisine, Rob Lawson, and the pastry chef, S\u00e9bastien Rouxel, to make dinner the engaging, somewhat eccentric experience it is clearly meant to be. Before the first courses appear, for example, there may be a \"cauliflower mille-feuille,\" the raw vegetable shaved into white sheets that are softened by chilled mezcal cream and then topped with sturgeon caviar. It's enticingly off-kilter, and another frequent amuse manages to outdo it: a spoonful or so of white-asparagus foam above a warm custard of sunflower-seed butter, dense and nutty and sweet with a few drops of honey. This is luxury dining in its way, which is not the predictable way. The menu proposes three courses for $98, but a server informed me that \"we also have \u00e0 la carte, if that's more your rhythm for the evening.\" Frequently the surprises come in the form of an unexpected tweak dealt to a vegetable. Slowly cooked in beet juice, a whole beet takes on the glistening ruby intensity of raw bluefin tuna. There is an appetizer of actual bluefin as well, and it has the precise, Japanese-informed minimalism of a dish you'd get at Jean-Georges, with tiny spring peas and young turnip greens and an electrifying white cloud of grated horseradish. In a dish of fava agnolotti, the X factor is the bright, almost effervescent sparkle of vinegar-marinated tomatoes and their juices stirred into a Parmesan-rind broth. There is one mystifying appetizer in which the dueling tidal flavors of sea urchin and squid-ink risotto are allowed to cancel each other out. For the most part, though, the plates don't overreach, for all the inventiveness on display. Asparagus dipped in aioli is a good idea, of course, but what if the asparagus has been steamed inside a wrapper of thinly shaved cedar until it is nearly as smoky as country bacon? And what if the aioli is enhanced by truffles? It may sound overworked, but it is such a thrill that one of my guests asked for another plate before we could move on to the main courses, throwing the rhythm for the evening right out the window. The night will pause again if one of the main courses is the sweet potato, as everyone tries to figure out where it got its creaminess and savory depth. Even once you know it's been sealed up and baked inside a little coffin of sourdough that is streaked with green threads of wakame seaweed, you still can't quite believe that all this flavor has been achieved with an ordinary sweet potato. Some of the large pieces of fish and meat are showstoppers on their own, like the lobster that rests for four days in aged-beef fat before being broiled and set over some jammy ratatouille. When they are not, something else on the plate usually is. The long slab of roasted duck breast dredged in powdered herbes de Provence would keep my attention even without its sidekick, a curiously likable risotto made from pine nuts. In the case of lamb, the firecracker is a cocotte of fresh, creamy cranberry beans. Mr. Rouxel, recently of Upland and the Clocktower, brings a lighter-than-air quality to the desserts. Hovering over a crunchy buckwheat pastry crust is a wavy sea of pastry cream infused with parsnips. It's earthy and ethereal at the same time. He even knows what to do with white chocolate, aerating it into a mousse to frost an English-pea sponge cake, and giving it a piercing sour-cherry sorbet as a foil. All seven captains working at 701West are sommeliers, listed by name on the menu; they are assisted by back servers who are sommeliers in training. This is one of those innovations in service that seems obvious now that somebody's actually doing it. The meal can become an evening-long conversation about wine; the sommeliers even invite you to play the wine-insiders' game of guessing the identity of a mystery pour in a black glass. It is slightly incredible that a restaurant that tries so hard to give wine equal status with the cooking does not have more bottles for under $80. That said, the ones it does have tend to be very good and fairly priced. Besides 701West, Mr. Fraser is in charge of the deep-dish focaccia, carrot Bolognese and \"billboard burger\" at the Terrace and Outdoor Gardens, which is open all day on the ninth floor. He also oversees the dinner-theater menus at the Paradise Club on the seventh floor, which is currently staging \"The Devouring,\" a neo-Burlesque extravaganza (juggling, sword swallowing, aerial acrobatics) purportedly inspired by William Blake. This was no doubt the destination of the stilt walker I nearly ran into in the lobby one night. Dressed in scarlet from head to heel, she got along faster on her stilts than I do on my own legs. She was the first thing I've seen in years that gave me hope for the future of Times Square. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

Realizing that this was somewhat ambiguous, especially applied to a dish as laden with stuff as the brew of lambs' snouts, ears, tongues, cheeks and eyeballs known in Turkey as kelle paca, I tried again. \"Is it very filling, I mean?\" My concern was a familiar one, to me at least. I was in Queens, at a new Turkish restaurant in Astoria called Lokanta , and the menu was so appealing that I wanted to try it all. Already I was set on a few bourekas, some labneh, the fava dip and some form of braised lamb over eggplant. I'd spotted another three or four dishes that I was probably going to tack on at the end of my order, as if by afterthought. I suspected that I could add a small bowl of kelle paca and still eat everything else. But a big bowl, one so thick with bits formerly affixed to a sheep's skull that a spoon would stand up in it, might tip the scale. The server pondered this for a while until a wiry man got up from his marble-topped table in the corner and conferred with her. Wearing baggy jeans, a white T-shirt and a baseball cap that kept his zinc-colored ponytail in place, he looked like a contractor, maybe a painter who'd come by to touch up the moldings and had been invited to stay for a Turkish coffee. Then he spoke to us about the sheep's head soup. \"I am a genius,\" he began. \"And even I don't know how to answer this question. I think that the question must be wrong.\" As those who chase the scent of lamb and charred eggplant around the city have probably guessed, this was no contractor. This was Orhan Yegen, the Turkish-born chef and restaurateur who has opened close to 20 Turkish restaurants over the past two decades or so while keeping up a running monologue that made him a favorite of food writers . In 2004, Mr. Yegen opened Sip Sak in Turtle Bay, then proceeded to surprise those who had charted his career by embarking on a long, stable period . All was quiet, relatively speaking, until April, when Lokanta arrived in Astoria to supplement the Greek and Cypriot menus along its stretch of Broadway, and Mr. Yegen arrived to tell customers that their questions were wrong. The kelle paca colloquy ended when I agreed to order it. After hours on the stove, the meat on the head had fallen away into about eight different textures, from frilly to ropy to collagenously chewy to tender and lean. All of this suspended in a slippery, almost sticky broth the color of cappuccino. And no, it was not too filling. Soups, braises, stews and other recipes requiring plenty of time and even more olive oil are the basis of Mr. Yegen's reputation. They set his menus apart from those at other Turkish restaurants around town, which tend to revolve around the grill. Lokanta makes very fine kofte, but for a full medley of minced and skewered meats, you are better off under the swaying chandeliers of Taci's Beyti on Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn. Lokanta will grill or roast a whole fish, but it will not be all that different from what might be served in Brooklyn at Liman , where your bass will be filleted within view of the fishing boats and swans of Sheepshead Bay. Diners in Lokanta's custody have signed on for a more nuanced view of the Turkish kitchen. Take, for instance, the shadings that lamb takes on. In hunkar begendi, chunks of it are stewed in tomatoes and peppers and ladled over an eggplant mash beaten to a memorable richness with cheese and milk. Ali nazik is, in schematic form, the same thing, built on the same foundation of milky eggplant, but in Lokanta's version the lamb is ground and simmered with onions and red and green peppers; somehow it achieves a rich, unctuous consistency that is amplified by the eggplant and the scoop of strained yogurt dropped on top. Lokanta's \"roasted lamb and rice\" is in the pilaf family, which means that the rice is not just a side dish but the heart of the recipe, baked until alluringly sweet with currants, allspice and cinnamon, then sprinkled with fresh dill at the last minute. The lamb's job is to be obligingly tender, and it succeeds, one reason the dish is requested by so many tables. To fend off boredom, I imagine, Mr. Yegen fills his manti with both lamb and beef. Each little dumpling is rolled by fingertip and is roughly the size of one. The meat has been seasoned just forcefully enough that it will announce itself, politely but clearly, as it breaks through the dough. It would be possible to sit down in front of a bowl of these, spooning them up with their warm yogurt and chile oil and dried mint, and call for another bowl a minute later. Of course, the meal should begin with strips of nigella-dotted Turkish bread and a spread or two -- maybe memorably creamy pur\u00e9e of dried favas; or the roughly mashed eggplant, smoky without a trace of bitterness; and one of the strained-yogurt dips, either the tangy cacik, laced with minced cucumbers, or the labneh, as firm as a new mattress. Either will prove useful as the meal goes on. So will a simple salad, especially the one with white beans and purple onions. The tightly rolled, golden bourekas are like skinny Turkish spring rolls filled with dill and melting feta. Cold poached leeks, a frequent special, are more appealing than the cold poached artichokes that have a permanent spot on the menu. If Mr. Yegen tells you that the grilled octopus is the best in the city, keep in mind that he rarely seems to leave his own restaurant. It's quite good, though, with a fugitive sweetness that may be supplied by the tomatoes and purple onions. Desserts run toward milky white puddings, nice if you are looking for a mild sedative. The baklava, imported from Turkey, is a treat for those of us who like pistachios and think sugar syrup makes a better baklava sweetener than honey. The unlikely champion, though, is the butternut squash that has been languorously baked in its own juices with nothing but sugar. The technique is one of those small tricks that helps Mr. Yegen's cooking stand out, like the perfume of lemon peel in the Turkish lemonade. Lokanta has no liquor license yet. Some customers smuggle wine through the door and keep the bottles on their tables, which are topped with radiant white marble from Turkey and surrounded by classic bentwood cafe chairs. But it is hard not to want the lemonade, which is cold and just tart enough and not very filling at all. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

TAK Room is so determined to be \"timeless,\" as Mr. Keller has often called it, that it seems clueless. TAK Room opened in March, one of 11 restaurants inside the 720,000-square-foot mall at 20 Hudson Yards. Parts of Hudson Yards are still under construction, but enough has been finished for most New Yorkers to figure out that this fistful of glass needles stabbed into the West Side wasn't built for them. Just as the helipad the city offered to build for Amazon crystallized anger about the cruddy state of our subways, the glittering new home on 10th Avenue for global luxury brands, investment funds, law firms, business travelers and hunters of seven- or eight-figure apartments spurred a lot of New Yorkers to ask, What's in it for us? Mr. Keller's answer is a restaurant that looks and acts like a millionaire's hangout in an old New Yorker cartoon. It charges like one, too, with adjustments for inflation. An eggplant Parmesan is the least expensive main course, at $30, followed by the New Zealand salmon for $42. After that, please turn off all electronic devices and place your tray tables in the upright, locked position, because we are going up to $66 and $75 before reaching a cruising altitude of $85. Look down there -- don't the people look just like ants? TAK Room's timing is off in other ways, too. Hudson Yards has stirred up New Yorkers' latent resentment of chain stores from beyond the Hudson, and what does Mr. Keller offer them but a clone of his restaurant in Florida, the Surf Club ? The name has been changed, but the menus are nearly identical; they glorify the strait-laced, spice-free food that rich white Americans used to feed on when nobody was shaming them into being adventurous. It is the food of \"21,\" of three-martini lunches, steakhouses and country clubs: prime rib and Dover sole, iceberg lettuce and oysters Rockefeller. Of course, being a Thomas Keller production, TAK Room serves the most refined, meticulous country club food you've ever seen. Most of it is very good, and a few things are so inexplicably delicious that you have the sensation of slipping the knots of gravity and floating an inch or so above your seat. The entrance is on the fifth floor, just past Neiman Marcus. But the action is on the sixth floor, up a Deco-cubist staircase so grand that you may feel a little underdressed unless you have Carole Lombard on one arm. (There is no dress code.) At the top, you find yourself in a lounge where a pianist and upright bassist glide through satiny jazz standards. Bartenders whip up streamlined, uncomplicated drinks that are either genuine classics, like the Pendennis Club, or modern drinks built along classic proportions, like the Tritter rickey, a tall, fizzy gin number that shimmies with absinthe. Around sunset, when pink light trickles through the western windows, it has to be the most pleasant room within a mile for fighting vainly the old ennui . They let people eat in this room, too, and it is tempting. But there is more to see, room after room, all laid out by the London interior-design firm David Collins Studio. There are leather banquettes deep enough to lose a small child in. Facing them are mohair-velvet chairs that swivel so you can quietly surveil the room without craning your neck. Each table gets a white linen cloth and a flickering oil lamp behind a white porcelain shade. The other colors are black walnut, midnight blue and law-firm green. At some point a captain in a crisply tailored suit will deposit the wine list. It mostly avoids the latest fashions, like a croquet party on Nantucket. Later there will be a preamble to the menu. Under the day-to-day care of Jarrod Huth, TAK Room's chef de cuisine, it has a continental theme and an \u00e0 la carte format. Highlights will be pointed out, and the prime rib will certainly be mentioned, as will the restored 1930s silver trolley on which it is ferried from table to table. Here comes a French onion dip surrounded by newly fried potato chips that are dark without a hint of charring. This is TAK Room in one extremely crunchy, lusciously creamy bite: an hors d'oeuvre from the age of Naugahyde and polyester, transformed into something so good and pure it's beyond reproach. The Parker House rolls are gravity-defying orbs served with soft cultured butter that, in the evening's best magic trick, rises from a custom-made dish in six identical ridged curls , like shrimp performing a Busby Berkeley routine. Bespoke flourishes like that are a TAK Room hallmark; see also the oyster crackers, like down pillows shrunk to the size of Chiclets, served with the silk-smooth New England clam chowder that is one of the most likable appetizers and, at $16, the best value. Another hallmark, though, is unevenness. Avocado Louie with a small bouquet of other vegetables is thrillingly right, thanks to a Thousand Island dressing that crackles with energy; the Caesar salad, made while you watch, has almost no personality. Grated Parmesan and anchovies vanish into it without a trace, along with dull croutons that could take some pointers from the oyster crackers. Something called \"warm soft boiled egg\" is a quietly joyous celebration of luxurious flavors and textures, the yolk running like lava over a buckwheat blin and a heap of warm osetra caviar in cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. (Yes, warm. It's wonderful.) And the chilled prawn cocktail is going to be my platonic ideal of the dish from now on. But the crab cake had very little crab flavor, on two different nights, although it contained almost nothing else. Lobster thermidor (now there's a name I've not heard in a long, long time) is so tender, its sauce so fluffy and rich, that eating it becomes an intimate act. Dover sole meuni\u00e8re, though, has neither the crisped skin nor the juicy flesh that can make this fish so alluring. Yes, life cannot be one giant plate of dancing butter-shrimp. Still, the gap between great and non-great items -- nothing comes close to bad -- is a bit too wide and comes into view a bit too often. Regulars will learn to work the menu the way golfers learn their way around the eighth hole at Pebble Beach. Some will love the prime rib, which could not be any more moist without breaking several laws of chemistry. Others will wish that it had more concentrated beef flavor and that the flaps and handles had not been trimmed off, perhaps in pursuit of some Kellerian quest for bovine symmetry. A large number will settle on the roast chicken for two. The meat is juicy but not gushy, the flavor full but not salty, the jus dark but not over-reduced. After the chicken, the pastry chef, Alex McClenaghan, can offer a highly refined coconut cake or an urbane lemon meringue tart, but you'd almost have to be insane not to get the chocolate cake. Certainly a close relative of devil's food cake, his version weaves dark-chocolate cremeux between its many, many layers, all of them wrapped in a dark-chocolate frosting. And there will be regulars, because the rewards of TAK Room, if you can find them and pay for them, are as intense as the chocolate in that cake. The core audience may turn out to be travelers on loan from the Surf Club and Mr. Keller's California strongholds, or they may just be people who like the feeling of crashing the country club. Anti-plutocrat fevers come and go, but the trappings of American aristocracy are always in style somewhere.

Banh beo, a species of small rice cake, are a favorite afternoon snack in the central Vietnamese city of Hue. Each one is steamed in a ceramic dish just big enough to hold a few spare coins. Faced with a platter of banh beo, you realize fairly quickly that you have essentially two choices: You can use a spoon, or hold the dish to your mouth and tip it up while throwing your head back, as if doing a Jell-O shot. If you go the Jell-O shot route, it may help to bring a pair of chopsticks or a fingertip into play at the last minute to encourage the banh beo to leave the nest. You have now transferred to your mouth a warm divot of steamed rice and tapioca flours that has a consistency like panna cotta's and a negligible flavor on its own. All the action is in the toppings. At Van Da, these include a spoonful of chopped scallions and the green oil in which they were sizzled, red rings of fresh Thai chile, some fish sauce, rehydrated dried shrimp and a flap of fried tofu skin, standing in for the pork rinds a banh beo vendor in Hue would use. The divot of rice cake is still warm, which helps the aromas drive their way into your head. It's over in a minute. If you're lucky, there will be another banh beo on the table so you can start over. Van Da joined the East Village's growing hub of interesting Vietnamese restaurants three months ago. Like Hanoi House , Madame Vo and Madame Vo BBQ , it is semitraditional and semimodern. Those two strains are embodied at Van Da by, respectively, Yen Ngo and Hannah Wong. Ms. Ngo, who owns the place, was raised in Dalat, Vietnam, and while she has worked in restaurants and catering in New York City for years, she has never had a chance before to show off the food of her childhood, like the banh beo steamed by her mother, who had grown up in Hue. Ms. Wong is the chef. Though she has cooked at Gramercy Tavern and Battersby , her background in the food of Vietnam before Van Da was more or less confined to the roughly two weeks she spent traveling there while living in Hong Kong on a Fulbright grant a decade ago. Nevertheless, she has put together a trenchant, concise and pleasure-focused menu of Vietnamese dishes. Some she learned directly from her boss, and on those recipes she was apparently discouraged from drawing outside the lines. Others are more freely interpreted. It's a credit to Ms. Wong's sensitivity that if you don't already know the original templates, it can be hard to tell where they end and her imagination begins. Banh beo and the other snacks from Hue that Ms. Ngo taught Ms. Wong get their own berth on the menu. As you'd imagine, they tend to be very good. Banh it ram are chewy, fried balls of mochi, filled with a coconut-soaked mash of mung beans and shallots. Banh khot are little rice-flour pancakes molded into edible cups about the size of a Ritz cracker. In Vietnam, the cups would be filled with shrimp. Ms. Wong instead spoons saut\u00e9ed mushrooms into hers, along with a crisscrossing of fresh herbs and a spill of coconut cream. Ms. Wong makes an effort to bring out regional differences in Vietnamese cuisine by devoting sections of the menu to Saigon and Hanoi, hundreds of miles apart, as well as Hue, somewhere in the middle. She doesn't have quite enough dishes from any one place to paint a full picture, but the project is intriguing. Like other New York chefs, she has been caught in the tractor beam of cha ca la Vong , the turmeric-and dill-scented fish dish that is a specialty of a 100-year-old Hanoi restaurant of the same name. Her version, though, supplies less dill, less sauce and less satisfaction than some others. Her two improvisations on the theme of Hanoi's best-known contribution to gastronomy, pho, are more effective. One gives you the soup without the noodles; floating in a rich and cloudy broth are ghostly white, billowing won tons that contain chopped beef fillet freely seasoned with black pepper. The other dish is, humbly enough, a plate of soupless pho noodles stir-fried with springy mushrooms, bitter greens and chopped scallions. Its simplicity makes the impact of the dish hard to explain until you learn that it has been showered with Maggi Seasoning , a soylike sauce that is the invisible secret of many Vietnamese dishes. Nodding toward Saigon, Ms. Wong makes a rendition of shaking beef by stir-frying tender and chewy marinated hanger steak with potatoes and then throwing a fistful of watercress at it. If you think that sounds like a French bistro plate, then you are starting to understand how her mind works. Ms. Wong cooks skillfully, with an appreciation for nuance, and she doesn't abuse her freedom by innovating pointlessly. It's possible, though, that she could stand to be less shy with chiles and herbs. The table salad of greenery to be wrapped around grilled shrimp offers no herbs other than mint and basil, and you'll run out of lettuce before the fourth shrimp has been dressed. The green papaya salad is a little too innocuous, and while her version of the street snack of grilled corn in fish sauce is a real success, fresh chiles would have more impact than the chile threads Ms. Wong balances on top. (Incidentally, the kitchen at Van Da makes a fine hot sauce that is like a milder and less acidic Sriracha, but servers never seem to remember to mention it until the end of the meal.) There are just three desserts. By the time you order, one or two may have been 86ed. With luck, though, the che will have survived. In Vietnam, che is thought of as a drink even though it can take the form of a pudding, as it does here, where warm pearls and threads of tapioca are cooked in coconut milk with cubes of soft taro. It is just sweet enough to qualify as a dessert. A black dust darkens the surface: black-sesame brittle, ground to powder. Even a single dessert qualifies as an impressive feat inside Van Da's tight quarters. Through the miracle of careful design, the space almost never feels cramped, but this is still an intimate restaurant. In the basement is a small seating area laid out as efficiently as the cockpit of a fighter jet; above it, at the top of a staircase, is an even smaller seating area sharing a room with a window-facing dining counter, the kitchen and a bar. The cocktails that roll off that bar, like the gin-and-celery duet called the White Tiger, are much more sharply drawn than the drinks at restaurants with twice the space and four times the budget.

No doubt it went through the same birth pangs as all the others. As far as I can tell, though, it simply materialized one morning this March at 70 Pine Street, and was open for business that afternoon by the time the financial district's elevators began disgorging traders, bankers and analysts in search of 5-o'clock refreshment. One reason it seems to have crept up on the city is that it's a large, well-capitalized, big-time restaurant of the kind that only established groups seem able to get off the ground these days. Yet Crown Shy doesn't come from Danny Meyer, Andrew Carmellini or any of the other usual suspects. Its two main players were recruited after talks among April Bloomfield, Ken Friedman and the building's developer fell apart in 2016, before accusations of sexual harassment engulfed Mr. Friedman. Crown Shy's chef, James Kent, used to run the kitchen at the NoMad , and his partner, Jeff Katz, is the managing partner at Del Posto . Neither exactly fell off the turnip truck last week. As a team, though, they're unproven, and as they went through construction and hiring, the drumbeat of publicity was more muted than it might have been if marquee names had led the project. Then there is Crown Shy's location, a sprawling, soaring, street-level space that, as far as anyone recalls, has never held a restaurant before. Many New Yorkers have seen the 1932 building's distinctive, hulking, pyramidal silhouette on the skyline, but until recently, when the offices on its 67 stories were repurposed as expensive apartments and hotel rooms, not many had encountered the frenzied exuberance of the lobby, which makes use of polished marble in at least five contrasting colors. It looks like something Bernini would have designed if he'd lived to see the Jazz Age. Depending on which entrance you use -- the revolving doors are crowned with aluminum reliefs of Art Deco flowers being pollinated by elongated stylized butterflies -- you may want to allow an extra five or 10 minutes to take it all in before you eat. Above all, it's the extent to which Crown Shy already has its act together that makes you ask: Where did this place come from? The whole operation radiates confidence from start to finish. The finish brings real desserts from a real pastry chef, Renata Ameni. She comes to Crown Shy fresh from Manresa, in Los Gatos, Calif ., and before that, she put in half a decade at Eleven Madison Park . Her desserts at Crown Shy look uncomplicated, and you don't realize how intelligently they've been put together until you start to eat one. There's a milky-white yogurt cheesecake under tender spring strawberries, with smooth strawberry sorbet in the center and a pistachio crumble sprinkled over that. Her chocolate tart gives her a chance to show off about half a dozen different effects she can work with chocolate, starting with a crunchy, crumbly, almost salty chocolate crust, moving on to a soft, souffl\u00e9-like filling and ending with curls of dark chocolate. Ms. Ameni's side of the kitchen is also responsible for the savory churros filled with Gruy\u00e8re sauce -- the menu calls them fritters, they taste like goug\u00e8res and the texture is something else entirely. Also her work: the miniature loaf of pull-apart bread that appears after you order. With dried olives on top and olive tapenade between every skinny slice, it is one of the most memorable parts of the meal. Even the obligatory scoops of ice cream that restaurants seem required to offer aren't allowed to leave her pastry station until they've been turned into a composed dessert, and not some kind of slapdash sundae , either. Satsuma ice cream gets to wear a toasted turban of marshmallowy meringue and some cracked honeycomb candy on the side. The effect is witty and delicious, progressing from purely sweet to bittersweet to tart and bittersweet. Mr. Kent's savory dishes pursue the same strategy. This is to say, they regularly over-deliver, starting with the iced Wellfleet oysters dressed with cucumber jelly, diced cucumbers, grains of jalape\u00f1o and microleaves of purple shiso. An almost absurdly creamy pur\u00e9e of white bean hummus under a fiery red slick of melted 'nduja is probably meant to be shared, but as soon as I'd tasted it I came up with other ideas, as my dinner guests will testify. Two tartares show Mr. Kent's talent for carrying bright new ideas with him into well-traveled territory. In the first, he laces hand-chopped raw beef with toasted walnuts and earthy rye croutons; in the other, chopped raw snapper is sprinkled with individual juice-filled vesicles of grapefruit, lime, lemon and orange that pop between your teeth, a kind of instant, interactive ceviche. Maybe one or two ideas should have been left by the side of the road. The chicken liver rag\u00f9 tossed with housemade cavatelli doesn't need to be so sweet with sherry; a rough pesto is a fine use for fresh chickpeas, but isn't there a better partner for it than shaved jicama? All is forgiven when Mr. Kent turns a mainstay like grilled chicken into a main course as exciting as the one at Crown Shy, which keeps the sunshine brightness of its citrus marinade, and is served with a pur\u00e9e-slash-hot sauce of fermented hot and sweet peppers. The vivid orange of that hot sauce almost matches the marble in the lobby. But Crown Shy's two big dining rooms and extended bar are a little more restrained, dominated by cream tones, blond wood tables, and chairs with saddle-brown leather seats and backs. The only echoes of grandeur are the enormous windows and the ceiling high up overhead. The wine list is one to get lost in. Finance wizards with bonuses to expunge can certainly do that, but it's great to see lots of bottles under $100 on almost every page. Anyone who knows what some of these wines cost wholesale will be able to locate any number of good deals, but even the unschooled will notice the value regions. They jump off the page: Portugal, Greece and New Zealand, for instance, along with vast stretches of Germany and pockets of Spain, France and Italy. With so many strengths, Crown Shy must have at least one thing wrong with it. And yes, it does. Obviously that name is ridiculous. Knowing that it refers to a tendency of very tall trees not to let their upper stories grow into their neighbors' branches doesn't help, either. But we should probably get used to it, because we're going to be hearing more about this restaurant. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

The sheer number of restaurants in the city -- about 27,000, according to the health inspectors -- makes the argument absurd. How many of them are slipping? All of them? Just the first 20,000 or so? In reality, people who gripe about the state of New York restaurants are usually talking about a sliver of a slice of a fraction, probably around 50 places whose names are in steady circulation, with the newest weighing most heavily in the results. The number of really good ones is higher than anyone can count. Places that other cities would brag about get lost in the crowd here. The chef G\u00fcnther Seeger, for instance, was a national star when he cooked in Atlanta. The tasting-menu restaurant he opened in the West Village three years ago should have been a major destination, especially after he dropped the prices. Mr. Seeger can make ingredients bend to his will almost without touching them. His cooking outshone that of some of the city's more famous chefs, who whip their ingredients harder with far less payoff. Yet he struggled to put G\u00fcnther Seeger NY on the map. I reviewed it, but some other critics didn't, and by the time it closed, last month, Chris Crowley of Grub Street wrote , \"it wasn't a restaurant you heard a lot of food geeks talk about.\" Mr. Seeger complained to one acquaintance that he couldn't even get on a list of New York's 100 best restaurants. Of course, good restaurants fail everywhere, but it's hard to imagine Mr. Seeger vanishing into the crowd in San Francisco, Chicago or Los Angeles. Considered and rejected, maybe. But overlooked? Not likely. I'm not sure that any words of mine could have persuaded the city to cuddle up to Mr. Seeger, who isn't particularly cuddly. But I wish I'd found ways to remind New Yorkers that his breathtakingly pure cooking was there to be enjoyed while that was still true. Which brings us, by a circuitous and not particularly well-paved route, to Anthony Mangieri of Una Pizza Napoletana . Using naturally leavened dough and a short shopping list of ingredients, Mr. Mangieri makes what is unmistakably the finest sit-down pizza in the five boroughs. (I doubt he has any rivals in the stand-up joints, either, but slice pizza is a different game.) Two years ago, I posited that Razza, a pizzeria in Jersey City, made \"the best pizza in New York.\" I don't regret writing that, but I would like to point out that Mr. Mangieri was not cooking in the city at the time and that Razza's chef, Dan Richer, has said that he began taking pizza seriously only after he met Mr. Mangieri. Una Pizza Napoletana saw a rush of curious pie-eaters after it opened on Orchard Street a little more than a year ago. But the last few times I've gone, there were too many unclaimed chairs and bar stools. When Anthony Mangieri is making pizza, the right number of empty seats is zero, as any New Yorker who waited in line at the old Una Pizza Napoletana, in the East Village from 2004 to 2009, could tell you. Press interest in the new place has died down, too. So when I heard a rumor that Mr. Mangieri was thinking of leaving the city and taking his pizza with him, I was unnerved, to put it mildly. Asked about it, he told me he was considering it but hadn't made up his mind. Mr. Mangieri has left New York before, and I didn't like it then, either. This time, I wasn't going to let him get away without a fight. It is true that my review of Una Pizza Napoletana last year was decidedly mixed. It is also true, though, that almost every criticism I made has been addressed. It has gone from one of the most confounding pizzerias in the city to one of the most enjoyable. The problem with Una Pizza a year ago was that it was trying to be two things at once. It was, of course, a Neapolitan pizzeria, serving classic, unadorned pies baked for about two minutes inside a wood-burning oven shaped like an igloo. But it was also a cutting-edge Lower East Side experiment. At the instigation of Mr. Mangieri's partners, the chefs Fabian von Hauske Valtierra and Jeremiah Stone, the kitchen brought forth appetizers that had rarely if ever been asked to live under one roof with a pizza. There was a jellylike mass of raw lobster inside a ring of chickpeas, and a rust-colored puddle of 'nduja under raw turnips and nasturtium leaves. The wine list was virtually a treatise on natural wines, a long document full of the names of eccentric producers and obscure European villages. In another restaurant, all this would have been the departure point for some adventurous evenings. But in a pizzeria it led to some peculiar pairings, made the check a bit higher than you wanted and resulted in long waits before you were finally allowed to eat the delicious pizza you'd come for. Over the past year, Mr. von Hauske and Mr. Stone have stepped aside, letting Mr. Mangieri call the shots. The wines on offer now number about 15. They are still a likably eccentric lot, but picking one doesn't feel like studying for a master sommelier exam. The appetizers are simpler and less expensive: a plate of marinated white anchovies, a dish of warm Italian olives or a bowl of Little Gem lettuce with sunflower seeds in a Caesarish dressing. I do miss the tiramis\u00f9 from the opening menu, but the new cannoli filled with ricotta -- a blend of domestic cow's milk and Italian sheep's milk -- are nearly as good. It's common for a new restaurant to trim its sails, but this one has trimmed its prices, too. In the beginning the five regular pizzas were all $25; now they range from $19 to $25, and the two extra-complicated Friday and Saturday pizzas are priced at $26. I liked Mr. Mangieri's pies in the East Village, I liked them more when he came back to town, and it's possible, just possible, that they've improved over the past year. He is, like Mr. Seeger, a minimalist. He lets you notice each ingredient: the little ping of sourness in the Campanian buffalo mozzarella, for instance. Or the unruly, windswept-hillside aroma of dried Sicilian oregano. The precise crunch of each unrefined Trapani sea-salt crystal waiting to dissolve. The crust is so tender it barely fights fork, knife or teeth. Some diners will wish it put up more crackly resistance. You inhale it at least as much as you eat it. When you have finished, some of the most popular pizzas in town will seem tough, leathery, overworked. Even if this is not the style you crave, you'll know that it's the work of a baker who has spent years listening to the dough. There is a place for people who are as obsessed with pizza as Mr. Mangieri, and the place is New York City.

By the time people reach Kawi they tend to look rattled; New Yorkers who will easily weave their way around broken sidewalks, potholes, garbage piles and al fresco rat conventions come undone when faced with the interior of a shopping mall. Kawi, now two months old, can be disorienting in its own way, but at least you can have a seat and a drink while you get your bearings. Space there is used, or not used, the way it is in Las Vegas. There's a very long bar behind a line of black, geometric bar stools receding toward the vanishing point; low lounge tables; taller, square wood tables; round wood tables; black-leather booths; red-leather booths; red-leather banquettes; and a row of chairs facing a kitchen counter. Between all this furniture are aisles wide enough for a Zamboni. All those seats have backs, too. Kawi is loaded with the comforts and accommodations that critics, including me, were begging Mr. Chang to pay more attention to as recently as the opening of Nishi three years ago. Has anybody complained before that a David Chang restaurant was too quiet? They're saying it about Kawi. If there is anybody left who still thinks of Mr. Chang as a downtown punk, Kawi will clear up that misconception. The early Momofuku restaurants were skateboards; Kawi is a minivan with sliding doors, armrests, cupholders and Don Henley on the stereo. The ride may not be as fast, but it's a lot smoother. Kawi is also the first Momofuku restaurant in New York to address Korean cuisine head on and at length. Majordomo , which opened in Los Angeles last year, is at least half Korean, but the menu is loaded up with other stuff, a lot of which is big and showy and seemingly designed to dazzle the high rollers. It can be hard to remember you're eating galbi-jjim after a server buries it beneath a tableside avalanche of shaved raclette. Eunjo Park, Kawi's executive chef, avoids this type of distraction. This is lucky, because she makes food that you want to concentrate on. Before joining the Momofuku stable, she worked in the formal and highly fastidious kitchens of Daniel , Le Bec-Fin and Per Se . She later returned to South Korea, where she had lived until she was 12, for advanced studies at the Seoul restaurant Gaon and at the kitchen of the Chunjinam hermitage, presided over by Jeong Kwan , certainly the most celebrated cooking Zen nun in her country. A strong interest in tradition marks Ms. Park's food at Kawi. Her dishes are set apart from versions you may have had before by the exactitude of the technique and the quality of the ingredients. One section of her menu is turned over to kimbap, those wide, nori-wrapped sushi rolls often spotted at salad bars, languishing under plastic wrap. Most kimbap is designed to be portable, filling and inexpensive. Ms. Park's kimbap, on the other hand, is built for pleasure. She has a pickled vegetable kimbap on the lunch menu that is truly exciting; you are meant to dip it in a dark liquid that tastes a bit like soy sauce but is made with beets. The dinner menu brings kimbap filled with chives, pickled daikon, citrus jelly and a buttery pink vein of foie gras terrine. Has this really never been done before, you wonder as you eat it, and if not, why not? Among the other gussied-up raw fish that you expect in Momofukuland, like a refreshing if somewhat staid madai tartare, are some dime-size clams in chile sauce and an elegant, inspired interpretation of gejang. Blue crab legs and claw are cracked and given a three-day soak in soy sauce, among other things, which gives them an impressive amount of flavor. Then, in case you haven't noticed that you're dealing with a real chef, Ms. Park stirs the crab's roe with creamy rice and spoons this Korean risotto into the open belly of the shell. At moments like this, or in the hwedupbap filled with raw fish as strikingly good as any you'll find in a $200 omakase, or in the doenjang jjigae, a potful of braised fermented bean paste with pork belly that appears on the menu as \"yesterday's stinky soybean stew\" and manages to be homespun and polished at the same time, it's possible to see Kawi as Ms. Park's response to Atomix . It's as if she had looked at Junghyun Park's dazzlingly complex compositions at his year-old modern Korean restaurant and decided that she could cook in a style that was every bit as modern and painstaking, but that instead of turning traditional dishes into tasting-menu food she would keep the old forms and innovate inside them. With her tidy, refined, French-influenced neo-traditionalism, Ms. Park could become something like the Alain Ducasse of Korean cooking. It's not obvious, though, that Kawi needs an Alain Ducasse. Certain appetizers seem to belong on another planet, more beautiful and gentle than ours, such as the soft tofu with soy syrup that, sitting under a shattering thin crust of caramelized sugar, is like a savory cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e by way of Seoul. And there are others, such as the sticks of fried cod that a server pointlessly snips in half with scissors and then spritzes with atomized yuzu juice, that are right at home at Hudson Yards. The presentation seemed forced. That could also describe the boiled chicken dish, one of the menu's showiest items and, at $64, one of its most expensive. The whole bird is steamed, then the breast is sliced and served plain while the dark meat is fried and coated with spices. Neither is spectacular on its own, and the combination is bizarre. More successful versions of elaborate, oversize, multicomponent dishes are proven moneymakers elsewhere in the Momofuku republic. But arm-waving platters like that seem out of place at Kawi, which is the least Momofukian of the Momofukus. The most uncharacteristic thing of all is that the dining room has never been operating at anything close to capacity, at least when I've been there. Maybe tables are being kept off the reservation books to give the cooks time to learn where the spice cabinet is. Or maybe the fans who are so devoted to Mr. Chang's downtown spots are still trying to figure out the escalators.

The condoms became the subject of a series of advertisements on which the production company worked; in one of them, called \"Acts of Love,\" dancers in London re-enact, with surprising grace and dignity, the mating rituals of blue-footed boobies, fiddler crabs and other animals. Well, kids, when two companies like each other very much, sometimes they decide to create a new company together. That is what happened with the production firm and the prophylactics people when, for reasons that are perhaps best not to question, they hit upon the idea of expanding their product line from condoms into noodles. The restaurant lies across Union Avenue from Kellogg's Diner. Its door is marked during business hours by the fluttering white noren curtains. It is the second Hanon location. The first is about 6,700 miles away, in the city of Kamakura, which lies south of Tokyo and is known for soba, not udon. This gave Hanon the advantage of not competing against any of Japan's established udon styles, leaving its chef, Takahiro Yanagisawa, free to come up with his own. Mr. Yanagisawa, who had spent 25 years making sushi before turning to noodles, focused his innovative urges on the dough. He began by adding wheat germ and bran to the white flour that in udon is typically used alone. The resulting noodle is called zenryufun or whole wheat. The bran and germ are Mr. Yanagisawa's attempts to make a more healthful udon, but they also add flavor, a mottled color and a slightly rough texture that holds on to the dashi-based broth. This dough is also made into a green noodle, called sasauchi, by mixing in powdered barley shoots and leaves of kuma-zasa, a bamboo variety that pandas dote on . To the human palate, or at least this human's palate, sasa tastes something like green tea. Both the speckled zenryufun and the green sasauchi are flat noodles, resembling fettuccine that has been working out. Avoiding extremes, they are moderately chewy and reasonably springy. Either flavor, or both, can be ordered cold and spread on a bamboo mat for dunking into a sauce, either a peanut-buttery sesame sauce or the traditional dashi-based dipping sauce. For larger or more curious appetites, these dipping noodles, called seiro udon, can be dangled into a hot duck soup in which a few hunks of well-boiled duck meat swim. The cold noodles can also be accessorized with whipped mountain yam or tempura or both. If you had stumbled into Hanon under the impression that it was another generic Williamsburg noodle mill, the tempura would set you straight. The crust is engineered for udon, thick and substantial enough that it will not dissolve and float away in the soup, yet somehow not oily or clunky. The tempura is served with sea salt, which will not only season the fried blowfish tails, shrimp, mushroom and vegetables, but will also do very good things to any noodles it happens to meet. With the hot soups, there is no choice of noodles. All are made with zenryufun. The plain broth, a dashi augmented by white soy sauce, is not so salty or concentrated that I didn't want to drink it all. It also performs well made into a thick-but-not-sludgy curry soup with thin pink slices of washugyu beef; a shaggy, mossy, salty-sour mass of ume and kombu; and a soup of shaved beef and onions that tastes like a deeper, stronger version of French dip jus and is blitzed by a little grated yuzu peel at the end. A few near-relatives of udon make it to the menu as well. The beef-and-onion combination can also be had over rice. Creamy, slightly spicy cod roe is tossed with zenryufun for an excellent mentaiko pasta that, for once, relies on the roe rather than Kewpie mayonnaise to make an impression. The eventual plan is to sell both colors of noodle to grocery stores and other restaurants -- to become, in essence, the Sun Noodle of the udonisphere. This would be a gain for New York, but for the moment Hanon's udon is found only at Hanon, where the noodles are made fresh each day. Any plan for world domination is not hinted at on the restaurant's Facebook page , which seems to be its home base online, though nobody has bothered to post a menu there yet. Nor does the dining room suggest a budding global chain. Atmospheric and presumably expensive prints by the photographers Takashi Homma and Nobuyoshi Araki hang over the tables, and a signed Cy Twombly lithograph has been placed by the door to the backyard. The music -- torch songs, jazz piano -- seems to be coming from a radio tuned to another decade. A lot of this cocktail music will make more sense once the liquor license comes through. Hanon is getting set to offer sake, shochu and wines chosen by Jorge Riera, who built the list at Frenchette and has turned countless New Yorkers on to the fizzy, fuzzy and furry delights of natural wines. The idea of Hanon is not to slurp and slide out, but to stay for a meal: a chilled French red with the fried chicken and Japanese omelet, maybe, and something a bit brawnier with curry soup. Dessert could be a tofu blancmange, smooth and white and somewhat sweet, but there is more satisfaction in the grainy, earthy bricks of red bean paste. The meal might end with tea, to which the restaurant takes the same unhurried approach it applies to everything else. The iced oolong is slowly cold-brewed; a bamboo whisk and ceramic chawan are kept on the dining counter for painstakingly whipping up bowls of matcha; an appliance imported from Taiwan will transform freshly steeped hojicha and ice into a tan froth, a process that takes about five minutes. This foam tea is dairy-free, unlike Taiwan's infamous cheese tea. It is served in a wine glass, and the experience of drinking it is similar to tackling a pint of Guinness before the head has settled down.

The restaurant had changed significantly since the last time it had been evaluated by a Times critic: Sam Sifton promoted it from three stars to four in 2010, when Mark Ladner was the executive chef and Brooks Headley was running the pastry kitchen. First, Mr. Headley had quit this stately, expensive Italian restaurant in Chelsea so he could sell fast, cheap vegetarian burgers . Next, Del Posto had spent about $1 million on crystal candle vases, white leather chairs and other luxurious fittings that made it even more stately and expensive. Finally, Mr. Ladner had left to sell fast, cheap pasta. A fresh review was clearly in order. Before I could write it, though, a number of women who had worked for Mario Batali, one of the owners, started talking about the sexual harassment and abuse that they say he had doled out. Suddenly there seemed to be more important questions than whether the braised-rabbit agnolotti were cooked al dente. Negotiations took more than a year, but Mr. Batali no longer profits from Del Posto, having sold his stake in March to a group led by his former partner, Joe Bastianich . Employees have said that Mr. Bastianich himself helped, at a minimum, to build the sexist and disrespectful environment in which Mr. Batali operated. Mr. Bastianich has apologized, saying that he had heard Mr. Batali speak inappropriately to employees, and that he should have done more to stop the sexual harassment. Some diners will stay away, feeling that Mr. Bastianich has not sufficiently atoned. I understand this, but I am also interested in the way employees may be treated at the restaurant now and in the future. Here, there is reason to hope. Among other human-resources reforms, employees can now report complaints about owners or corporate officers to an independent investigative firm with the power to refer cases to outside counsel. As part of the restructuring, Melissa Rodriguez, who has been the executive chef of Del Posto since 2017, was made a partner in the restaurant, along with Jeff Katz, now the managing partner. A new pastry chef, Georgia Wodder, was appointed last spring. Del Posto is, with the possible exception of Aquavit , the grandest and most expensive restaurant in New York where women are in charge of everything you eat, starting with the miniature saffron waffle rolled like a cannoli and stuffed at one tiny end with taleggio and at the other with fennel pesto, and ending with the prosecco marshmallow tucked into the wooden drawer of a custom-made cheese grater. The cooking is more subdued now. The kitchen is not seen as a beacon of innovation the way it used to be, perhaps because Ms. Rodriguez is less interested than Mr. Ladner was in feats of technical derring-do like 100-layer lasagnas . She gets her effects by following old Italian templates and putting them together so elegantly that they seem to light up from inside. There's an honesty to her approach -- she doesn't try to shoot out all the lights by supercharging dishes with fat -- but it's not the kind of peasant simplicity people usually mean when they talk about honesty in Italian food. It's a sophisticated honesty. You know chicken cacciatore, of course. Ms. Rodriguez's version is made from guinea hen breast, roasted until the skin crackles like parchment. What would be the body of the stew is now a sauce; the tomato, celery and onion in it come through distinctly. Occupying a little sidecar is a pressed puck of braised leg meat under a single, Roman-style gnocco, a small featherbed of semolina held together by eggs, milk and cheese. One side has been broiled so hard it is nearly burned, which seems like a mistake at first, but turns out to supply the bit of campfire that this hunter's stew needs. It has to be far more complicated to prepare than the cacciatore at your neighborhood Italian restaurant, but it seems simpler, pared to essentials, and wonderful in every bite. I've never seen anyone wring as much flavor out of salsify as Ms. Rodriguez does. Sliced transparently thin and fried, it makes crunchy brown chips about half the size of an M&M. These decorate the top of a grilled-salsify pudding that has the refreshing bittersweetness of one of those plant-based Italian aperitifs. If it were not garnished with streaky leaves of radicchio, it could pass for a dessert. The menu structure has not changed, although the prices have. Everything can be had \u00e0 la carte. Lunch is still a relative bargain, though the price has shimmied up to $59 for three courses. For a blowout $194 dinner, the Captain's Menu yields eight courses or so. Most people, however, go with the $164, five-course Menu del Posto. The primary argument in favor of this strategy is, to me, an overwhelming one: Two of those five courses are pasta. Del Posto's pastas are worth doubling up on. They can come in many forms. Delicate conical tortellini have hidden pockets of nettles and spring peas; they are half-submerged in a light spring-vegetable brodo in which Parmigiano-Reggiano rinds once bobbed like bay leaves. This is the spring minestrone. A single, plate-spanning raviolo, called a fazzoletto, is topped with poached mussels and filled with spinach and fresh herbs -- not a lawnmower-mulch of greenery but a layer of emulsion as thin and velvety as the dough that envelops it. The sauce of mussel juices, white wine, butter and saffron makes this the only convincing mussel pasta I've ever had. The range of flavors Ms. Wodder commands in her pastry kitchen seems unnecessarily limited to me, although I may be unfairly comparing her desserts with Mr. Headley's, which roamed all over the place. Individually, her desserts are soothing, often showcasing the comforts of dairy. More emphasis, some extra acidity or bitterness, might have brought an assemblage of quince paste, brown-butter gelato and griddled brioche into relief. But I appreciated the way winter squash in the batter modified the sweetness of an olive oil-orange cake, and I enjoyed the moody sulkiness that amaro lent to a citrus salad served with the cake. Del Posto has in recent years picked up a reputation as a restaurant for one-percenters. It rarely gives that impression once you are inside, where servers solemnly accommodate just about anyone. There is a vegan menu at Del Posto. A vegetarian meal can be put together easily, and almost everything can be made without gluten, including the pasta. Yes, the stockpile of Champagnes includes some lock-and-key stuff, and should you require a Barolo costing between $2,000 and $4,000, one will quickly be added to your bill. But among the 3,100 or so Italian labels superintended by Evan Clagnaz, the wine director, are more marked from $60 to $75 than I can count. Piemonte is a place to hunt, and Friuli, and the Valle d'Aosta, for starters. Though the restaurant is not exclusively for rich people, it is explicitly for occasions. Once, when a reservationist called to confirm and asked whether I was celebrating anything special, I said no, and was gently laughed at: \"Just a normal Tuesday night at Del Posto?\" There is little danger that anyone will mistake a night at Del Posto for normal. If nothing else, the napkins and towels are a tip-off. First, there is a small hot linen napkin scented with tomato-vine oil, to wipe the dust of the outside world from your hands. Then a large white linen napkin, followed just before dessert by a small yellow one. It is given to you, and the white one is taken away, by a server using a large fork and spoon as tongs. When you go to the restrooms, you may encounter an attendant who has just restocked the hand towels from a large basket she carries on one arm, like Heidi out gathering wildflowers for Grandfather. There are little ceremonies like this from start to finish; I don't know of any other restaurant that performs quite so many tasks whose only real purpose is to draw attention to themselves. And these things are rarely done with a smile; employees seem to have been directed to keep a respectful, formal distance as they carry out your requests and perform other services you'd never think of requesting. They rarely seem comfortable. Their solemnity is underlined by the sepulchral lighting at night, so gloomy it makes the crypt of Grant's tomb look like a tiki bar. A good deal of the service is the attentive, helpful kind that you really want, but the rest of it seems designed only to give customers the sensation of temporary power over other people. Some people may love this, but it reflects a serious lack of imagination when you think about the ways the service at Blue Hill at Stone Barns or Noma , for instance, is integrated into the experience. Is it stretching a point to ask if enshrining subservience, as Del Posto does, reflects the same twisted sense of priorities that allowed Mr. Batali to get away with abusing his own power for so long? (And is it a coincidence that far more men than women seem to work in the dining room, particularly in the upper ranks?) Now that Ms. Rodriguez owns a piece of the restaurant, perhaps she can lead a reconsideration of priorities in the front of the house, and find a tone that more closely matches her philosophy in the back. She shouldn't have to clean up the messes men made. But having worked her way to the top of a restaurant that has always aspired to provide luxury, she has a chance to decide what, in New York in 2019, that word might mean.

At least it has escaped now. For the past decade or so, Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana , the 93-year-old establishment said to have invented the regional delicacy, has been exporting it to its other branches in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. There is also a small cult of the clam pie among New York pizzaioli. It has become a fixture at Lombardi's and some Staten Island pizzerias, as well as inspiring lovingly considered tributes at Pasquale Jones , Motorino and the Clam . I have eaten most of them, and happily, but on a recent trip to Connecticut I was led to what I now realize is the clam pie against which all others should be measured. It is baked at Zuppardi's Apizza in the city of West Haven. Unlike the coal ovens used to fire New Haven's more famous \"abeetz,\" to use the Connecticut-Neapolitan dialect, the ovens at Zuppardi's are fired by gas. As a result, Zuppardi's pies are not nearly as blackened as the ones from Pepe's, but the crust still bulges with air pockets and emerges with a pleasingly dry, thin and crackery crunch. [ Learn how to make pizza at home with this guide from NYT Cooking. ] Zuppardi's tops its clam pizza (market price, typically $32.45 for a medium pie) with fresh garlic, olive oil, dried oregano, cracked red pepper and littlenecks. Smaller clams may be opaque when they reach the table. Larger specimens will be just warmed through. All will taste as if they had just been shucked, as in fact they were. Opening clams to order means that the clam pizza takes longer than Zuppardi's other specialties, like the plain pie (tomato sauce, grated cheese, no mozzarella), itself worth a detour from Interstate 95, which rumbles by about a cherrystone's throw away.

These flattened cod fritters are the size of pie plates in Puerto Rico, while in Queens they are roughly the diameter of a coffee can. Dimensions aside, they give off all the right signals. They are the color of a corn muffin, with green specks of chopped cilantro under the surface that let you know they are not made from Goya's mix. They don't leave your fingertips entirely free of grease, but they come close. They have an exterior crunch that surrenders quickly to the firm, chewy interior of mashed salt cod; the texture is less fried dough than fish taffy. You could start to build a business around bacalaitos like these. That, in fact, has been Derick L\u00f3pez's plan for some time now. Mr. L\u00f3pez, who was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the South Bronx, is the Freakin Rican's chef and, with his husband, Victor Vargas, its owner. About four years ago, armed with picnic coolers and a couple of folding tables, the two men began selling a short menu of Puerto Rican staples at the street fairs that seem to infiltrate a different New York thoroughfare each weekend. As they promoted the Freakin Rican catering operation, the Freakin Rican product line, the Freakin Rican Facebook page and the Freakin Rican YouTube channel, they saved their earnings so they could found the Freakin Rican restaurant. After a false start in another part of Queens, it opened a short distance from the Museum of the Moving Image one year ago this month. The dining room has 19 seats. The banana-plant wallpaper on the left wall is reflected in the mirrors on the right. In between are some metal chickens and bright-green figurines of coqu\u00eds, the little frogs that chirp from every Puerto Rican tree. Diners sip on tropical-fruit shakes or bottles of Kola Champagne, Coco Rico and Malta India, the Harry, Ron and Hermione of Puerto Rican soft drinks. H\u00e9ctor Lavoe may be playing over the speakers, or V\u00edctor Manuelle, not so loudly that they can't be drowned out by the sounds of a small number of employees singing \"Happy Birthday\" while wielding a tambourine and a pair of maracas. If you have spent any time at all on the trail of chicharrones, mofongo, sancocho and other wonders of the Puerto Rican kitchen, you know that Astoria is not a primary hunting ground for any of them. You also know, though, that blinking-light cuchifritos parlors and family-run cocina criolla luncheonettes have been disappearing from the Bronx, East Harlem and the Lower East Side over the past few decades, along with many of their customers. The Puerto Rican population in New York peaked around 1990, when residents of the old barrios began to flow to the suburbs in large numbers, according to Laird W. Bergad , the director of the Center for Latin American, Caribbean and Latino Studies at City University of New York Graduate Center. Beacons of Puerto Rican cuisine still survive; Casa Adela, for instance, is still busily dispensing chickens from its venerable lemon-yellow rotisserie on Avenue C, despite the death last year of its founder, Adela Fargas. But there are not so many of these places left that we can take an unlimited supply of tostones and mojo de ajo for granted, either. The Freakin Rican developed its act on the street-fair circuit, but it applied the same tactics that succeed at Smorgasburg and similar urban foraging grounds, where the ideal dish can be held in one hand, gets immediate attention, costs under $10 and can serve as a plank in a branding platform. This may explain why appetizers are the strong suit on the Freakin Rican menu. The sorullitos, Puerto Rico's answer to hush puppies, are an exception; they are dense and dry, as if the cornmeal hadn't absorbed enough water. Mr. L\u00f3pez's alcapurrias, though, are very good, even if the picadillo that runs down the middle of a tube of mashed fried plantains like the graphite in a pencil could be seasoned a little more forcefully. And his pasteles are exceptional. Pasteles are structured like tamales. Where the masa would be, Mr. L\u00f3pez makes a sweet, enjoyably gummy mash of green plantains, taro root and kabocha squash. The filling is a soft, rich vein of stewed pork shoulder with ham, bacon, red peppers and green olives. Rolled up in a banana leaf, these pasteles probably deserve their own float in the Puerto Rican Day Parade. Mr. L\u00f3pez fries chicken in two styles. One, the chicharrones de pollo, is traditional. The other, the Freakin Crispy Wings, is not. Each has its rewards. The chicharrones, hacked into three-bite hunks, taste of cider vinegar and garlic powder and have a smooth, achiote-tinted buttermilk crust that breaks open with a pleasing crackle. The Freakin Crispy Wings are spicier, and the shell is thicker and more deeply crevassed. These wings may owe more to Atlanta than to Mayag\u00fcez, although you can get them with a guava barbecue sauce that's reasonably tropical. Leave behind these appetizers, the core of the street-fair business, and the menu can start to appear unsteady. At dinner, the main courses tend to be fairly plain fried or grilled meat. Grilled pork chops splashed with mojo can be dry and dull, and the grilled chicken breasts are not much more interesting. Baked pork ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce are tender enough, but they aren't very persuasive. On several nights, I found myself gazing longingly at the lunch specials on the back of the menu, wondering why I couldn't have a brick of pastel\u00f3n for dinner. (I came back for it one Thursday afternoon, and was glad I did.) Until more long-cooked dishes like it appear at dinnertime, consider a bowl of sancocho. Listed as \"vegetable root soup\" for $7, it doesn't sound like much of a meal. But it is a grab bag of a stew with at least two kinds of meat, great hunks of taro and yuca, a couple of inches of corn on the cob and a magical squash broth that has the consistency of heavy cream and the color of very ripe mango. In the unlikely event that you finish it and the bowl of rice that comes with it and then cry out for more, the Freakin Rican has just the thing for you: mofongo. A dome of mashed plantains possessed by garlic, the mofongo is cooked to order to keep the crunchy bits crunchy and the whole thing from getting boggy. You can have it with chicharrones or sliced roast pork, which leaves behind a happy impression of garlic, oregano and salt. If you have come for a birthday, a candle stuck in the meringue icing of a tres leches cake is probably in your future. If not, flan and espresso will do, and a bag of pasteles for tomorrow.

Again the flavors come from Asia and the methods, generally, from France. Again the far-off tropics are evoked through the play of indirect, dappled light, as if filtered through jungle foliage or a carved wooden screen. Again the presiding culinary sensibility belongs to a Vongerichten. Jean-Georges Vongerichten put together Spice Market in 2004, a confection of teak, silk, vodka, peanut sauce and high heels that brought the Asian Party Temple restaurant genre to its apotheosis. All the earlier examples suddenly seemed fumbling and unsophisticated, and with the possible exception of the Spice Market spinoffs in Qatar and Mexico, the ones that would follow seemed increasingly mindless and out of touch. Interior design that rummages through the musty old trunks of Orientalism doesn't look as alluring as it did 15 years ago, and cooking that filters Asian flavors through a Western sensibility isn't automatically met with gales of excitement. Wayan, where Mr. Vongerichten's son, C\u00e9dric, is the chef, avoids both traps, I think. The restaurant is a tribute to Indonesia, the home of his wife and business partner, Ochi Vongerichten, and the site of two restaurants that he opened recently. (He is also the chef of Perry St. in Manhattan, which his father owns.) The scale is more personal and the cultural references are more specific at Wayan than at Spice Market and its kind. The menu is far from encyclopedic, but it is clear that Indonesia's cuisine has been given more than the quick glance that informs a lot of Asian fusion. Ms. Vongerichten works in the dining room, stopping by tables to offer explanations of the menu and how the cooking differs from that at some other Indonesian restaurants in New York, which she cheerfully calls \"more authentic.\" More than any other factor, she helps keep Wayan from turning into a junior version of one of her father-in-law's restaurants -- Young Vongerichtenstein. Servers will tell you to start with a stick or two of satay. You can, although the skewers are cooked on a flattop instead of a grill, and inconsistency is an issue. The pork skewers that are so appealingly juicy and savory with sweet soy one week can be scorched and bitter the next time you see them, and just ordinary the following week. (The pickled watermelon radishes on the side, though, are always terrific; they're brined with lime leaf.) The peanut sauce on chicken satay may hum with red curry and chiles, or may present as a sweet, inert blob. A more promising opening move, and one that will help place C\u00e9dric and Ochi Vongerichten's mental map of Indonesia in perspective, would be the Jimbaran-style clams. This is not a dish that is likely to have been stirred by generations of sainted grandmothers since the dawn of time. It is, in fact, a specialty of the seafood vendors who sprang up on a stretch of Balinese beach where resorts first began to appear sometime around the birth of Taylor Swift. Littlenecks, flavored with soy sauce and garlic paste, are grilled under flakes of coconut, which form the golden crust that would be provided by bread crumbs if these were clams oreganata. A slice of pickled red chile sits on each one, waiting. If you were on vacation, you would order tray after tray of these. Here on Spring Street, other things will keep you distracted. In the hearts-of-palm salad, sweet and sour are carefully pitted against each other by means of a mango vinaigrette, a lime-and-fish-sauce dressing and a neon coat of passion-fruit pulp. The crab cake is, despite its sweet chile sauce, about as Indonesian as Betty White, but it is fresh and fluffy and not worth arguing about. Wayan's rendition of the street snack bakwan jagung is a golden agglomeration of corn kernels and shallots fried into a flat, crunchy disc. There had better be nasi goreng at any restaurant that is even playing at being Indonesian. There is, the rice fried just until it crackles a bit between your teeth. It has a gentle but genuine spice undercurrent that would be welcome in more of the cooking. Of course there is a gado gado, and this being 2019, of course the main ingredient is avocado; the hard-cooked eggs belong to quail. This time the peanut dressing isn't cloying or clumpy. As the plates get larger, few dishes really come forward as the kind of knockout that everybody will talk about later. The closest contender must be the lobster and basil with wavy noodles in a sauce containing, among other things, sweet soy and melted butter -- a combination that the senior Mr. Vongerichten has used so successfully that it may be his son's inheritance. Should the calamansi vinaigrette poured over the steamed black sea bass be more sour and spicy? Probably. But if there are few stars on the table, the contrast of flavors, colors, textures and techniques makes the meal into a memorable ensemble piece. The drumsticks in yellow chicken are crunchy, and the thighs are tender; both are mellow with a yellow curry seasoned by lemongrass and ginger. The tomato-chile sambal pressed into the surface of cod \"bilindango\" is potent enough to carry over to the spears of asparagus and fiddlehead ferns sprawled alongside. All of this looks very come-hither in the dining room, where the Rockwell Group has abandoned stadium-size props, building atmospheric effects instead out of contrasting textures and light values and the movement of shadows. This is the visual language of expensive tropical resorts, and Wayan seems to give people the feeling they're on vacation. It is not necessarily a loud restaurant, but New Yorkers are a loud people, and around 10 the noise can start to press down. It is a good time to call for dessert. The purple-yam ice cream with banana cake and caramelized bananas is good if sundaes are your thing. The pandan custard under passion-fruit pulp gets a lot of mileage from just a few flavors. But the one that sounds too boring to bother with (\"assorted exotic fruit?\") is worth a second look. Lychee, mango, pineapple and dragon fruit may not be particularly exotic, but a dip or a dunk into a dark, spicy syrup of tamarind and palm sugar will wake them right up.

And they did, in a sense. Soon Mr. Haraguchi had established his own free-standing establishment, Yuji Ramen in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where he serves that bacon-and-egg mazemen along with his possibly visionary \"tunakotsu\" ramen. In 2014, when Ivan Orkin came to New York , he brought along his own mazemen recipes. Over the next few years mazemen turned up in other restaurants, too, but all of them remained better known for soup ramen, and sold more of it. It began to look as if mazemen would never be more than a sideshow act, the one-armed ax-catcher of the ramen circus. Then at the start of the year, the chef Shigetoshi Nakamura, who operates an intimate ramen shop on the Lower East Side, opened an annex next door that is dedicated to mazemen. All the seating at this new place, Niche , is at a dozen or so stools arranged around one long, narrow table. When the dining room is fully occupied, the only way to get from one end to the other is to walk sideways while holding your breath and picking up all the coats that you are going to knock off their wall pegs as you go. Not that there is much reason to roam around. Orders are taken from and delivered to the table, and there is no public restroom on the premises. As is the case next door at Nakamura, seats by the window offer a close-up view of the stone walls that support the last few yards of the Williamsburg Bridge before it empties onto Delancey Street. Before he came to New York, Mr. Nakamura was already well known in Tokyo, where he proved to have a theatrical streak. Before filling a bowl with noodles, he would yank them from the boiling water with his left hand and then hold them high in the air for a few seconds, letting them drain while standing completely motionless. Suddenly he would drop his arm and the basket would plunge toward the water again, before stopping just in time and getting one quick, emphatic shake. When Mr. Nakamura was immortalized as one of four \"ramen gods\" in a set of Hello Kitty notepads and phone straps, Kitty was posed with her left paw raised high in emulation of the Nakamura Shake. If Mr. Nakamura has been practicing his choreography on the spaghetti-like, crinkly noodles at Niche, I haven't seen it yet. The Nakamura Shake seems designed to extract cooking water as quickly as possible before the noodles cool, and temperature is not especially critical in mazemen. The idea of noodle soup without the soup has been on the loose in Japan for decades. Broth is the most expensive and labor-intensive part of a bowl of ramen; in the 1950s, a Tokyo noodle shop, in the pitiless logic of the restaurant business, began omitting the broth when ladling out noodles at staff meals, or so the story goes. This \"abura soba\" -- oil noodle, because it was moistened with lard along with the seasoning sauce called tare -- wasn't half bad, so it went on the menu at a discounted price. As an even cheaper version of an already cheap and filling meal, abura soba was quickly embraced, especially by students. As food ideas tend to do in Japan, it evolved rapidly. Today, abura soba tends to refer to dry soups that have more or less the same toppings you'd find in a bowl of normal ramen, while mazemen generally has toppings that are rarely seen in soup and often would not respond well to being submerged in hot liquid. There is Italian-style mazemen, with anchovies, salami, olives and tomatoes. Some mazemen shops specialize in fried beef cutlets. At a Tokyo restaurant called Beefst , the centerpiece of each bowl is sliced roast beef, served rare. Mr. Nakamura has an answer to that: steak mazemen. The steak is rib-eye, in cubes that have been browned with a kitchen torch. When you stir them with the noodles and a smooth, creamy spoonful of something the menu simply calls \"pork sauce,\" their juices and flecks of char flavor the whole bowl. Plain spinach and fermented bamboo, meanwhile, keep the total effect from being queasy-making. Novel, straightforward, refined, unruly and impure of heart, steak mazemen has the makings of a classic New York dish. So does the duck, a common special. A sliced breast of moulard duck cooked to a deep violet-pink, it is served with a bright, focused sauce built on soy and enough warm duck juices to lubricate the whole-wheat noodles. It is not an austere dish by any means, but it is balanced and restrained. The same cannot be said for another special that is always offered on the same nights: a bowl of liquefied foie gras topped with pistachios and truffle oil. It is not clear what will happen to anyone who tries to eat this with a spoon, but the prognosis does not seem good. Instead, everybody orders it with the duck mazemen and dips the noodles into the foie gras, after which conscious thought tends to stop for a minute or two. When cerebral activity resumes, you might wonder why the sauce doesn't come with its own noodles. No other mazemen is such a joy ride, but the vaguely Italian one with tomatoes, mushrooms, kombu and an angry red soak of chile oil is not the kind of thing you want to turn your back on. Even the tribute to Russ & Daughters , where the noodles are coated with spicy cod roe and the topping is sliced smoked salmon, can sneak up on you. Niche is one of the few ramen-yas in town where the appetizers are worth noticing. Sea urchin perched on tiny corners of toast is a strange and awkward affair, but the sardines on toast, dressed with chile flakes, are very good, as are the raw scallops with yuzu juice and the avocado salad showered with tempura flakes. Should fries be an appetizer? Maybe not, particularly Niche's \"umami kombu fries,\" which have been sprinkled with powdered shio kombu until they are almost subliminally green. Apart from the color, they look like the fries at McDonald's. The difference is that the shio kombu makes them almost diabolically hard to stop eating.

Her third restaurant, Haenyeo was about three months old and already filled with people who looked as if they'd been going there for years. It sits on a prime corner lot, on a stretch of Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that is rich in local minichains serving banh mi, burritos, lobster rolls and so on, to take out or eat in. Intimidating restaurants don't tend to prosper here. Very few people inside Haenyeo look the least bit intimidated as they lift grilled oysters by the shell to pour the dregs of hot seaweed butter over toast; or carve wedges of zucchini-scallion pancakes fried to a dark and satisfyingly rich brown; or stir mushrooms, squid, bean sprouts, steamed spinach and cabbage kimchi with a just-cracked egg into a bibimbap whose bottom layer of rice is golden and crunchy where it meets the hot stone bowl. The customers at Haenyeo seem to have an easy familiarity with Korean food. Some of them, at least, can probably thank Ms. Kwak for that. In 1992, when she began serving the cuisine in the East Village at her first restaurant, Dok Suni's, the words tteokbokki and seolleongtang and jajangmyeon did not roll off the tongues of most non-Koreans. But that's who she wanted to lure in with American music, date-night d\u00e9cor and Western-style service. Once she had them, she would tempt, teach, turn them on to the flavors she'd grown up with. Her mother, Myung Ja Kwak, shared cooking duties. Ms. Kwak's was not the take-it-or-leave-it approach of 32nd Street, and she kept at it. She wrote \"Dok Suni: Recipes From My Mother's Korean Kitchen,\" which was one of the few Korean cookbooks in English when it came out, in 1998. At her second restaurant, Do Hwa, she and her mother led customers deeper into unfamiliar ground. Each of the restaurants stayed open for about two decades, which is a very long time in New York. If you want a metaphor for how effectively Ms. Kwak paved the way for restaurants like Atoboy , Soogil, Danji and others whose chefs weave Korean cuisine into new patterns, consider that one of them, Oiji, moved into its address on First Avenue right after Dok Suni's moved out. What Ms. Kwak is doing in Park Slope isn't all that different from what she has done all her career, except that by now South Korean comfort food has become comfort food for New York in general. Haenyeo does pay more attention to seafood than Dok Suni or Do Hwa did, though. Ms. Kwak hasn't gone pescatarian on us. She still serves impressive pork and beef bulgogis with ssamjang and lettuce, and the pan-fried dumplings are filled with high-fat ground beef seasoned with kimchi, garlic and soy. But her menu's orientation has shifted slightly toward the ocean. This is good news, because the seafood at Haenyeo has a sparkle and sweetness you don't always find in the smoke-filled rooms of 32nd Street. A bibimbap variant may be the menu's sleeper dish, partly because it starts out looking like a lunch bowl from Sweetgreen. It is a version of hwe dup bap. At first you just see raw tuna, shredded romaine and perilla leaves, grated carrots and cucumber, and strips of seaweed. Hidden underneath is warm rice. But there is a pink mound of spicy cod roe in the bowl, too, with cured salmon eggs and a few lobes of sea urchin. Both of them will break apart as you stir, bringing their distinct saltwater intonations to the rice and vegetables. What the menu calls \"white fish fillets\" -- pan-fried cod with rings of scallion showing through their thin gold sheet of egg batter, otherwise known as saeng seon jeon -- is so modestly named it might get overlooked; it shouldn't. The menu plays Don't Mind Me again with \"mackerel, grilled or braised.\" Just get the mackerel, because the kitchen knows how to cook it, whether over a flame or in a dark, smoky pan of garlic and gochujang. In truth, the kitchen seems to know how to cook every kind of seafood, although perhaps it could come with a better partner for the fried scallops than the sweet, yellowish tartar sauce with corn in it. The walls are hung with photographs of Korean women in wet suits. These are the haenyeo of Jeju island , who dive up to 30 feet deep for conch, abalone and seaweed while holding their breath for several minutes at a time. The money they made diving is probably the reason parts of Jeju have a matriarchal family structure. Naming the restaurant after them, Ms. Kwak continues a theme started with Dok Suni's, which means \"strong women's.\" One dish that seems out of place is a revival of Dok Suni's fried chicken. Was the batter always so pasty and airless? That's not how I remember it, but it's possible my standards have changed as Korean fried chicken has infiltrated nearly every part of town over the past decade. In any case, there is better chicken to seek out here, not just the home-style dokdoritang stewed in chile sauce but also the wings. Haenyeo double-fries wings that have been dipped in potato starch, then coats them with a fine version of a yangnyeom chile sauce, tangier and a little less sweet than some. When Ms. Kwak detours from the Korean straight and narrow, consider traipsing along behind her. You may wind up having beignets for dessert, buried under a fresh coat of powdered sugar in the best Caf\u00e9 du Monde style. (This and the grilled oysters may betray the hand of her business partner, Terrence Segura, who is from New Orleans. He is also her husband.) Or you may follow her all the way to the joyous rice cake fundido, which starts out as tteokbokki in chile sauce and becomes totally atypical through the addition of chorizo, sliced jalape\u00f1os and a melted, browned topcoat of Oaxacan cheese that comes up in long, stretchy strings when you pull on it. It is, in all likelihood, the best Tex-Mex dish in New York. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

At the very least, it has paused to catch its breath. Since the seven-story food court in Hudson Yards was unveiled last month, the public reaction has been somewhere between shrug and ugh. Attitudes may improve as visitors eat their way to the top floor. So far, though, the response hasn't come close to matching the greeting bestowed on the restaurants at Time Warner Center in 2004, even though the project represents the same basic idea executed by the same developer with at least one of the same chefs, Thomas Keller . Even more striking has been the low-key reception to Rocco DiSpirito's return. Late last year Mr. DiSpirito took over the kitchen at Standard Grill in the meatpacking district. At one point, when he was the chef at both Union Pacific and Rocco's on 22nd while starring in a television show, he was arguably the most famous chef in the country. Then both places closed, and the show was canceled. Mr. DiSpirito has not been in charge of a restaurant since George W. Bush was in the White House. For that matter, it has been some years since Standard Grill itself has done anything noteworthy. In 2009, when it was new and Dan Silverman was the chef, I reviewed it, gave it one star and then lost track of it. In other words, the selection of Mr. DiSpirito did not just come out of left field. It came from the weeds across the street from the parking lot behind left field. For surprise value alone, it should have been one of the year's most buzzed-about news items. But the trumpets have been muted, and the back handsprings seem to lack a certain bounce. This, at least, is the view from outside the restaurant. Once you're sitting at one of the tables -- newly topped with leather pads in a major retrofitting that has made the dining room look like an expensive cabaret, blue velvet and all -- you will hear quite a lot of talk about Mr. DiSpirito, or as they call him here, Chef Rocco. Chef Rocco, you learn, conceived each dish on the menu so that it can be eaten by one person or shared with others. No, I didn't believe it at first, either, but apparently it's true: Rocco DiSpirito invented food. There is also something that servers call Chef Rocco's Game Changing Toast, although sometimes they shorten it to Rocco's Game Changing or simply Game Changing, as in \"Here's a little more Game Changing for you.\" The item in question is a toasted, cracker-thin slice of bread made of nuts, oats, seeds and psyllium-seed husks held together without benefit of wheat flour. Like nearly everything on the menu, it is free of gluten. Being mostly made of browned nuts, it is also delicious. Whether it is truly Rocco's is up for debate. It seems to strongly resemble the Life-Changing Loaf of Bread recipe that Sarah Britton published on her blog, \"My New Roots,\" in 2013, and that appeared on another blog two years later, with minor changes, as Game Changing Nut & Seed Bread . It's one of the items that reflect Mr. DiSpirito's recent obsession with nutrient-dense dietary supplements , although the way it keeps coming up in the servers' patter makes you wonder if Mr. DiSpirito spent too much time as a QVC pitchman. Anyway, somebody-or-other's toast sits under the smoked gravlax, red with beet juice and very silky on its bed of coconut cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, that Mr. DiSpirito sends out as an amuse. A plate of the toast will also appear if you order the platter of acorn-fed, hand-sliced Ib\u00e9rico ham or the chilled Maine sea urchins served on the spiky half-shell. Either one will convince you that Mr. DiSpirito knows how to get his hands on raw materials that can stun with almost no assistance. The best things at Standard Grill, and there are quite a lot of them, depend on very good ingredients touched as little as possible. Back in the Union Pacific days, Mr. DiSpirito's interest in East Asian cuisines came out in the form of complex preparations, arcane ingredients and out-of-nowhere juxtapositions. Now he seems to have moved on to the luxury minimalism of an omakase sushi chef, a style that was foreshadowed by the only Union Pacific dish he's brought back, bay scallops and sea urchin with a few throat-searing drops of mustard oil. Standard Grill's ice-cold cubes of bluefin chu-toro stirred with golden osetra caviar, meanwhile, could have come straight out of Masa , while the yellowfin tartare, barely dressed with crushed macadamias and freshly grated wasabi, is like one of the better items at Tetsu . Each night there are half a dozen or so skewers cooked over Japanese charcoal and wheeled to the table on a mini-grill the size of a toaster oven. Speared on a stick might be fantastic small scallops out of Peconic Bay; a feathery mop of maitake mushrooms; buttery chicken livers with barely a hint of bitterness; or firefly squid, a little bigger than a fava bean and grilled whole so they can be swallowed guts and all. Again, the ingredients are exceptional. The skewers look simple enough, but they are all, you learn, brushed with \"a little sauce Chef Rocco came up with to complement the charcoal.\" The sauce for seafood involves coconut nectar and lemongrass, and what it actually does is put you, vaguely and pleasantly, in mind of Thailand. While I am one of those increasingly stooped and wizened diners who remembers, in detail, Mr. DiSpirito's cooking at Union Pacific, far more people recall him as the meatball-pushing antihero of \"The Restaurant,\" an NBC series about Rocco's on 22nd, an actual (and doomed, it turned out) Italian-American restaurant. The show, which debuted in 2003, was a pioneer in the genre of cooking-focused reality television, although when everybody started suing everybody else, it became clear it was a pioneer in the way the members of the Donner Party were pioneers. The handful of Italian dishes at Standard Grill may be meant for \"Restaurant\" fans. Neither of the two pastas showed Mr. DiSpirito at his best, but a chewy risotto with red shrimp and what seemed like half a dozen forms of black truffles may make you understand why Ruth Reichl started her 1998 Times review of Union Pacific with a woman moaning at the next table. Standard Grill's Norwegian salmon on an ivory puddle of vegan cashew sauce won't inspire the same reaction, but the steaks might; they are dry-aged until ripe, and earn their deep-brown crust over extremely hot Japanese charcoal. Given what Mr. DiSpirito is capable of doing with a piece of halibut and some goose fat, I can't quite believe that I'm recommending the rib-eye over the seafood, but I am. It may be that Mr. DiSpirito knows exactly what he is doing. Simplicity is the whole point of a grill, which is first cousin to the steakhouse. He has also designed a menu so straightforward that if, after a respectable period of time, he is no longer in the kitchen, the food quality can stay roughly the same as long as the hotel doesn't argue about ingredient costs. The Standard has not left the restaurant's fate entirely in his hands, either; besides redecorating, it hired a ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel, Michael Cecchi-Azzolina, away from Le Coucou ; he is hard at work building an audience every night, handing out old-school business cards to old-school producers, chefs and publishers, sitting down to chat with Brooke Shields and Ms. Reichl. Standard Grill is so much better than it used to be, and so much better than almost any restaurant serving a comparable menu of grilled meats and chilled seafood, that it's foolish to wish for the return of the same Mr. DiSpirito who gave us Union Pacific. It's a little bit as if Barbra Streisand had returned to Broadway, and then sang all her songs in a whisper sitting on the edge of the stage.

In fact, in Blue Smoke's attempt to bring together the barbecued game hen of Cozy Corner , in Memphis, with the fried hot chicken of places like Prince's, in Nashville, the bird has been through a good deal more than that. The process goes like this, approximately : spatchcocked, brined, rubbed with spices, smoked, chilled, dunked in a frothy batter, tossed in seasoned flour, deep fried, dipped in spicy oil and sprinkled with four kinds of ground pepper. \"Just a little pop-pop dust right on top\" is how Jean-Paul Bourgeois, Blue Smoke's chef, describes the last step. \"That introduction of fresh chile onto that fried chicken, it just brings the zing.\" Then came one final touch, he said: \"a little swirlybird of Tabasco hot honey.\" Handily, this can all be shortened to smoked, fried hen when you order ($24 at the Battery Park City location and $26 on East 27th Street). But you'll know there's more to it when your jaw smashes through the dark crust with a sonic boom; when the particular forms of heat contributed by habanero, black pepper, Sichuan peppercorn, Aleppo pepper, cayenne and Tabasco sauce all start to pile up and reverberate like My Bloody Valentine guitar chords ; when the meat gives up juices that swirl with wood smoke.

That small children routinely bought coffee-flavored milk in school cafeterias; that \"beer\" was not pronounced with an \"r\" at the end, but pizza was; that a hot dog shortened to about four inches and topped with meat sauce is called a hot wiener , and that a counterman preparing six of them at a time may deploy a maneuver known as \"wieners up the arm\" -- all of this apparently strikes people who grew up more than 20 miles from Providence as very funny. When New Yorkers hear that Violet , a new restaurant in the East Village, serves a style of pizza that comes from Rhode Island, they start to smile, as if getting ready for the punch line. In fact, though, Violet's pies are a homage not to the whole state but to a specific restaurant, Al Forno, in Providence. If you know one thing about Al Forno, you know that its pizza is not a joke. One of the restaurant's two founders, George Germon, originated the recipe in the early 1980s, more or less out of desperation. After failing to get an oven hot enough to produce a crust as thin and crunchy as the ones he remembered eating in Italy, he tossed dough on a wood-burning grill and watched in awe as it stiffened to a crisp almost instantly. The pizza he and his wife, Johanne Killeen, would develop and elaborate from there was in a category of its own. The skills required to bake dough in a pizza oven, whether it runs on gas, coal or wood, don't apply to grilled pizza at all. This makes it an unending source of fascination to pizza technologists including Violet's chef, Matt Hyland. With his wife and business partner, Emily Hyland, Mr. Hyland paid tribute to wood-fired New Haven and New York pizza at his first place, Emily , then took on Detroit pan pizza at Emmy Squared . They have expanded both restaurants to new locations, including Citi Field, where Emmy Squared is now the \"official pizza.\" But Mr. Hyland has been a student of the Al Forno school of pizza for years, since going to college in Rhode Island. Violet, which he opened at the start of the year, is dedicated to the style. He has worked allusions to other features of the state's cuisine into the menu, which makes forays into pasta and small seafood dishes, but the pizza grill is at the center of the action. Anyone who has eaten at Al Forno will recognize the lineage of Violet's pies. Both are as thin as a saltine all the way to the edge, with parallel lines of grill marks on their undersides. Al Forno puts fontina on its margheritas, as Violet did with all its pizzas until recently, when it began experimenting with havarti. In any case, the cheeses are on the dry side and grated for fast, thin distribution. Sauces are splashed down by the spoonful, quickly, before the crust burns. That's the template for a pie called the Atwells: a base coat of grated havarti and pecorino under big blots of a garlic-laden pesto made even greener than usual by the inclusion of broccoli and pistachios. While Al Forno tosses raw, slivered scallions on almost every pie, Violet may chop its scallions or grill them. One appealingly eccentric pie that combines a New Haven clam pizza with a Peking duck pancake is finished with fried julienned leeks. Olive oil does give Al Forno's crust extra crackle and flavor, but Violet's less lavishly oiled dough, made with a sourdough starter, has more flavor of its own. It's a little salty, crunchy but not brittle, more substantial than you expect, and highly chewable. Violet gives you a heavy pair of shears to snip the pie into wedges, or any shape you like. Wielding them supplies the palpable thrill of using exactly the right tool for the job, and it's even better than that because the job is eating pizza. A trip to Providence last weekend, though, turned up more than structural similarities between Violet and Al Forno. Three of the four pizzas on Al Forno's menu reminded me of pies I'd eaten at Violet. One resembled the Atwells, but its pesto was made with asparagus rather than broccoli. For Violet's Beech Vibes, a thin layer of duxelles is spread from rim to rim, then topped with tahini, caramelized onions and pickled beech mushrooms. It reminds me of a pissaladi\u00e8re in which the anchovies have been replaced by mushrooms. Al Forno makes a duxelles pizza, too, but tops it with unpickled white mushrooms, and doesn't use tahini. And, of course, both places do a variation on a Neapolitan margherita, called the margarita in Providence and the Classic in the East Village. The difference between their dough recipes doesn't quite put to rest the suspicion that Violet should be more conscientious about avoiding overlap even though Al Forno is 180 miles away. Most diners, of course, will just be happy to have a new style of pizza in town. Any of Violet's pies, eaten before or after the iceberg-wedge salad with blue cheese and a jolt of ranch dressing, or the fris\u00e9e salad tossed with fried artichokes, would make an ideal fast dinner. Beyond that, the going can get tricky. All the pastas I tried seemed like rough drafts, from the radiatore baked in a very salty vodka sauce to the spaghetti con vongole con dashi, a Japanese-Italian blind date that doesn't have the right chemistry. The two desserts I had were even stranger. Describing one of them, a cheesecake with banana pudding on it, the server said, \"I'm just going to tell you what it is and if you guys want it, you can order it.\" If the warning had been any stronger it would have come with liability waivers. If you did want to build a longer meal, some of the seafood appetizers can help. Not the \"stuffies,\" baked stuffed littlenecks or cherrystones that could use more clam. The smoked mackerel, though, is excellent and comes with some unusually good fresh-fried potato chips. There are also shrimp that have been grilled with their heads and shells on, placed over johnnycakes and splashed with spiced piri-piri sauce. Johnnycakes, which are made of fried cornmeal mush and taste like it, are probably more strongly identified with Rhode Island than any other food. I have never been sure why, because johnnycakes can be found, if you really want to look for them, all along the Atlantic Coast. The only time I've seen Rhode Islanders eating them was on a Boy Scout camping trip, and boy scouts will eat anything if you leave them in the woods for a few days. In any case, the johnnycakes that Violet places under the shrimp and the piri-piri sauce are kind of wonderful. The cornmeal has a lush, right-off-the-cob flavor. I'd have them for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Is it possible that the joke has been on me all along? Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

At two points during the March menu, a person who is not Mr. Odo faces you across the thick plank of Lebanon cedar that forms the dining counter and makes something for you. The first time is about halfway through the meal, when Seong Cheol Byun shows up, shapes half a dozen pieces of sushi and lays them down, one by one, in front of you. Some of his ingredients, kept on wooden trays that he carries from place to place, are typical, like the warm short-grain rice and the dark nikiri that he will brush over certain fish. Others are less typical. The ginger he mounds on your plate is pickled together with sliced lotus root and daikon. On March 1, looking forward to spring, he added cherry leaves to the mix. Mr. Byun, a Korean-American, ferments daikon, cabbage and sesame seeds to make white kimchi, which he wraps inside nori for a tuna roll. You eat it like an ice cream cone, but faster. When Mr. Byun worked at Sushi Nakazawa, much of the seafood he used was flown in from Japan. At Odo, almost all the fish have been caught off the East Coast of North America: Long Island black sea bass, Florida mackerel and North Carolina bluefin tuna, which may be several weeks old before Mr. Byun is ready to serve it. This sushi reflects the American region where it is made, incorporates the Korean background of the chef making it and still has an unmistakably Japanese spirit. This one course, if tripled in length, could be spun off into a separate establishment that would probably be among the top two dozen sushi restaurants in the city. The second time an Odo course is prepared while you watch, it is made in a cocktail shaker and served in a cocktail glass. It is, as you may have guessed, a cocktail, though it is also the first of two desserts, sweetish and not especially boozy. Frank Cisneros, the sommelier, subordinates the alcohol to fresh fruit, in the style of the revered Tokyo bar Gen Yamamoto . Barrel-aged shochu is muddled with one or two sprightly segments of mikan orange, subjected to a calisthenic shake and strained into a delicately etched glass before a shimmer of sparkling wine is laid down on top. Orange juice in cocktails usually tastes diluted and weak; in this drink, it was radiant. I would say that the drinkable dessert course could be expanded into a separate cocktail bar, except that Odo already has one of those. Odo, which opened in December a few minutes' walk from the Flatiron Building, is entered through a door hidden in the back of a compact den -- cafe by day and bar by night -- called Hall. This arrangement seems to remind people of a speakeasy, although it would take an especially clueless bootlegger to open a speakeasy inside a bar. So far, Hall has not been fully discovered, but it still gets busy enough at dinner time that you can be stranded by the front door for a few minutes before anyone on staff notices. Some diners on their way to Odo will find this an awkward start to a meal that costs $200 before tax, tip and drinks. But they may also discern that Hall, lined with carved oak panels salvaged from what appears to have been a library or church vestry from around 1900, is one of the neighborhood's most entrancing rooms; that the corridor, which seems too narrow and definitely climbs on its way toward a too-short brass door with no handle, is perspective-altering in a way a Surrealist would enjoy; and that Odo, a shadowy and windowless space on the far side of that door is an unusually tranquil shelter from crowds, noise and anything else you might want to get away from for a couple of hours. The 14 counter seats face the kitchen and, in the middle of it, a charcoal-gray island. This is where Mr. Odo and his cooks assemble the other courses I promised to tell you about. Duck breast has been grilled over charcoal and positioned between two sauces. One is a black spill of concentrated soy spiced with sansho pepper; the other is an ivory pool of pur\u00e9ed apples and cream. These sauces contrast in every way you can think of, including East versus West, and they come together like opposing poles of a magnet. A springy chunk of truffle-flavored mochi is crisped on the grill and engulfed in a white-miso soup that has grated white truffles floating on the surface. You smell truffles in the air first, get them on the tip of your tongue next and finally taste them everywhere when they're released from the mochi. A croquette tastes something like an Italian rice ball made from New England clam chowder that has young bamboo shoots in it. This golden, breaded arancino is finished with dots of grated goat cheese. Shaved lamb shoulder, baby harukei turnip and two asparagus stalks as thin as licorice whip are served, still cooking, in a hot broth, a kaiseki version of shabu shabu. Odo -- incidentally, the name is pronounced as a set of initials, O.D.O. -- pursues local ingredients not just for its sushi course but throughout its menu. The simmered lamb used to gambol in the Hudson Valley, the croquetted topneck clams were raked in off Long Island and so on. Kaiseki's near-liturgical focus on timeliness almost seems to demand local ingredients, and they have been central to Niki Nakayama's strategy at n/naka in Los Angeles, but less so for New York's few kaiseki chefs. Chikara Sono at Kyo Ya , for instance, takes pains to import traditional ingredients from Japan the minute they're available. Mr. Odo came to New York as the chef of Kajitsu , the extraordinary restaurant on East 39th Street that follows the vegetarian cooking tradition known as shojin ryori, born centuries ago in Zen Buddhist temples. One contribution he made in his five years there was to freshen up the menus with more food grown nearby. In the first and last tastes of his February and March menus, he anchors Odo firmly in the New York region. When you sit down, you are immediately poured a cup of cold sake. It is brewed in Brooklyn, and it is very good, swirling with fresh-fruit aromatics. Then at the end, after the fresh fruit, Mr. Odo serves ice cream made with kasu, the creamy solids left over at the end of sake distillation. The ice cream looks like vanilla and tastes, not surprisingly, like fermented rice. This particular kasu is supplied by the same brewery in Brooklyn that makes the sake. Expanding his range to meat and fish at Odo, he has kept the resourcefulness that limitations encourage. Somewhere along the way Mr. Odo also picked up technical skills in traditions far outside kaiseki. Each night, in the gohan course, Odo offers a choice of three starchy dishes. This is where I encountered a very fine seafood curry over rice; an elegant bowl of short ramen noodles in king crab broth; and fresh soba served with little pieces of pickled vegetables and wasabi blossoms, looking a bit like broccoli florets but tasting like mustard. As with the cocktail and the sushi, each of these dishes could, if Mr. Odo wanted, be leveraged into separate specialized restaurants, or food-hall stands. You could tell yourself that $200 is a large amount of money for a single meal or you could say that for the chance to visit all these different establishments without leaving your seat, it's a pretty good deal.

Arrive before the fish shops along this famous, not-quite-faded Italian strip in the Bronx take in the iced clams and octopus for the night. Across from Dominick's, turn into the indoor market that Fiorello La Guardia ordered up. Move on past the hand-rolled cigars and the T-shirts reflecting various tenets of Bronx philosophy. Keep going beyond the scamorza, the soppressata and the ready-to-go heroes, and walk out the door on to Hughes Avenue. Just to the right is a spinning wheel that looks old enough to have been Rumpelstiltskin's and next to it, another door. Open it, walk inside. The short trip seems to have taken you back in time. The spinning wheel turns out to be just one piece in Cka Ka Qellu's collection of antique tools, stringed instruments, yokes, brass coffee mills, manual typewriters, dishes of hammered metal and embroidered costumes that the owner, Ramiz Kukaj, brought over from the old country. Some, he says, go back to the 18th century. The floors and walls seem to have been airlifted from an Albanian farmhouse, and the speakers play wistful folk tunes on traditional instruments, not the modern, globally aware wake-up calls of the brass band Fanfara Tirana . The restaurant is soaked in nostalgia. The other reason for the walk from Arthur Avenue is that it recapitulates a pattern that's repeated throughout this neighborhood, where the signs and menus facing the street are still written in Italian but many of the people in the back rooms, seasoning the sausages and frying the veal cutlets, are Albanian. Here and there, those Albanians have brought a little of their cuisine into those Italian businesses. Cumin-laden suxhuk sausages hang to dry in the salumerias. In some pizzerias, the burek challenges the Jamaican beef patty for outsider meat-pie supremacy. One such place, also owned by Mr. Kukaj, is in the Norwood neighborhood and is called Tradita. ( Ligaya Mishan reviewed it in 2017.) But if you want a deep-end Albanian experience, Cka Ka Qellu, pronounced SHA ka chell-OO, is the place to go. The kitchen does not focus on the seafood of Albania's Adriatic coast, or the more intensely Greek- and Turkish-leaning cuisine of its southern reaches. Instead, it heavily favors the north, which shares many dishes with the former components of Yugoslavia that are its neighbors. In particular there is a strong overlap with Kosovo, home to many ethnic Albanians including, at one time, Mr. Kukaj and his chef, Afrim Kaliqani. In their kitchen, yogurt and cream are everywhere, along with curds of soft fresh cheese and triangles of creamy, unsqueaky feta. A good portion of the menu could be described as things in a creamy white sauce. Another, entirely different portion could be described as creamy white sauce with things in it. Included in the second group are some of the dips that are almost obligatory at the start of your Cka Ka Qellu experience: tarator, tart yogurt with minced cucumbers, garlic and parsley, similar to tzatziki, but nearly as fluffy as whipped cream; cream stirred with bits of suxhuk to give it a pinkish tint and a suggestion of spice; and kajmak , which our server described as \"like butter for bread\" and I would say was like cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche blended with cream cheese and butter. (In parts of Albania, it would be made by boiling unpasteurized milk from water buffalo.) I found myself dipping sausages, vegetables and just about everything else into the kajmak, but it is exceptionally good with a warm slice of the bread that Cka Ka Qellu bakes in the pizza oven that is the first thing you see when you walk in. When the menu defines kacamak as \"cream with polenta,\" the cream in question is kajmak, stirred into a fine-grained, nearly white mass of cornmeal that takes on the lightly fluffed quality of really well-made mashed potatoes. Sometimes there is a creamy sauce where you don't expect one. Each slice of lecenik, a cornbread with spinach and cottage cheese that is so rich it is only a few rungs in the ladder from cheesecake, comes to the table under a spoonful of kajmak. Sometimes there is no creamy sauce where one would do some good. The restaurant's version of fli, the slow-baked, many-layered pancake, is served as a long, narrow wedge with no accompaniment, although it is somewhat less than fully tender and moist. Luckily it responds immediately to any spare yogurt you can forage from elsewhere on the table. The mantia, baked dumplings filled with ground veal and onions, will seem tough and dry, too, if you order them alone. The same mantia cooked with yogurt in a clay dish will seem perfect. Is there another restaurant in New York that makes as much use of veal, and as little of any other meat, as Cka Ka Qellu? It is the main ingredient in the restaurant's qofte, ground and mixed with onions and red pepper; and in its qebapa, mild skinless sausages cooked on the grill. (The sausages would be called cevapi in other corners of the Balkans, where they are likely to be made from lamb or beef.) Veal works its way into many of the clay-dish stews, including the veal tava, something like a Mediterranean ratatouille that got itself entangled with a meat-and-potato stew from another part of Europe. Rolled up with cheeses and smoked meat, breaded and fried, veal also serves as the filling for the alluring Skanderbeg. Named after a great patriotic hero of the 15th century, Skanderbeg is generally called Albania's national dish, although its resemblance to a kayak made from chicken cordon bleu renders it something of an outlier in the cuisine. Ladled along its crunchy, golden length is -- please rise and face Hughes Avenue -- a creamy white sauce. Eating all of this without a salad is unimaginable and probably unadvisable. Each of Cka Ka Qellu's several salads seems to consist of cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions and cheese in slightly different arrangements. If the vegetables were any fresher, you'd be embarrassed to eat them in public. Surprise appearances by olives and their ilk provide extra variety. Like the breads, the desserts are baked on site: syrup-soaked baklava, a nut cake called haxhimak, a sugar cookie with nuts pressed into the top whose Albanian name is sheqerpare. I like them best with coffee boiled on the stove in a long-handled brass pitcher and served on a matching tray, both of them engraved with ancient, geometric designs that repeat and repeat.

This is a familiar concept in Vietnam, where it is known as bo bay mon, as well as in San Jose, Calif., Houston and other areas with robust Vietnamese populations. In New York, where the Vietnamese restaurant scene is more anemic, bo bay mon is still a rarity. The rough outlines of the setup at Madame Vo, though, will be familiar to any New Yorker who has gone out for Korean barbecue. New York City bureaucracy is unwelcoming to the tabletop charcoal grills seen in Hanoi, so an electric grill under a metal screen is embedded in each table. Once the grill is switched on and the metal rods down at kneecap level begin to warm up, an array of sauces, condiments and vegetables will arrive. When the rods are red, a server with a pair of tongs will lay some meat down on the screen, return periodically to fiddle with it and eventually decide when it is ready to be eaten. The similarities with, say, Han Joo Chik Naeng Myun & BBQ in Queens end, of course, with the actual food. Yes, both offer lettuce for wrapping, but at Madame Vo BBQ it is part of a Vietnamese table salad, along with fresh herbs; raw cucumbers, pineapple and apple; and pickled carrots and daikon. The restaurant also sets out a nifty caddy that holds circles of rice paper and warm water, in a miniature bathtub, for wetting the paper until it is soft enough to fashion into rolls. Rather than gochujang and sesame oil, there is a classic Vietnamese nuoc cham, an intoxicatingly good version of the pineapple-and-fermented anchovy sauce known as mam nem, and lastly a tamarind sauce, which suggests Madame Vo BBQ can follow or leap over Vietnamese tradition at will. This is about what you'd expect if you've eaten at another restaurant, a few blocks north, simply called Madame Vo . Jimmy Ly is the chef in both places; he and his wife, Yen Vo, are the proprietors. Each was raised in the United States by immigrants from Vietnam, and like many children of immigrants they seem to be fluent not just in two languages but in two cultures, enabling them to serve dishes their families might recognize in a setting that outsiders might embrace. The wings at Madame Vo, sticky with caramel and fried garlic, are drive-straight-from-the-airport good. The restaurant produces some of the only pho in Manhattan worth talking about. One of them, in a porcelain bowl the size of a baptismal font, is filled with a potent beef broth, a short rib on the bone and enough other cuts to make a butcher smile. At least one dish at the couple's new restaurant can stand alongside the wings and the pho at their first: the oxtail congee. Congee, or chao thit bo, is customarily the last course in bo bay mon. It frequently takes the form of a cloudy beef-and-rice soup. Mr. Ly cooks his congee with some chicken stock until it has the consistency of polenta, then spoons over it some sweet and savory braised oxtails in honey, fish sauce and brown butter. Everything about it is wonderful, even the scallion greens on top. The first of the seven beefs is typically boi tai chanh, a raw beef salad, and this is a high point, too. Lean eye of round cut into thin pink sheets is the canvas for an action-painting whirl of fried shallots, raw red onions, chopped peanuts and slivers of fresh mint. Pretty standard stuff so far, but then Mr. Ly bathes the salad in tangerine-lime vinaigrette, which has a positively buoyant effect, and splashes it with a bright-green, lemony pulp of fresh rau ram pur\u00e9ed in oil. In the middle of this $59 menu come the grilled meats, the courses for which the table salad and rice paper wrappers have been waiting. The finest of these might be the relatively straightforward five-spice tongue, although the betel-leaf-wrapped bundles of seasoned ground beef -- bo la lot -- are soothing and stimulating at once, and the New York strip with marrow butter is a clever way to acknowledge Manhattan's own beef-eating rituals, even if it would draw blank stares on the streets of Saigon. If you, like me, are naturally skeptical when servers persistently push a big-ticket item, you might be tempted to blaze your own path through Madame Vo BBQ's menu. But once you've tried the bo bay mon you have, by and large, seen the kitchen at its best. Yes, you could get the whole catfish, and if you are not into beef perhaps you should. Despite what the menu says, the catfish is not grilled, but fried and then baked. It was perfectly done the night I had it, and was filleted at the table by a server who knew his way around a fish skeleton. By that time, all that was left to do was to wrap a chunk of fish in lettuce and rice paper with a squeeze of grilled lemon and some of the saut\u00e9ed shallots, lemongrass and bird chiles that the kitchen had ladled along the snaking curve of the spine. If you are thinking about a vegetable, the skewered and grilled okra pods in soy are crunchy and unslimy. The other appetizers, though, can be tricky. One night, the grilled scallop brushed with duck fat was transporting; on another, it tasted too much like the grill. Spring rolls filled with short rib and bone marrow seemed pointlessly indulgent, and so did their truffle hoisin dipping sauce in which I couldn't taste the truffles. A few dishes might have been improved if they'd arrived while hot, like the extra-large grilled oysters under caramelized sea urchin mayonnaise or the charred sea urchin, basted in its shell with butter, sake and fish sauce. Grilled prawns brushed with a lovely orange butter were slightly more mushy than two prawns sold for $38 should be. And while the 44-ounce tomahawk steak was more than a fair deal at $90, it would have been helped by a more aggressive sear and more salt. On certain nights, the whole operation had a slack, inattentive feeling that's rare in new restaurants. The catfish sat on the table, getting cold, while we waited for the table salad to show up. The thick stems of stir-fried morning glory would have been better cut into shorter lengths. Madame Vo BBQ may eventually run as smoothly as its older sibling. While it works out the mechanics, the surest route to happiness is to eat the bo bay mon while sipping cold coconut water through a metal straw out of a whole green coconut that you hold in one hand, like a cup of coffee.

The dish is Hong Kong-style won-ton noodle soup, though, which requires Maxi Lau, the chef and proprietor, to keep a large number of items on hand to be added to or subtracted from the soup at the customer's whim: the broth of pork bones boiled with dried shrimp; the skinny yellow noodles with their firm, elastic snap; the stewed beef cooked with a sizable pinch of five-spice powder; the dense fish balls streaked with scallions; the weightless, grease-free chips of fried fish skin; and so on. But the one item that is absolutely essential is the won ton. Make that plural -- won tons, as many as Ms. Lau will put into your bowl ($8). This turns out to be four if you also want noodles, and six if you don't. Years ago Ms. Lau's mother dreamed of opening a won-ton shop, and had gone to Toronto to learn the art of won-ton wrapping from a family friend. Those plans changed when she learned she had cancer. After she died, two years ago, Maxi Lau decided to rebuild her own life. Leaving her job in corporate management, she retraced her mother's steps, learning to make won tons with the same family friend. Three months ago, she started Maxi's as a pop-up every evening but Thursdays, taking over a Hong Kong-style breakfast and lunch cafe owned by an aunt in Flushing, Queens. Ms. Lau plans to set up a noodle soup shop of her own in another part of Flushing later this year. Until then, she is making more won tons than she expected, because customers keep coming back to buy them by the dozen, frozen. Ms. Lau's won tons are filled with a mixture of shrimp and pork, with the emphasis very much on the shrimp. Each bite -- it takes at least two to finish off a Maxi's Noodle won ton -- confirms that the shrimp are of very high quality and are cooked in a way that keeps them unusually crisp and juicy. You can see their bodies glowing pink through the thin skins of the wrappers, whose loose ends trail behind the plump, round won tons like comets' tails.

Another part is the sense of being in on a secret, eating at some place that doesn't have a Yelp entry and may not even have a name, while your friends are waiting in line at Roberta's . The mismatch between the borrowed space and the borrowers can send off sparks, too. Three years ago, when the Danish chef Bo Bech staged a one-night pop-up in the kitchen at Cosme in Manhattan, using ingredients he'd bought from farmers and shellfishers in Virginia the day before, his Mid-Atlantic-Nordic cooking stood out against the aromas of griddled masa and roasted chiles. When a pop-up settles down into a space of its own, it loses those things. In their place, it takes on the extra weight of proprietorship. The owners have to make decisions that were previously made for them, and those decisions will start to define them. It's their paint color on the wall, their scented candles in the bathroom, their name on the door. This is the position in which we find the former pop-up Oxalis and its chef, Nico Russell, a veteran of Daniel , in New York, and Mirazur , on the French Riviera. Beginning in 2016, Mr. Russell slalomed through a series of restaurants that would hand him the keys on off nights so he could cook tasting menus of 10 courses or so. First he inhabited Fitzcarraldo , an Italian restaurant whose combination of industrial, nautical, cinematic and Mediterranean elements has made it a frequent wedding site. Later he moved on to Egg , an austerely contemporary temple to breakfast which had begun its own life, more than a decade earlier, as a pop-up. He sold tickets to his Oxalis dinners, enough of them to get a few investors interested. With enough funding to take on a lease in Crown Heights, Oxalis opened in November in a former wine bar within sight of the Brooklyn Museum. Mr. Russell's vision for Oxalis is the one behind the bistronomie movement in France and its disciples abroad: carefully considered food served without the hoopla that drives up tabs. He slings a lot of vegetables in Oxalis's four- to six-course set menus, and it's one sign of his skill that this doesn't come across as a cost-cutting measure even though it must be, at least in part -- dinner is an extremely reasonable $60. Both the price and the understated cooking style reminded me of Contra , which opened with a five-course, $55 menu. The last time I went I ate a dish built around spaghetti-like strands of rutabaga under a warm snowdrift of whipped Alpine fontina. These two mild-tasting ingredients were set in motion by the force of a third, a dark and focused coffee-and-chicory cream sauce. This was a rutabaga that made me smile. Granted, I probably like rutabaga more than the average person, but I suspect that exposure to the rutabaga at Oxalis would make the average person realize that I'm right. Meals begin with a couple of bite-size snacks, one of which tends to be a crisp potato cake dusted with bay-leaf powder and topped with a chip of nori. It looks harmless enough, but can produce powerful emotions, which are easier to understand once you know that the potatoes are stewed in duck fat and then deep-fried. The other snack might be some lightly dehydrated beets brushed with marjoram-infused cream, or tiny grilled carrots that you dip in chamomile sabayon. (This is one of the dishes that suggests the long shadow of Noma , which in its early days famously matched aged carrots with chamomile.) The price seems meant to encourage frequent visits, but if you return often you may experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. At meals in December, January and February, I was always served some variation on raw sea scallops with daikon and apple and some version of duck breast, sweet potato and yogurt. The portions in both cases were restrained but the flavors were outsize. The scallops were cured in miso and refrigerated for a few days and came out of it with something like the concentration of flavor that beef gets from dry-aging, but none of the funk. The duck's flavor was less surprising, but there was some energy in its collision with sweet potato pur\u00e9e and fig-leaf yogurt tart enough to cause double-takes. Like the rest of the menu, desserts are unshowy but can be highly impressive. One worked goat milk up into a thing of beauty: Some of it was made into a simple frozen custard, the rest cooked down into cajeta. The cooking makes it clear why people chased Oxalis around Brooklyn in its various borrowed spaces, but other aspects of the restaurant suggest that it hasn't quite figured out how to live in a space of its own. A meal there can be a somewhat solemn experience, which doesn't seem to be what Mr. Russell and his partners are aiming for. The layout seems to work against it. The kitchen is right up front, and the bar is all the way in the back, separated from the dining room by a glass door in a glass wall. I can't imagine what the wall is for, unless Oxalis is planning to bring back the smoking section. Instead of serving as a street-side welcome and a source of energy for the dining room, the bar feels like a waiting room. And while it takes reservations, the tasting menu isn't served there. The bar menu is \u00e0 la carte. The dining room could use a little lift. It's as plain as a Shaker church, with clamshell-colored wainscoting below white walls unbroken by pictures or anything else. (All the art is in the restroom.) The way the servers have been coached on their lines so far underlines the decorative stiffness. They say stuff like \"Moving now into more sweet things \u2026\" rather than \"Here's your dessert,\" and my neighbor one night was instructed to \"sit back and relax,\" something that tends to go without saying in most restaurants. Things have loosened up since the liquor license came through. In the first few weeks, the servers were always trying to push a nonalcoholic beverage pairing for $20, and while the bar was mixing sodas that were more interesting than many cocktails around town, I'm not sure they were different enough from one another to justify drinking the whole slate. Now there are also wine pairings, starting at $35. Sometimes I wondered whether it would get the air circulating if the bar popped up in the dining room, or vice versa. There's probably some simple fix, or a series of them, that would give Oxalis some of its old sense of adventure. You can sense it lying there, waiting, when you taste that cajeta, those scallops, the fantastic little potato cakes.

At the same time, another style of French restaurant was dying off, but generally without benefit of a full obituary. This was the small, discreet bistro with forehead-height curtains in the windows, Piaf on the speakers, snails on the menu, chips on the china. They could be found uptown or downtown, almost always on a side street. Unlike Le Pavillon, La C\u00f4te Basque and their ilk, and unlike Keith McNally's immersive brasserie sets , which came later, these bistros were rarely fashionable. They were filled with professors and psychotherapists, Paris Review readers and Film Society of Lincoln Center members. Occasionally a passer-by out walking the dog would stand on tiptoe to peer over the curtain, but paparazzi did not stake out the doors of these establishments. Individually, few were landmarks. Collectively, their quiet continental self-assurance, their indifference to the passage of time, not to mention their cr\u00e8mes br\u00fbl\u00e9es and blood sausages and Fleuries, helped form the backdrop of the city. You always thought you'd have one within walking distance. Then, one day, you didn't. Bistro Pierre Lapin , which the chef and restaurateur Harold Moore opened last May in the West Village, is either a very late entry into the genre, or else a homage of impressive intensity. The dining room has the forehead-height curtains -- green gingham. It has Piaf on the playlist, and also Pink Martini's \"Sympathique,\" which has become the \"Vie en Rose\" of the Spotify era, for better or worse. Pierre Lapin also throws in some frills that go beyond the basic formula. White tapers burn on every table, wall sconces throw off Cognac-colored light from behind lampshades the size of teacups, a collection of thin flowery china dishes supplements the chunky white bistro ware. Most of all, Pierre Lapin has that rich, creamy, antique cooking -- all the stuff nouvelle cuisine tried to kill. As soon as you order, you get a preview of what you're in for: A length of chewy, substantial baguette arrives with a small mound of cultured butter, a pile of truffled cheese spread and a pink hunk of rustic pork p\u00e2t\u00e9. On a quiet night at home, this could serve as a light dinner. At Pierre Lapin, it is a little snack to stave off hunger before the appetizers. Going back at least as far as his days at Commerce , Mr. Moore has seemed at home with profuse helpings and sauces that settled over them like a goose-down duvet over a sleeping Saint Bernard. After closing that restaurant, he opened an ode to Southern immoderation called Harold's Meat & Three, now just Harold's ; the most memorable thing I've eaten there was a Kentucky hot brown sandwich on which the Mornay sauce flowed freely. He also briefly ran a less focused study of Americana called the Greenwich Grille, where I ate a chicken potpie that I thought had potential. About a week later, I learned that the place had closed. None of Mr. Moore's previous kitchens went for the gut quite as gleefully as Pierre Lapin's. Your first course there could well be, and almost certainly will be if you leave the choice to me, an avalanche of mushrooms in cream cascading over the edge of a tall slab of buttered and griddled pain de mie. But it would be a mistake to overlook the Brie au four, roughly half a pound of baked Brie melting among dried figs and walnuts, all served with toasted baguette. I ended up ordering the Brie for the table, which freed somebody else to get the very meaty frogs' legs in a small lake of parsley, garlic, butter and lemon juice, while another guest tried the \"balle de matzo en consomm\u00e9.\" In English, that means a nice bowl of chicken soup with a single matzo ball so densely packed that if you tossed it out of a second-story window it would probably put a dent in a car hood. This is not a bad trait in a matzo ball unless you happen to own the car. The lusty tune begun by the appetizers is picked up by the main courses. There is a fairly classic coq au vin, not too winy-tasting; some hefty sea scallops under toasted almonds, sensibly outfitted with endive and citrus sections; and a grouping of gnocchi, foie gras, saut\u00e9ed sweetbreads and mushrooms, black truffle shavings and puffy chicken dumplings, all milling around in a Cognac-flamed cream sauce. It sounds insanely overcrowded, but is very rewarding to unpack. We have only scratched the surface of the menu. It goes on, perhaps longer than it should, because some dishes are more appealing than others. A black sea bass \"bonne femme\" was simply dull instead of simple. The soupy, thin cassoulet could have used more meat and a thicker crust of bread crumbs. The garlic sauce Mr. Moore made for snails tasted less garlicky than run-of-the-mill snail butter; the snails and I never figured out what we were supposed to do with the sunny-side-up egg planted in the middle of the plate. The menu could be trimmed by about a third. The same is most likely true for a few individual dishes, although Mr. Moore's shambolic, celebratory cooking style is one of the reasons Pierre Lapin works as well as it does. If he tidied everything up he'd be going head-to-head with Le Coucou , a contest that would not play to his strengths. The excess, the untucked shirttails on the dishes, the incomplete thoughts on the menu are part of the restaurant's charm. That charm does not quite extend to the wine list, which looks like one from four decades ago. It's almost entirely drawn from Bordeaux, Burgundy and the Rhone, with very few bottles under $75. This seems to be taking the joke a little too far -- in 1971, you could still get cheap Bordeaux. I drank well, but I always spent more on it than I meant to, which is the kind of thing that can keep diners from coming back. For dessert there is a coconut cake that has little to do with France. Dense and rich in a homespun American style that some people will love and others will find too leaden, it followed Mr. Moore here from Commerce, where it was a big hit. Other members of the lineup you already know. The chocolate mousse is deliciously dark, though not as airy as it could be. The sugar crust on the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is burned to order. Both are overshadowed, though, by a peculiarly likable Pavlova. It is conceived as a tart, with a meringue crust and a whipped-cream topping; once it is sliced into a white wedge, bright yellow passion-fruit curd runs down its sides. Anna Pavlova would not recognize it, but she would have liked its sense of theater. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

Like a dutiful younger brother, the second restaurant is supposed to work harder, please more people, make fewer demands, be more pragmatic and smile as the firstborn sucks up all the attention. There is rarely any confusion about these roles. Bouchon Bakery & Caf\u00e9 doesn't try to waylay customers toddling toward Per Se 's blue door and tempt them into having a quiche and salad instead. Sometimes, though, younger siblings who follow the rules can still pull off some quiet subversion. This summer, the chefs Jeremiah Stone and Fabian von Hauske opened a wine bar two doors down Orchard Street from their showcase restaurant, Contra . The new place, called Wildair , plays its part exactly as written. And somehow, in a subtle and charming way, the kid upstages his big brother. Contra does laid-back refinement as well as any downtown restaurant, and the two chefs pack an impressive amount of nuance into its six- or seven-course set menus. Wildair is the one I want to go back to, though. I want to camp out at a high table, taste everything new on the menu to see whether it clicks and pillage the stash of natural wines like Genghis Khan. Format matters. Contra's is a concise tasting menu, and tasting menus are the parchment scrolls on which chefs inscribe their Magna Cartas with goose-quill flourishes. Wildair borrows its format from contemporary European wine bars such as Manfreds & Vin in Copenhagen and Le Dauphin in Paris, places that extend a hand inviting us to try something new, drink a strange gamay bottled by an ornery old hermit, eat a little of this and a little more of that while we catch up, unwind and make plans. You visit Contra. Wildair is a restaurant you can live in. The food isn't necessarily better, but it's often more inventive. You wouldn't guess that from scanning the menu, reading down from oysters and cheese to fried squid and steak. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske are serving familiar, likable food. But instead of tying them down, this seems to have given them permission to lift off with extra altitude. The squid is fried along with sliced lemons and sections of green onion. Everything is contained in a golden shell that is implausibly light and crunchy, with no hint of sogginess. Potato flour mixed with masa is the secret of the batter. A garlic-powered squid-ink aioli gives the dish some staying power. The secret of Wildair's white shrimp with celery is probably the shrimp themselves, netted off the coast of Georgia. But the kitchen augments their unmistakably wild flavor by patiently stewing them in garlic-piment\u00f3n oil, heads and all. On my first two outings at Wildair, I passed up the pork rillettes, suspecting that they were outsourced. They are not. They are beautifully made on site, smooth and pinkish and creamy in a glass bowl sealed with a white blanket of fat. I spread the rillettes on thin toast and took a bite, letting the fat and its warm, holiday flavor of ginger and other seasonings melt on my tongue. I almost skipped the lettuce, too, suspecting that it was lettuce. I was right about that but wrong about skipping it. With squiggles of butter-and-caramelized-lettuce dressing insinuated into its folds and some chopped pistachios on top, the sweet Little Gem lettuce makes for one of those ideal salads that is as complicated as it needs to be and no more. The dream date for that lettuce would be the dry-aged Wagyu steak, slick with melted beef fat and so tender it doesn't seem entirely real. It might have made me dizzy if I hadn't already been reeling over the price, $70 for roughly 25 ounces of meat, sliced from the bone, that two companions and I ate while luxuriating in the oak-and-steel embrace of Wildair's stools. (The discomfort is more acute at the narrow counters on either side of the dining room.) For the average mortal's budget, the beef tartare is a more accessible lettuce partner. Chopped into bits that are big enough to chew, the meat is crunchy with toasted buckwheat, hot with fresh horseradish, and sharp with gratings of tangy smoked Cheddar. Though the two chefs seem liberated by cooking for a simple wine bar , this freedom sometimes leads them off the path. Wet blobs of below-par sea urchin had no business glopping up an excellent potato cake I ate in the early summer. The texture of whole clams and flabby cubes of lardo over griddled bread with spinach wasn't as appealing as the flavor. The kitchen may also want to cut the squid and green onions into smaller pieces; you want to eat them with your fingers, but they're so big you almost need a knife and fork. Mr. von Hauske is the baker of the two. The dense white sourdough with the fantastically crisp crust that he makes at Contra is sold at Wildair, too, this time with a dish of salted olive oil that catches nicely in your throat. For dessert, he has come up with a very likable panna cotta; the sweetness comes from soft shavings of watermelon granite and a crumble of caramelized milk. There's also a chocolate-peanut butter tart that tastes exactly the way I've always wished a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup tasted. One sign of how well Wildair works is that nearly everybody I know who has dropped in has a story about discovering a new wine. The central character in most of these stories is Jorge Riera, the wine director here and at Contra and a soft-spoken but ardent advocate for winemakers who believe in letting nature have its way. I owe him for introducing me to a biodynamic fino sherry from Andalusia and an elegantly honeysuckle-scented grenache blanc from Catalonia, among others. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske named their wine bar for a prizewinning racehorse that lived in the neighborhood before the Civil War. Mr. von Hauske believes it should be pronounced \"willed air,\" but almost everybody calls the place \"wild air.\" Maybe everybody is wrong, or maybe this is just a case of a younger sibling claiming its own identity.

But let's not argue. Let's talk about Houseman. It's on Greenwich Street in Hudson Square, on a block that the rest of the city forgot about after the Holland Tunnel was built and then suddenly remembered a few years ago. Across the street is a glass-and-steel apartment house by the architect Winka Dubbeldam . It looks like a venetian blind that got tangled up with the building next door. If I lived there, I would have been happy in July when the lights came on inside Houseman, illuminating the white brick walls and pale wood tables and chairs. By now, I'd know the hosts who stand in the doorway or on the sidewalk. And one of my daily routines would be checking out the changes on the menu, which is laid out like a newspaper's front page. Print lives! The date runs at the top to the left of the restaurant's name. A weather report is on the right. (\"Gray. Cooler!\") In the middle is a cryptic drawing; one night it looked like a pumpkin with some dangerous ideas. All around the page are boxes. One suggests an inexpensive wine, and another proposes a cocktail made with ingredients you've heard of. The rest are occupied by things that I am always very interested in eating. Since the chicken is the above-the-fold story, let's start there. In fact, it is half a bird, with parsley salad scattered on top and a thick slab of grilled bread spread with roasted garlic on the side. But in every other way, it is a classic Sunday night roast chicken. In restaurants, I manage to get a chicken like this roughly once out of every 50 attempts. At home, my average is closer to one in 12. I tasted Houseman's on three nights, and it was equally irresistible every time, juicy in every flap and joint. Ned Baldwin, who owns the restaurant and, with Adam Baumgart, runs the kitchen, said they weigh each bird before calculating how much salt to rub into its skin. However they do it, this is a roast chicken that you want to settle down with and take apart piece by piece. Most of the food at Houseman is like that. You don't taste it in politely appreciative nibbles. You throw yourself at it until there's nothing left. No menu layout can convey this quality, but when you find a restaurant that has it, you come back. The kitchen grinds sausages and grinds them well. One night, they were made from goat. If the words goat sausage conjure up a dry and wrinkled meat pouch, these were the opposite: pink, broad, juicy and gently spiced, offered up as a main course with a jammy tomato sauce and a bracing salad of dandelion leaves. Another night brought sweet pork sausages grilled then simmered, Portuguese style, with steamed clams, and very good. Houseman had an ideal late-summer dinner in its swordfish salad, a salade ni\u00e7oise by other means. Hunks of fish, poached and then packed in olive oil and sitting on a mat of tuna mayonnaise, were surrounded by little potatoes, string and shell beans, and some cherry tomatoes roasted so they collapsed on your tongue. The menu is top-heavy with appetizers. Like that swordfish main course, they lean on seasonal produce given a Mediterranean cast. Roasted peaches were yielding and honey-sweet alongside chopped hazelnuts, crumbs of feta and crinkles of grilled pancetta. Drippingly ripe tomatoes, real September beauties, were submitted to a fantastic Middle Eastern treatment of sesame seeds, cumin and parsley, underscored by the tingling sourness of sumac. A long, skinny eggplant, its grilled skin stripped off to expose its pale flesh, was dressed with bright-green basil oil and sat on a swirl of uncannily smooth and lemony tahini. Can tahini be luxurious? This was. Even the snacks, often pandering little throwaways, are worthwhile at Houseman. Salted fried favas, as brown and crunchy as a nut, are a cocktail-hour treat with a Pat Flynn (a rum and Coke you can drink without losing your self-respect). A soft-cooked egg, split and topped with capers, anchovies and fried leek threads, is a fine idea, too. Houseman's dining room, which has an upright, right-angled, vaguely New England look, provides enough traditional comforts that the scarcity of main courses on the menu seems out of character. Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Baumgart may offer so many more appetizers because they expect a lot of customers to make a meal of them. But when there are typically just four or five main courses, and one of these is a burger, the margin of error is small. Sometimes, Houseman falls outside it. That burger -- two flat patties under melted cheese and a mushroom-onion topping -- deserves a better bun than the flavorless and somewhat dry one it gets, especially at $17. (Crisp but preposterously salty fries cost an extra $2.) When a fillet of striped bass poached in court bouillon with clam juice is sold at $85 for two people, it shouldn't be as overcooked as mine was. The dessert menu, which comes to the table written on an abacus chalkboard, runs into the same trouble. One of just three slots was thrown away on a scoop of lackluster blackberry sorbet in a nest of broken-up celery sorbet. The celery was more intense than the blackberry, which did not make it a better dessert. It's lucky the other two choices were so good: a peanut tart that's like pecan pie without all the goo, and a sundae of wonderful malt ice cream with cherries in syrup. Houseman is still a young restaurant, with room to grow. A better hamburger bun should not be hard to come by. Already it gives you something that a lot of places never do: a sense that almost everything was cooked for a reason. Until recently, Mr. Baldwin was the chef de cuisine at Prune , which gives you the same sense. Prune's owner, Gabrielle Hamilton , was underrated as a chef for years because, I think, she never seems to invent anything in the kitchen. She isn't big on shotgun marriages of ingredients. But she understands the pleasure, part animal and part something else, that we take from food that is direct and honest. Many chefs have ideas about how to cook. The really good ones have ideas about how to eat. Ms. Hamilton does, and so do the two chefs at Houseman.

He named the place he opened in June, across 42nd Street from Bryant Park, after himself, but it could just as easily be called the Modern in Exile. He took along the Modern's pastry chef, Marc Aumont, a virtuoso of desserts and breads who worked at his side for the restaurant's first nine years. He replicated its two-in-one structure, too. In the bar, where gooseneck streetlamps crane out over low tables, he has an approachable menu, some of it Alsatian, like rustic tartes flamb\u00e9es and the greatest liverwurst in the five boroughs. Things get far more elaborate once you enter the dining room, behind a ring of rough timber beams pulled from a Vermont barn. In that space, Mr. Kreuther imported the four-course $98 prix fixe format that was in place when I gave the Modern's dining room operation three stars in 2013. He has reproduced much of his last restaurant's tone, too, with formal but cheerful servers raising bell-shaped glass lids from main courses in synchrony and quickly running a silver sweeper over every crumb that falls on the white tablecloths. Mr. Kreuther did not make off with the Modern's wine cellar, but he charged Emilie Perrier with building a new one that is only slightly less impressive. There are treats from all over, but the excellent bottles from Alsace are a special pleasure. And of course, Mr. Kreuther brought his recipes. Here is the palm-size tart of smoked sturgeon and sauerkraut under a dandelion-colored mousseline with a gleaming black eye of caviar. There is the cushion of foie gras between two firm pieces of squab breast, trickling with red juices, all bundled up inside savoy cabbage and a papery shell of brik pastry. Both are as marvelous as I remembered. Like much of the cooking at this new restaurant, these dishes make an irresistible case for the power of classical European techniques, all the blade-flicking and stock-skimming tricks that Mr. Kreuther swings around so easily. A native of Alsace, his skills forged by the martial discipline of French, German and Swiss restaurants, Mr. Kreuther makes no effort to hide his old-school training. Rising up from a pool of cantaloupe sauce (an idea as cool as the chilled sauce itself) was a foie gras terrine. Any foie gras from Mr. Kreuther's kitchen is pretty much guaranteed to be wonderful; this one was molded into a dome studded all over with purplish cubes of duck prosciutto, each no bigger than a pinhead. A smaller brunoise may be technically possible, but it would require lasers. Fried frog meat in the lightest sheath of batter was bunched up at the end of a leg bone pared as clean as a toothpick; you dunk these drumsticks in a lemony garlic bouillon so bright and focused that you can almost see the worried face of the cook who watched the pot. Two things about this fine-grained precision. First, it is about as fashionable as acid-washed jeans. Younger chefs are scattering ashes over whole leaves, splashing buttermilk in a bowl and calling it a sauce, and trying to hide signs of human manipulation. Mr. Kreuther's dishes look as unmistakably man-made as a skyscraper, and his sauces were obviously produced in a stockpot, not an udder. Second, Mr. Kreuther uses technique with purpose. The point of cutting duck ham into microcubes is that you taste some with every bite of foie gras smashed on toasted brioche. So before dismissing this grand Midtown dining room as a horse-drawn carriage in the age of Uber, sit down and see how exciting a little knifework can be. Notionally, dinner is made up of four courses. In reality, new things stream out of the kitchen in an endless slot-machine cascade. Before the first course, three miniature dishes arrive at once. Each is a distinct event. The last time I camped out at a table, I wanted to pocket my guests' cracker-and-sweet-potato sandwiches. A new bread from Mr. Aumont's oven shows up every few minutes, each with its own spread. The parade starts with a warm, savory kugelhopf, still in its ceramic mold, with chive fromage blanc. It is so good that one of my guests nibbled on it while telling our server that she didn't eat gluten. A few minutes later, she was given a plate of the best gluten-free bread I've ever met. I don't think Mr. Aumont can make a dessert I wouldn't like. He is always toying around with forms and shapes; the high point, so to speak, of his great chocolate-and-cherry dessert is a towering dark-chocolate cone that melts while you watch. But his games never interfere with the flavors, which stay clear and direct. Pineapple carpaccio is hidden under a tuile and a spoonful of herb sorbet (lime leaf, Thai basil), but you're never in doubt that the fruit is carrying the melody. The savory courses don't always have the same focus. Mr. Kreuther has a lot to say, but at times you wish he wouldn't say it all at once. A sweet, charred whole tomato was overcome by its seasonings, especially garlic and black pepper, and by the cup of dark gazpacho that tasted like an unspicy virgin Mary and didn't add any clarity. Far more distracting, though, is the crazily gaudy collection of tableware. Gabriel Kreuther would be a more elegant restaurant if the simple, well-designed service pieces from the Modern had come along for the trip. Servers place a different set of elongated forks and spoons on a black blotter before every course, and at moments balancing food on the end of one of these feels like a game from a small child's birthday party. Some courses arrive on crystal dishes with a spike on the bottom; you're told you can hold it by the spike or nest it into a kind of crystal inkwell, but what you can't do is eat the food without thinking about the thing it's sitting on. This pointless eccentricity goes on and on. Tableware salesmen must have scratched a symbol on the door that means \"easy mark,\" like a hobo sign. At first the interior, designed by Glen Coben, also struck me as too frantic. Mr. Coben juxtaposes those barn pillars with copper panels, glazed tiles and wallcoverings boldly printed with storks and flowers. It's a little loony, but somehow all these elements together bring warmth and energy to a room that has at its core a deeply comfortable and rewarding white-tablecloth restaurant.

Founded by Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich in 2003, it was among the earliest and most influential restaurants to twist the Spanish tapas idiom into what New Yorkers learned to call small-plates dining. The Casa Mono style has spread far and wide, leaving in its wake a trail of cluttered tables, unpredictably sequenced dishes, and diners reduced to asking pathetically, \"Will that be enough food?\" All of this might earn Casa Mono the historical notoriety bestowed on early tremors of annoying or inconvenient trends, like the first spam email, if it weren't the case that almost everyone agrees that Casa Mono has always been very good. To that I'll add a contention of my own. The pleasures of eating there are both richer and more varied than in 2004, when this tiny, perpetually crowded restaurant was last reviewed in The New York Times. (Marian Burros gave it two stars .) Andy Nusser, the executive chef and an owner, kept the tapas fairly uncomplicated in the early days. Roasted piquillo peppers filled with juicy braised oxtail were on the menu then, are there now, and probably will be forever. The seared skirt steak, served with sweet stewed onions and a romesco that crunches with coarsely chopped almonds, is still one of the most elementally satisfying one-course meals near Union Square. It's even better if you eat it alone at the bar, which may be your only option on those nights when reservations are impossible. But over the years, the kitchen has branched out into cooking that a Catalan tapas-bar proprietor might squint at before deciding that tapas do not always need to be interpreted with a strict-constructionist approach. In this era of sea urchin overload, there is still a wild thrill to be had from the sweet and briny orange lobes at Casa Mono, stirred with chopped walnuts and lime zest into very soft scrambled eggs that have been splashed with colatura. The menu calls this condiment \"ancient anchovy oil.\" How ancient I have no idea, but from the looks of happy disbelief around the table, I'd say just ancient enough. Or take the section of the menu called \"Whole Organic Animals.\" You may ask how a small plate can hold a whole animal larger than a quail. What the menu is trying to say is that Casa Mono buys entire beasts that once browsed on Hudson Valley pastures, then carves them up and serves them in portions that in Spain would be called raciones. Casa Mono's drive into meatier terrain is largely the doing of Anthony Sasso, named chef de cuisine in 2008 when Mr. Nusser shifted most of his attention to other Batali restaurants. Mr. Sasso learned to swing a cleaver at Fleisher's , the nose-to-tail butcher shop in Kingston, N.Y. This is one butcher-chef who does not try to hand you a dripping bouquet of snouts and spleens. Most of his \"whole animal\" dishes are ones that even cautious carnivores may try. And try they should, because the reward will be flavors whose depth and complexity are still too rare in American meat. Streaky lamb belly, rolled around tomatoes and raisins, had an extremely alluring balance of chewy lean and tender fat; the quality of the meat made the splash of mint salsa verde seem like a new idea. Lamb leg, with its more untamed flavor, was braised in cider and cinnamon, then folded into a sweet and nutty mole, with a memorable trace of bittersweetness that came from dark Spanish chocolate. A slab of goat confit, patiently simmered in olive oil, had a clear, clean flavor. Goat responds well to extra richness, which it got from guacamole strengthened by goat cheese, and from half an avocado cured in sugar. Bricks of meaty and very tender pork belly came with fried plantains, thin slices of honey-cured ham, pickles, garlic and a honey-banana mustard whose sweetness didn't go over the top. As loaded with surprises as it was with flavor, this was Mr. Sasso's tribute to the Cuban sandwich. Seafood is a major theme on the menu, too, and usually a rewarding one. Four razor clams cooked on a plancha and sloshed with olive oil would have been great if one of the four hadn't been nearly raw. But baby octopus from the same plancha were tender inside and lightly crunchy along their suckers; they were served with shaved fennel and lumps of pink grapefruit, as they have been since Mr. Nusser dreamed up the dish a decade ago. The crema catalana hasn't changed, either. Burned sugar still tops the custard like thin black ice. It still comes with bay leaf fritters. You still eat these by pinching the stem, biting down and stripping the sweetly scented dough away from the leaf with your teeth. Other desserts have added layers of polyphony. The most rambunctious of all involves bite-size churros, their crisp ridges pressed into chocolate ganache. A scoop of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ice cream is painted maroon by a sauce based on Spain's demented and inspired spritzer, red wine and Coca-Cola, fortified with cherries. It's a perfectly controlled dessert that seems to be on the verge of total, wanton collapse. Mr. Batali's other restaurants treat the Hudson Valley as if it were a lost region of Italy. Casa Mono does something similar, using the Greenmarket down the block as if it were the Mercat de la Boqueria in Barcelona, Spain. A softball-size heirloom tomato is dotted with popcorn-flavored aioli; pickled hot peppers are tossed over a voluptuous blob of burrata that sprawls across anchovy toast. The wines, of course, make a longer trip. In a miracle of space management, this micro-restaurant keeps what has to be the deepest, most pleasure-packed trove of Spanish wine in the city. The sherries alone, many bottled by the young, treasure-hunting Equipo Navazos firm, could see you through a solid month of meals. Titans like Pingus and Palacios are available for those who can pay for them, but Rachel Merriam, the wine director, has filled the list with well-priced discoveries, too. I found plenty of them with the help of sommeliers who seem to know instinctively when to stick with tradition and when to go off road. A request for something that would drink like cru Beaujolais was answered with a soft red Txakolina that had a bittersweet finish. And despite the crowds, the sommeliers always had time to talk. If you have questions about fractional aging, as we did, Casa Mono is the place for you. The sommeliers are so attentive that I didn't feel neglected one night when I couldn't quite figure out which server was in charge of our table. Service can be a little diffuse at times. In a place this size, though, help is never far away. Only three items (including a rabbit, in multiple parts) are listed at more than $20 on the menu, which runs from noon to midnight. The dining room, with glass doors on 17th Street that swing open in warm weather, is at its most charming in the slack hours between lunch and dinner. Even when packed, though, the little room has pockets of, if not privacy, then at least intimacy. The mosaic tile floors are now so worn down they look like Roman ruins. It's hard to remember when they were new. Hard to recall a time before small plates, too, and harder still to find a New York restaurant where they are satisfying, one after another, as at Casa Mono.

Last week at Superiority Burger , a vegetarian medium-fast-food outfit in the East Village, it changed in the middle of my meal. I was eating a tofu wrap and a salad of tender red-veined chard with pickled onions and juice-heavy blackberries at one of the six seats. These have swing-down desktops that remind me of college lecture halls and the old Prime Burger that used to sit across 51st Street from St. Patrick's Cathedral. You can occupy an individual burger desk in a popular restaurant for only so long before the urge to let somebody else sit down becomes overpowering. So when I got back in line to place a second order at the counter, I asked for takeout. The chard salad, served like most of the vegetables in a paper boat, was no more. Taped to the spot on the white-tiled wall where its name had been written on a white card in black marker was something new: juicy green heirloom tomatoes with chopped corn. I wondered if one of the cooks had just tried out a new dish on Brooks Headley , the chef and owner, and he'd said, at 7:30 in the evening, \"Let's do it.\" That was not far off, it turned out. \"We've come up with a lot of our specials during little lulls in service,\" Mr. Headley, who was the pastry chef at Del Posto until he opened Superiority Burger in June, told Lucky Peach recently. \"Everybody runs down to the basement and picks up a project.\" New ideas fly through the kitchen so quickly, you can almost hear them buzz by. This is what elevates Superiority Burger above what it appears to be at first glance, a Shake Shack for vegetarians. And it's why going back regularly, as I've been doing, is an adventure. The avid experimentations of Mr. Headley and his cooks remind me of what was going on in the first year at Momofuku Noodle Bar , when David Chang and Joaquin Baca were on the edge of giving up and came back by cooking as if it were their last chance. Nothing at Superiority Burger contains meat, and most dishes can be made without animal products on request. Some of them you can be sure of finding every time, including the veggie burger that was famous from pop-ups before the restaurant opened. Others arrive out of nowhere and disappear a day or a week later. When it is among the specials taped to the wall, a meatless analogue of the Philadelphia cheesesteak interests me keenly. Shaved steak had been traded in for strips of yuba, the immortal Cheez Whiz for a smooth, subtly flavorful species of cashew cheese. The yuba mostly worked as texture; the flavor, which was strong and lasting, burst out of a spicy swirl of soft, deeply browned onions and green peppers. That sandwich did not mimic the flavor of a cheesesteak but conjured up enough of the sensations touched off by a cheesesteak to be an honest variation, not a fake. It was both heartfelt homage and its own, craveable thing. It wasn't on the wall last time; I look forward to our reunion one day. The same goes for the ice-cold smashed cucumbers that seemed to have collided, in one of those fortuitous you-got-chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter accidents, with what tasted like spicy rice pudding. (Personal and confidential to the roasted fingerlings and eggplant last seen wearing capers and pine nuts in a radiant lemon vinaigrette: Please come back. I won't ask where you've been if you don't ask me about the chard salad.) When it comes to Mr. Headley's gelati and sorbets, I try to adopt a Buddha-like state of nonattachment. These appear in a different two-scoop duet each night, one sorbet of ripe fruit straight from the market sharing a small paper cup with a dairy-based gelato. Last time, it was peach sorbet under gelato made with toasted hamburger buns; there were roasted peaches between them and a powder of the toasted buns, soaked in milk and dried, dusted over the top. When my Zen intentions weaken and I find myself wanting it again, I meditate on the impermanence of life as represented by a seductively lush nectarine sorbet I tasted a month ago. Wearing the paper cap of an old-time burger flipper or soda jerk, Mr. Headley takes care to serve his ice creams just cold enough to slide when they touch your tongue. But they won't be melting; if you have ordered it with dinner and sat down at one of the burger desks, he'll wait until you've finished before he picks up the scoop. I can't think of a better, more meticulously put-together $4 dessert in the city. To my taste, it outshines the sandwich for which the place is named. The Superiority Burger is indeed superior to many other veggie burgers, but truly loving it may require a built-in desire for veggie burgers that I lack. Filling out its small Martin's potato bun, layered with melted Muenster, iceberg lettuce, roasted plum tomatoes, brown honey mustard and pickles, the patty is seared to an energetic crackle and has a satisfyingly tender bulk. The buildup is almost too convincing, because the patty itself, which tastes of mashed beans, nuts and grains, breaks the illusion. For a ground-beef fan, the Superiority Burger takes you almost all the way, then stops. Among the sandwiches on the permanent roster, I prefer the Sloppy Dave. This is, of course, a meatless sloppy Joe, a sesame-seed roll filled with tofu in a marvelously spicy tomato sauce, with fried onions on top. I should say \"usually filled with tofu\"; the sandwich was almost all sauce on a first encounter, but it had more substance on subsequent tries. The menu's nicest surprise is the Superiority Wrap, a whole-wheat tortilla encasing tofu and brown rice. A similar item is a staple of earnest vegetarian restaurants, where it typically tastes like a paper-towel tube packed with pulverized drywall moistened with Morrissey's tears. The Superiority Wrap is a much more rewarding proposition. The rice has an excellent nutty taste. Shredded cabbage has a refreshing effect. A streak of bright tahini whirred with roasted sweet and hot peppers cuts through the tofu like a searchlight. And I loved the playful sweetness provided by a vein of candied sunflower seeds. The aesthetics of Superiority Burger are half-White Castle , half-punk. The menu board and signs borrow the stencils and ransom-note lettering from rock's safety-pin-and-spit era. Music swerves from Wire and the Clash to proto-punks like the y\u00e9-y\u00e9 singer Karina. The prices, which peak at $9 for the wrap, are as democratic as it gets. Mr. Headley, a hard-core-band drummer, leads his restaurant with the collaborative spirit of a musical style that gave up peacock guitar solos for blitzkrieg-bopping ensemble playing. He'll tell anybody who asks that the cucumber salad isn't his, but the work of a sous-chef, Julia Goldberg, and his menu is loaded with shout-outs to other chefs and restaurants. The chard salad had \"Zuni pickled onions,\" and raspberry sorbet came with \"CF cream cheese gelato.\" \"Does CF stand for cruelty free?\" a customer asked. \"No, Claudia Fleming.\" Another name you may hear, if you go more than once, is your own. The woman at the counter surprised me one night by remembering not just my fake name but the real one of the last person I had brought. This was more than standard critic-spotting. She showed me a stack of yellow Post-it notes with the names of repeat customers. \"I'm trying to learn them all,\" she said.

The restaurant is on the second floor of the New York Edition hotel, which opened in the skyscraper at the foot of Madison Avenue in May. Marriott and Ian Schrager, who run the place, brought in the restaurateur Stephen Starr to operate the Clocktower. To get there, you can take the elevator from the lobby, or you can disappear up what looks like a big white cocoon into a tight spiral staircase. Upstairs, burning candles in glass lanterns flank the floor of the elevator bank. Somebody, maybe you, will notice this too late and kick one over. \"Don't worry, it happens all the time,\" a host says, not all that reassuringly. She leads you past the billiards table upholstered in felt the color of grape jelly and into the bar, where you rescue a female friend who has been sent there to wait for the rest of your party. She has been there just long enough to stand uncomfortably while every man in the room checks her out. The Clocktower plays a familiar game, the private club that has accidentally let you in. There are three small, connected dining rooms. Yours has a dark green marble fireplace big enough to roast a goat. Above the wainscoting of book-matched burl and below the wedding-cake crown moldings, original fixtures ordered up by some long-dead insurance executive, hang framed photographs in black and white, one above another, gallery style. They show celebrities from the 1950s, '60s and '70s, dozens and dozens of them. When you ask about one, a server brings you an explanatory booklet printed on heavy paper stock. Your waiter wants to talk about the menu. Seafood is listed under Seafood and salads under Salads. You nod. Orders placed, you get a small round loaf of bread, cut in quarters, steaming. \"I.P.A.-rye sourdough with buttermilk and butter.\" The crust shatters on impact; the crumb has a prickle of tartness. In five minutes, you want another loaf. When the seafood-under-Seafood arrives, you know the bread was a preview of what's in store. There's citrus-marinated shaved fennel, so bright that it tingles, over the chilled lobster salad served in its shell. A sweet king crab leg with cucumber-pickle curls and dashi jelly rides high on chipped ice spread out over a silver pedestal. Cubes of raw scallop and hamachi are spread over a chunky pesto that's surprisingly right. This chef can cook. Who is he, anyway? His name is Jason Atherton . You'll read later that he was raised in an English resort town on the North Sea, where his parents ran a small hotel. That he spent five years working for Gordon Ramsay. Like Mr. Ramsay, he now has restaurants in London and around the world. Unlike Mr. Ramsay, he is not a magnet for controversy, which may be why his landing in New York has been less bumpy than his former boss's. Also, there is very little egotism in Mr. Atherton's cooking. He seems to have the peculiar idea of cooking to make other people happy, not to reflect his own glory. You've heard that he serves contemporary English food at the Clocktower. It doesn't taste much like England to you. There are exceptions, like the suave and gentle Lancashire hot pot, a traditional mutton stew that Mr. Atherton makes with rabbit, to excellent effect. It's so good that you ignore the other, fancier half of the dish, a pastry-wrapped bullet of spongy rabbit loin and slightly overcooked foie gras. How to describe the rest? It's festive and generous, and it looks exciting. Classic sauces and techniques are used, but they don't feel like old hat. Mr. Atherton's cooking is not pretentious, but it has the celebratory elegance that traditional hotel dining rooms promise to deliver and rarely do. A beurre blanc, taking its gentle heat and berrylike flavor from pink peppercorns, is genuinely exciting over gleaming braised halibut; so is the carrot pur\u00e9e that's somewhere between a sauce and a vegetable. You're even happier with the roasted king salmon that gets along wonderfully with its sauce of chives and chopped oysters. Of course, there is Dover sole, and you appreciate the time-honored treatment of brown butter, lemon and capers. You admire the duck \u00e0 l'orange, too, the chew of the breast pieces, the concentration of the confit and the way the sauce conveys the fragrance of oranges without the sweetness. These sauces are spooned or poured when the dish is served, a formal gesture that the Clocktower pulls off without stuffiness. Maybe the stage business ought to stop there, you think. While one server points out each variety of raw oyster, another stands off to one side holding a tray of condiments. He stares into space, no doubt wondering where on the small table he is supposed to put all this stuff. A terrific piece of smoked thigh that comes with chicken breast, nicely roasted with herb stuffing under the skin, is served in a drawer that slides out of a little box. Some of this hyperactivity may fall away as the restaurant matures. Perhaps somebody will also toss out half the bottles at the bar; a lot of the cocktails have two or three more ingredients than they need. You took a few sips of a cloying pineapple-rum concoction garnished with glow sticks and a temporary tattoo, then ran for the sanity of the wine list. When the stock market stops correcting itself, you may splurge on a $400 Bordeaux; this week calls for a bottle in the $40 to $60 range. Clocktower has scores of them. Now you want dessert. You want all the desserts, in fact, so it's a good thing you brought a crowd. The pastry chef, S\u00e9bastien Rouxel, has the same solid hold on classic technique and proven flavors that Mr. Atherton does. His pistachio souffl\u00e9, with a lump of chocolate-yogurt ice cream dropped through its roof at the last minute, is virtually perfect. You wish he would get the ice crystals out of the vanilla ice cream that comes with a tarte Tatin, but the sticky caramelized apples make you unreasonably happy, and while it's billed as a portion for two, it's easily enough for four. The table is still jammed, and here come some treats in a vintage McVitie's biscuit tin. You make room because everything in that tin is good, from the crumbly-tender shortbread to the toffee brittle coated with dark chocolate and chopped peanuts. The check comes. You do the math, not just the tip, but the more subtle calculation of whether this is a fair deal. The Dover sole was more than $50, but it always is. Other main courses were in the $20s, which is rare in this style of restaurant. And there were great little surprises all through the meal. You sign your name. You'll be back.

I'll praise the pine-smoked mackerel that a mackerel-conscious friend and I have been emailing each other about for a month now. I'll reminisce about the bowl of buttered rice and stewed beef that seemed boring at first and then not boring at all. I'll try to explain what makes the bubble-cluster of crust on the fried chicken so good. All in due time, all in due time. First, I need to tell you about the honey butter chips. As faithful readers of the South Korean dailies know, about a year ago the snack company Haitai introduced the country to a new potato chip flavored with \"sweet, sweet honey from beehives\" and \"gourmet butter\" from France. Mass hysteria ensued. Few stores could keep them in stock and those that did rationed one bag to a customer. The snack's social media presence was Kardashian-esque. On eBay, two bags of the chips sold for more than $100. An anxious nation was soothed to learn that Haitai is building a chip factory outside Seoul, and disappointed to hear that it will not be completed until next year. Frustration was mounting in the East Village as well, where Oiji's two chefs, Brian Kim and Tae Kyung Ku, wanted to pay homage to honey butter chips, but couldn't get their hands on any. Undaunted, they took to the kitchen. The chips they came up with have not ignited a citywide panic, but they are not a joke. They come to the table straight from the fryer, translucently thin and shimmering all over with honey and brown sugar melted into butter. Cayenne keeps the syrup from overstaying its welcome. They are crisper and more lovable than wet potato chips have any right to be. The chefs grew up in South Korea in the innocent times before honey butter chips. They met in culinary school in the United States, then went off to learn their trade -- Mr. Kim worked at Bouley , and Mr. Ku at Gramercy Tavern and at his family's restaurant back home. Getting back together years later, they leased a room with a lineage, the former site of Dok Suni, the pioneering modern Korean restaurant on First Avenue. Made over as Oiji, it is a warm and orderly space of exposed brick and wood. Half the dining room is taken up by a table that looks as if it came from the reading room of a college library, with benches on either side. Oiji helps take the sting out of Dok Suni's demise. In some ways it continues its predecessor's mission of updating and translating Korean cuisine with respect. It may also remind you of the chef Hooni Kim's places, Danji and Hanjan ; like them, it adjusts traditional recipes for the small-plates era. Those places draw harder on Korea's more intense flavors, while Oiji aims for a little French-style nuance. I promised you buttered rice and beef. Oiji's braised beef is a variant on a classic banchan, but its version is less salty and soy drenched. You take your wooden spoon and stir it into the rice with half a soft-cooked egg and some low-key radish pickles. The mixture is so subtle it barely registers until the butter's tractor beam switches on and you find yourself thinking that you could eat this every night. The mackerel that Mr. Kim and Mr. Ku smoke over pine needles may fit into your Sunday mornings. It's soft, a bit creamy, and tastes like something Barney Greengrass might sell if it relocated to a forest in Maine. The fish comes with a soy-based sauce. You're supposed to brush this on using a cluster of pine needles tied with a string. I liked the mackerel very much but this tiny broom made me feel as if I were having dinner under the floorboards with the Borrowers . As for the chicken, it's a genuine achievement. Typically Korean fried chicken has a hard, crackling shell, but Oiji's is dressed in a puffy, pale, blistered cloak that crunches like newly fried chicharrones. At the other end of the texture spectrum is the superb terrine of pigs' feet, firm pink meat held in a thin lattice of gelatin. The terrine is underpinned by French aromatics (thyme, maybe allspice). Korea enters the picture through the precise, clear flavors of the spicy citrus vinaigrette. Mr. Kim and Mr. Ku have a spin on yuk hwe, but in their kitchen the chilled raw cubes of beef with egg yolk and sesame oil are augmented by pickled mustard seeds. It's very good, although cooking the yolk to a soft jelly seemed like an unnecessary flourish. A hot soup of ground perilla seeds is gloopy and grainy in a way that some guests at my table never got used to. I wouldn't put it at the top of my list, but I liked the way the chefs used oyster mushrooms to deepen the flavor of the seeds, which can taste a little flat on their own. The risk with this kind of cooking is that people who know their way around traditional Korean restaurants, where the only small plates are the free banchan, may walk away feeling they've paid more for less. I didn't get as much of the tender squid, shrimp and mussels in truffled seafood broth as I wanted. And if the gochujang-braised drumsticks were twice as spicy I doubt shrieks of pain would fill the dining room. But most of the time, when I knew the Korean original, it helped me enjoy the renovations Mr. Kim and Mr. Ku have made. The cocktails aren't quite as clunky as names like Thyme to Samba suggest. Wines are respectable, but the most rewarding thing to drink is soju. Oiji offers more styles and prices than you usually see in one place, including a garnet-colored soju made backstage with pomegranate vinegar. All but two dishes are under $20. Most can be shared by two or three people, but if you make a solo dinner of the mackerel for $14 and the house-made cold soba with pickled ramps for $10, you'll be eating and spending well. Another $5 will get you honey butter chips and the satisfaction of finding a bargain not available on eBay.

A man wearing an elegantly knotted silk tie had just materialized at our side and wished us \"bon app\u00e9tit\" with the ease of a native speaker. He was Charles Masson, who for years steered the stately old ship of La Grenouille until a family struggle sent him out on the streets. He landed at Chevalier as the \"director.\" In the pre-opening press , Mr. Masson drew as much attention as the chef, Shea Gallante, formerly of Ciano and Cru. But just a month after the opening in early April, he announced that he was leaving. Now, four weeks after that, I was startled to see him in the flesh, still haunting the dining room, wishing us a healthy appetite as we faced our scallops and cavatelli. Today Mr. Masson is officially gone, but Chevalier is still searching for a guiding spirit. This place is confused about its identity. The designer Stephen Sills gave the dining room the soft glimmer of an abalone shell; it's pretty, but it also looks like a movie director's idea of a restaurant for rich people. Some of the customers get into the spirit: On two separate nights, somebody walked in with the help of a sterling silver-handled cane. As one of my guests said, it's a place where Bruce Wayne would have dinner. According to the website, though, Chevalier is a \"brasserie de luxe.\" The first person who can successfully explain what it has in common with a brasserie wins a choucroute garnie for 12 at my house. Finding the right tone for a new restaurant is fiendishly complicated. As expense and ambitions increase, so do the complications, and Chevalier is both expensive and ambitious. Already, even as it tries to figure itself out, there is a lot to enjoy. Mr. Gallante's cooking is a little hard to pin down, but every meal reminded me just how compelling Ciano and Cru had been when he was in charge. Anybody whose taste buds are in working order could work up a good appetite for those cavatelli -- chewy but tender, yolk-enriched, and shiny in a sharp, springlike ramp pesto with smoked pecorino. The next course brought what has to be the greatest piece of roasted veal loin I've ever met, supremely flavorful and juicy. The long slabs of dry-aged duck breast I ate another night had all the intensity, the blood-rich tang and the richness that I'm starting to give up on getting from steak. Thick slices of pork loin ringed with a narrow band of well-rendered fat were a model of subtle, sensitive roasting; most chefs can't come up with pork this juicy without brining it until it's as salty as ham. Mr. Gallante is smart enough to leave these strong flavors alone, with just minor help from the rest of the plate. With the duck came a dab of Medjool date-red wine sauce, not too sweet, and the pork got by with just a breezy, summery helping of beans and garlic scapes. With seafood, the sauces do more of the work. A buttery emulsion with a trace of lemon verbena was neatly calibrated for black sea bass; cucumber chopped to a pulp and yuzu juice had a powerful and wonderful effect on raw Japanese yellowtail. The charcuterie plate is a marvel of offal craftsmanship: duck rillettes with a bullet of foie gras shot right through the center; rough-hewed and pistachio-flecked liverwurst; calf's tongue and chicken liver mousse layered in a terrine with a bronze jiggle of Madeira jelly on top; saucisson sec with a clear, bracing fermented sourness. Wow. But the same restaurant that achieved this near miracle also served foie gras mousse as cold and hard as butter right out of the refrigerator. I couldn't spread it; worse, I couldn't taste it. The veal that had been so transporting was, the next time I tried it, cooked to the unappetizing pinkish-gray color of canned tuna. Both nights, it came with a stodgy nub of sweetbread, reminiscent of pressed tofu. Fried soft-shell crab with burrata sounded weird on the menu and was weirder on the plate. It was like watching a bad date. I kept waiting for one of the ingredients to get an urgent text from a roommate who's locked out of the apartment. Although Chevalier often seems to be in out-of-town-tryout mode, it charges Broadway prices. This may get ironed out in September, when the menu will go \u00e0 la carte. Right now, a three-course prix fixe dinner is $96; two courses are $74, which means you could save $22 by skipping David Carmichael's accomplished French desserts. The prix isn't entirely fixe, though. The dense chocolate souffl\u00e9, which to be fair is enough for two and is delivered with a dark-chocolate, cr\u00e8me-anglaise-filled egg that servers carefully crack and place on the souffl\u00e9, is $8.50 extra. Side dishes, like excellent gratin dauphinois, are $12 extra; the charcuterie plate is $26 extra. Mr. Gallante also promised lower, more consistent prices for the bar, where the situation now borders on the irrational. A manhattan was $18, but a gin and tonic was $20. One night, my companion pointed to my $22 Moscow Mule and asked the bartender for something \"just like his, but different.\" One difference was its price, $24. Tweaks are planned for uniforms, d\u00e9cor and \"service sensibility,\" which the publicist said \"will definitely be lightened.\" I have no complaints about the service itself; the dining room staff came out of the gate with the fluid, watchful poise of people who have been in place for years. But its Old World tone would make more sense if the restaurant itself had a clearer point of view. Chevalier and its hotel were built by a real estate conglomerate, which sold them but still manages both through a subsidiary company. The conglomerate also owns the Baccarat crystal firm, and sprinkled its sparkly glass all over the building. At Chevalier, named after a Baccarat designer, the product placement is subtle but ever-present. There are charms in drinking water from heavy crystal tumblers, not least of all the workout you give your biceps, but it's hard to escape the feeling that customer pleasure is secondary to corporate interests. Chevalier seems to have been conceived as a French luxury restaurant, in other words, simply because Baccarat is a French luxury company. French luxury restaurants can be wonderful, but they have to be played with conviction. Mr. Masson could have supplied that, but now it will have to come from somewhere else. Of course, there is one luxury that would overcome all arguments. Food as consistently good as the charcuterie plate and that first veal loin would make Chevalier a destination. It just wouldn't be a brasserie.

Untitled is on the ground floor of the Whitney Museum of American Art. The Whitney is the second major art museum in the city to choose Danny Meyer to run a big, semiformal restaurant -- the Museum of Modern Art is the other -- and yet Mr. Meyer is resolutely uninterested in arty food. When Eleven Madison Park began its swerve toward the conceptual, he sold it. The remaining holdings in his Union Square Hospitality Group are polite restaurants where polite people are in very little danger of being challenged or provoked. Although Mr. Meyer has worked to make his name synonymous with hospitality, what his restaurants sell above all is reassurance. Imagine his relief that the Whitney decided against installing Charles Ray's sculpture of a naked Huck Finn , bending over next to an 8-foot full-frontal Jim, on the plaza in front of Untitled. (Next door at Santina, which plays Nicki Minaj to Untitled's Taylor Swift, they would have rearranged the tables for better views.) The restaurant is slotted into a narrow quadrangle with glass curtain walls on three sides, designed, like the rest of the museum, by Renzo Piano. Untitled treats the architect deferentially. Too deferentially, I think: In its near-total lack of ornament, the dining room can look like an espresso shop. If Eero Saarinen's cardinal-red chairs weren't so comfortable, you might get antsy after an hour. An architect friend spent the night admiring Mr. Piano's meticulous engineering, but also pointed out that interiors with curtain walls are only as beautiful as the building across the street. At Untitled, you look at a hulking industrial slab across Gansevoort Street. At least it is an improvement on the view from my old desk at Mr. Piano's New York Times building, where I peered into the dark soul of the Port Authority Bus Terminal. All the energy and beauty at Untitled are on the plates. They throb with color. It's not just decoration, either. The color mostly comes from fruits and vegetables so ripe they're ready to pop. Michael Anthony, the chef; Suzanne Cupps, the chef de cuisine; and Miro Uskokovic, the pastry chef, use market produce flamboyantly, as though they were trying to get the purse-lipped farm-to-table puritans who solemnly hand you a single baby zucchini to crack a smile. A slice of the tender, rich poundcake is virtually swallowed up by ricotta, sabayon, strawberries and violas. More strawberries -- and nearly every other berry under the summer sun -- ring the gloriously slouching chamomile panna cotta in a great purple landslide. Around a towering ship's-prow wedge of cake with sesame brittle and peanut-butter icing, servers pour a blueberry sauce with the spicy buzz of ginger, which rockets the dessert right out of PB&J territory. The four menu categories aren't labeled, but it's obvious that the third section is turned over to vegetables. A few are best as side dishes, like the spoonable potato pur\u00e9e liquefied with melted Cheddar, too salty for more than a few bites. Most of the vegetables, though, have enough contrast and sophistication to be appetizers or even main courses. Pickled wine-colored cherries, sunflower seeds and orange splashes of carrot vinaigrette make every bite of a kale-and-cabbage salad taste like a new dish. (If we are sentenced to see raw kale everywhere we go, every restaurant should dress it as exuberantly as Untitled does.) Earlier this summer, there were roasted and griddled leeks, as dark as roasted Japanese eggplants and almost that soft, with an intense, sweet-sour salsa sauce of citrus and pasilla chiles; I've never wanted to cheer for a plate of leeks before. Every taste tells you how carefully (and recently) these chefs have done their shopping. A dinner companion was convinced that some ingredient had been injected into the flat beans to make them taste so alluring, and she didn't think it had anything to do with the baby squid, hazelnuts and ancho chile sauce on the plate. But no, these were just excellent beans, grilled quickly so they still had some snap and juice. You can tell that the rotisserie chicken had great flavor down to its core before it took its turn on the spit. If you're not sure, try the fried chicken that comes on the same plate. Under the airy, crackling crust that owes something to Japan and Korea, there's very fine meat. If every dish were this good, Untitled might rank up there with Gramercy Tavern, where Mr. Anthony and Mr. Uskokovic hold the same titles they do here. But the kitchen isn't there yet. One night I'd brought along a native of Owensboro, Ky., the smoked mutton capital of the world. But it didn't take a barbecue authority to know the smoked pork ribs were tough and undercooked, and coated in a paste that didn't taste of anything but salt. It was the only real disaster. In other dishes, the worst you could say is that the cooks packed too much into their shopping bags. The flavor of swordfish steaks disappears into a mashed eggplant that was a little too sharp and salty, and the taste of sea scallops can't hold its head up in a bowl of sweet watermelon gazpacho with lemon cucumbers and peaches. At times the plates had so much going on that they left you with only a blurry impression of deliciousness. But as blurry impressions go, that one is hard to beat. At the end of one dinner, Mr. Anthony stopped by my table. (I'd been spotted long ago.) He was enthusiastic about how the gray limestone floors and white-oak counter catch the light during the day. He was slightly less enthusiastic about the kitchen, which is as narrow as a scallion. When he said he and Ms. Cupps were taking inspiration from the overflowing planters up on the High Line, I understood the botanical profusion of their plates. Maybe the wine director, Eduardo Porto Carreiro, can find some inspiration up there, too. Native plants grow on the High Line, and American art fills the Whitney, but Untitled's wine list genuflects toward Europe. You can drink very well without spending a fortune, but it could get interesting if Mr. Porto Carreiro took his cues from the location. Untitled is not really meant for museum visitors, who are much more likely to recuperate with an avocado toast at Mr. Meyer's Studio Cafe on the eighth floor. Instead, the restaurant is one of the attractions the museum is peddling, part of its multipronged campaign to be seen as a neighborhood hot spot and not just some boring shed where there's nothing to do but look at art. Sometimes I miss those boring sheds, though I don't miss the school lunchroom smell of their cafeterias. And at least the Whitney's urge to pump itself up with crowds has given us Untitled.

The phrase was \"the return of the repressed,\" and it seemed relevant, somehow, to these fried squares of puffed wheat at El Rey Coffee Bar & Luncheonette on the Lower East Side. Porkless chicharrones would have struck me as sacrilegious a few years ago. At the time, I was busily cheering on the new cult of animal-flesh worship that was burying the joyless orthodoxy of the low-fat diet beneath slabs of pork belly. White meat, steamed vegetables and olive oil were elbowed aside to make room for chicken liver toasts, marrow bones and whipped lard. Chefs and avid eaters scorned anything that might qualify as health food, which by the standards of the time included any vegetable cooked without bacon. But as Freud knew, repressed urges find ways of bobbing to the surface again. Last decade, the return of the repressed looked like an entire pork shoulder torn apart by people who would leave the table with the glazed look of an anaconda that happened across a slow-moving deer. In this decade, it looks like puffed brown rice with raw cauliflower pebbles and kale at Sqirl in Los Angeles. It looks like an Allen Street marquee of Times Square dimensions screaming DIRT CANDY above Amanda Cohen's vegetable circus-slash-restaurant. It looks like chia pudding with hemp at Dimes on Canal Street, where they put wheat grass in their margaritas. And it looks like vegan chicharrones locos at El Rey. The dish turns a Mexican street snack, chicharrones de harina, into a salad, and turns salad into an event. These mock pork skins are tossed with mint and sticks of raw jicama in a bowl, the vessel of choice for return-of-the-repressed dishes across the country. They are dusted with smoldering Aleppo pepper and lemony ground sumac, strafed by a terrific hot sauce of chiles and pickled pineapple and mellowed with a nondairy cashew cream. Nicholas Morgenstern, the proprietor of GG's and Morgenstern's Finest Ice Cream , opened El Rey in 2013 with little more than an espresso machine and some shelves of pastries baked by Gerardo Gonzalez. Luncheonette was appended to the name when Mr. Gonzalez was promoted to chef a few months later. When El Rey was reviewed by Ligaya Mishan in a Hungry City column the following year, it served breakfast and lunch. Friends I trusted kept telling me that I needed to check it out. They said things like \"the food is exactly what I feel like eating.\" They renewed their calls after February, when the dinner menu sprouted up. All these friends were women, and when I finally took their advice, I noticed that in the dining room, men were always outnumbered by women (they had yoga stomachs, quick eyes and nails as colorful and glossy as a Mini Cooper on the dealer's lot). I wouldn't read too much into this observation, but it seems worth mentioning because the voices that brayed most loudly about the virtues of animal fat tended to be male. The pieces of this tiny restaurant fit together like an empty wallet and a new $20 bill. Two high tables are each surrounded by four metal stools. A few more seats crouch beneath a counter that looks onto Stanton Street, and three more face an area the size of a bathtub with a single induction burner. This passes for the kitchen. Neon script on the back wall spells the restaurant's name in swimming-pool blue. The service is California chill. Ordering is uncomplicated. El Rey has few of the comforts of a larger, more elaborate restaurant, but none of the discomforts, either. Mr. Gonzalez is a native of San Diego. In his short time at El Rey, he has worked out a point of view in the kitchen that is distinctly his own, a blend of California-Mexican cuisine with some of the less punitive flavors from the health-food and vegan disciplines. In these tight quarters, his menu necessarily favors assemblage over cooking, by which I mean dinner will probably feature at least one salad. There is chopped kale that tastes brighter and more refreshing than the routine version. The shaved cauliflower number sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds has more surprises; it softens and picks up flavor as it soaks up the chickpea-tahini vinaigrette and the yolk of a poached egg. Other dishes have more ballast, but nothing will make you feel like an anaconda. Warm, marinated chorizo is essentially a tapas portion with something extra: chopped hazelnuts and threads of orange zest. Octopus, sliced dime-thin and marinated, Cuban style, is mixed with chopped hominy and tomatillo; it sits on white beans that have been pur\u00e9ed with squid ink, garlic oil and black garlic. I was still wondering if I'd ever tasted white beans put to such interesting use as I scraped the last smudges from the plate. Mr. Gonzalez has devised a winning, original tostada: shaved carrots and smoked sardines on a crackerlike corn tortilla on which whipped butter and thick yogurt are spread. Butter and sardines are longtime dance partners, but what sends them trotting off in new directions is the salsa verde of carrot greens. The kitchen has limitations, and not all of them can be blamed on lack of space. The brief menu reaches for the crunch factor of nuts a little too often. Should you eat the papas bravas the same night as the chicharrones locos, you may wish they did not both depend on the pineapple hot sauce and the cashew cream. But if you have them on their own, the crisp skins of little blue potatoes knocking up against pickled chunks of pineapple, you'll simply wish you had more. To drink, you may have a good oddball wine, or a twist on the michelada rimmed with Aleppo pepper, or white sangria turned green by shiso and cucumber, which gives you the pleasant illusion that you are fortifying your body with nutritious juices and not just knocking back one glass of wine after another. At the end of dinner, there is usually a single dessert in addition to whatever pastries the daytime crowd didn't make off with. One sultry May night, Mr. Gonzalez had carved up buttery lobes of Champagne mango, spooned mango pickle sauce on top and scooped some mango-passion fruit sorbet on the side. It was exactly what I felt like eating.

It can be a confusing restaurant at first, its messages mixed, its fairly simple concept fuzzed over with complications. But give the place a chance, and you can find clarity in the smells of garlic and wood smoke that fill the dining room; in the way sweet paprika and cilantro sidle up to each other in olive oil; and in the fresh, firm seafood, the grilled sardines and carabineros, red as a lobster, their heads dripping with juices that are as rich and intense as any sauce. The restaurant may be unfocused, but the cooking isn't. Mr. Mendes's basic idea for Lupulo, which opened a few blocks south of Herald Square in April, was straightforward enough. The name means \"hops,\" and the place is his take on the beer-centered Portuguese taverns called cervejarias. The nearest American equivalent is probably a brewpub, which Lupulo resembles with its hard, low wooden chairs, its high ceilings and its U-shaped dining bar stretching off into the distance. The menu gets right into the beery spirit with food that's left a little rough around the edges. The skin on chicken piri piri is black from the grill, but the meat is juicy right down to the bone. It shows up at the table with skinny French fries and a squeeze bottle of piri piri, the hot sauce that suggests Portuguese people have an advanced understanding of pain's pleasures. Manila clams steamed open in vinho verde with cilantro and chopped spring garlic are simple and wonderful, especially when you soak some grilled bread in the pan sauce. Purists may be let down to find that Lupulo's caracois are meaty Burgundian snails lying naked on a plate, not the smaller variety that people suck from their shells one by one on any summer afternoon in Lisbon. But wait until the purists get a taste of the rustic olive oil sauce, spiced with smoked paprika and chopped garlic that is warmed but not tamed. The Portuguese are masters of what Italians call cucina povera, the discipline of squeezing enjoyment out of inexpensive ingredients. Maybe you have wondered why anyone would choose to eat bread porridge? Try Lupulo's version of a\u00e7orda -- mushy and crunchy at the same time, topped with a few carabineros and saturated with a shrimp-head stock that makes the room reel -- and wonder no more. Mr. Mendes works the same humble sorcery on sweet spring peas cooked with chori\u00e7o. The liquid yolk of a sunny-side-up egg waits to be poked and swirled around until it joins up with the fresh herbs laced into the peas. It has a close cousin, just as satisfying, in the bowl of bright-green favas with crunchy knobs of blood sausage and morels. At other times, the kitchen veers off message, with artsy swooshes and swirls that seem as if they'd be more at home serenely perched on the tablecloths at Mr. Mendes's other, more formal restaurant, Aldea . You can spot these exiles from Chefville on the menu at a glance: the raw sockeye and darkly glittering caviar in buttermilk froth under radish wheels sliced thin enough to blow away, the grilled asparagus with dried and fresh sea urchin. From a branding standpoint, Mr. Mendes should probably ship these dishes off to Aldea . But I hope he doesn't, because his forays into fussiness are at least as flavorful as the more broad-shouldered plates. And some, like the raw snapper with the stormy heat of fermented serrano peppers calmed by waves of coconut broth scented with makrut lime, are at least arguably Portuguese in a post-colonial sense, if you care to play those games in the face of inarguable deliciousness. Of course there is Portuguese wine, a short and solid list, but there is more energy and excitement in the beer menu. This document can be disorienting, though, at least on a first visit. Why open a cervejaria and turn over all the taps but two (recently there was one for a Spanish cider, another for the dry, likable Sagres lager from Portugal) to American craft breweries? Mr. Mendes has said in interviews that he features the United States simply because it makes more of the carefully, intelligently made beers he enjoys than Portugal, where small-scale brewing is a newer phenomenon. He gave Ryan Mauban, most recently seen fussing over the bottles and kegs at Torst in Brooklyn, the job of tracking down innovative brews from around the country. His list is short but packs in a lot of stylistic diversity: goses (see Eric Asimov's Pour column this week ) more tart than lemonade, Belgian-style ales with a barely-there hint of Thai basil. With dessert, Mr. Mauban may suggest a South Carolina stout brewed with cocoa, cinnamon and a flicker of habanero. It tastes like chocolate soda that grew up into an alluring stranger with a dark secret. In fact, it had more going for it than some of Alexander Zecena's sweets, like the sleepy vanilla rice pudding, now off the menu, and the pasteis de nata, bite-size tarts of egg custard that were somehow both floury and not quite firm. But there is no point trying to resist the pudim Molotov, like the child of a flan and a marshmallow, or the eggy sponge cake next to a slice of soft, mildly sour sheep's milk cheese. The menu, to give this dead horse one last whack, is kind of confusing. It is divided into Small Plates, Fish, Meat and Garden. Simple enough, until you're told that all but the last four Fish entries are also small plates. That quirk is easier to get used to than the roar of Lupulo's dining room at full tilt. The wall of traditional blue-and-white Portuguese ceramic tiles is pretty, but combined with the two walls of soaring window panels and all the bare wood, it guarantees that by 8 p.m. everybody will end up talking about how hard it is to talk. Full-tilt dining rooms may not be a problem for long if Lupulo doesn't get an acoustic adjustment soon. It would be a shame if noise drove the crowds away, because Lupulo gets almost everything else right. On that point, there shouldn't be any confusion.

The couple on my left had ros\u00e9 in their glasses, too. I did what one member of the pink wine fellowship does when encountering other members, and offered them a taste. Patrick Cappiello, the wine director of this worthwhile modern French restaurant on the Bowery, provided the introductions. My Bellwether pinot noir was not, he said, technically a ros\u00e9, though it was translucent, the color of raspberry juice, and as highly drinkable as any Proven\u00e7al pink. The grapes were grown on the east coast of Seneca Lake and turned into wine with a minimum of hocus-pocus by Kris Matthewson . Mr. Cappiello called him \"a rock star of the Finger Lakes.\" My neighbors knew the fellowship's code and offered me a pour of their sparkling ros\u00e9, Ultramarine. With its precise, almost etched framework of acidity, it was a thrill. The pinot noir grapes were grown along the Bohemian Highway in Sonoma County, and fermented by Michael Cruse who, according to Mr. Cappiello, is \"a rock star of California sparkling wine.\" It was starting to sound like a winemaking supergroup, the Velvet Revolver of pinot noir. But this is just Mr. Cappiello's way of talking about the 1,600 or so bottles on his list. He likes to knock the crust off the rituals of buying something to drink by casting a favorite producer as a poet of barrel fermentation, a virtuoso of natural yeast, or, to give this restaurant's name in English, a rebel. The assault on tradition implied by the name turns out to be fairly tame stuff, but you bump into it all over the restaurant. The unforced, intermittently French food is inspired by one particular rebellion. The chef, Daniel Eddy, comes to Rebelle straight from the Paris restaurant Spring , a member of the loosely bound bistronomy movement. Bistronomy isn't a style of cooking; it's a reordering of priorities across the restaurant. The idea is to strip out expensive Michelin bait like linens so prices can come down and everybody can pay attention to the food again. While bistronomy put an extra shine on the copper pots in Paris, it hasn't really resonated in the United States. So Rebelle, despite its bistronomic pedigree, won't strike most New Yorkers as a huge departure. It should, however, strike them as a very good place to eat seasonal food that flirts with French ideas in exciting ways. The sauce on an appetizer of sliced raw fluke is brown butter with a flicker of lemon and a handful of capers, fried until crisp. Say hello to your old friend skate Grenobloise, but reimagined as chilled sashimi, and approximately 10 times better than that sounds. And here are leeks in vinaigrette, but not the comfortable old mush you've cozied up to before. Snipped into bite-size cylinders, these leeks are younger, firmer, their onion character not completely subdued. What the black filaments of leek ash are doing on the plate I can't say, but the scraps of soft-boiled egg are there to help when the grains of mustard tug at your throat. Like Spring's chef, Mr. Eddy is American born and raised. Sometimes it's hard to tell what distinguishes his contemporary French cuisine from the international style in food that stretches from Copenhagen to Mexico City and beyond. In the case of the excellent roasted monkfish with a pale pink blush at the core, it must be the butter emulsion that insinuates itself about the sea beans, the mussels and the sliced razor clams. In the case of the seared scallops with raw green apples and crisp turnip coins in a bright-tasting juice pressed from herbs, apples and celery, who knows. Nothing, maybe? It's smart, original and not quite like any other scallop dish I've had. So far the meatless main courses I've tried could be described as a collection of vegetables sharing a plate. The beet bourguignon (beets, pearl onions, braised carrots, raw mushrooms) needed a sauce to tie everything together, ideally one with some fat. And I'm not sure anything could tie Rebelle's carrots together with morels and peas, but the dish has some distance to go before it will be compared to Narcissa's carrots Wellington . Or, for that matter, to Rebelle's monkfish, or its roast chicken, a long strip of bird under a crackerlike roof of skin. Absolutely everything about this plate seems to have gone right, down to the golden, papery slices of potato fused in butter-fried unity. A second rebellion takes place in the realm of interior design. The nostalgic French restaurant clich\u00e9s that New Yorkers love have all been bagged up and left at the curb with the potato peels. Rebelle has no Pernod posters, no zinc bars, no walls painted the color of Serge Gainsbourg's teeth. The 90 chairs are black, the tables are black, and, high above both, the ceilings and ductwork are painted black, too. At times Rebelle reminds you less of a brasserie on Boulevard du Montparnasse than of a strip club on Queens Boulevard, especially when you start hearing classic pole-dancing hits of the 1980s by Naked Eyes and the Human League. The owners, who include Mr. Cappiello and who overlap with the partners behind Pearl & Ash , one door north on the Bowery, were probably going for a sexy nightclub look. They overshot the mark by a gyration or two. The murk may be an accident, but the servers' upselling is so consistent it must be scripted. The menu is divided into small appetizers for $12, less small ones for $16, main courses for $24 and desserts for $9. This seems to require no explanation, but a server will still tell you that \"our menu is designed for four courses.\" No. Your menu is \u00e0 la carte, which means it is designed to let people decide how many courses they want. They should be able to make that decision without any Jedi mind tricks, like being told that a $22 foie gras torchon (billed as a special but available every night, in my experience) is \"ideal as a precourse, for the table to share.\" The gently marked-up wine list can rinse out the bad taste of these check-fluffing techniques. Although there are four-figure bottles from prime real estate in Bordeaux, Burgundy and Napa, so many others are clustered just over and under $50 that I lost count. For this modern French restaurant with an American chef, the wines are largely made in the contemporary, hands-off style, and they all come from France and the United States. If you've written off all American wines as big, galumphing, overpriced beasts, drink one or two of the lithe and inexpensive creatures Rebelle has picked up in the Finger Lakes, the Pacific Northwest or the Central California Coast. A few glasses should convince you that, following France's lead, the United States is now going through a delicious, small-scale winemaking rebellion.

Here are some possibilities. The spacious tree-lined front courtyard of the High Line Hotel has an Intelligentsia coffee truck by day.

But the people at the next table were stumped when they saw it on the menu of Noreetuh , which has been offering tastes of Hawaii in the East Village since March. \"What's poke?\" one of them asked, rhyming it with Coke. After a silence, a man sitting with her spoke up. \"It's a fish,\" he said. Pause. \"A kind of tuna.\" This exchange suggested some of the challenges facing Noreetuh's chef, Chung Chow, along with his partners, Jin Ahn and Gerald San Jose. Island seafood and produce fill the walk-ins at contemporary Honolulu restaurants like MW or the Pig and the Lady , but they rarely reach the island of Manhattan. A knowledgeable audience can't be imported, either. While islanders can be counted on to know exactly which local dish Alan Wong is playing around with, the average New Yorker has almost no idea what the residents of the 50th state eat . Don't they like \u2026 Spam? Sure, among other things. Mr. Chow, who was raised in Hawaii and cooked at Lincoln Ristorante and Per Se , goes out of his way to treat Hormel's arrestingly pink canned meat product as if it were an heirloom ingredient. Stuffed into supple agnolotti and accessorized with hon-shimeji mushrooms; semi-juicy, soy-cured spring almonds; and a mob of bonito flakes (waving their hands in the air like they just don't care), it could almost pass for mortadella. It may be the most elegant dish on Mr. Chow's menu, although it gets stiff competition from the monkfish liver torchon, a pink button surrounded by jellied passion fruit. Lightly pickled pears soften the passion fruit's brassy tendencies. Mash the fruit and fish liver together on a sweet dinner roll from King's Hawaiian bakery , and you have one of the most exciting tastes to wash up on Manhattan's shores this year. With prime ingredients, carefully organized plates and nonviolent menu prices, Mr. Chow seems intent on making Hawaiian classics presentable for their introduction to New York. Four or five garlic shrimp stand side by side on a long column of rice, offering the same pleasurable assault of garlic-flecked butter that you'd get from a big messy pile slopped onto a paper plate by one of the shrimp trucks of Oahu. And however you pronounce it, Mr. Chow's poke is classical, generous and slightly Japanese-leaning, made from firm, cool bigeye tuna, diced and slicked down with sesame oil. Frills of seaweed carry the heat of tobanjan, the spicy Japanese bean paste. Neatness counts for only so much, though, and some dishes are more fastidious than flavorful. The pork in panko-crusted croquettes isn't very emphatic, and the katsu sauce on the side needs more kick, too. A different poke, with octopus and fingerling potatoes, has only a flicker of the tuna's personality. White asparagus looks very nice alongside crumbled Chinese sausage and chopped eggs, but the combination doesn't go very far. Noreetuh has plenty of dishes for a successful first visit. Dinner will be particularly fun for wine lovers because Mr. Ahn has compiled an overachieving list of German rieslings, Burgundies in both colors, grower Champagnes and more far-flung treats. Better still, the prices are low; just by sticking to your budget, you can drink at a higher level than usual. Noreetuh may have a trickier time converting new diners into regulars, though. The two dining rooms, while tasteful enough, don't have anything you could really call atmosphere. Noreetuh means \"playground\" in Korean, and the owners seem to want to give a party. But where did they find their DJ.? A Motown hit parade is followed by \"Yellow Submarine,\" and then by Taylor Swift, Natalie La Rose and, gosh, is that really Taylor Swift, twice in one night? At the moment, there's something a little cautious about the whole enterprise. But the last time I went, I ate a bowl of spaghetti, new to the menu, that points in the right direction. Richly oily smoked butterfish was folded in among buttered noodles, bright orange with fiery little capsules of spicy cod roe. This wasn't a polite exercise in cultural diplomacy; it was a shut-up-and-eat dish, and if a third Taylor Swift song had played right at that moment, I wouldn't have cared. Another small, modest looking restaurant called the Eddy sits right around the corner, on East Sixth Street's disappearing row of interchangeable curry spots. The Eddy is so small and modest looking, in fact, that after it opened last spring, I almost decided not to review it at all, on the theory that when a restaurant has just over 30 seats and doesn't seem to have any trouble filling them, there isn't much point in driving more people there. The chef is Brendan McHale, and I wasn't always sold on his cooking. I would have liked some of his dishes better if they hadn't reminded me of slightly better things I'd eaten elsewhere, like the burrata served, as at Estela , in an herbaceous puddle of chlorophyll. Others, like the strangely bloated gnocchi or the dull, spongy lamb loin served with pellets of teff spaetzle that looked like rabbit feed, were easy to forget. But other dishes were wonderful. There were unimprovable roasted potatoes with strips of rib-eye whose dry-aged intensity was amplified by the low-key funk of melted Brie. And the soft-shell crab with a peppery arugula pesto that I kept eating after the crab was gone. And the jiggly, just-set cardamom panna cotta with crystals of rhubarb granit\u00e9 on top. And the airy chips of fried beef tendon, spread with Greek yogurt and dotted by smoky trout roe. Like Mr. McHale's bacon tater tots, which wear little bright-green berets of pur\u00e9ed sweet peas, the tendon puffs disappeared with a crunch and left behind a strong desire for more. I would say that both hors d'oeuvres were smart cocktail party food, but I have never been invited to a cocktail party this smart. And then I thought about how extremely pleasant everybody is at the Eddy, starting with the bartenders, who look up and smile each time a new customer walks in, as if they lived in the opening credits of a sitcom. I remembered the drinks they made, which are as good as the ones at a dedicated cocktail bar. I recalled the compact well-priced wine list, and how I never picked a bottle that I didn't enjoy a little more than I'd expected. When I went back to the Eddy, I noticed how quickly the people I brought settled in and got comfortable under the timbered rafters and low ceiling that make the dining room look like a well-kept old tavern. And how easy it was to hear one another, even when the place was crowded. The Eddy, in other words, is one of those restaurants that gets so many little details right that your main course can be a little shaky and you can still walk out happy. That's a rare thing, no accident when it happens, and the reason all those seats are so often full.

(Second prize is 30 courses.) The restaurant does have its sense of humor, but it quickly proved that about cooking for maximum pleasure, it was unswervingly serious. Carlo Mirarchi, the chef and an owner of Blanca and its sprawling mother ship, Roberta's , was a rigorous miniaturist, combining a few ingredients at a time into two- or three-bite compositions that were utterly complete, even if they left you wanting more. At 31, he already had an impressive sense of what to put on a plate and what to leave off. What he didn't have yet was a repertoire deep enough for the length of the meals he served. My early dinners at Blanca were marked by dishes that seemed like placeholders, and there were moments when the kitchen's reach exceeded its technical grasp. It was as if Mr. Mirarchi were giving you a tour of a mansion he'd bought before the contractor had finished the punch list. Most of the place was spectacular, but there were rooms where you would not want to spend the night. Being a critic, I had a suggestion, hinted at in my two-star review that year: make the meal shorter and cheaper. Being a chef, Mr. Mirarchi ignored me and kept refining his marathon tastings, very gradually. \"The menu changes so slowly that for us it's like watching your hair grow,\" Leslie Vinyard, Blanca's welcoming and gracious service captain, remarked one night from behind the countertop. So it may have taken a while, but every time I've settled into one of the padded brown-leather captain's chairs recently, nearly everything I've tasted has been remarkable in one way or another. One dinner this spring got rolling with a fat little Pacific Northwest oyster. Sharing its deep cup-shaped shell were juicy round cells of finger lime that popped in my mouth like citrus caviar, and a pool of green juice pressed from roasted asparagus, an ingenious combination that teased a mild cucumber flavor out of the oyster. At the end of the night, asparagus came back. Samantha Short, the pastry chef, had made a sort of coconut semifreddo, silky on the tongue, which hovered over a spoonful or two of white asparagus soup seasoned with sugar and salt. Sweet and savory, tropical and vegetal flavors crashed together and bloomed into something daring and great. The desserts after some mega-tastings are gradual diminuendos. This was a mike drop. Over three meals since October, I've experienced all sorts of flavor detonations: a streaky fold of raw pancetta with a burst of black peppercorns; a salt-roasted Japanese sweet potato with an unexpectedly dreamy dressing of macadamia milk and ground espresso beans; a crunchy wedge of tart apple carrying a small, remarkable payload of garlic, olive oil, anchovies, fried bread crumbs and cardoons cooked in apple juice. I have also started looking forward to sunchokes, a vegetable that has a hard time getting more out of me than grudging acceptance. Blanca caramelized them deeply, steeped them in soy milk, then whipped them into a cream. A ragged leaf of toasted sea lettuce supplied a bottom note, and the crumb of beeswax and honey at the bottom of the dish made my eyes go wide, every time. Then there are the agnolotti parcels that are like Freshen Up gum from the dark side. They burst when you bite down with an oozing, inky-green liquid made from melted taleggio and phytoplankton. The flavor is like a distillation of spinach, seaweed and squid ink. It's a totally disorienting sensation, and while I love it, not everyone will. I think of this course as the one guest-directed by David Lynch. It is when the dwarf starts to dance . One of Mr. Mirarchi's sillier conceits in the early days was making you wait more than two hours for an ordinary slice of filone, presented as its own course. You still wait, but now it's worth it. The breads made by Nina Subhas may include a soft Hawaiian sweet roll with pineapple juice in the dough and black salt on top, and a flaky garlic knot that's like a savory Danish. Or you may be given a chunk torn from a squat round loaf made from Roberta's pizza dough. Brushed with olive oil, this steaming-hot pizza bread doesn't need the house-made butter, not that I let that stop me. Once, grilled snow crabs were served with a deliciously funky crab-innards sauce. Now the steamed legs of very recently living king crabs come with a saffron-colored slosh of melted butter sauce whipped with shaved bottarga. The sauce is an upgrade, less likely to step on the sweetness of the shellfish, and I've never again been served gelatinous, half-raw crab legs as I was in 2012. This has become one of New York's essential dishes, along with the 'nduja raviolo, an explosion of spicy pork lava, the one item that has been on the lineup since opening night. Mr. Mirarchi's notion of what al dente means seems to have softened. So has the pasta, slightly, but I'll deal with the extra-chewy core of tightly hand-rolled noodles to taste his creamy, yolk-rich carbonara with lamb fat and cured lamb breast. Beneath the body of Blanca's menu is an Italian chassis, so after pasta come the meat courses. There may be a few rosy slices of roast duck placed beside a slow-burning beet mole, followed by porchetta with chimichurri. The servings are never very large and never as hot as I'd like, but the meat is always juicier and more concentrated than almost any other restaurant can manage. When you say \"savory desserts,\" some people look for the exits. None of these people have tasted Ms. Short's intermezzos and finales. She can make the heat and the vegetal taste of poblano peppers seem like sensible, delicious additions to a cake. One night, her parting shot was a chocolate-Parmesan ice cream with shaved white truffles. It was another mike drop. One could, and come to think of it one will, complain that Blanca offers no wine bottles under $80 and no glasses under $18. Customers who have torn a hole in their budget to afford the $195 for dinner, before tax and tip, shouldn't have to drink beer all night. Not that this would be a terrible fate; Blanca's beers are as varied and full of character as the sakes and wines. A course-by-course wine pairing can be had for $95, but Shanti Carson, the sommelier, excels at working with people who aren't that thirsty. Ms. Carson is also the one who placed the vinyl on the turntable when I decided to prove to the other 11 people at the counter that \" New York Groove \" isn't the only good song on Ace Frehley's first solo album. The record collection, which Mr. Mirarchi may well have lifted straight from the garage of his childhood home, is one of the ways Blanca deflates high-end dining's gassier pretensions. His aim has always been to run a restaurant that is both a luxury and a weird adventure. The entrance tells you everything. You walk into a cinder-block bomb shelter of a pizzeria, past the crowds eating pies with names like Lamb of God. You turn left at the bar, go out the door, take another left at the radio studio and a right at the tiki bar. Keep going past the shipping containers and the outdoor oven, walk down a couple of steps, through the door, and you're inside Bushwick's first three-star restaurant.

It didn't seem to follow the rules, or even know that there were rules. The health department and other city agencies knew, though, and after just 18 months, they pulled the plug on Danny Bowien's hallucinatory all-ages chile-pepper party. At its new address on East Broadway, there is a host behind a lectern instead of a dude handing out plastic cups near the beer keg. While the old space looked as if it had been built by Mr. Bowien and his friends with two-by-fours, a staple gun and a paper dragon, the new two-level dining room with half-moon booths of brushed red velvet under bistro mirrors was inherited from an earlier restaurant that seemed to have employed a licensed architect and a professional designer. Now there is a well-appointed kitchen in the basement, not Orchard Street's narrow galley behind plexiglass, where the heat and flames were so ferocious that Mr. Bowien seemed intent on turning himself into the nightly special, grilled chef. He still wears shorts on his trips to the dining room, but now it looks like a fashion choice, not a matter of survival. While very few items on the old menu couldn't be knocked together by one person with a wok in less than five minutes, many dishes now speak of ample counter space and many hands, including those of Angela Dimayuga , the executive chef. (Mr. Bowien is the chef and owner.) Of her many contributions to Mission Chinese Food, the one everybody wants to talk about is Josefina's house special chicken. Josefina is Ms. Dimayuga's grandmother, a Filipina, and her chicken is no short-order stir fry. The bird is roasted with a stuffing of fresh chorizo, raisins, olives, sweet pickles and butter. It is carried to the table on a silver platter, feet splayed out, head tucked in. When the torso is cut into thick slices, the center of each one has the white-and-yellow ring of a hard-cooked egg. Everything about Josefina's chicken is great. The recipe is most likely of Spanish descent. This should make it an idiosyncratic fixture in a Chinese restaurant, but idiosyncrasy is to Mission Chinese Food what the Bloomin' Onion is to an Outback Steakhouse. In the original San Francisco incarnation, as well as in the first New York location, most of the idiosyncrasies looped around Sichuan cuisine. Many of the old dishes, marked as much by Mr. Bowien's freethinking approach as by the burn and tingle of chiles and Sichuan peppercorns, have migrated to the new restaurant: the kung pao pastrami; the galvanizing lamb ribs with sweet, gooey dates; the Chongqing chicken wings so acutely spicy and flavorful they make Buffalo wings seem as dangerous as an animal cracker. But this kind of scorched-tongue cooking has become a minor motif in Mr. Bowien and Ms. Dimayuga's menu, which goes on for pages. Fewer than a third of the items are marked by red flames blazing from what looks like a pair of cheeks, and not the ones you kiss your grandmother on. The rest is not just less fire-spewing but more varied than before, drawing from regions beyond Sichuan and countries beyond China. Some of it is even nuanced. Splashing around in a gentle, aromatic pool of chamomile, almond milk and saffron, the steamed Napa cabbage has more in common with a chai latte than with Mr. Bowien's pork-drenched mapo tofu. There is a startlingly well-calibrated, nori-sprinkled salad of red cabbage in a Caesar-esque vinaigrette of soy, miso, sesame and anchovy. Konnichiwa, Caesar! Another salad waves toward Vietnam, with green papaya threads, roasted peanuts, sliced banana blossoms and shreds of lightly smoked chicken. The perfume of dill, mint and basil rises up from a bowl of cellophane noodles in deeply aromatic lamb soup. Grassy, astringent matcha is sprinkled over green-tea noodles with scallions and ginger. Fried rice with sweet and tender lumps of lobster is fragrant with coconut oil. Whole dorade can be cooked two ways: roasted in the wood-burning oven with turmeric and pickled chiles, or deep-fried and plopped down on a sheet pan over fat noodles and hunks of purple taro, with an armful of fresh herbs thrown on top. All of these are smart, layered and vibrant enough to win over anybody who shows up thinking that Mission Chinese Food is still in the business of knocking your head against the wall until you smile or pass out or both. It's easier to taste the quieter flavors now. With the extra space and staff, the kitchen pays some attention to the order in which dishes arrive, so it can keep the more antisocial ones in solitary confinement. Nobody is going to mistake Mission Chinese Food for a rarefied tasting room, though, not when you can get a pepperoni pizza. Mine was too soupy, but the same sourdough starter is the base for two different puffballs of bread, both tossed into the wood-fired oven, both with a natural-yeast flavor that rewards slow, appreciative chewing. One makes a fine platform for smoky pickled chiles and excellent oil-cured anchovies straight from the can, but my favorite way to eat it is to swipe it through a little dish of softened kefir butter in its own buttermilk. On Orchard Street, the throttlingly loud music, the elbows-in-your-ribs seating, the chile-induced sweats and the improbably low prices (nothing cost more than $15 when I gave the restaurant two stars in 2012 ) conspired to cover the kitchen's lapses. You registered the bumps, but as on the Cyclone, they were part of the ride. They matter more now that the menu is rich with check-goosing banquet dishes and the restaurant aims for a degree of finesse. There is a wine list now, stocked with semi-obscure natural wines. In the five months the restaurant has been open, servers have memorized a few stock phrases, like \"it goes well with our food\" (imagine that), but have not learned which part of the corkscrew will remove a metal bottle cap, or when to stop pouring an unfiltered wine to keep sediment from sliding into the glass. I liked taking a hammer to a clay brick to reveal a whole duck confit stuffed with sticky rice and chestnuts, and liked the rich and oily meat I tore from the legs, but I didn't love the dry breast meat, and I wouldn't mind taking a hammer to the $100 price tag. I also won't be handing over another $150 for a smoked prime rib topped with a king crab leg, a garnish that just seemed like bait for the hedge-fund crowd. For far less money, the celery with hazelnuts that was so nicely stir-fried one time was nearly raw the next. I might have loved the just-cooked black kale with pickled plums if not for the overpowering brininess. But these are normal lapses for what has become, against the odds and to almost everybody's benefit, a nearly normal restaurant. The hallucinations may have stopped, but Mission Chinese Food is still a trip.

Time drags down restaurants in New York. It turns hot spots into castoffs and grand dining rooms into whispery museums. Hakan Swahn opened Aquavit in 1987. Over the last 27 years, it made the reputation of one Marcus Samuelsson and transferred from a light-drenched atrium with a defining waterfall to a more prosaic space in a pink-granite tower in the East 50s. The move happened a decade ago, but Aquavit still seems to be struggling to find the right tone in its dining room, which still isn't as comfortable as it could be. Its kitchen is soaring, though. Emma Bengtsson, who took over as executive chef last spring, is cooking modern Scandinavian cuisine as delicious as any I've ever had in this restaurant. In three-course prix fixe menus as well as five- or eight-course tastings, she juxtaposes flavors and textures in ways that are both complex and finely tuned. Even more crucially, her ideas are fresh without aping fashionable Nordic tropes, which would have been the wrong way to bid for relevance. Ms. Bengtsson sprinkles enough sea buckthorn around to show she's perfectly aware of what's happening in Copenhagen, but she is in no apparent danger of disappearing inside a cloud of hay smoke. She is her own chef. Almost every dish is denoted by a pair of ingredients, but there is always more to the story. For \"scallop and radish,\" slices of raw scallops are given extra depth by white soy and fish sauce, and shaved breakfast radishes are tucked around them. Unannounced, but pivotal, is a brightly flavored froth of ramps. This green fluff has been sprinkled with puffed buckwheat kernels, whose slightly earthy crunch completes the picture. Ms. Bengtsson builds contrasts of color and shape that underscore ones of flavor and texture. She pairs creamy white buttons of delicate asparagus panna cotta with crisp ribbons of raw asparagus. Against both forms of the vegetable she pits salty-sweet gravlax in ravioli-esque pink bundles, sheets of cured salmon draped over chopped mounds of it. When a fillet of grilled Spanish mackerel shows up, you can see its slashed black-and-silver skin through a glossy apricot-colored sheath of jellied gooseberry. The gel is also tart enough to offset the mackerel's rich oils, a clever way of adding acidity without a sauce. There's a hint of sweetness in the candied pistachios and in the lacy umbrellas of fennel flowers, and more tartness in the poached red gooseberries strung along the plate with cauliflower florets -- some raw, some pickled and lightly charred. When Sam Sifton wrote the last Times review of Aquavit , in 2010, Marcus Jernmark was the chef and Ms. Bengtsson was in charge of breads and desserts. (Mr. Jernmark is now cooking at Restaurant Frantzen in Stockholm.) It's tempting to see a pastry chef's training at work in Ms. Bengtsson's dynamic handling of color, her appreciation of things that go crunch, her use of fruit in savory dishes, and her sense of sugar as a seasoning, on full display in the caramelized walnuts and drops of birch syrup with curls of an aged Swedish cheese called havgus. But it's foolish to push that argument too hard. I don't blame her background in the sugary sciences for the one savory dish of hers I could not force myself to like, a p\u00e2t\u00e9 of calf's liver encased in unnervingly sweet cucumber jelly. It looked like an expensive paperweight and tasted, to me, like a Jell-O salad concocted by a deranged '60s housewife. But I suspect it wouldn't seem nearly as strange to somebody raised in Sweden, as Ms. Bengtsson was. No matter which menu you get, there are extra treats all along the way, from a traditional potato dumpling in smoked lingonberry broth to intensely flavorful rye crackers. I was so happy spreading soft brown butter on the seed-packed Danish rye that I probably wouldn't have minded had the meal stopped right there. The climax of the eight-course menu is a stunning imitation of nature that sets yolks of sea-buckthorn curd inside eggs made of goat cheese parfait; snowflakes of yogurt foam dust a bird's nest of honeyed tuile strands. Eating the dessert called \"chocolate and texture\" is like sneaking into a box of leftover chocolate cake and quietly spooning up all the crumbs and frosting before anyone notices. In short, Ms. Bengtsson's food is wonderful. I only wish there were a little less stiffness involved in eating it. Aquavit is, among other things, a showroom for the graceful curves of Scandinavian design, from Erik Bagger's elegant flatware to Arne Jacobsen's swooping egg chairs. But one night, as the meal rounded the corner into its third hour, my lower back began to understand that the spindly armchairs were not necessarily conceived with the rigors of 21st-century tasting menus in mind. My dining companion was perched in an uncomfortable yoga pose because her banquette cushions were too far from the table for her to sit back and relax. Lumbar support wouldn't be a major issue if Aquavit were not so eager to push the longer menus. The choices on the three-course prix fixe are limited, and servers like to say that the eight-course menu provides the fullest expression of the chef's creativity, or something like that. Whatever the exact words, they were always spoken as if the meaning of life were about to be revealed. At times the servers had the somber expressions and postures you'd see at a funeral -- on the pallbearers, if not the deceased. This becomes unnerving when they stand in a row at the back of the dining room, all dressed in black. Once I could have sworn I heard a captain snap his heels together as he stood at attention, like Colonel Klink . My preliminary diagnosis is Michelinitis, an excessive stiffness caused by a desire to get or keep Michelin stars. Aquavit has two now, and I worry that if it ever gets to three, the servers will have been replaced with wax figures. But life still breaks through often enough. Sarah Blau, the beverage director, is natural and confident, and she sifts through an abundance of fine choices on the wine list. And the lounge, one of the most civilized harbors in Midtown, has a relaxed tone that the dining room could stand more of. I'd almost suggest turning the bar into a tasting-menu counter if it weren't such a fine place to chase Swedish meatballs with one of the many so-called aquavits that are really house-infused vodkas. Both have been fixtures for years, holding steady in a restaurant that in many ways seems to be getting younger all the time.

I love their food and their music and their boots. I admire their ability to tame landscapes that are hostile to human life. I respect how quick they are to stick up for their state and its culture. In fact, I may be slightly afraid of Texans. I have no desire to mess with them. I can read the bumper stickers. Reviewing Javelina , which bills itself as \"New York's first authentic Tex-Mex restaurant,\" may have presented me with an unusual conflict of interest. My interest in telling the truth about this establishment could come into conflict with my interest in not having my butt kicked by angry Texans. What if something I didn't like at Javelina turned out to be the very thing that Texans most love about authentic Tex-Mex? It may get in the way of my earnest desire for my next trip to Texas to be a safe and peaceful one. Lucky for me, I have only good things to say about Javelina. Javelina, near Union Square, is a godsend for anybody who loves to eat before 6 p.m. or after 9:30 p.m.; since opening two months ago, the restaurant has been talked up so much in the press that those are usually the only reservation times available, even if you book a week or two ahead. You may worry that at those hours the dining room would be depressingly quiet, but that's not the case. Javelina's 58 seats always seem to be taken by large groups of people shouting with youthful animation. It always sounds as if somebody were telling a woman at the far end of the table that he had just found $1,000 under the menu, and the woman were shouting back that Ryan Gosling had just texted and he's coming to the restaurant in, like, five minutes! How anybody gets drunk enough to act this way is one of several fun Javelina mysteries to keep you entertained. Fresh or frozen, the margaritas have a slight chemical taste that I was thankful for because it tended to keep my own alcohol intake to near-Mormon levels. I also stayed alert and sober when faced with the Tijuana Manhattan, made with tequila in the place of whiskey and served in a rocks glass with no ice at all, even though it was the temperature of a freshly killed snake. While bartenders elsewhere have become insufferable bores on the subjects of ice and proper shaking techniques, the ones at Javelina are refreshingly free of such pretension. Even the water is sometimes served at room temperature. One night, the bar made me a Paloma in a pint glass, while a woman at my table got her Paloma in a much smaller glass. Everybody knows women drink less than men, so we appreciated the thoughtfulness. To avoid making her self-conscious, I suppose, the restaurant even charged us both the same amount, $13. At most restaurants, you are served what you ask for so routinely that your eyes glaze over with boredom. Javelina does not fall into the trap of dull predictability. One night after I left, I realized the guacamole I'd ordered had never arrived; it's not every restaurant that gives you something to think about on your way home. Meanwhile, people at the next table were presented with a dish they insisted they hadn't asked for. \"You didn't order brisket?\" the server asked, keeping up the playful spirit. One of Javelina's calling cards, queso, is usually suggested by the servers when taking orders. Occasionally this Tex-Mex cheese fondue is served hot, but more often it arrives lukewarm, which prevents trips to the emergency room. The cooler temperature offers the added benefit of allowing a latex-like film to congeal on top, which provides an interesting contrast in texture with the liquefied cheese below. Queso is short for chile con queso, so named for the hot peppers that are stirred into the melted cheese. Javelina's traditional yellow queso is supposed to be flavored with serranos, while a white version is said to come with both jalape\u00f1os and roasted poblanos. But spicy food can be hard for many people to digest, so I am relieved to report that both colors are quite bland. A premium queso called the Bob Armstrong does have some flavor: It tastes like ground beef, which in fact it contains, along with guacamole and chopped tomatoes. The menu said that another loaded queso, the Mag Mud, was supplemented with black beans. I didn't see them, so I probed the cheese with tortilla chips, digging way down to the bottom. Black beans shouldn't be easy to lose in a bowl of white cheese. Where were they? About five minutes later, a server placed a bowl of beans on the table. \"This is supposed to go with the queso,\" he said. Mystery solved! The chef is Richard Caruso, and his menu looks unmanageably long, but fortunately only a few items on it are worth getting. Puffy tacos, a San Antonio specialty, come out well, with bits of pork shoulder and other taco toppings piled into a deep-fried corn tortilla, crisp outside and soft in the middle. The steak enchiladas are good, too, with a mouthwatering sour-cream sauce all around them. The cilantro-cream gravy around mahi-mahi is comfortingly thick and rich, and the fajitas are just what you'd expect them to be, with one difference: The flour tortillas are outstanding. Every time I went to Javelina, in fact, those flour tortillas were the best thing on the table. Tender, yielding, pressed in the kitchen and freshly browned on a comal, they are both thicker and lighter than the kind most places use as packing tape to seal up burritos. They are so good that if you happen to accidentally order the tacos filled with pale, cold brisket that tastes more like boiled pork than beef, you can simply tear off chunks of the tortilla and eat them on their own. Corn tortillas are used in the enchiladas de Tejas, and they really made me appreciate how good the other tortillas are, because these are as stiff as a new pair of jeans. They were filled with equally sturdy melted cheese and blanketed with a chile sauce that would make a wonderful way for Mexican cooking teachers to show students what happens when you try to toast dried chiles and end up burning them instead. There is no dessert menu, so every table is supposed to get a plate of sopaipillas, on the house. I got mine once out of three visits, just the right ratio to bring a tremor of anticipation to the end of the meal. The best news of all, for anybody who hates waiting around to settle the tab: There is no need to ask for the check. It is dropped without warning as soon as the last dirty plate has been cleared, and sometimes even earlier.

For his first year in business down in the headwaters of Orchard Street, just off East Broadway's warren of Fujianese places, Mr. Wu was the only Asian-American chef plundering Chinese traditions to weave a modern cuisine of his own imagining. Then Danny Bowien showed up a couple of blocks away with his kung pao pastrami and his Mylar rainbow wall and his \"Twin Peaks\" hallway, and fanboys and fangirls turned cartwheels on the sidewalks. Sure, in theory, the more the merrier, a rising tide lifts all boats, and so on, but Fung Tu was now in the shadow of the only hipster-Chinese restaurant that anybody wanted to talk about. As a friend who likes both places put it, there must be moments when Mr. Wu feels like Donovan in \"Don't Look Back.\" Fung Tu didn't help its own cause by getting off to a tentative start in 2013. A dinner about a month in held as many timid nonstarters (sunchokes and mushrooms uneventfully inhabiting a steamed bun) as eye-opening treats (the egg roll of pork belly and juicy olives stuffed into a delicately fried garlic-chive crepe). Some early reviews fell between nonplused and underwhelmed. Ligaya Mishan, in a Hungry City column , was more taken with the food than other critics were, but she thought some flavors never quite showed up. The sound of heads being scratched must have carried to the kitchen, because Mr. Wu has adjusted. Over three meals since the late winter, I rarely had any doubt what he was getting at. Mr. Wu is a two-year veteran of Per Se , and his cooking has always relied on nuance. It still does, but now the accents have been filled in. When something is supposed to be salty or spicy, it is. When salt and spice aren't on the dance card, farmers' market vegetables and other main ingredients step up. Dishes that were great from the start, like the duck-stuffed Medjool dates that drink up smoke until they taste like date bacon, are at least as good now. Some may be better. And many of the new dishes are a reason for anybody who wrote off Fung Tu after the early days to put a return visit at the top of the calendar. See, for instance, the China-quiles, which was devised for brunch but stays in its pajamas until dinner. The template is ma po tofu, but the bean curd has been replaced by a smoky egg custard so smooth and silky it almost parts itself when your spoon gets close. Over that goes a Sichuan pork sauce that makes your mouth hum and burn, studded with transparently thin yucca chips for crunch. On the opening menu, a similar but more fainthearted pork sauce was ladled over a white pile of doughy, bland dumpling knots. The sauce on the China-quiles is so much more delicious that you couldn't call it an evolution; it's more like an intervention. The Sichuan two-step occurs again in a vinaigrette that dresses cured Spanish mackerel, carved into elegant slices that almost look like small anchovies. With tart little buttons of pickled hon shimeji mushrooms, Mr. Wu shows that he can pluck the hot, sour and salty notes as cleanly and precisely as Jean-Georges Vongerichten. He can also bend classic European spring flavors in his direction, tossing asparagus, morels and peas with ricotta gnocchi that receive a whiff of Gorgonzola from doufu ru, fermented tofu. Fried soft-shell clams appeared on the menu when spring got into gear. Their breading was a shade too thick, but Mr. Wu surrounded them with flavors that could make a clam rake taste good. First, he dusted them with dehydrated tomatoes, dried ginger and ground chiles, a blend that is a staple of Indian curries but becomes newly exciting in powdered form. Fermented black beans echoed the blend's sour-salty theme. Fried clams want tartar sauce; Fung Tu's is seasoned with star anise, charred ginger and other aromatics from a bowl of pho. The snack menu at Fung Tu does more than pad the check; it lets Mr. Wu come out and play. There are chips and dip, in the form of shrimp chips, shiny with hot oil, and a soft, rich, angry-red 'nduja. A sweet throat-burning mustard sauce was a little too intense for simple chicken wings, but the pairing of gently briny smoked mussels with scallion oil was so fresh and lively that I would like to take back what I said about smoked mussels at my parents' cocktail parties. That doesn't mean you're in the clear yet, smoked oysters. Many wines would butt heads with such delicate, oblique cooking. Sommeliers overprescribe Gew\u00fcrtztraminer for Chinese food, while laypeople tend to self-medicate with Tsingtao. Jason Wagner, Fung Tu's drinks overlord and general manager, has better ideas. His very affordable list is packed with cryptic names like mondeuse and macabeu, which he will gladly decode. An enthusiastic partisan of sherry, he is worth listening to when he suggests a Gran Barquero amontillado that tastes like toasted hazelnuts dipped in caramel for the thin-cut fried pork chops with fermented mustard greens, a Chinatown classic here given a tangy, syrupy sherry-maple soy glaze. The service in the beginning was a little tightly wound for a restaurant that sat between Success Hosiery and Yat Sing Trading Inc. Now the staff has relaxed into the setting, where handsome wood booths and straight-backed banquettes are illuminated by bare chrome-dipped bulbs caged in polyhedral glass webs made by Mr. Wu's wife, the jewelry designer Jane D'Arensbourg . The bar up front provides an unhectic cove where you can decompress with cocktails that locate the middle ground between tradition and invention. Not usually the grandest of finales in Chinese restaurants, desserts, under Mr. Wu and his chef de cuisine, John Matthew Wells, are given a little more thought at Fung Tu, though they still seem like stepchildren to the rest of the menu. There are fried buns with fruit; a white chocolate mousse, not too sweet, with smooth, firm rhubarb slices; and peanut butter-chocolate truffles rolled in sesame seeds. When I first tasted one of those truffles, in 2013, it was chalk-dry and bitter, and went back to its plate after one small nibble. Like many things about Fung Tu, it turned out to be worth a second look.

Last March, I wrote an article about New York's quickly diversifying ramen landscape. One place I discussed was Mu Ramen, which had found a temporary home operating after-hours inside a bagel shop. Almost as an afterthought, I made a list of the 10 ramen bowls I had enjoyed the most during my reporting, putting Mu's suave and creamy tonkotsu at the top. The article and the list appeared online on a Tuesday afternoon. On Wednesday morning, Mu Ramen canceled all future appearances, saying it had been deluged with requests for reservations. Immediately, I was blamed in some quarters for killing the pop-up. One person on Twitter, accusing me of stoking a demand that the place could not handle, went so far as to call me a \"herb.\" If I knew how to make money, I wouldn't work for a newspaper. Still, I had a sense that this is not how capitalism works. Last week, Joshua Smookler, Mu Ramen's chef and its owner, told me \"the real reason\" he had decamped from the bagel shop. \"I was scared of the government finding out what we were doing,\" he said, even though he believed it was legal, \"and was afraid that would have an effect on our doing a brick-and-mortar.\" He had just signed a lease on the current site, and he and his wife, Heidy He, wanted to concentrate on getting it ready. Others can judge whether that makes me a card-carrying herb. For my part, I'm just happy to report that the new, bagel-free Mu Ramen is a great place to smooth over any hard feelings caused by its nine-month absence. Of all the restaurants in the city where you are expected to make loud slurping noises while you eat, Mu may be the most civilized. The 22 seats half-fill a space that could easily hold more, and if you have to wait for one of them (after an experiment with reservations, the place is now first come first served, except for the tasting menus that will begin later this month), the deep built-in benches by the front door are a pleasant change from, say, the steps in front of Totto Ramen in Hell's Kitchen. Six of the seats face a counter. The rest surround three slabs of reclaimed wood. These communal tables touch but don't quite line up, creating little pockets of semi-intimacy, along with a sense of roominess. Running along the ceiling are thin wood slats bent into waves. They look like noodles swimming out of the kitchen. Before you face down the ramen, the appetizers may call your name; they definitely called mine. One of the best things to eat at Mu comes not from the streets of Tokyo, where Mr. Smookler has never been, but from his apartment, where he and his wife steam mussels when friends come for dinner. At the restaurant, he cooks clams instead, spooning a hypnotically aromatic saffron aioli over them. Then the dish takes a leap that makes no sense until you try it: You pick up a clam and scoop up some Vietnamese nuoc cham with the shell. Why the flowery musk of saffron reacts so well to lime and fish sauce I cannot say. Every clam was a fresh surprise and a fresh mystery. He also makes a tender, airy corn pancake, squirts some foie-gras-fortified maple syrup over it, then covers it with smoked trout. It's wonderful, especially if you like the sneaky feeling of eating breakfast at night. The only Japanese thing about it, other than the flyingfish roe dotting the trout, is the name. Mr. Smookler calls it an \"okonomiyaki\" (quotation marks his). For a fuller immersion in Japanese flavors, try the chirashi variant called U&I, named for the uni and ikura that are mounded with spicy raw tuna over sushi rice. U&I is far from groundbreaking, which does not at all detract from its pleasure. But the two times I tried the fried chicken wings stuffed with foie gras and brioche, they did not stop traffic, which they are clearly meant to do. The crust and meat were superb, but the stuffing was dull, and the quince paste that might have brought it into relief was bunched up at one end of the wing. Mr. Smookler trained in the meticulous rigor of Per Se 's kitchen, and his gift, those wings notwithstanding, is his Keller-like drive to find a better way. This usually means a harder and more costly way. When his supply of pork for tonkotsu broth suddenly dried up last year, he went to the Midwest and persuaded nearly 40 farmers who raise Berkshire hogs to start a cooperative. Then he arranged for a small slaughterhouse to butcher the four cuts of pork he wanted and ship them to Long Island City, where he would cook 120 pounds of bones at a raging boil for most of a day. This is a long way to go for a bowl of soup. (Metaphorically speaking, it is also a long journey for Mr. Smookler, who was born in South Korea and raised in New York as an Orthodox Jew.) If $15 seems a fair price for those ingredients, the conviction only grows once you start eating. Like all of Mu Ramen's broths, the tonkotsu has a flavor both deep and long, with extraordinary balance and a rounded profile that has no jarring, gamy edges. Without being greasy, it's gorgeously full-bodied and almost chewy; as you wind the noodles into your mouth, the droplets that cling to them feel like heavy cream. The flavor is very good, but it's the texture that can rock you back on your three-legged stool. Mr. Smookler pulls a similar consistency out of boiled beef bones, veal bones and oxtails for the soup he calls Mu Ramen. He drew the inspiration for the stock from the Korean dish seolleongtang. For the toppings, he went to the other side of his upbringing. He corns beef brisket, brines cucumber ribbons and shaves raw cabbage into threads that cook when they hit the bowl. The half-sour pickles are juicy and refreshing, and at the same time they transport you to your favorite delicatessen. More meetings with more farmers produced the chicken skin, feet and giblets that go into the shoyu ramen that just strutted onto the menu. The broth is another full-bodied knockout, and the chicken flavor is pure and intense. The weightiest, richest possible broth is not necessarily the ramen ideal. Ramen Lab , on Kenmare Street in Manhattan, makes a more traditional shoyu with a chicken broth that is very pure but more restrained than Mr. Smooker's, so it blends with the soy more willingly. Mr. Smookler's ramen is so compelling in part because it's an exception. My praise for it should not be taken as a signal to other chefs to try to make soups as robustly silky as his. Speaking of praise, if I had it all to do over again, would I still tell the world how much I admire Mu Ramen? Do I feel the same way now? Absolutely.

When he opened Minton's Playhouse in Harlem in 1940, Henry Minton, the first black delegate to the local musicians' union, knew that jazz players were frequently in need of a meal and a place to give their instruments a workout. He gave them both. Minton's extended a tricky welcome to its jam sessions: Musicians could eat free soul food and take a solo as long as they could keep up with the house band, anchored by Thelonious Monk and Kenny Clarke. (The house band!) This gang of nonconformists delighted in bizarre chord progressions, obscure keys and melodies that ran upside down. Their bucking-bronco tactics threw some musicians right off the stage. The ones who stayed put included Dizzy Gillespie, Coleman Hawkins, Don Byas, a Juilliard student named Miles Davis and Charlie Parker, who had a notable ability to put away fried chicken. Writing in Esquire years later, Ralph Ellison described Minton's Playhouse as \" a musical dueling ground ,\" and quoted a bartender who remembered when \"Lester Young and Ben Webster used to tie up in battle like dogs in the road.\" The radical sounds that came out of the duels at Minton's and a few other clubs made a sharp break with the swing of the big-band era and formed a new style that would be called bebop. When assessing the role that Henry Minton's soul food played in the birth of bebop, it is worth keeping in mind that most of the testimonials to it come to us from hungry jazz musicians whose meals were on the house. Still, African-American music and cooking were a potent mix at Minton's once, and this was one reason to pay attention to the revival of Minton's as a jazz supper club that opened 18 months ago. Another reason came along in November, when Joseph Johnson, known as J J, took over as chef de cuisine after making a name for himself at Minton's sister restaurant next door, the Cecil . And a third, highly compelling reason takes the form of Mr. Johnson's Lowcountry gumbo. At the bottom of the bowl are broken grains of Carolina rice, with its irreplaceable flavor. The meat is smoked chicken and the seafood is wild shrimp, as tender and sweet as you could hope for. Two shrimp lie on top, crisscrossed, and their heads are still on. The base that holds it all together tastes of shellfish and tomato, of course, but a deep, mysterious oceanic note lurks down there. It comes from dried shrimp, and it makes for a haunting bowl of gumbo. Mr. Johnson does some bold, original cooking at Minton's. There are also dishes, particularly some appetizers, that could use more verve, and others that can go seriously out of tune when the kitchen has an off night. In the face of that unpredictability, the success of dinner at Minton's depends on how much you like to hear jazz musicians skittering around a tune, toying with a rhythm, tying and untying knots of harmony. If your ears don't bend that way, you have no business paying the cover charge at Minton's. If they do, I don't know a better place in the city to get them reshaped while you eat. The place is extremely welcoming, and manages an old-fashioned graciousness without strain. A dress code for men urges but doesn't positively demand jackets; the website boils the advice down to three words: \"Dress Sharp Gents.\" No customer outsharps the front of the house, though. Male servers wear black bow ties and vests, while the managerial types favor tailored suits and pocket squares. One of these, spotting a recently drained cocktail glass on our table, stopped short in mock indignation. \"This is empty. This is an outrage!\" he said, and came back in a minute with a freshly mixed drink. The tables are lined up along walls hung with cocoa-toned curtains and framed photographs of Billie Holiday and other innovators, in black and white. At one end of the room are the stage and the only item from the original Minton's that wasn't ruined by water used to put out a fire upstairs decades ago: a 1948 mural of a late-night jam session in a small bedroom lighted by a kerosene lamp. On the brass bed, a woman in a red dress has passed out, face down. If she ever comes to, she may want to fortify herself with a plate of warm biscuits and whipped butter sweetened with sorghum and vanilla. Or, if she's lucky, the kitchen will send out some hush puppies, with black-eyed peas and pickled okra mashed into the cornmeal. Black-eyed peas are a refrain in the kitchen; lightly fried, they sit alongside the crab cake appetizer, an excellent deviled version, racy with lemon juice and mustard. When she is firmly on the ground again, I'd suggest the smoked pork chop with a lightly candied glaze of pralines and a scoop of bourbon yams. Mr. Johnson works out his menus with Minton's executive chef, Alexander Smalls. Both men are African-American, as are the restaurant's principal owner, Richard Parsons, and pastry chef, Mame Sow. Mr. Smalls, a South Carolina native, is a particular exponent of Lowcountry cuisine, which carries lasting imprints of West African and Caribbean cooking. There are direct quotations from South Carolina, like smooth she-crab soup or the crab and shrimp on fat, fluffy grains of grits. And there are riffs on the African theme, including collards cooked so they keep some of their crunch and dressed with a spiced peanut sauce. It's just a side dish, but I haven't stopped thinking about it. The less said about the kitchen's weakest night, the better. I'll just express my doubts that octopus and unripe strawberries were meant to be joined in ice-cold union, along with my strong feeling that tiny, dense, sweet corn muffins are neither \"popovers\" nor a good thing to eat alongside smoked trout, and leave it at that. What matters is that we left the table happy, an unusual outcome after a rocky meal. Ms. Sow's desserts helped, especially her elegant baked alaska with a foundation of graham cracker cake and a filling of smoked and toasted marshmallow ice cream -- s'mores with a Dress Sharp attitude. So did the young musicians working out nuanced, intricate compositions in this sophisticated Harlem room. When you hear Harlem, you picture one of two places: the great hive of African-American ideas and culture that flourished and disappeared, like Atlantis, or the modern neighborhood of wine bars, construction cranes and million-dollar apartments. The two Harlems meet at Minton's when a serious band is onstage and gumbo is on the table.

The temperature outside hovered just above freezing. That said January, too. But almost nothing inside did. Santina's new glass-box building sits under the High Line like an unwisely located greenhouse, but oranges grew on the branches of a little tree, potted palms sat in the corners, heliconia and other tropical flowers gushed from glazed urns above the bar. Servers wore jelly-bean-colored polo shirts and slim-waisted chinos, like Dean Martin reaching for his 9-iron at Pebble Beach. People were sharing fritto misto, as crisp and fresh as any in town, and pulling apart multicolored bouquets of crunchy raw vegetables radiating from bowls of chipped ice. They were sipping cocktails through straws stuck into pineapple mugs, as if on a Waikiki honeymoon. Even when the front doors opened, the building is so painstakingly designed by the architect Renzo Piano (with the firm Beyer Blinder Belle) that its vestibule kept the cold winds of the meatpacking district from invading the dining room. Inside Santina, it was summer in January. It's summer there now, and unless the landlord turns off the heat, it will still be summer when Christmas gets here. Almost all the food at Santina pulses with the bright, refreshing flavors we crave in hot weather and, it turns out, in other months, too: jolts of chiles, sparks of citrus. Fresh herbs are tossed around frequently and enthusiastically. Chives, mint and basil turn a wonderfully gentle tomato-free minestrone garden-green; Thai basil leaves are flattened over the mint-and-parsley salsa verde applied to a juicy, sweet grilled porgy; tortellini sorrentina (delicate eggy pasta sheets stuffed with soft sheep's milk ricotta) are surrounded by raw marinara sauce and some olive oil mixed liberally with, what else, fresh herbs. Individually, none of Santina's tricks are really new, but the kitchen throws them all together in ways that are fun, energizing and mood-altering. Santina comes to us from Mario Carbone, Rich Torrisi and Jeff Zalaznick, busy restaurateurs who somehow find the time to endow each place they open with the thematic complexity of a Paul Thomas Anderson movie. The food, they have said, is coastal Italian, in part because the corner of Washington and Gansevoort Streets where the restaurant sits used to be shoreline . The three restaurateurs take their concepts further than anybody else in New York, though. They have elaborated the coastal-seafood notion to the point of seeing Santina as a seafood restaurant in an Italian beach town somewhere, maybe along the Italian Riviera during the 1950s or '60s. This gets them to the palm trees and the servers' resort-wear costumes. It also inspires a hilarious playlist, mixing sambas and cha-chas (Remember how the same Perez Prado tune pursued Marcello Mastroianni in \"La Dolce Vita\" wherever he went, even at the seaside village by Fiumicino?) and period Italian pop tunes from singers including Fred Buscaglione, the gangster impersonator who always seemed to get gunned down by a vengeful woman in the last verse. Mr. Carbone, who leads the kitchen with Dan Haar, the chef de cuisine, has said that the restaurant is named after his Sicilian grandmother. But Liguria plays a bigger role in the kitchen, providing pistou and the chickpea pancake, called a cecina, crisp on top with a soft white underbelly, ready to be spread with crushed, exuberantly seasoned avocados or an excellent salad of tiny shrimp or cold cubes of raw tuna humming with herbs and Calabrian chiles. The Carbone-Torrisi-Zalaznick team doesn't let its themes get in the way of a fun idea, though. The bartenders stock plenty of Italian aperitifs for their excellent run of cocktails, but they also let their grass skirts sway to the ukulele strains of tiki drinks in concoctions like the pineapple-and-banana-flavored Manganelli punch. While Italian seafood dominates the main courses, the grilled chicken comes in a sensational robust guajillo sauce that is as Ligurian as Rand Paul. These are not the kinds of two-ingredient recipes that you would throw together when it's too hot to cook. It's fairly complex stuff, and occasionally a heavy hand gets the better of the kitchen and the summer sun turns oppressive. Blue crab meat with spaghetti became mired in an oily glop of tomato sauce, and excess pork fat dragged down a bowl of warm rice salad tossed with guanciale and heaps of black pepper. Sea bass Agrigento, though cooked just right and buoyed by herbs and orange sections, sank under suffocating amounts of red peppers. Josh Ber's desserts, on the other hand, almost seem underthought. Filling three cannoli with cream in the Italian-flag colors -- green pistachio, white coconut and red maraschino cherry -- is a cute idea, but the pastry tubes are limp. So is the tart shell that's filled with a pond of dark, rich pudding to make a chocolate diplomatico; it's thin without being crisp. All the desserts are gluten-free, a worthwhile goal, but the substitutions entail more sacrifice than they probably should. The meringue puff topped with lime custard is very good, but it could use company. By the end of the meal, though, if the noise ricocheting off the glass walls hasn't gotten to you, you're likely to be in a frame of mind that isn't much bothered by limp pastry. Most of the food, particularly toward the top of the menu, is charming and playful in a way that's hard to fight. The rice-salad concept applied to shrimp zingara is a lively, spicy hit. Beyond seafood, Santina has a very winning way with vegetables. Even when it stoops to using seasonal produce, it gives them a warm-weather brightness. Butternut squash discs, lightly scorched to char and soften their edges, get a topping of cracked pink peppercorns, pumpkinseeds and honey agrodolce that almost turns them into candy. Even the kale and sunchoke salad, with pomegranate capsules strewn around like buckshot, tastes cheerful. Santina's eternal sunshine is a kind of rebuke to dogmatic seasonality. It feels like an answer from Mr. Carbone, Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Zalaznick to the wintry Scandinavian visions that are now in fashion; to the chefs whose bleak, gnarled plates of sunchokes look like scenery left over from one of Ingmar Bergman's gloomier excursions. If the people at Santina ever meet Death on the beach , they're ready to kick sand on his blanket and challenge him to a game of volleyball.

He had Moto , his Michelin-starred avant-garde restaurant in this city's meatpacking district, and a cafe, Berrista . He was putting together an innovative brewery, Crooked Fork, and finishing his second cookbook. He apparently said yes to every charity that came his way, and was the driving force (and board president) behind the Trotter Project , a nonprofit group that offers career guidance for young people with an interest in cooking. A self-taught inventor, Mr. Cantu, 38, was constantly devising gadgets and techniques, at least two of which were patented. He dreamed of cooking interplanetary snacks for the entrepreneur Elon Musk's space-travel venture. He proclaimed that he would banish world hunger with something called the miracle berry . \"He created an environment where you weren't afraid,\" said Richie Farina, the executive chef at Moto , which experimented with edible paper menus and aromatic utensils. \" \u2018No' was never a word you heard here. His thing was always, \u2018How do you do more?' \" But the questions that lingered all week in Chicago, as Mr. Cantu's stunned friends and colleagues tried to imagine why he would hang himself in the warehouse space for the brewery, were these: Had he taken on too much? Had something pushed him to the breaking point? The three-ring circus that Mr. Cantu set in motion is not unusual in this age of the superstar chef, when the successful cook is expected to build empires and brands, to champion causes and to spawn visionary ideas. But the glowing news media coverage that follows can gloss over the bombardment of demands and crises that chefs have to negotiate as their enterprises expand. \"Man, what a stressful occupation we have,\" said Paul Kahan, whose restaurant the Publican is a few blocks from Moto and who frequently crossed paths with Mr. Cantu in charity work. \"In the public's eyes, you're not relevant unless you're opening new stuff and moving forward. The stress of that kind of creative pressure that he put on himself, and the stress of business, and the stress from the public to be relevant -- they just compound. Every restaurant is a collection of five million different details. If you let all those things compound, you'll go insane.\" For Mr. Cantu, the last few years added personal and professional losses. In the fall of 2013, his revered father figure, Charlie Trotter -- one of the first celebrity chefs -- died of a stroke . And in the spring of 2014, Mr. Cantu was forced to shut one of his restaurants, iNG. Recently, some key employees left Moto, and Mr. Farina indicated that he would step down this week as executive chef; new recruits would have to be trained to understand Moto's expectation-thwarting, science-minded cuisine. Last month, an embarrassing lawsuit was filed by an investor in Moto and iNG, Alexander Espalin, who asserted that Mr. Cantu should be removed because he had used revenue from Moto to shore up the failing iNG and subsidize his personal projects. Mr. Espalin did not respond to phone messages seeking comment. On the morning after Mr. Cantu's death, his widow, Katie McGowan, referred to the lawsuit as \"garbage\" in a post on Facebook. \"It was just another case of someone trying to make a buck off of him or take credit for his ideas,\" she wrote. Ms. McGowan told The Chicago Tribune that her husband had no history of mental illness or depression, and had left no suicide note. On Thursday, the day before Mr. Cantu's funeral, current and former employees gathered in Moto's basement kitchen to cook a vast potluck feast for Ms. McGowan and the couple's two young daughters. Steps away from the glass-boxed Class IV laser that the chef used for gastronomic experiments, they spoke of Mr. Cantu as a generous, cheerful, perpetually idea-driven man who seemed to be unfazed by all the pressures of his work. \"He was in a good mood, he was happy, we were talking about the future and all the good stuff that's going on,\" said Trevor Rose-Hamblin, Moto's former general manager and Mr. Cantu's chief partner in the brewery, who had recently traveled with his boss to Vancouver, British Columbia. In his childhood in the Pacific Northwest, Mr. Cantu and his family had often been homeless, and in his formative early professional years, he had endured the long hours and the relentless boot-camp atmosphere of Mr. Trotter's kitchen in Chicago. As a result, perhaps, he seemed inclined to hide any tension behind a tough-as-nails facade. \"He had this persona around him of being Teflon,\" Mr. Farina said. \"No matter what someone said, it didn't faze him. He almost seemed invincible.\" The brewery had emerged in classic Cantu style: impulsively. \"I said, \u2018I want a brewery,' \" Mr. Rose-Hamblin said. \"He said, \u2018Let's do it.' It was as simple as that, no questions asked.\" (Plans for the project are now uncertain, but Moto is scheduled to reopen on Saturday night.) Over time, the empty brewery space, on Montrose Avenue, became Mr. Cantu's refuge, where he could slip on a white lab coat, hook up an array of blenders and experiment with a wild plan he had to turn paper into pellets that could heat buildings. \"The brewery was definitely his happy place,\" Mr. Rose-Hamblin said. \"He could go there, he could get away. He always wanted his own lab.\" Mr. Cantu's voracious appetite for scientific knowledge was well documented, and there are countless anecdotes from Chicago chefs like Giuseppe Tentori, Bill Kim, Iliana Regan, Art Smith and Michael Taus about the change-the-world ideas that poured forth from him in a torrent. His patent lawyer, Chuck Valauskas, said Mr. Cantu had so many ideas so often that the primary task at hand was \"triage,\" the challenge of sifting through the surplus and figuring out which ideas (the \"food replicator\" vending machine? the see-through tabletop oven? the all-in-one knife, fork and spoon?) were likely to survive. \"Everything that would come out of his mind was just a moonshot idea,\" said Derrek Hull, who worked alongside Mr. Cantu doing publicity for both the restaurants and, later, the Trotter Project . \"There are very few people that you come into contact with that really are revolutionaries.\" Not everyone was dazzled. Brandon Baltzley, a Chicago chef and freewheeling memoirist who discussed numerous potential collaborations with Mr. Cantu, wondered whether Mr. Cantu's childlike \"excitable\" personality suggested a fracturing focus. \"He had his hands in so many pots and not his whole body in any one,\" Mr. Baltzley said. \"He was spread superthin.\" Mr. Baltzley said he admired Mr. Cantu's creativity but couldn't always tell whether his deluge of dreams had a grounding in reality. \"There was a sense of almost detachment from the real world,\" he said. \"My first impression of him was, this guy was in a fantasy place.\" Even after Mr. Cantu closed iNG (itself a reboot of Otom, an earlier restaurant that didn't make it), his churn of ideas didn't appear to slow down. \"You start having these small failures,\" Mr. Baltzley said, \"and then even with these small failures, you keep opening up new things, and I think that's when things got really weird.\" Mr. Cantu's plans could come across as contagiously brilliant and commercially unworkable at the same time. Take the miracle berry , from West Africa, which he incorporated into the menu offerings at Berrista so that the cafe did not have to use refined sugar. \"His idea was this berry can save the world because it makes horrible things taste good,\" Mr. Baltzley said. A meal at Moto (more experimental than even the cooking of boundary-pushing modernists like Grant Achatz and Wylie Dufresne) could challenge one's very notion of what qualifies as food. It served Kentucky Fried ice cream that supposedly tasted just like the Colonel's secret recipe; a snack that looked like foam packing peanuts but tasted like buttered popcorn; and a sauce-smeared dish that was supposed to resemble roadkill. \"He wanted people to back away from the real world and live in this fantasyland he was creating,\" Mr. Baltzley said. \"How often do you want to eat that food?\" From all accounts, Mr. Cantu appeared to be almost compulsively giving: his money, his time, his encouragement. Stories of his rampant generosity abound, as do stories of his explosive creativity. \"There's a darkness that comes with those types of minds, and he definitely had that darkness,\" Mr. Baltzley said. That much is clear from the circumstances of Mr. Cantu's death, but it still doesn't make sense to the people he led and inspired over the years. Mr. Rose-Hamblin said the news this week ran counter to everything he knew about him. \"If we keep our heads down, and we experiment, we can find a solution to big, big problems,\" Mr. Rose-Hamblin said. \"That's what he taught me: No matter what happens, there's always a solution.\" ", "rec_dishes": 0}, {"id": 84, "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/dining/homaro-cantu-science-minded-chicago-chef-dies-at-38.html", "review_text": " Homaro Cantu, a Chicago chef who kept a Class IV laser as a cooking tool and dreamed of eradicating hunger with nutrient-soaked edible paper, was found dead on Tuesday on the city's North Side. He was 38. He had hanged himself at a brewery he was building, the Cook County medical examiner's office said Wednesday. His wife, Katie McGowan, told The Chicago Tribune that she was baffled by his suicide. He did not leave a note, she said, and he had no history of depression or mental illness. Mr. Cantu, the chef at the acclaimed Chicago restaurant Moto, was among a small vanguard of American chefs who used chemical-laboratory techniques to coax food into novel and sometimes peculiar forms. He had worked for four years in the kitchen of another noted Chicago restaurant, Charlie Trotter, when Moto hired him to be its first chef. He had impressed the owner by cooking fish at the table in a small polymer box (essentially a miniature transparent oven), among other feats. Moto has held a Michelin star since 2012. Mr. Cantu eventually took over most of the ownership. In his early days at the restaurant, when it served synthetic champagne squirted into a glass by a large black medical syringe, Mr. Cantu seemed as if he were out to shock. As time went by, though, critics and diners began to pay more attention to the quality of his cooking as well. \"A 20-course tasting menu can begin with \u2018sushi' made of paper that has been printed with images of maki and wrapped around vinegared rice and conclude with a mint-flavored picture of a candy cane,\" said a 2005 profile in The New York Times Magazine. \"Should you fail to finish a course,\" it went on, Mr. Cantu \"will emerge from the kitchen with a refund: a phony dollar bill flavored to taste like a cheeseburger and fries. It may sound like some sort of Surrealist stunt with dire intestinal consequences, but here's the rub: The \u2018food' tastes good. Good enough to lure diners back at $240 per head (including wine).\" Mr. Cantu filed six kitchen-related patent applications over the years for various items, from an innovative utensil to the polymer box, all revealing a serious purpose to his fascination with gadgets. Customers might have giggled as they ate a picture of a cow that tasted like filet mignon, but Mr. Cantu said in interviews that his technology for flavoring and fortifying edible paper could help feed soldiers at war, astronauts in space and people in refugee camps. \"My goal with this is to deliver food to the masses that are starving,\" he said in an interview with the magazine Fast Company . \"We give them something that's healthy, that has an indefinite shelf life and that is supercheap to produce.\" In 2010, as co-host of the Discovery Channel's Planet Green television series \"Future Food,\" Mr. Cantu survived for a week eating only miracle berries and weeds, leaves and grass that he scavenged from his backyard. Born in Tacoma, Wash., on Sept. 23, 1976, Mr. Cantu was homeless from age 6 to age 9. He traced his interest in helping people through technology and his skills as a chef to that experience. He grew up in Portland, Ore., and graduated from the Western Culinary Institute (now a Le Cordon Bleu School) there. More recently, his ideas about ending hunger shifted to the miracle fruit, a berry that temporarily makes sour or bitter foods taste sweet. He called this \"flavor tripping,\" and it was the inspiration for another restaurant, iNG, now closed, as well as a coffee shop, Berrista. Last month, Alexander Espalin, an investor in iNG and Moto, sued Mr. Cantu in Cook County Circuit Court. Mr. Espalin, who claimed that he had never received any share of Moto's profits, charged that Mr. Cantu had misused restaurant funds to promote his own businesses, including a book he had published, \"The Miracle Berry Diet Cookbook.\" On her Facebook page, Ms. McGowan, Mr. Cantu's wife, wrote, \"It was just another case of someone trying to make a buck off of him or take credit for his ideas.\" Shortly before the suit was filed, Moto's pastry chef went to work for another restaurant. Early this month, its executive chef announced that he, too, was leaving. Last June, The Tribune reported, Mr. Cantu helped start the Trotter Project in honor of the chef Charlie Trotter , who died in 2013. The effort is aimed at providing culinary and nutritional education, particularly to students and poor neighborhoods. Mr. Cantu lived in the Old Irving Park neighborhood. Besides his wife, a former cook whom he had met at Charlie Trotter, his survivors include two young daughters.

Normal is not what Meat Hook Sandwich does, though, so I ended up eating something that I would call the greatest cheeseburger I've ever tasted if not for the inconvenient fact that it wasn't a cheeseburger. What I ate was a chopped cheese sandwich, also known -- in the very small patch of the United States where it is known at all -- as chop cheese. This sandwich rarely strays from its natural habitat, the bodegas of Harlem and the Bronx. Filled with griddled ground beef in a cloak of melted American cheese, it is a distant relative of the Philadelphia cheesesteak and of the tavern sandwich, an Iowa standby that also goes by the irresistible name \"loose meat.\" In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Meat Hook Sandwich stirs in some pickle relish and piles the meat-cheese-relish amalgam onto a sesame-seed semolina roll. The relish makes every bite spicy and sweet, while the cheese makes the meat, already potent and rich, extra hot and slick. The architecture of the chopped cheese avoids a common if generally overlooked flaw of many cheeseburgers: the tendency of the cheese to drift upward from the patty and incorporate itself into the upper bun. Discovering this rearranged cheeseburger at the sandwich shop should not have been a shock. The place opened last year as a satellite of the Meat Hook , a butcher store a few blocks away whose bacon-cheeseburger sausage has made numerous and rewarding (for me) trips from the display case to my grill. Behind the counter, brawny women and men are always breaking down entire hogs and sides of beef from livestock raised on virtuous nearby farms. The economics of whole-animal butchery demand ingenuity in selling off the less-popular cuts and scraps. House-made cold cuts were an obvious sideline. As mortadella, ham and p\u00e2t\u00e9 amassed, the omens began to gesture toward sandwiches. The Meat Hook's restaurant, on Lorimer Street, does not look expensively decorated; the neon sign spelling \"sandwich\" in big white block capitals was a hand-me-down from another sandwich business. This hangs on one of two brick walls painted white. Fourteen backless metal stools surround exactly three tables. Sandwiches are ordered at a counter and delivered to the table in red plastic baskets. This is the extent of what you would call \"service,\" except on Wednesday nights, when $25 buys a Meat Hook steak, an accompaniment (sometimes a salad) and as many bottles of cheap beer as you can drink without calling attention to yourself. The beers, Miller High Life or Pacifico, are carried to the dining room by a butcher moonlighting as a cook doubling as a waiter. The sandwich concern was founded by three pillars of the butcher shop: Brent Young, a Pittsburgh native with a lifelong hoagie fixation; Ben Turley, a rehabilitated restaurant cook; and Tom Mylan, who recently wriggled off the Meat Hook. They put a veteran Brooklyn chef named Gil Calderon in charge of the kitchen. Try to picture the lunch a hungry young butcher would dream about after spending the morning hunched over a large animal with a hacksaw, and you have a good idea what you are in for. There are no elegant tricorner panini, and nothing you can eat with one hand while holding a pinot grigio in the other. The cooks listen to their lizard brains. Simultaneously, a higher sandwich intelligence is at work, one that understands the crucial role of contrast and the life-giving spark of condiments. Or, as Mr. Turley and Mr. Calderon recently put it , \"Don't think of your sandwich as a Beyonc\u00e9, think of it as a Destiny's Child.\" The kitchen knows that even great roast beef, which the Meat Hook's is, needs backup. It needs a tangy, salty slice of Cheddar and horseradish sauce. Shredded lettuce for its juicy crispness and then, for a savory crackle, papery wheels of fried red onions. Finally, the bootylicious ingredient: a scattering of potato that seems to have been scraped off the bottom of a pan of hash browns. One sandwich is based on a hunch that roasted pork would benefit greatly from a creamy tuna sauce, vitello tonnato-style. (It does, and if the sauce is applied too lightly, the sandwich can be a little dry.) Another is a fairly straight-up Italian hero that, for once, starts with first-rate cold cuts (mortadella, pepperoni, soppressata, all from the Meat Hook), then hits them with caponata, raw onions, some unusually good pickled peppers and lardo whipped with roasted garlic. Would the flavors of the meats come through more clearly if they were folded and tucked to give them room to breathe, rather than being stacked up like plywood? Or is that a question that only a nonbutcher would ask? The Vegetarian Option is essentially a semolina roll heaped with all the garnishes from the other sandwiches. No meat intrudes on the fun, although the kitchen bends the rules slightly and slides in a purpose-made beet-parsnip-carrot hummus, without which the sandwich would probably taste like a heap of garnishes. In an expert piece of expectations-setting, Meat Hook Sandwich advertises that the Vegetarian Option is \"better than you'd expect.\" This was absolutely correct; the sandwich is impressively complex and still satisfying. If I have to choose between that and the hot chicken sandwich, though, vegetarianism is going to get a quick shove into moving traffic. An ode to the Nashville specialty known for producing copious tears of pain and ecstatic, speechless reveries, the hot chicken at Meat Hook Sandwich is made from hot-sauce-brined thigh meat with the deep flavor of a barnyard bird. Fried chicken sandwiches are usually made with pallid cutlets, so the intensity is startling. On top of that, there is sweet pickled celery and dried-chile schmaltz. This is chicken that can bring your whole day to a dead stop for a few minutes. Next to the order counter is a small blackboard that is always worth scanning. This is where specials like the chopped cheese appear. Around St. Patrick's Day, there was tender corned beef on seeded pumpernickel with a devastatingly rich coating of Welsh rarebit sauce. Recently, I've found a fine chipotle-fueled sloppy Joe. I wish I could tell you more about the steak and beer special, but when I tried to get it on the first day of this month, I was met instead by another rearranged cheeseburger. \"April Fools,\" Mr. Young said. Two all-beef patties had been nacho-fied with Tex-Mex-style queso sauce, pickled jalape\u00f1os and crushed tortilla chips. If this is what butchers daydream about, I need a cleaver.

Limani opened in November around the corner from the Rockefeller Center skating rink. Its menu is Greek, and its strength is formidably expensive seafood, which up until the moment it is laid on the grill can be found spread out on a small mountain of ice at the edge of the open kitchen. The modern dining room subliminally evokes the Aegean and has space for nearly 200 people at tables draped with white cloths. It all sounds peaceful enough. But four blocks away is Estiatorio Milos , which has operated on West 55th Street since 1997. It serves Greek food with a strong emphasis on formidably expensive seafood, which is displayed on a bed of ice near the open kitchen. The d\u00e9cor is modern and suggests the Aegean, the tablecloths are white, and there are easily enough chairs for 150. You might write this off to an uncanny coincidence if you didn't know that this Milos is a branch of one in Montreal and that this Limani is a branch of one in Roslyn, N.Y., whose founding manager worked in the Milos company for 16 years. The first chef in Roslyn was the original chef at Milos in New York. The owners have kept up traditions in Manhattan. Their kitchen is in the hands of M. J. Alam, who used to be the executive chef at Milos. Release the spiny lobsters: We have a fish fight. By longstanding tradition, a fish fight needs a referee. So, to begin with the most crucial item: As a rule, the array and quality of seafood at both establishments can give a seafood lover a happy case of vertigo. American standards like red snapper, bigeye tuna and black sea bass can be had, but there are far cheaper places to eat the standards. You go to Limani or Milos for creatures that circulate in the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic and generally migrate to New York only when somebody buys them a plane ticket. Among other species, both restaurants recently had the firm-fleshed John Dory, with its false eye staring out from its flank; rascasse, or scorpion fish, mild tasting and a traditional component of bouillabaisse; lavraki, or branzino, long and silvery and delicately sweet; and barbouni, or red mullet, a small fish whose full flavor is out of proportion to its size. Even more luxurious are the shellfish: firm and exquisitely flavored langoustines; spiny lobsters the size of a leg of lamb, with an intense taste that suggests a wild-game cousin of langoustines; live scallops, presented on the half shell with the slightly chewy, frilly band of mantle; and the heart-stoppingly sweet and supple red shrimp called carabineiros. Both restaurants serve red shrimp with a glass of sherry for the heads, although Milos suggests dunking the heads before sucking out the fat, while Limani advocates pouring the wine into the head and knocking it back, fat and all, like a J\u00e4germeister shot. In a perfect world, I would eat like this three times a week, with no regrets and no plaque in my arteries. In Midtown, which is still striving for perfection, a life like that would cost buckets of money. Limani is the cheaper restaurant, both in the menu prices and in the fish, which is sold by weight before cleaning. It charged me $85 a pound for those red shrimp, or about $17.50 each. Milos gave them to me for $95 a pound. Barbouni was $43 a pound at Limani and $61.50 at Milos. Limani is nobody's idea of a cheap night out, but the somewhat less fearsome seafood prices are a firm point in its favor. And it was only at Milos that I was served a fish that had stayed slightly too long on the flames, a whole fagri costing just over $80. It was also Milos that let scorched oil from the grill mar the lush taste of a $270 spiny lobster. On the rest of the menu, Limani's prices are merely expensive, while the ones at Milos read like a long series of typographical errors. The French fries are certainly worth $8, and by Manhattan standards $49 isn't out of line for three meaty, tender, very good double-cut lamb chops. But why $32 for a Greek salad, even if it had enough juicy, red, almost-summery tomatoes and creamy feta for four? And while the signature appetizer, a stack of fried zucchini and eggplant over a mound of tzatziki, was far lighter and more delicate than Limani's copycat version, paying $33 sucked the fun out of it. Prices seem to have doubled at least since 1997, when Ruth Reichl gave Milos two stars in its last New York Times review. Today, considering what happened to the fagri and spiny lobster, one star is more appropriate. But here things get complicated. Limani doesn't always duplicate its finesse at the grill throughout the kitchen. Gigante beans there were stewed in a tomato sauce that might have passed for canned soup. Desserts, except for a thick slab of yogurt with excellent honey or the fried dough balls rolled in cinnamon and honey syrup, called loukoumades, were not hard to pass up. At lunch, a tuna burger seemed determined to leave no impression at all, and a chicken kebab had me looking out the windows for the nearest halal cart. The afternoon was saved by an ideally cooked dorade royale. If money is not at the top of your pile of worries, or if you'll move it to the bottom of the pile for red shrimp and John Dory on the grill, then the choice between Limani and Milos may come down to style. Milos's d\u00e9cor is a one-of-a-kind blend of exposed structural columns in bare concrete and weathered Greek artifacts, including amphorae big enough to hide a pair of rodeo clowns. The split-level dining room is loud, lively and full of people who act like regulars. Service is practiced, and can be charming. A few years ago, when I was seated between a pillar and a low concrete wall, a server popped up on the other side of the wall and said with a winning smile, \"You have my favorite table!\" Limani, which in nearly every other respect swims in Milos's wake, darts off on its own in the interior-design department. The floor of the dining room is done in blinding white marble, and the leather seats are a softer white. In the center is an infinity pool that keeps changing from blue to violet, the colors glinting off the small metal fish on a mobile that hangs in a double helix from the ceiling overhead. Some people will look at it and see a Greek fishing town taken over by millionaires. I saw South Beach. By now, though, readers who give any thought to their dinner budgets have no doubt decided to run screaming from Midtown and head straight for Astoria, Queens. For starters, let me suggest Astoria Seafood, which is like Limani or Milos but with no luxuries, fewer kinds of fish and check totals that don't rival the round-trip fare to Athens.

It took most of an hour in my kitchen to reduce carrot leaves, cauliflower stems, onion butts and scallion greens to small bits that I hoped would make an appetizing lunch for the molds, mini-bugs and earthworms in the backyard compost bin. The next night, I had a meal that made me wonder if my time would have been better spent tossing everything with a good vinaigrette and eating it myself. The setting was Dan Barber's Greenwich Village restaurant, normally known as Blue Hill. For three weeks in March, he has converted it into a pop-up called wastED where he and his cooks sell fish bones, bruised and misshapen vegetables, stale bread and other items not commonly thought of as food for $15 a plate. The pop-up presents a creative challenge to the kitchen crew (how can we make this stuff taste good?) and an intellectual challenge to the diner (why do we assume it won't?). It was a night of thoughtful, creative, entertaining and surprisingly tasty agitprop. Chefs with an eye on the bottom line try to avoid kitchen waste. In a memorable scene in Bill Buford's book \"Heat,\" Mario Batali berates Babbo's cooks for throwing out vegetable scraps that could make perfectly good ravioli fillings while he roots around in a trash can like a bear cub at a campground. In their search for overlooked ingredients, Mr. Barber and his crew did more than that. They went out on a crosstown refuse hunt. From Baldor Specialty Foods, a restaurant supplier in the Bronx, came bruised outer leaves from heads of bok choy and peelings from fennel, kohlrabi and apples for the \"Dumpster dive vegetable salad\" that persuaded me to reconsider my compost habits. To be painstakingly accurate, most of the persuasion was done by a buttery vinaigrette of ground pistachios, a swipe of tarragon sauce and a heap of white froth made by draining the liquid from chickpea cans and whisking it. Smashed pulp from Liquiteria's juice presses was dyed to a reasonably convincing beef color by beet juice, shaped into burgers and slapped on buns made from \"repurposed\" bread. From Raffetto's, the shop on Houston Street, they picked up remnant noodles that ran from the pasta rollers between batches of dough. These were boiled together, so they ranged from floppy to taut, and were dressed with a mildly fishy sauce made from monkfish tripe and smoked fish heads. The kitchen staff members took turns dropping off plates. One showed pictures of Baldor's bagged, peeled produce on an iPod and another pantomimed how he had scraped skate wings until his arms hurt. The night's guest chef, Philippe Bertineau from Alain Ducasse's bistro in Midtown, Benoit, appeared with head cheese, a pig foot croquette, stewed offal and tongue layered with foie gras, a reminder that French country cooking has a long tradition of turning scraps into treats. Halfway through dinner, Mr. Barber came to the table with a sheet of wax paper holding a fish skeleton as long as a baguette. \"I grew up on this stuff,\" he said. He didn't mean the bones, which used to belong to a black cod, but the shiny white flesh sold in appetizing shops as sable. When sable is filleted, some meat sticks to the carcass. I unstuck it with a sauce spoon. Sable is always a treat, and this came with a bonus: the gooey, soft bits hugging the spine. Between mouthfuls, I crunched on some crisp carrot tops with fried fish skin. The skin, the bones, and the heads in the salad dressing came from Acme, the Brooklyn facility that gives New York some of its finest smoked fish. The restaurant was packed to the gills, one part of the fish that was left off the menu. A long row of high tables had been shoehorned into the center of the dining room. These were not just any tables, either. \"The tables were grown -- yes, grown -- during the second half of February with compostable materials and mycelium,\" read a note on the back of the menu. The walls, meanwhile, were covered by a white fabric draped over crop rows to keep out frost and aphids. They were backlit, which gave the restaurant the feel of a wedding tent. \"A wedding tent, that's nice,\" Mr. Barber's brother and partner in Blue Hill, David, said when he stopped by my table. \"Most people say it looks like a meth lab.\" Breaking with protocol, I had asked Dan Barber for a reservation. This, of course, gave him the chance to set aside the choicest carrot tops and fish heads. Let the reader beware. I dropped the fake-name routine because seats have been scarce, my deadline was zooming in, and I am not trying to write a restaurant review. Still, the forewarned reader may wonder what I thought of the meal. I had one of the best times I've enjoyed in a restaurant in the last year. The food was great, full of the surprises that happen when cooks run into inspiration at full creative tilt. Almost every bite was delicious, with a few exceptions. \"Repurposed\" buns did not knock Martin's potato rolls from their place in my heart. I had trouble getting at the fried monkfish wings, which were shaped like a V, with most of the good stuff jammed down in the crevice. If I were going to enjoy them on a regular basis, I'd need to grow a snout. Also, the crackers served alongside an intense and rich bowl of broth made from desiccated dry-aged beef trimmings had almost no flavor. They were made from field corn, the commodity crop that goes into high-fructose corn syrup, cattle troughs and ethanol. It accounts for 99 percent of the nation's cornfields, and it is the only ingredient used at wastED that I'm convinced humans have no business eating. This was Mr. Barber's point, of course. The meal was gently and consistently seasoned with a protest against the grotesque way Americans waste food while millions of us go hungry. Lack of money and other resources forced members of 6.8 million households in the United States to eat less than they normally would at times during 2013, the latest year for which government statistics are available. At the same time, 133 billion pounds of the food that is available to consumers goes into the garbage annually. The facts and numbers could go on, but I feel ashamed already. Our food is produced and consumed in a bogglingly complex web. It can't easily be changed, certainly not by a three-week stunt in an expensive Manhattan restaurant. Perceptions do change, though, and quickly. Sliced white bread was a prestigious item in 1960. Many find it worthless today. For years our restaurant culture has placed supreme value in pristine, high-priced ingredients. What if everybody who could afford restaurants like Blue Hill learned instead to prize bruised vegetables because they had been transformed by a chef's skill and ingenuity? What might we do with the ingredients that any hack could cook? It's a provocative, appealingly subversive idea. For now, whenever one of my children complains about dinner, I'll silence him by saying that I once ate garbage, and liked it.

Wrapping each floret is a pale-gold skin of batter. It's almost invisible, but you feel it as you bite, its soft snap reinforced by the full-on crunch of chopped almonds. Poached before it is fried, the cauliflower is nicely salted all the way down to its tender core, but it is still cauliflower, so it needs a little support. This is supplied by a lush green tomatillo, pistachio and fresh herb sauce that gets in a quick, peppery jab before it signs off. Where does this dish come from? In the proximate sense, it is from Andrew Carmellini's latest restaurant, Little Park , inside the Smyth hotel in TriBeCa. The ultimate inspiration, though -- where is that from? The batter is related to tempura, and I think I might have caught the rustle of Mexico in the sauce. Beyond that, it is hard to say. The fried cauliflower seems to be one of those dishes that happen when a chef's imagination is allowed to roam. Mr. Carmellini once dreamed of owning an Italian, a French and an American restaurant. In less than four years, starting with Locanda Verde in 2009, he and his partners built all three. Then, after the Dutch and Lafayette , he knocked out a fourth, a drop-in pasta place called Bar Primi that seemed to come together in less time than it takes the rest of us to watch a cat video on Facebook. Since becoming his own boss, in other words, Mr. Carmellini has cooked in and around the traditions of one country or another. At Little Park, he and his chef de cuisine, Min Kong, the executive sous chef at Carbone until last year, are working out their ideas from scratch. This may be why the best dishes there seem more fresh, natural and intuitive than what's on his other menus and why Little Park has less in common with Locanda Verde than it does with forward-leaning places like Estela or even the modern-Mexican Cosme . It is Mr. Carmellini's most contemporary restaurant. In a sense, it's his first. In the modern fashion, most dishes are of roughly the same size and complexity. There are no second-class ingredients and almost no side dishes. The vegetables are as intriguing as the animals on plates, like steamed black bass with bracingly vinegared lentils or the intensely beefy hanger steak under broccoli whose thin stems had been judiciously charred. Beets are, insistently, the point of the earthy and velvety risotto made from them, although cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and goat cheese do put extra wiggle in its walk. Flowers and shaved bull's-eyes of Chioggia beets on top keep the shockingly red plate from looking like a crime scene. It's a lucky carrot that ends up in Ms. Kong's kitchen; rarely is the vegetable lavished with so much attention. Some are roasted to a smoky sweetness, some are juiced and whipped into an airy orange custard, and still more are slivered into ribbons. All are flattered by the molasses notes in sticky black garlic and by a patch of cocoa nibs and toasted crumbs. At lunch, Mr. Carmellini and Ms. Kong send a stunning little sandwich down the runway, a celery root schnitzel with creamy, incisive mustard and apple-brussels sprout slaw on a sesame-seed bun. The celery root is not the most flavorful I've had, but it is soft in all the right ways, augmented by generous bookends of golden breading. I ate one and wanted another. Another small marvel: the first worthwhile spaghetti squash I've ever met. It was baked with garlic and a stealthy dose of lobster butter and upstaged the protein it was meant to support, half of a tiny lobster tail that wasn't warm enough to melt the herb butter slapped on top. There was other evidence of inattentiveness, like the oily mop of oversauced whole-wheat spaghetti with cabbage and red wattle pork. (The menu calls the poor hog \"red waddle.\" No doubt it was a large animal, but why add insult to injury?) Little Park's servers also push the popular contemporary con that small plates are meant for sharing. As one of my dinner guests remarked, \"That's like saying: \u2018This is a studio apartment. It's perfect for a family.' \" I know I wanted more than one of the frilly kale-filled ravioli sitting on a sauce of sweet roasted winter squash. In most other ways, though, servers are poised and helpful. They are quick to demystify the peculiar cocktails, like the gin sour dusted with beet powder, and the even more peculiar wine list. Josh Nadel, the beverage director for Mr. Carmellini's restaurant group, has divided bottles by topography (\"river valleys,\" \"lakes and slopes,\" \"mountains and terraces\"). This is an illuminating way to learn about viticulture, but it's a confusing way to find a red that goes with duck. Additional subdivisions into light-, medium- and full-bodied are easier to grasp. A bit of explanation may also be required with some of Jennifer Luk's desserts. What is frozen lemon fluff? It's a delicious white block of dense citrus meringue around which orange sections and candied ginger can happily revolve. How about cinnamon toast ice cream? It's something like crushed Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal sprinkled over ice cream that tastes like sweet bread, and it's as charming as it sounds. As for the \"winter sundae\" of apple and beer, it's slightly more charming than it sounds, but maybe not quite enough more. When you think of Mr. Carmellini's restaurants, quiet and civility are not the first qualities that come to mind. Little Park has them. Desert-toned fabrics seem to soak up excess noise in a dining room designed by Gachot Studios that walks the line between midcentury chic and expense-account bland. Anyone who has faced down the unwelcoming committee at the door of Locanda Verde, or showed up on time at Lafayette only to be sent to the bar, or waited on the Bowery to get into Bar Primi, will appreciate the more hospitable greeting at Little Park. Some of my guests, arriving early for a 9 p.m. table, were already seated when I showed up. The calm atmosphere may be the least fashionable thing about Little Park.

This is not a question critics ask every day. But then the place in question, Eleven Madison Park , is not a restaurant where most of us would or could eat every day. This, in fact, is one of the sticky issues raised by the drastic changes its two driving spirits, Daniel Humm and Will Guidara, have made since its last review in The New York Times, in 2009. Back then, when Frank Bruni promoted it to four stars from three, most customers still selected three courses from Mr. Humm's menu at a cost of $88. Today, lunch or dinner is $225 for more than a dozen courses. All but two are typically chosen by the kitchen. A few days in advance of a recent reservation, the head ma\u00eetre d'hotel, Justin Roller, sent an email warning, \"Our tasting menu lasts approximately three and a half hours, so please plan your day accordingly.\" The last time I got a message like that, it was from my doctor, shortly before my colonoscopy. Meals at Eleven Madison now cost more, take longer and offer less variety from one week to the next. As might have been predicted, this took the restaurant out of regular rotation for many locals. Perhaps to make up for the loss of actual New Yorkers in the dining room, Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara turned the restaurant into a theme park about the city . In its very early days in 2012, the result was the most ridiculous meal I've ever had. Nearly every course began with a clunky, humorless history lesson about steakhouses, appetizing stores, clambakes, cheesecakes and even Times Square scam artists. The patter overshadowed and undermined the food. Notably, it had no voice, in a city full of them. \"Three-card monte is now illegal, but along the same lines, we had a deck of cards made for us,\" my server recited, before doing a magic trick. I never figured out how it was done, but the greater mystery was just why a restaurant charging hundreds of dollars for such kitsch would want to lecture diners about \"hustlers and scammers.\" Some of this gab has been dropped, but not all. Even now, when any ingredient is grown in New York State, someone is sure to point it out. Hang on, New York has farms? And chefs can cook their stuff just like the ingredients I get at the supermarket? Wait, I need to write this down. Constantly mentioning the region only underlines the shallowness of Eleven Madison Park 's approach to it. (A server announced that the oysters grew \"upstate\" in Greenport, N.Y., which will be news to Long Islanders.) Mr. Humm doesn't dig down into the natural and cultivated landscape of his region the way, say, Christopher Kostow, Sean Brock and Dan Barber do. He practices entry-level locavorism. Objections like this buzzed before my eyes so insistently that at times they blinded me to what was going on in the soaring Art Deco space across from Madison Square Park. Which was: a roomful of people almost goofy with happiness. The woman dining alone with her camera shyly accepting an invitation into the vast and gleaming kitchen for a special course prepared a few inches in front of her; the couple watching, as if seeing their first sunrise, a sommelier who removed a cork by melting the bottle's neck with red-hot tongs; the guests at my table going limp as they tasted a crazily good braised pork collar and cheek in a dark sauce that was like pig marmalade; and finally even me, the overthinking picker of nits and finder of faults. Under the restaurant's relentless, skillful campaign to spread joy, I gave in. What Eleven Madison feeds your intellect can have the value of junk food, but what it feeds your mouth, stomach and spirit is something else. The restaurant tries as hard as any I know to bring delight to the table with every course. It succeeds so often that only the most determinedly grumpy souls could resist. Even the spoken intros have a role. They serve to tee up the surprises that emerge from the kitchen, which reliably turn skeptics into swooners, especially as Mr. Humm has axed some of his sillier gimmicks. (Back to Times Square with you, three-card monte.) More crucially to this restaurant's intent, the patter opens a window between customers and staff. The dopey speeches work like pickup lines; you may smirk, but at least you respond, and once you've done that, a conversation can start. Mr. Guidara, a front-of-house man who rose to become Mr. Humm's business partner in the restaurant when it broke off from the Union Square Hospitality Group, is a creative partner, too, working to establish a loose, entertaining tone in the dining room that sets Eleven Madison Park apart from its competitors. The servers are deeply attentive to details. As a manager told New York magazine , \"It takes 10 months to learn how to pour water.\" The remote formality that typically comes with punctilious service has been banished. Servers want to make you an active collaborator in the fun. As Bacall said to Bogart, it's even better when you help. At the center of the collaboration is, of course, Mr. Humm's cooking. He is, at heart, a neo-classicist, a master of pruning the old-fashioned curlicues from the traditional haute cuisine of his training to make the pleasures more modern and direct. This isn't always clear when he is trying to keep up with path-blazing chefs like Grant Achatz and Ren\u00e9 Redzepi . But it's the force that drives his best innovations, like globes of celery root braised in a pig's bladder, inspired by the classic French dish poulet en vessie. The white globes will be bathed in a truffled chicken reduction and set beside a circle of celery root pur\u00e9e that has been spooned over, guess what, more truffles. And Mr. Humm, always alert to opportunities for spectacle, knows that beyond forming an airtight vessel for steam, an inflated pig's bladder shimmying around a copper saut\u00e9 pan makes a great conversation piece in the dining room. Recently, the cheese course packed into a picnic basket was retired. A fondue has taken its place, and it is both homey and spectacular. The serving bowl is a baked carnival squash and the utensil a hot, soft pretzel stick from the protean pastry kitchen. There is no homily about the glories of the street-corner pretzel cart. You are left alone to revel in the melted cheese, to mash the pretzel against cubes of sweet squash, and to imagine anything you like. I decided to imagine that the fondue came straight out of Mr. Humm's upbringing in Switzerland, because it worked on my senses with the deep, soulful pull of a childhood memory. There are no printed menus at the start of the meal, just a conversation led by the table's captain. Once allergies and aversions are out of the way, two choices remain. One concerns the main course; the other is about foie gras. Mr. Humm is a virtuosic handler of fattened duck liver, so either the hot or cold version is likely to produce altered states of consciousness. He brings out foie gras's sweet and silky traits by layering it with braised red cabbage and serving it in a chilled wedge that looks like a slice of marbled Bundt cake; its meatier and robust qualities come through in a seared slice under fried brussels sprout leaves and smoked eel. Many people will choose no foie gras at all. I don't know what you can give a meat-avoider to make her feel she's not missing out as her dinner partner goes bug-eyed over foie gras, but the watermelon and goat cheese salad served to a guest of mine last fall was definitely not it. So much attention goes into the showstoppers that substitutions do not always measure up. By now, a more glamorous alternative may be in the wings. Many things are in the wings at this restaurant, which is defined above all by its fluid movement into the future. The New York theme may wind down, though I hope the manhattan cart stays, stocked with mixers for the classic cocktail and its five variants to be stirred up at your elbow. Whatever new theme rolls to the table after that may be only partly baked, like the initial New York menu, but Eleven Madison Park's true theme will stay the same: convincing you that you've been lifted to some better world until the man in the top hat outside whistles for your cab.

It used to be a rock of stability. The shifting winds of fashion did not bend it. Its basic formula was so firmly set that you could go to a steakhouse in San Bernardino and then one in Baltimore and have the same meal without looking at the menu. Now steakhouses are swerving all over the road. Their menus read like competitions to see who can stray furthest from plain beef and potatoes. The more desperate they grow in their attempts to prove they're not like the staid steakhouses of yore, the more they seem to converge. Take two examples that opened last year: Knife, in Dallas , and Bowery Meat Company , in Manhattan. Knife has duck risotto on the menu; Bowery Meat Company has duck lasagna for two. Knife has a whole roasted chicken; Bowery Meat Company has half a roasted chicken. Knife has half a roasted pig's head with Mexican salsas and tortillas; Bowery Meat Company has pork belly Chinese-barbecue style. After a while, reading these menus is like seeing your dad twerk. But the hey-we're-cool-no-really menus aren't as troubling as the way these places insist that they don't want to be called steakhouses anymore. Knife, according to its website, is \"a reinvention of the steakhouse experience.\" And here on First Street just off the Bowery, the chef Josh Capon and the restaurateur John McDonald, the team behind Lure Fishbar and El Toro Blanco , have brought forth a \"meat company\" whose website says it is \"not a traditional steakhouse, but a balanced meat-centric menu.\" Just between us, Bowery Meat Company is not, in fact, a menu, balanced or otherwise. But it does have a menu, and on it you will find seven cuts of beef and a burger, potatoes cooked at least four ways and a spinach side dish. Mr. Capon appears at certain tables presenting masses of raw beef draped on a cutting board. And while the wine list has admirable and enticing range, its foundation is a cache of broad-beamed cabernets that are obviously meant to be married off to bricks of dry-aged beef. Is it possible that Bowery Meat Company doesn't know it's a steakhouse, the way Bruce Willis in \"The Sixth Sense\" doesn't know he's a ghost? The dining room, by Meyer Davis Studio , could go either way. The right angles, the horizontal grain of the glossy paneling, the broad stretches of simple geometric curtains and the collection of midcentury chairs by Eames and other designers call up the heyday of Palm Springs and gibsons and Pall Malls and, yes, steak, along with other meats. In this retro room, prime beef makes as much sense as Mr. Capon's swell nods to old-school Italian-American classics, like shrimp scampi, woozy with garlic and butter, or broiled oysters under slightly scorched bread crumbs, New Orleans style. His zucchini carpaccio dotted with creamed feta, chopped pistachios and fresh mint is very good now; it will be excellent when squash is in season. He also makes a terrine of chicken livers and foie gras, smooth in all the right ways and served with onion jam and toasted brioche. This is true luxury, not the mock luxury of a garden-variety deviled egg trying to pass itself off as a $25 appetizer by dressing up in caviar. Mr. Capon is not given to rash experiments. He knows where the pleasure centers are and how to tickle them. (So does his pastry chef, Katie McAllister. Her desserts are unabashedly sweet, sometimes to the point where you lose interest, although the s'mores sundae is uncannily precise, down to the ice cream that tastes exactly like a campfire marshmallow.) So his duck lasagna is not some bold invention but a gooey casserole in which the duck rag\u00f9 is essentially a seasoning and the bulk of the work is done by loads of melted caciocavallo. It is meant to serve two but could probably bring four people to a dead stop. And there is more. Much more. In the end, I barely put a dent in the menu, though it left its mark on me. Connoisseurs of ultratender burgers will go wild for Mr. Capon's hefty but loosely packed version on an extremely yielding bun. I like a burger that puts up more of a fight, but I loved the flavors of the melted raclette and caramelized onions. The most imposing of the meats is the veal chop, thick and quartz-pink. It's rubbed with paprika, coriander and fennel seeds for a whiff of the souk, but what gives it energy is the juice of a grilled orange half. That citrus-spice alchemy is a terrific solution to the boredom sometimes caused by plain broiled lumps of animal muscle. Another solution may be a smaller chop costing less than $52, but Bowery Meat Company understands that one of the jobs of any steakhouse, traditional or not, is to help carnivores spend lavishly. There is, as you'd expect, a proprietary cut of meat from the celebrity butcher Pat LaFrieda, the $54 \"Bowery steak.\" (Imagine the things \"Bowery steak\" might have been a euphemism for 20 years ago.) A mosaic of trimmed rib-eye cap, it's intensely flavorful, but I wish Mr. Capon would leave the garlic-heavy raw chopped herb sauce on the side. The 14-ounce New York strip is $55, is served naked except for some roasted shallots and has a fine dry-aged tang. It was missing only a rough, satisfying crust of the kind the kitchen put on the c\u00f4te de boeuf, a 38-ounce marvel of careful dry-aging and extensive marbling that costs $138. Demand for expensive beef rises with bull markets in stocks, and the current one just charged into its sixth year. The natural outcome of this is more steakhouses, but lately there have been complicating factors. Women don't take to the traditional steakhouse the way men have. Many people have ethical and environmental concerns about beef production. The most recent challenge is the rise of the small-plates culture, which has made portions of meat larger than, say, half a pound look a bit unseemly. This is why (he said, adopting a Viennese accent) the steakhouse has been acting so peculiar lately: It is trying to unite what's left of its core audience with the new herd of refugees from the small-plates revolution. Maybe Bowery Meat Company and places like it should just forget about defining themselves in relation to the steakhouse. Instead, they could come up with a new name for a place where you eat an appetizer followed by six or more ounces of meat, poultry or seafood. There used to be a word for this: restaurant.

Mr. Tower was the chef who gave Chez Panisse its first taste of national fame and even its early identity, before it began acting like Our Lady of the Holy Heirloom Squash. This, though, was in the 1970s. Now he is in his 70s, and was living in the Yucat\u00e1n with scuba gear and a few suitcases' worth of possessions when he heard that an oversize and heavily leveraged restaurant in Central Park had just lost its chef. He tracked down the owners and insisted that he was the man for the job. He started in November. By all accounts, Mr. Tower always had a gift for making dinner into a celebration. That is a useful talent at Tavern on the Green, where many people go for many different reasons but where everyone has some vague expectation that it ought to be fun. And maybe it will be, you think as you cut between fox-trotting couples on a makeshift dance floor in the bar, where a singer with platinum hair and an emerald-green dress is going all out on \"All of Me.\" Another hopeful sign: Mr. Tower's menus are more lighthearted and eager to please than the ones the chef Katy Sparks wrote during her short stay. The story and scenery are so perfect that somebody really should make a movie out of it. By the time financing comes through, maybe Mr. Tower will have delivered the dramatic turnaround the plot requires. But right now, the fun stops when the food arrives. \"New Orleans rock shrimp and crab meat soup with shrimp toasts\" sounds like a party on the bayou, doesn't it? It was like a mix-up in a Chinese takeout order. The grayish-gold broth looked and tasted like won ton soup fortified with a few drops of iodine. The long shrimp toast laid over the surface became a soggy mush. A Lincoln Log stack of crisp young romaine hearts got the Caesar salad off to a fine, fresh start. But the dressing was the indistinct creamy kind enjoyed by people who don't like the taste of anchovy, or garlic, or lemon. The braised short rib was dry, the filet mignon was tough, and the pork shoulder, rolled round a mix of mozzarella, pesto and prosciutto, was nearly raw inside. Dessert brought a passion fruit cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e that was almost everything you could ask. I say \"almost\" only because it did not happen to taste like passion fruit. The dining room staff, meanwhile, hasn't lost its ability to surprise with new forms of amateurism. While delivering one appetizer, a server tried a slightly too fancy pivot. The plate tilted. A stack of toast went sliding off the table. Watching this unravel, the server swore in a stage whisper. The word, describing a substance that was probably ankle-deep when Tavern on the Green was a fold for sheep, is not one that tends to appear in this newspaper. Still, it succinctly summed up my feelings as I realized, once again, that this movie was not going to end the way I had hoped.

They'd been retrofitted with light bulbs to make a functional if terrifying chandelier, but what was their original purpose? Several possibilities suggested themselves, from medieval torture device to a particularly inhumane way of catching fish. \"You'll have to ask Jody,\" a server said after admitting that she didn't really know what the thing was either. \"Every day, she brings in something else that she's just found. She'll say, \u2018Don't think about it, but that olive bowl is 200 years old.' \" Jody is the chef Jody Williams. She shares responsibility for Via Carota's Italian menu with the chef Rita Sodi, her partner in both business and domestic matters. When it comes, however, to buying antique nail barrels, china hutches, silver teapots, seltzer siphons, porcelain creamers, glazed cheese crocks, woven wood baskets, woven metal baskets and other stuff to fill a restaurant, Ms. Williams does it all by herself. Her eye for dressing a room is well known by the many people who swear by Ms. Williams's other restaurant, Buvette , a hop and a skip to the west on Grove Street. Buvette is filled with antiques and flea-market triumphs, starting with the black Raleigh bicycle left unchained on the sidewalk, as if the owner had just popped in for a croque-monsieur on the way to buy an armful of leeks. Buvette is French, and its premise seems to be that everything about France and the French is deeply adorable. The tables, the plates, even the silverware are about two sizes smaller than normal. Many people, some of whom live in Paris, where a second Buvette is a big hit, find all this irresistible. But it always makes me feel as if I'm on the set of a Wes Anderson film wearing a large trash bag while everybody else is dressed in vintage Boy Scout uniforms. Fortunately, while Via Carota has been energetically propped, it avoids the preciousness of Buvette. There is an ambient cuteness level, to be sure, but it is balanced by an Italian severity; the spiky iron chandelier (made by the sculptor Warren Muller from a clam rake) hanging over the charming cocktail coupes. The beechwood chairs with built-in pockets for books, for instance, came from a chapel in Wales. They make you sit up straight. Best of all, Ms. Williams and Ms. Sodi are cooking deeply appealing food, without mugging. Ms. Sodi is a stickler about classic Italian pasta, which forms the foundation of her own small restaurant nearby, I Sodi . You can tell she is a stickler because her pastas taste the way they are supposed to taste, the sauces not too complicated or heavily applied, the noodles not too tight and not too flabby. I might have liked a little more wildness in the wild-boar rag\u00f9 over pappardelle, but I could not have asked for a more rounded, balanced, mellow rag\u00f9 or more supple noodles. And while pasta with black truffles may not sound modest, there was nothing ostentatious about the irregular patches of pasta called stracci (it means \"rags\") turned with melted butter, Parmigiano-Reggiano and truffle shavings; it seemed, in fact, like the only sensible thing to do with a truffle. Apart from calling it a svizzerina and topping it with rosemary and whole garlic cloves, they make no attempt to prettify the chopped New York strip steak. Molded into a puck and seared on cast iron, it is both simple and amazing. Those of us who believe that the best burgers are chopped with knives, as this one is, will especially love the way the svizzerina feels in the mouth, substantial and even slightly luxurious, a quality that steak loses the minute it goes through a meat grinder. Like most of the meat and fish dishes, the bunless, French-fry-less svizzerina stands more or less alone, Italian style. Under the very simple and very good rabbit, patiently pan-fried, you will get a slice of fried bread to take care of any oil. If you like the taste of rabbit, this is the dish for you. A stub of grilled octopus leg gets a mound of green-olive relish. If all this pasta and protein sends you looking for vegetables, you will find yourself in one of Via Carota's strongholds. There are vegetables of all shapes and sizes, and with them the chefs give up a bit of their severity and start to play. Twiglike salsify roots were caramelized in brown butter, almost candied, and wonderful. A fennel bulb, cooked until tender, was dressed in orange pulp and orange zest. Shafts of leeks, poached and served cool, were topped with shavings of cured mullet roe and grated hard-cooked eggs; suddenly, I did not want to see leeks served any other way. Only with the grilled radicchio did they go over the top, piling on sweetness with currants and balsamic vinegar, then enriching everything with soft caprino cheese. But that kind of excess is just what Via Carota typically and gracefully avoids. Creamy stracchino cheese may seem too rich to stand in for fresh mozzarella on crostini with cherry tomatoes, especially tomatoes that have been sun-dried to a raisin-like sweetness. As things turn out, it's phenomenal. So is the mash of walnuts, honey and lardo that the chefs spread on another crostino, one that would be just as good at breakfast or dessert, or with cheese or yogurt. It would probably be good sold from a vending machine at the Port Authority. But then you would miss the short and no-nonsense list of drinks made from as few ingredients as possible (Italian-style, again). Or the much longer but still no-nonsense wine list, which covers a lot of ground without letting the prices get too out of hand. (Do keep an eye on the bottom line, though. It's surprisingly easy to reach $100 a person if you decide to taste something from each category on the menu.) Or the very tender crostata with a thin, sticky layer of raspberry jam. Most of all, you'd miss the chance to see the West Village take to this restaurant as if it had been around as long as one of Ms. Williams's olive bowls.

Semilla had taken two cabbage leaves, then flattened and dried them until they were as crisp as a cracker. This was the bread. In between were a bundle of unusually delicious coleslaw and some grains of buckwheat groats. It wasn't the most securely buckled-down sandwich I've ever eaten; some of the buckwheat fell out on the horseshoe-shaped counter around which Semilla's 18 seats are arranged. But I liked the way the buckwheat that stayed in the sandwich cracked between my teeth like Grape-Nuts. The flavors woke up old memories of the Polish and Ukrainian restaurants that are mostly gone from the East Village. And it was undeniably cool to have cabbage-leaf \"bread\" arrive at my place without warning. Diners at Semilla don't see a list of the 10 or so courses for which they are being charged $75 until the next day, when an email arrives from the restaurant. The sandwich struck me as a dish that might not last long on an \u00e0 la carte menu. How many New Yorkers would choose to spend their dinner money on pressed cabbage when they could have broiled oysters or beef ribs or kale salad? By cordoning it off within a meal that has to be taken as a package deal, Semilla had sheltered the cabbage sandwich from the roughshod forces of the marketplace, the way the government might protect nests built by the gentle piping plover by banning four-wheel drive vehicles from the beach. The market's relentless pressures to turn tables, to goose the check and so on are clear to anyone who goes out to eat in New York. It's less obvious how those pressures may influence menus until we stop to ask why so many are virtually identical, with the same salads and the same cuts of the same animals. If not for minor variations in sauces and side dishes, we'd all fall asleep after our first cocktail. Semilla's chef, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez-Ruiz, and its pastry chef, Pamela Yung, are using the nature-preserve possibilities of the tasting menu so their customers can taste dishes that weren't concocted to please the marketplace. This is a familiar concept in music, film and art. It has come to New York dining only recently as multicourse, limited-choice menus have spread from the empyrean realms of Per Se and Atera to more affordable, less formal precincts like Contra and Semilla. Understand, as you enter this nature preserve, that you will be browsing extensively upon stems, tubers, rhizomes, seeds and other plant parts. Semilla tends to save fish and meat for moments when extra depth or intensity are needed. For instance, a paste of salt cod that covered the bottom of a plate in a thin layer, like gesso on raw canvas, acted like a dip for charred cups of cipollini onion and circles of rutabaga. It's a dish that draws you in, as much for the rutabaga, which showed off its little-known talent for tasting like three or four vegetables at once, as for the salt cod, distilled to a potent cream so good I ran my fork around the plate twice to make sure I hadn't left any. At Semilla (Spanish for seed), the term for this style of cooking is \"vegetable forward.\" This both warns vegetarians and vegans that they will need to ask in advance for substitutions, and reassures those for whom the term vegetarian cooking still evokes tie-dyed flashbacks of carrot-lentil loaf. Mr. Ram\u00edrez-Ruiz, the chief vegetable manipulator, owes almost nothing to that branch of the vegetarian family tree. It's easier to see the imprint of Per Se, the Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare and Isa , all former employers, in the way he elegantly props one flavor against the next. He makes a frothy soup of beer and grilled celery root, then pours it over \"noodles\" shaved from a celery root; whipped Cheddar adds tang as it melts into the soup, and puffed quinoa gives it a breakfast-cereal snap, crackle and pop. Ms. Yung, another Isa veteran, who has been teaching sugar and flour new tricks since her days behind the counter at Room 4 Dessert , contributes two sweet courses at the meal's end. (An inspired one brought black-truffle ice cream together with an electrifyingly tart Seville orange sauce.) She is also responsible for the hot sourdough bread that shows up at about halftime and often incorporates whole grains, such as farro and einkorn, that she grinds in a countertop mill stored on a shelf above the kitchen pass. (Most of the kitchen is visible from the seats and the rest can be seen through one-way glass slots in the restroom wall. At least, I think it's one-way glass.) One night she had filled out the dough with cooked oatmeal, and the bread was pleasantly sticky under its thick crust. On all nights the bread arrives with a swirl of creamy butter and a trickle of buttermilk. There are aspects of Semilla over which reasonable people can disagree, but Ms. Yung's bread isn't one of them. I could argue, though, that the $75 price will keep out some of the young, creative-underclass types who may appreciate what the chefs are up to. I'd also say that Semilla's servers should stop assuming that everybody has been initiated into the cult of natural wines; a guest of mine found the two samples she was poured too eccentric, and decided to drink nothing -- a lost opportunity on each side of the bar. Inevitably, I wished a few dishes at Semilla had been swatted to the floor by the market's invisible hand. One was a plate that I've come to call \"too much cabbage with too many soybeans.\" Another was an ice cream Ms. Yung made out of colza oil. Colza oil is a close cousin of canola oil; frozen, it tastes like cold lubricant. There is risk in this kind of cooking. There is reward, too, and the chance to find out how good a rutabaga spring roll can be when you dip it in bittersweet orange juice reduction. Whenever I glanced at the other people huddled around the ash countertop, I saw far more appreciative nods than puzzled grimaces. The crowd reminded me of the audiences, small but intense, who showed up to hear underground bands in the '80s and '90s, when that was one of the few ways to hear music that didn't get played on the radio.

Before I could answer, he handed me a spicy tuna roll that would casually knock over my ideas about spicy tuna rolls, and spice, and tuna. Pickled red Thai chiles sat on top of the roll, chopped to bits and ready for action. The tuna underneath was soft sinew cut from the belly of a bluefin. It was grilled until the fat ran, until it soaked through the rice in its crisp nori wrapper and dripped out the bottom of the roll and into my palm. \"Actually, it's not too spicy,\" Mr. Lau said. Ten seconds later, Mr. Kim leaned over and said almost the same thing: \"Actually, it's not that spicy.\" Actually, gentlemen, it was really pretty spicy. In run-of-the-mill sushi bars, the spicy tuna roll is a cheap firecracker of questionable provenance. Nobody who has had Shuko's version, though, is going to forget it. The heat comes in gusts that keep getting stronger until you can't do anything but hold on. The chiles scour your tongue, cauterizing it. The melting oils from the tuna belly blanket your entire mouth, trying to restore the peace. The two sides, almost evenly matched, fight for control, and you are the battlefield. Mr. Lau and Mr. Kim were last seen sharpening their knives at Neta , a few blocks away. It was their first perch after leaving the truffled nest of Masa Takayama , who put Mr. Lau in charge of the kitchens at Bar Masa in New York and Las Vegas and made Mr. Kim head chef of Masa itself . Neta, though excellent, had a well-defined comfort zone right from the start. Compared with Shuko it looks like a restaurant on training wheels. Meanwhile, Mr. Takayama's operations, particularly now that the overpriced and underperforming Kappo Masa has been added to the fold, have begun to look like assembly lines where golden hooks are baited with two- and three-figure delicacies to dangle before whales. (Would you like the truffle maki roll topped with caviar or the caviar roll topped with truffles?) Those and other guaranteed bell-ringers do put in appearances at Shuko. Fat-streaked tuna belly, prone on a bed of rice, was one in a long volley of sushi pieces chosen by the chefs, at a cost of $135. Toro appeared again in the $175 kaiseki meal, a string of mesmerizing little plates followed by a shorter sushi recital. This time it took the shape of a homage to Mr. Takayama, a pure and tightly chilled tartare under a green-gray hump of Osetra caviar. During the five minutes or so it took to smear this on toasted milk bread and eat it, no force on earth could have stopped me short of hot lava flowing under the front door, and even then I would have made a guess at its speed before deciding to get up from the counter. What's impressive about Shuko, though, is how many times the chefs ring the bells without resorting to clich\u00e9d indulgences. One of the most memorable pieces of nigiri in my sushi omakase was an intense, livery, chewy bite of squab cartilage with sansho pepper. Another was a slab of Mediterranean dorade so rich and fatty it reminded me of shrimp. Another was simply a grilled shiitake cap folded around a pinch of warm rice. On the kaiseki menu another night, finely shredded Japanese mountain yam, burdock and carrot had been flattened with slivers of scallop beard to make a crisp, airy, hand-held latke. Toward the middle of both meals, a chef began to lay down pickle slices, silently, one after another, like a blackjack dealer. Shuko had piled these carrots, radishes and so forth into wood barrels to ferment when they were still in season, not just to save their flavor but to expand it. New York State produce preserved by traditional Japanese methods makes a fine emblem for Shuko's blending of cultures. Another may be the facade on East 12th Street, where the windowless wall is finished with sand and particles of hay, and the door is marked only by a handful of dried flowers tied with a string. It could be an ancient house in Tokyo, if not for the classic New York cast-iron column running right down the middle. Open the door and you enter what could be downtown's latest version of cocktail hide-outs like Angel's Share or Milk & Honey. And in fact, once you sit down at the long and carefully buffed ash bar, a bartender in a beard and necktie will offer to stir up a drink for you. This is an offer worth accepting. Another server, in ripped bluejeans, pours house-made sparkling water. The music is very slightly louder than in most sushi bars and spans the decades from Debbie Harry to Sky Ferreira. Ice Cube is having a good day, but Lorde is over getting told to throw her hands up in the air. Some purists may feel that all this desecrates the temple of sushi. They can go eat in a temple. Mr. Lau and Mr. Kim, both young and fluent in several cultures at once, have taken all the preciousness out of omakase and kaiseki dining and replaced it with a relaxed, sophisticated cool. They were already moving in this direction at Neta, but with Shuko they've arrived. Everybody seems to feel comfortable here. (Some feel a little too comfortable; one night, a couple who seemed to have been married for several centuries carried on a long and inscrutable argument, while a young tycoon at the opposite end of the bar rattled off his company's revenue figures for the last five years.) Both menus offer an in-depth look at how good these two chefs are at bringing out flavors without appearing to be doing much to them. My sushi omakase, but not my kaiseki meals, included a flight of sea urchin, starting with pale, creamy blobs from Santa Barbara, Calif., then moving to Monterey, where the lobes were more compact and had a cleaner sweetness, and ending with uni topped with a lacy swirl of shirako tempura, the hot and buttery seminal fluid of a cod. The kaiseki doesn't delve as intimately into marine biology, but in recompense it offers a slightly wider variety of surprises. One of them is an ending too good to give away, a dessert that is so unluxurious and un-Japanese and wonderful that the chefs seem to be smiling to themselves every time it's served.

The December wind off the harbor that was shaking the little brick buildings in Red Hook, Brooklyn, was keeping everybody at home, ordering pad see ew and massaman curry from the new neighborhood Thai place. This turned out to be lucky for me. Five minutes later, I was facing down a platter of shrimp with skinny dried chiles over torn lobes of sweet pomelo that had a flaky coating of toasted coconut and crushed peanuts. Soon after that came a big bowl of rice noodles, shrimp and round Asian eggplants in a mild green curry that seemed to get more and more appealing. This arrived with a separate plate of dried anchovies, boiled eggs with almost-solid yolks and a fresh red chile sauce that had definite intent to harm. Then the kao soy turned up, the dish I'd come to try. This is a pale-yellow coconut milk curry from Chiang Mai with submerged noodles and a chicken leg, and, above the surface, fried egg noodles going off in all directions with strands of green-papaya fritters. There was another condiment plate for the kao soy, of course. I was eating all of this as fast as I could, and as the overall deliciousness began to sink in I started eating even faster. It wasn't fast enough, though, and soon the plates covered every inch of available surface area and I needed to slide an empty table next to mine. In fact, I ran out of space every time I went to Kao Soy. Some blame must be given to the plates, which are vast white things with rims almost as wide as the sidewalks on Park Avenue . Some goes to Thailand, where a meal may start with half a dozen salads and sticky rice, and where even the condiments seem to have condiments. Some goes to the tables, which are not built for this kind of thing. Most, though, goes to Kao Soy's menu for inducing me to order too much (except that it was never too much) by offering Thai dishes I rarely see around town, including a few from northern Thailand. Those of us who prowl restaurants whose owners come from countries known for delicious food harbor an irrational belief that one day, if we play it right, we may get the Other Menu. This is the one the owners save for their family and friends. It's the one that lists all the foods they loved back home. It's filled with the dishes everybody says Americans won't like. Nobody I know has ever seen one of these documents. That hasn't stopped me from raising my eyebrows and dropping key foreign phrases in the hopes that a server will say: \"Oh, you want the Other Menu? Just a moment, sir.\" At Kao Soy, the Other Menu is printed on the same green page that lists the dishes you know from your local Thai spot: the fried rice, the pad thai, the curry with choice of chicken, beef, pork or shrimp. Those items fill the shopping bags that go out the door every few minutes. They help keep the business floating. But the mission of Kao Soy is to sell New Yorkers on what Sirichai Sreparplarn, one of the restaurant's two chefs, calls \"the real food from the north.\" Several New York neighborhoods have been wrapped in the fiery clutch of Thailand's northeastern region, Isan. Dishes from the north, though, have been found almost exclusively in one place, Pok Pok Ny , just outside Red Hook. This puts two northern Thai kitchens less than a mile apart in a borough that is home to only about 12 percent of the city's Thai population and virtually no other Thai restaurants worth knowing about. Kao Soy was opened last summer by Kanlaya Supachana, who has worked in several Thai restaurants around Brooklyn, answering phones and such. She and her co-chef, Mr. Sreparplarn, close friends for many years, had what he calls \"the same passion for serving real flavor to New Yorkers,\" but they failed to persuade any existing Thai restaurants to share their vision. Finally a local contractor, Carlos Padillo, agreed to sign on as Ms. Supachana's business partner, and they took over a tiny space, filled it with a few tables, a tiny bar and an electric fireplace. The northern Thai dishes are scattered around the menu. Most obvious is the excellent kao soy, made in the style of Ms. Supachana's father back in Chiang Mai. Beneath the heading Snack & Salad is a dish called nam prik ong. This is a platter of steamed cauliflower, long beans, strips of fried pork rinds curled like Fritos and long surfboards of romaine lettuce, all meant as garnishes for a dip that's something like a spicy, slightly sweet pork rag\u00f9 that went for a swim in the ocean. Or maybe the dip is the garnish; it was gone before I'd decided. A related dish, sai oua, is filed under Various. The dip here has been pounded from garlic, onions and fresh green chiles, hot ones. For dipping, you get steamed young mustard greens, cucumbers, freshly fried pork (not rinds but meat this time, and marinated in soy), along with a house-made pork sausage, the sai oua itself. Deeply perfumed with makrut lime leaves, coriander roots and lemongrass stalks, this sausage makes a more complete single-bite introduction to Thai flavors than any plate of pad thai. For the time being, we reach the end of the northern Thai menu with the banana blossom fritter and the kang hung le, a warmly spiced peanut curry cooked with pork belly and beef. A fried drumstick comes on the side, and you are meant to pull off some dark meat, pinch it with sticky rice and then scoop up some of the curry. I didn't understand it, but I loved it anyway. But we have not reached the end of the Other Menu, because there are other less-familiar dishes under the Snack & Salad or Various headings. Few are dull, and some are very good, like the shredded mango salad with cashews and two kinds of dried fish, no longer than a toothpick. Kao Soy isn't quite finished yet, Ms. Supachana will say. (When it is, I hope she gets her hands on more of the fresh herbs that add minty, bitter and even fishy notes to many of the salads at Pok Pok Ny; without them, some of Kao Soy's cold dishes seem to stop short.) There are big plans for the little bar, including a full stash of liquor. Two weeks ago, the liquor license arrived, and already Kao Soy has some interesting ideas about what to drink with Thai food, like Farnum Hill cider from New Hampshire, a Belgian-style saison ale from Allagash in Maine, or a red grenache from Donkey & Goat in California. They're going to need bigger tables.

The rest of us had a hard time keeping track of her various proficiencies, and one time we asked her to remind us whether she knew Chinese. \"Oh, I would love to learn Chinese,\" she said. \"But I just don't have eight weeks to spare.\" Too bad she isn't a chef. Very few have eight weeks to spare these days, but that doesn't stop them when, in pursuit of empire building, they decide to learn some other nation's food. By the time the news releases are ready, a week's vacation has become a research trip, and a snack bought with pocket change has become a $13 appetizer. Mexico is a favorite destination for these immersion courses. This has led to the illusion that New York is enjoying a boom in serious Mexican cuisine, when in fact what the city is experiencing is a handful of restaurants that present, some more convincingly than others, a chef's south-of-the-border fantasies. Before he opened Cosme on East 21st Street in October, the chef Enrique Olvera reversed the process. He already had a pretty good handle on the cuisine of Mexico, having grown up and now owning a flock of restaurants there, including the globally acclaimed Pujol. Mr. Olvera's research trips were to Manhattan instead. He studied its dining rooms, its menus, its cocktails and its customers. He was clearly taking notes, because he shows an uncannily state-of-the-art instinct for what New Yorkers want when they go out for dinner. Cosme is cool, but isn't trend-chasing. It's crowded and lively, but isn't painfully loud. It's comfortable, but isn't coddling. Most of all, the cooking is a thrill, largely because it sails right over ideas like tradition, authenticity and modernity. Many underpinnings come from Mexico, while a lot of the ingredients were bought locally. The flavors are here and now, though; you connect with the dishes right away. In the style of places like Estela, many seafood and vegetable dishes turn out to be salads, or something like a salad, approachable, simple-seeming assemblages with a jolt of the unexpected. White ayocote beans, which look like cannellinis and are as creamy as any bean I've tasted, are surrounded by mixed greens and sliced radishes, all looking innocent enough; it's the habaneros and charred cucumbers in the dressing that get you. The raw hamachi dabbed with lime and jalape\u00f1o sounds like another crudo variation, but the jalape\u00f1os are fermented and the limes dried until they turn black; together their flavor is so intense it could walk through bricks. Scallops and poached jicama, cut into white discs that you can't tell apart until you bite down, are dressed with lime juice and cucumber; it seems like a traditional aguachile, but the sneaky, sideways heat comes from grated wasabi. Mr. Olvera doesn't use heat and spice as weapons; he uses them like a pen, to sharpen and define the outlines of a dish. Dried ground chiles provide some backbone to a sweet pineapple pur\u00e9e served with firm, flavorful cobia and warm tortillas, for making an exhilarating seafood version of tacos al pastor. Whenever a stack of fresh tortillas arrived, I would pull one from its folded napkin, hold it up to my face and inhale. It was a motion I hadn't made since grade school, when I would bring the purple-smudged handouts still warm from the Ditto copier up to my nose to breathe in their sweet, forbidden, chemical smell, like rubbing alcohol mixed with danger. The aroma of these tortillas was completely wholesome -- like flowers, bread straight from the oven, and a baby's cheek at the same time -- but I still wanted to fall headfirst into it the way I did with Ditto solvent. There are no tortillas remotely like this in New York. Cosme makes them downstairs in the kitchen from old strains of blue, yellow, purple and white corn grown in Mexico. The tortillas are one of the few reminders around if you forget for a moment that Cosme is a Mexican restaurant. Many of the kitchen's innovations probably shouldn't be copied, because they depend on Mr. Olvera's deep knowledge of Mexican food together with his understanding of what's being cooked in Copenhagen, Chicago and Lima. But one idea that I hope other Mexican restaurateurs steal is the decision to go without all the props (sombreros, grinning calaveras) that say, \"Hola, amigos, have a margarita!\" The furthest Cosme goes in that direction are the small potted succulents on every table. Yana Volfson, Cosme's drinks mastermind, reacted as if we'd stepped on her foot when we asked if mezcal (she has quite a collection) would be poured into rustic clay cups; no, she said, it goes into clear, modern glasses. The dining room hangs in a pool of darkness, where black ceilings and walls recede while shafts of light beam down onto the tops of the tables. You see what you're eating and whom you're eating it with; that's about it. The menu is not built around familiar Mexican signposts like enchiladas, either; it's just a long list of dishes, all of roughly the same size, running down the left side of the page. In the lower right corner, by itself, is guacamole. It's the one landmark every customer is sure to recognize, and it is literally marginalized. Mr. Olvera might as well train the servers to roll their eyes like April Ludgate if anyone orders it. The menu, in fact, isn't a lot of help when it comes to suggesting how to put together a meal. Servers will suggest sharing about three dishes for each person at the table. Follow this advice, and you will not go hungry; unlike many chefs, Mr. Olvera takes the trouble to plate food so that it divides easily. But you will pay for the experience. Cosme is an expensive restaurant, where dinner for two with dessert and wine can easily creep beyond $300. A few dishes leave you wondering momentarily if it's worth it, like the stodgy, compacted eggplant-lard tamal. And while there is an absolute classic on Jes\u00fas Per\u00e9a's dessert menu, the cracked meringue made with burned and pulverized corn husks and filled with corn mousse, the rest of them tend toward a blandly pleasant sweetness. There aren't many problems like that, though. More often you get something like the fried pork skin, as big and brown and open as a catcher's mitt, covered with sliced radishes and avocados. It doesn't sound like much, but it's sensational. So are the duck carnitas, slowly braised in the meat's own fat with orange and Coca-Cola (the Mexican one, no corn syrup). Or the lobster paired, boldly and unerringly, with fresh chorizo and refried black beans. Almost everything you taste at Cosme seems new without being forced or mannered. It isn't the kind of Mexican cooking that can be learned on a vacation. It has to be lived, and for that there are no shortcuts.

Regular spikes would indicate the orderly arrival of restaurants, with just a few aberrant tremors here and there: the closure of Tabla and, very rarely, a change of chef. But since the summer of 2013, one quake after another has jolted the needle. The chef of the Dining Room and the Bar Room at the Modern stepped down. Then the same thing happened at the two Blue Smoke locations. Then North End Grill. One at a time, replacements were named. Recently came word that when Untitled moves downtown with the Whitney Museum of American Art, it will get a new chef, too. This cluster of seismic activity could be a coincidence. Or it could mean that pressure was building for a while; suddenly, the tectonic plates moved. What is clear is that a company with a healthy respect for loyalty and stability has taken advantage of the turnover. The new chefs are far from cautious caretakers; they've moved decisively to refresh menus that, in some cases, had begun to stagnate. Today I'll take on Blue Smoke and North End Grill; the Modern is a complicated case of two restaurants, each holding three stars from The New York Times, and is best saved for another time. Even fans of Blue Smoke would not have described it, before Jean-Paul Bourgeois took over the kitchen last March, as a beacon of innovation. From its birth in 2002 on East 27th Street through the opening of a Battery Park City location 10 years later, Blue Smoke tried to replicate every major American barbecue style. This guaranteed that its meat would be compared to Texas brisket, Carolina pulled pork and St. Louis ribs, and also guaranteed that the verdict would not favor Blue Smoke. Mr. Bourgeois has tried to extract himself from that trap by dropping the regional aspirations from the menu, which now offers \"seven-pepper rubbed beef brisket\" and so on. It's a start, but today Blue Smoke also faces competition from local pitmasters who produce great barbecue more consistently than it does. At their best, Blue Smoke's pulled pork can run a close second to the one at Mighty Quinn's Barbeque, and the brisket isn't far off the one at Hometown Bar-B-Que, which has gotten better and better. On off days, you may get a pulp of gray, lifeless, smokeless pork or a tough, stringy sparerib. But while Blue Smoke's barbecue lags, as ever, a few paces behind the front-runners, when it comes to contemporary Southern cooking in New York Mr. Bourgeois's menu is at the head of the pack. An appetizer called the Preservation Plate recently gave a survey of his range. He had used the smoker to turn a duck breast into very fine ham. His kitchen had put up pickles in the warm weather, string beans and red grapes tasting of cloves. He'd made a blackberry and root beer mustard to go with chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 on toast, and tender, juicy pickled shrimp. This is a platter that summons thoughts of Frank Stitt or Hugh Acheson. Mr. Bourgeois is a native of Thibodaux, La., and some of his best dishes have been yanked, still wriggling, right out of the bayou. You know he means to do things the right way when you see the soft French bread that comes with oysters roasted in smoked garlic butter under crackling bread crumbs. His seafood boil is outstanding, every ingredient cooked the way it should be: the little potatoes, the crisp baby carrots, the fat, wonderful gulf shrimp and a head of boiled garlic that is delicious spread on Saltines. The comeback sauce goes with all of it, just as the chunky and aromatic tomato sauce goes with the very fresh pan-seared red snapper, gulf shrimp and crab meat to make a Cajun court bouillon, or coo-bee-yon. Over two visits at each location, it became clear that missteps can occur at either, although the worst service I've ever had at one of Mr. Meyer's restaurants took place in the Flatiron branch. My table repeatedly seemed to disappear for 20 minutes at a time. After one long absence, our server seemed to think we should have been finishing our desserts. \"How are your ...\" he began. \"Oh, you still have your menus.\" Blue Smoke's desserts themselves seemed to have dropped behind a fog of oblivion until very recently. Two months ago, banana cream pie had lost its custard or pastry cream, so scraps of brown banana sat naked on a pie shell; the kitchen tried in vain to hide them under whipped cream. Late last year the pastry chef Emily Isaac rode in to the rescue, and while she is only beginning to introduce her own desserts, the recipes she inherited are already greatly improved. It's less clear that North End Grill needed a course correction. I gave the restaurant two stars in 2012, but even then I thought Floyd Cardoz's menu was hard to pin down: It had an egg section, but also lots of fish, and meat cooked on the wood grill seemed to be important, too. Eric Korsh, who started last spring, has a more unified approach, one tilting toward France. The level of cooking may not be different now, but Mr. Korsh hits more high notes, and hits them more often. His charcuterie is worth a visit all by itself, whether for the slippery, salty and gelatinous torchon of trotters or the thin slices of lightly pickled beef tongue with gribiche sauce, tangy and smooth. And he served a loup de mer the way I'd like to see it done at La Grenouille, with a terrific lobster sauce, a tangle of simple spinach and a huge glittering knob of caviar. I loved the way Mr. Korsh had seared and deeply scored the skin side of a raw Spanish mackerel, leaving intact the rest of the slab; to lighten the oily fish he had brought together pink grapefruit, hot chiles, cucumber and radishes. I admired how precisely each piece of seafood in his bouillabaisse was cooked, although I thought the broth tasted a little too much like clams. And he seems to get the most out of the wood grill. Smoke and char bring a primeval thrill to a splayed-open, nearly rare squab; now that I think about it again, my pulse is racing. And the Berkshire pork, said to serve two but enough to subdue at least four, is a piece of meat for the ages; it could do for the pork chop what Peter Luger did for the porterhouse. Desserts, now by Tracy Obolsky, still weave sophisticated threads into classics, like chocolate cake with crunchy malt or the tribute, in ice cream, to the Almond Joy. Try it, even if you think the original can't be improved. Change is good.

At tableside trolleys inside the many dining rooms, bananas still go up in flames every few minutes. The stucco facade on Royal Street in the French Quarter is still pink, although the paint manufacturer prefers to call it Tomato Cream Sauce. (The trim color is Mayonnaise.) At a glance, Brennan's seems to be rolling along just as it has since it was founded in 1946. Over the last two years, though, the restaurant has been the subject of a foreclosure, a bankruptcy and a visit by the New Orleans Police Department, called in to pacify a shareholders meeting. Brennans inveighed against Brennans. Brennans sued Brennans. The restaurant was sold off in pieces: the building for $6.85 million, the name and other accouterments for $3 million . An estimated $20 million more was poured into fixing up the 18th-century structure and building new kitchens and dining rooms. When the pieces were put back together, Brennan's was in the hands of a new Brennan from another branch of the family, Ralph Brennan, and the kitchen was turned over to a new chef, Slade Rushing. Since reopening the restaurant in November , the two have tried to keep many Brennan's traditions alive. At the same time, they live in the modern world. Mr. Rushing spent the last seven years as chef of MiLa here, and Mr. Brennan runs six other restaurants. They agree that Brennan's won't survive if they can't give it two things it hasn't had in recent years: a reputation for good food, and the local following that goes with it. It had both in the early days, when Owen Brennan started the business, and his sister Ella helped manage it. To stand out from its more established competitors, Brennan's began to specialize in breakfast. It did this by encouraging diners, starting as early as 8 a.m., to pack more courses, more sugar, more fat and more cocktails into the morning meal than most Americans consumed in an entire day. One might begin with a glass of brandy milk punch as an eye-opener and end with bananas Foster, finished with a huge shot of flaming rum. This was nominally dessert, although in New Orleans, the line between drinking and everything else is often a blurred one. \"If you haven't had breakfast at Brennan's, you haven't really been to New Orleans at all, you know, che?\" the novelist Peter S. Feibleman wrote in 1971, sliding into local dialect for his contribution to the Time-Life \"Foods of the World\" series, the volume on Louisiana. \"Well, go there, you hear? Go there.\" By that time, the Brennans, led by Ella, Dick and their siblings, were opening restaurants in other neighborhoods and cities, starting with Commander's Palace . There was dissent in the ranks, though, and in 1974 the various branches agreed to a family divorce. Owen's children kept Brennan's. The other Brennans would run everything else. Neither side would explain, but it was clear the split was traumatic. \"When the family broke up, it was a huge deal,\" said Emeril Lagasse, the chef of Commander's Palace from 1982 to 1989. \"My experience with Ella and Dick over eight years was that the love that they grew up with, they wanted to express that. For Saturday and Sunday brunch at Commander's Palace, there was a lot of feeling and dishes on the menu that were really memories of Ella being at Brennan's on Royal Street.\" Outsiders who hope to understand the importance of Brennan's to the family, and the importance of the family to New Orleans, should bear in mind that after Brennan's had changed hands and Ella Brennan returned to the building in November for her first visit in 40 years, The Times-Picayune sent a reporter to cover it. Until the name began to appear in headlines, the subject of Brennan's rarely came up for many locals except in connection with the prices. \"At one point, it started getting really outrageously expensive,\" Mr. Lagasse said. \"I heard that a lot from people at the end of the last regime: \u2018Wow, it's super-expensive for eggs.' \" My breakfast there at 8 on a recent Sunday morning seemed fairly priced for a meal that included, in the fitness-minded Brennan's style, some grilled shrimp followed by pan-fried veal grillades over grits and then dessert, interwoven with a cocktail or two. For the menu, Mr. Rushing had dug into the restaurant's archives: There were crepes with a bright satsuma sauce, and there were baked apples with sugary lids of pecans and oats, both suggested as appetizers; eggs Hussarde and eggs Sardou; a mixed-seafood gumbo thickened with fil\u00e9; and a generously sherried snapping-turtle soup that was almost the color of black beans. Our server had an impressive ability to read the table, talking slowly and quietly in the beginning and picking up the pace only once she had gotten two Bloody Marys and a French 75 into us. I've eaten a morning feast this substantial, served with this level of sympathy and formality, just once before; that was at Commander's Palace, and technically it was brunch, not breakfast. Creole stalwarts also anchored Brennan's dinner menu, but one page was given to something you won't find at Galatoire's or Antoine's : a five-course chef's tasting. \"Brennan's is known for breakfast, and you can't really mess around with breakfast,\" our server said, by way of explanation. \"So this is where the chef gets to play around a little bit.\" Without strapping myself in for the full tasting, I still managed to eat most of Mr. Rushing's playing-around dishes. Remaking New Orleans barbecue shrimp with a very un-New Orleans ingredient, lobster claw, seemed like a delicious joke. I was impressed, too, by how much flavor white soy, threads of tart fermented mustard greens and browned coins of fried Japanese eggplant brought to slabs of raw amberjack without overshadowing the fish. One of the best things I ate at Brennan's was a duck-confit-studded rutabaga cake, Mr. Rushing's version of a Chinese-Vietnamese pan-fried turnip cake. To his mind, cooking Creole cuisine means being alert to flavors that new immigrants are bringing to the city's gumbo pot. In these early innings, Mr. Rushing's menu sometimes seemed to stretch too far in its effort to straddle the old and the new, without really doing justice to either. A surprising number of dishes were undone by one small detail: The turtle soup needed more brightness; the fried rabbit seemed to have lost its crunch after leaving the oil; the pompano didn't take on much color or flavor from the griddle; the lemon-butter sauce was a bit too thin to cling to its crab meat. The ideas and flavors were sound, though, so they may all come together once Mr. Rushing has all the cooks he needs for his three kitchens, which can serve up to 350 people at once. (By contrast, Mr. Rushing first received notice when he was cooking in a 28-seat Manhattan restaurant called Jack's Luxury Oyster Bar .) No such problems surfaced among the sweets, although now that I've tasted bananas Foster in its natural environment, I have to agree with Ella Brennan, who recently called the dessert \"very ordinary\" despite having a hand in inventing it. Almost everything else containing sugar was beautiful and refined, from the simple Creole crepes to a somewhat abstract version of bread pudding that was mostly a rich vanilla custard made even richer by big shards of praline. A few dots of French bread seemed to have been scattered around solely for propriety's sake. The dessert won't fool bread-pudding traditionalists, but it should please them. At the very least, it should help bring bread pudding into the 21st century. The French Quarter has become something of a Jurassic Park for Creole cuisine, a contained area in which to see shrimp r\u00e9moulade, oysters Rockefeller and other giants of a former age in all their lumbering glory. At Arnaud's, Antoine's, Galatoire's and Tujague's , evolution stops at the kitchen door. \"That's what happens to our institutions,\" said Liz Williams, the president of the new Southern Food and Beverage Museum , in the Central City neighborhood. \"They are not allowed to change. You might go to Antoine's once a year, but you don't want the menu to be any different than it was a year ago.\" That dynamic, she said, abandons restaurants to the tourist trade, which leaves them vulnerable. Mr. Rushing believes that's how the old Brennan's slouched into bankruptcy. \"They got stuck in a rut and they took things for granted,\" he said. \"Restaurants die if they're not progressive. You've got to have some sort of push for innovation.\" Brennan's, 417 Royal Street, New Orleans; 504-525-9711; brennansneworleans.com ", "rec_dishes": 0}, {"id": 99, "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/dining/restaurant-review-upland-on-park-avenue-south.html", "review_text": " \"Go to Upland\" is my current answer to anybody who asks for a good new place to eat in Manhattan. It will probably remain my answer for some time. The recommendation is the same for fetishists who unwind by reconstructing recipes from the court of Catherine de Medici as for parishioners in the Church of St. Rachael. It holds for drinkers who are on the lookout for unexplored grapes and for those who call all white wine chardonnay. The only diners I would not send to Upland are the ones who categorically refuse to take any meals along Park Avenue South. Their loss. Upland's owner and impresario in chief, Stephen Starr , has opened jostling, thumping, nightclub-slash-restaurants such as Morimoto and Buddakan , as well as intimate stages for chefs like Serpico in Philadelphia. Upland occupies the middle ground, a big restaurant where the set dressing feels like an event but doesn't compete with the food. For the kitchen, Mr. Starr recruited Justin Smillie, whose intensely flavorful spins on Italian cuisine at Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria won him national notice. Upland's 88-seat dining room and vast menu would make some of his peers, serenely accustomed to arranging brassica specimens at tasting counters the size of egg cartons, collapse in a swoon. Lucky for us, Mr. Smillie is made of sturdier stuff. His menu splashes around in the gentle, sun-dappled river of classic California cuisine, with special attention to its junctions with the Jonathan Waxman and Jeremiah Tower tributaries. (Upland is the name of the town in San Bernardino County where Mr. Smillie was raised; Mr. Waxman was a mentor.) Mr. Smillie's pizzas, built on a tender crust with puffy lips, are freewheeling, like the very good one with pears, arugula and soft stracciatella cheese underscored by aged balsamic and a pesto that crunches with chopped pecans. His pastas can be tried and true, like the firm and well-peppered bucatini slick with tangy pecorino or the long, star-shaped tubes called estrella tossed with a just-right saut\u00e9 of chicken livers with rosemary and sage. Or they may surprise you, like the spicy spaghettini that get their potent oceanic flavor from invisible baby sardines. Either way, they're further confirmation that Mr. Smillie is one of the city's pasta savants. As he showed in his last kitchen, he's something of a vegetable sage, too. Celery root never struck me as a showstopper, exactly, until I tasted the one at Upland, slowly roasted into an intense and creamy globe and brushed with black truffle butter. Everybody at my table always wanted to try his deep-fried hen-of-the-woods mushroom, and everybody was always happy swiping it in herbed Cloumage, a charming cousin of ricotta brought down from southern Massachusetts. And a main course of Tasmanian sea trout was made memorable by its vegetable side, a section of sweet, ivory-colored cone cabbage permeated by smoke. The burrata purist at my table was dubious about the heaps of trout roe and frizz of fried leeks Mr. Smillie piled on top of the near-liquid cheese, but the rest of us spooned it up, wishing we had a toasted everything bagel to complete the picture. When it was gone, we weren't sure we would have the energy for the plate of duck wings, like confit with a bone handle. But the sparks of heat and citrus in the yuzu kosho vinaigrette on the skin kept us going until we began to think that Upland deserves a place in the annals of poultry wing cookery alongside the Anchor Bar in Buffalo . Among the main courses, the grilled branzino with a scallion-heavy salsa verde was solid if unsurprising. The pork chop, though, half-moons of sweet persimmon and hot red peppers on top, was a sensation. I thought about Mr. Smillie's gift for building flavor upon flavor as I chewed on the tiny squares of crackling that wrapped around the bone. His menu rambles a bit, and it's no surprise that not all of the 30 or so dishes glide with swanlike grace. Chilled and decidedly al dente farro spaghetti seemed like an odd choice for a cold sea urchin sauce, and the whole notion is unlikely to melt anyone's heart in the dead of winter. Wads of spicy grated radish smothered the sweetness of just-shucked raw scallops. And the short rib with walnuts and unruly curls of shaved celery that was roasted on a rotisserie at Il Buco Alimentari hasn't fully acclimated to being cooked in an oven on East 26th Street; there seems to be less of the deeply caramelized meat around the edges, and it's less satisfying to chew on, while the bite of the peppercorns is more bullying than I remember. And I wondered about the size of the dining room when two out of three pastas showed up lukewarm one night. After some early critical grumbling about the desserts, a new pastry chef from Thomas Keller's fleet, S\u00e9bastien Rouxel, was installed shortly before Christmas. I hope he sets the whisks and rolling pins in order quickly because I've yet to meet a dessert at Upland that I'd come back for, let alone one that suggests the easy rapport Mr. Smillie has with his ingredients. For now, there is more excitement to be had in slaloming around Chantelle Pabros's wine cellar. She has assembled one of the most accessible, least dogmatic lists in town, with dozens of bottles under $50, as if that were the way all wine lists worked. (It isn't, but it should be.) New Yorkers can challenge their parochial disdain for California wines with classics like Chateau Montelena and leaders of the modern style like Cathy Corison. Or they can dip into one of several affordable Bordeaux, so unfashionable, so delicious. There is more than a token sampling of reds from Portugal, and three Canadian Chardonnays, patiently waiting for America to notice. The interior is lined by shelf after shelf of preserved lemons in jars, each one illuminated by three tiny LEDs until they become something like citrus lamps. When their marmalade glow hits the copper trim around the dining room, it gives off a light warmer than anything I've seen in a restaurant before. The tables in the dining room are generously large, the seats the kind you want to stay in all night. Not so in the bar, where two of my guests, arriving early, were deposited on hard-backed wood benches near the after-work mob. When I appeared, there was a whispered conference by the coat room. \"I'm sorry,\" a host finally said to my guests, \"I forgot to ask if you'd like to sit in the dining room.\" If she forgets to ask you, too, tell her I said the dining room is the place to be.

Restaurants owned by the chef Masayoshi Takayama, who has spent his career charging more for Japanese food than anyone else in the United States: five. Restaurants the two men own together: one, Kappo Masa , in the basement below Mr. Gagosian's Madison Avenue gallery. The dining room, furnished with teak tables and seating upholstered in buttercup-yellow leather, wraps in an L shape around the large, well-populated kitchen. Mr. Takayama is known for sushi, but Kappo Masa presents a general overview of Japanese cuisine, so in addition to the raw-fish counter, there are stations for grilling, frying, simmering, steaming and assembling marinated seafood plates and cold salads. He runs the kitchen himself, but I failed to spot him. Now three months old, Kappo Masa is not the most expensive restaurant in New York. That distinction belongs to Mr. Takayama's home base, Masa , in the Time Warner Center. (Price of dinner for one before tax, tip and drinks: $450.) Still, it is expensive in a way that's hard to forget either during or after the meal. The cost of eating at Kappo Masa is so brutally, illogically, relentlessly high, and so out of proportion to any pleasure you may get, that large numbers start to seem like uninvited and poorly behaved guests at the table. Price of a maki roll of chopped fatty tuna wrapped in rice with caviar piled on each of the eight pieces: $240. I could never bring myself to order it, or two dishes filigreed with white truffles: the fried rice with mushrooms ($120) or the Ohmi beef tataki ($150). So I can't tell you how any of them taste, but I can tell you that by the time I spotted something for less than $80, it struck me as a steal. Amount I spent for 5.5 ounces of grilled steak raised in Australia: $78. The beef had a species of tenderness that I associate more with bluefin tuna than steak. It tasted something like teriyaki without the sugar. I liked it very much, but mostly I thought, \"Why $78?\" In fact, Mr. Takayama charges similar prices across town at Bar Masa . But the food and service allow Bar Masa to pass for an \u00e0 la carte version of Masa itself. Kappo Masa is nowhere near as good. The raw ingredients may well be the same, but they are often handled carelessly, seasoned indifferently and served inattentively. Price of bland, watery cauliflower florets with maitake mushrooms that were grilled over far too much heat so their insides were raw and woody while their exteriors was burned to a char that peeled off in blackened flakes: $28. Price of yellowtail collar left on the grill until it lost the silky, puddinglike richness that is the whole point of this cut: $28. Price of noodles extruded from ground shrimp, a gluten-free invention of Mr. Takayama's, sloshing around in a greasy pond of way too much melted butter and not enough of the serrano chiles that may have given the dish a little spark: $24. Price of four tiny, cold flour tortillas filled with roast duck, floppy matchsticks of uncrisp duck skin and batons of overcooked foie gras: $26. Every once in a while, something genuinely remarkable would arrive, as if from another kitchen. Cubes of superb raw tuna ($34), seasoned with soy, sake and minced wasabi, were served polar-vortex-cold on a chilled white ceramic drum designed by Mr. Takayama. Butterflied grilled octopus ($24), soft and a little smoky in its dressing of sesame oil and lime, was something like Japanese shrimp scampi, a terrific surprise. There was \"baby dancing shrimp,\" in a shattering, exquisite batter dusted with ground chiles ($26), and a sea urchin risotto with springy grains of rice, some very fresh chanterelles and almost enough urchin to silence any protests about the price ($48). If the whole meal were like this, Kappo Masa would be a fantastic splurge. It's not, though, and those prices start to seem like very expensive lottery tickets. They got into my head in other ways, too, warping my normal sense of value. Menu price for cress with wasabi dressing: $18. Amount I paid: $38, making this the first restaurant where I have actually looked over the check before paying and missed a $20 overcharge for a salad. I hadn't been drinking that night, either. If I had, I might have become even more numbed to gouging. Approximate retail price of a bottle of 2012 Napa Valley chardonnay from Far Niente: $55. Price of the same bottle at Kappo Masa: $190. This was typical. The markup that New York restaurants customarily add to retail wine and sake prices is about 150 percent. The average markup at Kappo Masa is 200 percent to 300 percent. And I don't need to shop around town to know that a cocktail of unnamed vodka infused with pineapple, even if it is as fresh tasting as Kappo Masa's, should not cost $25. It doesn't seem possible that Mr. Gagosian and Mr. Takayama just made up these prices out of thin air, diabolically chortling like Batman villains, late one evening at Masa. (Number of times each month Mr. Gagosian eats there, by his estimate: two.) And yet if you are one of those people who suspects that Manhattan is being remade as a private playground for millionaires who either don't mind spending hundreds of dollars for mediocrity or simply can't tell the difference, Kappo Masa is not going to convince you that you're wrong. Superficially, the servers seem to belong in a restaurant offering casual luxury. They can act out a solemn, respectful greeting or a deep genuflection of apology. What they don't always do is care. Servers who rushed to our side and fluttered about and acted distressed after one of them bumped a votive candle off the table's edge: three. Servers who asked if anyone had been hit by the candle or checked to see if we had wax on our clothes: zero. Also, bowing at one side of the table holding a cocktail menu open may have broadcast a desire to please, but it made the text impossible to read. When I asked which \"long-stem mushrooms\" came with the grilled asparagus, the server very obligingly promised to ask the kitchen but never returned with the answer. One night the standard finger napkins didn't appear until halfway through the sushi course. A restaurant of Mr. Takayama's that forgets how to serve sushi seems unthinkable, but then the sushi itself was no prize. The rice was a gummy clump (though, on another visit, it was close to perfect). Kappo Masa provides a pantomime of service without the substance, and the restaurant itself is an imitation of luxury, not the real thing. Stars I might have given Kappo Masa if the prices were, say, 20 percent lower: one. Stars I am giving it: zero.

There is the coy, unmarked-door hiding of the neo-speakeasy. There is the romantic hiding of restaurants whose positioning at, say, the end of an alley allows men to seem clever and their dates to seem impressed. There is the snooty hiding of exclusive restaurants that behave like private clubs, an affectation that is going out of style and won't be missed. Then there is Botequim, a fine new Brazilian restaurant that seems to have been hidden away against its will in the basement of a hotel on Fourth Avenue. You descend to Botequim in one of two ways. The first is weird. You walk into the Fourth , the street-level all-day restaurant of the Hyatt Union Square New York, past disoriented travelers at the bar, and take the stairs that unwind beneath a dangling helix of children's beds suspended from the ceiling. The second is weirder. You open a glass door on Fourth Avenue that says Botequim -- so far, so good -- and descend a staircase that deposits you in a backstage area between the kitchen and the dining room. Taking this route one night, I landed in the middle of a hushed, tense conference between two employees, who fell silent when they saw me. I felt like Lord Grantham stumbling upon a downstairs bitchfest. The hotel's efforts to keep Botequim out of sight since its September opening may account for the half-full dining room. Once you make it inside, though, things quickly start to look up. Graffiti-style murals zigzag across the walls, samba rhythms ripple all night long, and a glass of cacha\u00e7a is never more than a few minutes away; the bartenders upstairs will shake it with muddled lime hulls for a classic caipirinha or stir it with a cube of frozen coconut water, a stupefyingly simple drink that I will be copying at home next summer. Most of all, Botequim has Brazilian food, under the direction of the chef Marco Moreira, that is too good to be trapped in a basement. To start, have a few globes of p\u00e3o de queijo, Brazilian cheese puffs that are something like goug\u00e8res crossed with mochi. Springy and lightly chewy from tapioca flour, they are delicious eaten in alternating bites with toothpick-speared lengths of grilled calabresa sausage, spicy and tinged with garlic. Or with a plate of pastelzinhos, wonderfully crisp turnovers whose thin pastry shells are not even a little bit doughy. Some are filled with cubes of unmelted cheese from the state of Minas Gerais, and you may need to come from there yourself to appreciate its squeaky blandness. But the pastelzinhos holding ground beef with tomatoes and olives are instantly lovable. So are the rough and flaky fried croquettes of salt cod, light but not insubstantial. They come with a lemon emulsion, which is to be ignored in favor of a few potent drops of the bright-red hot sauce made on site. It's terrific stuff. The main courses make it obvious, if it wasn't already, that Botequim's kitchen cooks with far more finesse than the remaining restaurants of Manhattan's Little Brazil or the outposts of those all-the-grilled-meat-you-can-eat chains that turn up every few years and are never as much fun as they sound. Mr. Moreira, who with his wife and business partner, Jo-Ann Makovitzky, owns Botequim along with Tocqueville and 15 East , was raised in S\u00e3o Paulo. The kitchen is in the hands of Jason Hall, his chef de cuisine, but you can tell that Mr. Moreira put considerable care into the recipes. He may have lightened some of Brazil's more bruisingly rich dishes, but he kept the flavors true. Botequim's cube of suckling pig plays a recurring role in one of my hungry daydreams, in which I break the thin roof of crackling skin into chips to scoop up swirls of lime-brightened pork, soft enough to serve as a dip. In other idle moments between meals, I flash back to the short rib, roasted in extremely slow motion until a dark and satisfying crust wraps around woozily tender meat. It's like smokeless barbecue, and once I had tried it, I stopped flashing back to Botequim's roasted top sirloin, called the Brazilian, a fine steak but ultimately just a steak. My private visions of moqueca may feature a more varied mix of seafood than black sea bass and a single prawn. But the coconut-tomato broth in this Bahian stew would taste a lot like Botequim's, with every mouthful slicked by a palpable slug of red dend\u00ea oil. And when I imagine feijoada, it looks the way it did my first night at Botequim, when it was loaded with smoked pork and sausages and the black beans tasted as if they, too, were on the verge of turning into meat. On a second try, it was more soup than stew, and the beans tasted like beans. Maybe it was just the luck of the ladle. The high point of dessert was always a tres leches-style coconut cake grandly slouching under the weight of all the milk and cream it had soaked up. When I tried anything else, the meal never ended as well. Sonhos, the doughnut holes whose name means \"dreams\" in Portuguese, had an undreamlike heaviness, though a quick dunk in guava sauce helped. For reasons I can't imagine, the rice pudding, which was allegedly made with bananas and passion fruit, tasted like stewed onions. And my coffee, which seemed like a sure thing in a Brazilian restaurant, was awful, a thin and watery broth. If you want a drink with dessert, try some sherry from Roger Dagorn's list, which is strong in all departments, down to the rarely seen Brazilian beers. But weak coffee and iffy desserts can be fixed; they're no reason to hide Botequim away from people looking for dinner along Fourth Avenue. Mr. Moreira and Ms. Makovitzky also operate the Fourth and a whiskey and wine bar called Singl , both on the street level. I don't know anything about the hotel business; if I did, maybe I'd understand why hotels have such strange ideas about spelling. But a bar seems like a natural inhabitant for a snug room in the basement. My message to Mr. Moreira: Set the moqueca free! Let the cod fritters come upstairs!

DIRTY, says one. FRENCH, reads the other. Diners who have reservations for Dirty French , secured with a credit card and a gentle warning of a modest $50-a-person cancellation fee, will find a dining room inside the Ludlow hotel that is decorated with a few shoestring-budget items, like a wall-length antique carnival mirror shipped from France. A few weeks ago, the partners had the artist Rashid Johnson, a frequent guest, throw oozing slicks of wax blended with West African black soap against the mirror's glass. (Around the same time, one of Mr. Johnson's wax-and-soap works sold at auction for just under $200,000.) Across from the mirror, over the bar, is a wide French flag that Julian Schnabel splotched with ink. Down on the tiled floor, in another humble little gesture, servers lope around in squeaky-fresh limited edition Air Jordans from the '80s, some of which probably cost more than I paid for my first car. Ever since Carbone and its neighbor, ZZ's Clam Bar, came along, swagger and money have been to Torrisi-Carbone-Zalaznick establishments what blinking lights and sitars are to Sixth Street's Curry Row. If the word for flaunting cash and art-world connections like this doesn't occur to you immediately, look at the strutting crowd of ceramic roosters that Mr. Zalaznick spray-painted in screaming pink: Dirty French is one cocky restaurant. It can also be an immensely enjoyable one. That sounds contradictory, but the same self-confidence that can get on your nerves also allows this crew to mess around with French cuisine with a hugely energizing lack of respect. In unnatural crossbreeding experiments, they force bistro cooking to mate with haute cuisine. To make dinner less stuffy and formal, they bring back stuffy formalities like cut-glass wine carafes and frilly oyster plates. They smudge the pages of Escoffier with strange foreign spices. It may sound like run-of-the-mill fusion, but it is a top-to-bottom remix, and nearly every weird mongrel idea leads in the direction of more flavor or more fun. Chefs more deferential to custom may not have ditched the hallowed basket of levain or baguette \u00e0 l'ancienne in favor of a flatbread inspired by the mahjeb Mr. Torrisi ate, one loaf after another, in a North African neighborhood of Paris. It's no innovation, this bread, just pita dough griddled in plenty of olive oil, buried under Proven\u00e7al herbs and sent out with a snowbank of fromage blanc, but people tore it up with greedy, greasy fingers at every table, mine included. Not that the chefs hide their training. (Mr. Torrisi worked for years under Daniel Boulud and takes the lead in this kitchen.) The mille-feuille is a technical showstopper, an accordion of ribbon-thin king trumpet mushroom stems folded over and over. It looks like pastry but pulls apart like buttered noodles, and when you drag them through a pool of green curry, the scene shifts to Thailand. It's a disorienting dish, and makes your head spin in a wonderful way. The restaurant creates a parallel world where French pastry turns into Thai curry; it's as if the chefs have imagined an alternative history in which the leading kitchens of France turned left instead of right several decades ago. What if nouvelle cuisine had embraced maximalism instead of minimalism, full-frontal abandon instead of lean precision? And what if, instead of teaching Americans to make puff pastry, the country's chefs had taken cooking lessons from the rest of the French-speaking world? For one thing, they might have come up with Dirty French's glorious lamb carpaccio. Brushed with a slow-burning raz al hanout oil, sprinkled with tart sumac powder and fresh herbs, dotted with sheep's milk yogurt and preserved lemon and wheels of roasted eggplant, the slices of lamb loin are saddled with as much flavor as they can reasonably be asked to carry. Or, though this probably needed a push from the roast-chicken gold rush started at the NoMad , they might have hit upon Dirty French's $72 poultry feast. First to arrive is the sneakily rich (translation: you can't see the foie gras) white meat in mustard-herb sauce. Then the bird's hindquarters show up on a cutting board. They've been soaked in a Vietnamese marinade of soy, fish sauce and lemon grass, slowly cooked in melted chicken fat (oh yes they have), then grilled and freshened up with lime zest. The chicken comes with crepes, irrelevantly; just pick up a drumstick and get to work on that burnished skin. The chefs have an instinct for the right kind of too much, but some dishes trip into the wrong kind. A deeply aromatic and fairly traditional bouillabaisse was thick with octopus, mussels, monkfish and one small, whole, wonderful red mullet. Cuttlefish ink took the broth to the outer edge of intensity, but the medicinal taste of fresh marjoram in some spoonfuls went beyond it. And while duck heart kebabs unloaded at the table added brawn to a fris\u00e9e and lardons salad, the blast of mustard in the dressing was an excessive use of force. A programmatic rollout of the formula -- Something Clearly French Under Heaps of Post-Colonial Exotica -- doesn't guarantee a sprinkling of magical pixie dust on every plate. Baked clams seemed perplexed by their thick jackets of almonds and Ethiopian spices, and so was I. A beautifully cooked trout meuni\u00e8re was speckled with sesame seeds and herbs, a mix that came across as an oddly neutered za'atar. Still, you can eat extraordinarily well by calling your shots and rolling with the loose, genial decadence of the place. The mood is set when a server comes over and says, in as laid-back a tone as anyone can manage while lugging an enormous 19th-century sterling silver punch bowl filled with ice, \"I wanted to let you have a look at tonight's oysters.\" Oysters: Why not? It continues when Lela\u00f1ea Fulton, who assembled a wine list that is all French, and fun for all kinds of budgets, shows up dressed like one of Charlie's Angels working undercover as a sommelier. Old Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape? Sure. It goes on through dessert, under the assured hand of the pastry chef Heather Bertinetti, who gracefully threads her way through the French-exotic conceit with a delicately architectural coconut-passionfruit Napoleon and a very short but very good pineapple tarte Tatin, rum-raisin ice cream on top. Mr. Torrisi, Mr. Carbone and Mr. Zalaznick, cautious and retiring as ever, plan to open three original restaurants next year while continuing to build new Parm locations. The question is whether this will leave them the energy to keep refining their mongrel bistro on Ludlow Street while rolling out its breakfast and lunch menus in the coming months. Dirty French needs time to grow into its ideas, and maybe to grow out of a few of them.

Rectangles of pizza bianca cut with scissors on the Campo de' Fiori from long planks shaped like diving boards, yes, but not for regular pizza. The standard circular pie is something travelers eat only after saltimbocca, puntarelle, spicy tripe, salt cod fritters, semolina gnocchi, porchetta, artichokes fried alla giudia and the holy pasta trinity of cacio e pepe, amatriciana and carbonara have all been checked off the list. It is food for the fifth night of vacation. And now the chef Nick Anderer has come to make this lesser stop on Rome's culinary pilgrimage route the main event of his new pizzeria, Marta . For the last five years Mr. Anderer has been a faithful custodian of the more famous Roman landmarks at Maialino , in the Gramercy Park Hotel. Marta, opened in September, is a continuation of that project, a spinoff that might have found a space next door if Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group had not decided to place it about a half-mile away in the soaring, stately lobby of the Martha Washington Hotel. Marta has Roman appetizers and entire Roman dishes repurposed as toppings for pizzas with thin crusts in the Roman style. Hold on, you say. Thin-crust pies are wall to wall around here. It is the house style of New York, a city to which people actually do travel for pizza. The style came from Naples with America's earliest pizzaioli more than a century ago, and it's been rejuvenated by modern obsessives who precisely calibrate their flour blends. What do we have to learn from Rome? Let's keep local pride in check for a minute. Marta's crusts are even thinner than what we think of as thin. Cooks in gray baseball caps press the dough flat with rolling pins on a marble counter. Slipped onto the floor of one of the hulking ovens whose black-tiled chimneys disappear into the hotel's second floor, the pies bake next to flickering stacks of firewood. The crust at first-rank Roman pizzerias like Da Remo in Testaccio is often compared to a cracker, but crackers crumble. This doesn't. It is more like the crust on a loaf of peasant bread from which all the soft crumbs have been stripped. It is durably crisp, unbendingly flat, and when you hold a slice by the edge, the rest of it juts out above the table like a cliff. Because everything I know about cliffs was learned from Wile E. Coyote, I kept waiting for the tip on each Marta slice to give way, but it never did. The pleasure of biting down on this pizza is both physical and auditory. The noise detonates along the jaw and plows right into the inner ear. Every bite sounds and feels like that. There is no soupy middle of steamed dough under wet tomatoes. It's pure crunch, all the way. What you lose with this style is the soft, springy, baguette-like curls at the edges of a Neapolitan pizza. The outer crusts of a Marta pie don't puff up; they stay hard and round, like grissini. When a pizza crust is all crackle, what's on top has to bring the flavor. This is where you see Mr. Anderer thinking like a cook. He has a great pizza-fied version of carbonara, with dots of egg and grated pecorino over crumbled, starchy potatoes and baconlike curls of guanciale. For a while, he was doing an enjoyable two-dimensional trippa alla Romana, too, spreading the rich, chile-boosted tomato sauce around the pie and arranging tender, not too chewy bands of tripe on top. In a more classical vein, the margherita, spread with flavorful tomatoes that are more pulp than sauce and punctuated with mozzarella, is superb. At $16, the buffalo mozzarella, richer and with a faint taste of the barnyard or wherever it is water buffaloes pass the time, is worth the $4 upgrade from the cow's milk variety. And if $18 seems high for a funghi pizza, note that the funghi in question are quartered chanterelles and frilly hen-of-the-woods, seasoned with thyme and just enough salt. Like almost all the toppings, the mushrooms are beautifully cooked with an insinuation of smoke; only the shoulder ham, layered between fontina and arugula, seemed to want more time in the oven, or maybe it needed to be sliced thin, so the edges could crisp and curl. Few pizzerias invest heavily in atmospherics, because pizza and the people who love it come and go in a few minutes. Still, it's a surprise just how little atmosphere the Union Square Hospitality Group has tried to conjure at Marta. The dining room, with its majestic high ceilings and blocky fluted columns, has the cold, empty monumentality of a 19th-century bank. There's some energy at the counter that faces the ovens, but very little in the rows of square tables behind it. The restaurant is open to the hotel lobby, and after a while, the comings and goings can make you feel as if you're eating in the waiting room of a train station. Lingering over a long series of courses is not advised. Marta works best when treated as a pizzeria, not a restaurant. Main courses are available, but they are not as trustworthy as the pies. Pork ribs managed to be both charred and undercooked, while a slow-roasted short rib needed a more potent infusion of flavor than gremolata could give it. The mixed grill of lamb chops, ribs and sausage was a magnificent exception, but in general the larger plates are best for those who can't eat pizza. (Marta does not make gluten-free dough.) A quick appetizer while the pizza bakes is absolutely recommended, though. Wood smoke wraps around rabbit meatballs, heavily peppered and herbed. The kitchen does fine work with hot oil, swathing vegetable fritters or seafood fritto misto in a translucently thin, light-gold batter and gently browning the bread crumbs around green suppl\u00ec shaped from very good basil risotto. After pizza, there is an affogato that is exactly right, an ice cream sandwich that's harder to like than it should be (the salted chocolate cookies could be thinner or softer, the pistachios crisper) and a cup of tiramis\u00f9 that's bracingly drenched in espresso. It costs just $5, which is helpful because pizza and fried food both need bubbles. Marta has a few Italian sparkling wines, but the real action is in the stockpile of nearly 40 Champagnes, from a $66 Roger Pouillon Cuv\u00e9e de R\u00e9serve to some $300-plus vintage treats. Nobody goes to Rome for Champagne with pizza, either, but this isn't Rome.

This review concerns one of the others, a place that stumbled at the start, as ungainly as a day-old giraffe, and only recently found its footing. Bar Bolonat opened in the West Village in March in what seemed an auspicious location, a corner spot looking out on Abingdon Square Park through yards of windows. Two months in, Einat Admony, the chef and owner, was on the verge of closing it, she said in a phone interview. Nearly half of her 54 seats had been taken away after the city ruled that one wing of the dining room was an unpermitted sidewalk enclosure. The disputed area was quarantined behind a velvet rope, although it was hard to imagine a crowd lining up for admission to this patch of bare cement floor. This put a strain on revenues, no doubt, and made the place look pretty weird. Even with reduced capacity, Bar Bolonat was afflicted by suboptimal acoustics. When I ate there early in the summer, the screeching in the dining room could have crushed scrap metal. It nearly crushed my desire to come back, too, but I held on because Ms. Admony was up to something original in the kitchen. The daughter of an Iranian mother and Yemenite father, she was combining the flavors of contemporary multiethnic Israel, where she grew up, with the idioms of modern restaurants in New York, where she has been cooking since getting a job in Bobby Flay 's kitchen at Bolo in 1999. I'd never tasted anything exactly like her shrimp in a Yemenite curry, with a fiery shot of green zhug and a small round of fried bread called malawach to soak up the spicy, turmeric-gold coconut milk. I wanted more food like this in my life, but I wasn't in a big hurry to face the decibels again. Now, with sound-absorbing tiles up above, Bar Bolonat is a quieter restaurant, though it's not entirely library-like. (One small section of ceiling, without tiles, is angled like the soundboard of a grand piano, with a similar effect.) It's also bigger. In September, Ms. Admony finally appeased the bureaucrats and returned all her seats to active duty. While fixing up the space, she made other changes, replacing executive chefs until she found Molly Breidenthal. When I ate there this month, the cooking was more assured than it had been, the spices applied more fearlessly. The giraffe is on the move. Energetic seasoning drives Ms. Admony's cuisine at Bar Bolonat, as it does at her exemplary falafel shops, Ta\u00efm , and to a lesser extent her Mediterranean comfort food restaurant, Balaboosta . One of Bar Bolonat's most likable dishes since the unsteady early days has been the lemony grilled baby artichokes with a creamy band of pistachio yogurt under a pale-green powder of dukkah. That blend of chopped nuts and herbs can get tired if it sits around too long, but Bar Bolonat's is extremely fresh, the pistachios still sweet and bright green. A swipe of corn pur\u00e9e takes its seductive, toasty flavor from turmeric, cardamom and ground cloves, Ms. Admony's version of a warming spice blend called hawaij that Yemenis stir into soups. Together with the creeping heat and sweetness of a red pepper sauce, the spiced corn makes something exciting out of a grilled octopus leg. Nearly everybody orders the Jerusalem-style sesame bagel, so light and fluffy it's almost an anti-bagel. Nearly everybody is right about this. What makes this racetrack-shaped bread so hard to pass up is the spoonful of really fragrant and complex za'atar that you dunk each piece into after giving it a preliminary bath in peppery olive oil. When dishes were underwhelming, as several were one August night, timid seasoning could be to blame. \"Za'atar ravioli,\" stuffed with smoky eggplant, might have been interesting had it included some actual za'atar. On the other hand, Bar Bolonat's zabzi, an Iranian fresh-herb stew served with soft specks of fresh couscous, was fantastically vivid, and it could have become one of my favorites if the short rib in the stew had not been tough and dry. The dishes at Bar Bolonat are meant to be shared -- everybody sing along -- and come out of the kitchen as they're ready. Or so the servers say. The menu is split into small, medium and large plates. As common sense would tell you if the servers weren't telling you otherwise, the bigger ones, like the lamb neck braised with dates and chestnuts until it is pull-apart tender, are a lot easier to split than the few mouthfuls of fluke ceviche with dried pomegranate seeds and juice. The kitchen could do more to help by, say, carving the pomegranate-glazed poussin instead of sending it out whole with a serrated knife. The bit about the dishes' showing up at random times is misleading, too, but in a good way. My table was never laden down with more plates than it could hold. This ought to go without saying, but in restaurants these days nothing does. Apart from one or two unscheduled leaves of absence one night, the service was generally excellent, with a professional bearing that signals Ms. Admony's intent to have Israeli cuisine taken seriously. The white napkins, polished stemware, sheer curtains and understated modern furniture are all a determined bid for the kinds of diners who would steer clear of anything resembling a hummus hut. For dessert, Ms. Admony makes a homey, from-scratch version of Milky, a chocolate pudding brand so central to Israeli life that it became the symbol of a protest this fall against the high cost of living. The halvah cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e tastes more like butterscotch than sesame, but it is worth getting for the tuft of halvah floss on top. The most entertaining and probably the best dessert is a fried envelope of baklava with ice cream sealed inside, although the ice cream should be colder and the pastry hotter if Ms. Admony wants to live up to the high standards once set by the fried ice cream at Chi-Chi's . Having fought City Hall and the screaming demons of dining-room noise, she's probably ready for a new challenge.

This is the happiness of thinking about a friend's newborn baby when you get into bed for a full night's rest; the thrill of knowing that at the exact moment when your marathon-running co-worker is gasping across the finish line in Central Park, you are at home, not running; and the joy of skipping over all the articles on turkey thermometers and lump-free gravy because it's not your turn to host. Of course, as a Thanksgiving guest, you still have work to do. The altruistic way of looking at this is that you should try to make the host's job easier. This assignment began back when you accepted the invitation. That was the moment to mention your allergies and to ask what you could bring with you. Now, with just a few days to go, it's time to take stock. Are your white and sparkling wines chilled, and do you have a way to keep the bottles cold while you are getting there? If you are bringing your famous yam lollipops, will they be ready to serve, sitting in an ovenproof serving dish that can be warmed up while the turkey is resting? Don't count on free counter space. Nathalie Dupree , a cookbook writer and veteran host in Charleston, S.C., ruefully recalled the year somebody showed up with boiled potatoes and proceeded to mash them on site. \"Splattering potatoes on the wall at a time when everything else is going on is not welcome,\" she said. If you absolutely must use the host's kitchen to finish the yam lollipops, today would be a good time to confirm that it's O.K. While you're at it, ask if there's something more that you can bring. \"I certainly don't always know, and would guess many a host doesn't always know, what I need until closer to the event,\" said Eric Diesel, who writes about food and lifestyle on his Urban Home Blog , and who has helped organize some sprawling Thanksgiving feasts with up to 30 guests. By the day before the holiday, he said, the host has a much better idea of what's missing: cocktail napkins, folding chairs, ice or, Mr. Diesel suggested, piles of plastic containers for sending guests home with surplus food. The last items should be brought only if the host wants them and only if there are enough for everybody. One woman whose annual spread starts with two turkeys and eight pies and goes on from there said the most egregious guests of all time -- worse even than the relative's new girlfriend who entertained the multitudes with tales of their fantastic sexual escapades -- were the couple who brought just enough Tupperware for themselves. \"We didn't get leftovers from Alan's mom,\" they explained. (The hostess, though still seething, asked that her name be withheld.) These suggestions help with the altruistic part of your mission. But remember that your highest priority is to make sure you are invited back so that you can enjoy the delicious sensation of not hosting again next Thanksgiving. Here, a small bribe is helpful. A bottle that is too good for the mob can be pressed discreetly into the host's hands as you murmur, \"This is for tomorrow.\" The more thought you put into the bribe, the better the odds it will be effective a year from now. \"Somebody brought me a nice box of stationery,\" said John Winterman, the general manager of the Manhattan restaurant B\u00e2tard and a polished host at home, when asked about gifts from guests he has invited more than once. \"Somebody brought me a chile pepper plant, which we used, of course.\" Flowers growing in a pot (cyclamens look dapper at this time of year) beat cut stems, which will send the host rooting through the cupboards with gravy-splattered hands to find an empty vase. Your shot at a repeat performance will be seriously jeopardized if you spill Burgundy on the heirloom table linens, so a light, alcohol-absorbent lunch may be advisable if dinner will be served late in the day. On the same principle, pregaming with a few shots before you arrive is a risky maneuver. You should be relatively sober when you present your host gift and size up the situation. \"Tune into how the event is going and plug into whoever needs something,\" Mr. Diesel said. \"If the cook is hiding in the kitchen ask, \u2018Can I help, or do you need me to be out there so you can be in here?' \" If you are shooed away, he said, appoint yourself coat-check clerk, bartender or babysitter. Or talk to the stray great-aunt who's on her own. If you are given a kitchen assignment, make sure you understand it down to the last detail, unlike the guest of Ms. Dupree's who piled potatoes on the turkey platter. If the host refuses help, that should not be taken for an invitation to stand in front of the refrigerator and chat, even if that's what you'd do on another, looser day. On Thanksgiving, home kitchens are almost as busy and focused as professional ones, and you shouldn't enter the combat zone any more than you would bust through the swinging doors at Jean-Georges during dinner service shouting: \"Yo, J. G.! What up, dog?\" Most of all, encourage the cooks from the sidelines. Bite your tongue if you notice the gravy hasn't been degreased as thoroughly as you think it should be. \"It's so important not to give any kind of advice on anything,\" said Denis Gainty, a professor of Japanese history at Georgia State University. \"You need to be the cheerleader for the food that's being produced by the host. I have lots of opinions about brining, but I realize I need to steer the conversation to safer topics, like religion and homosexuality.\" At last, the turkey has been carved and you can finally enjoy the fruits of someone else's labor. The urge to cash in with soaring mountain ranges of your favorite foods will be strong. This is the time to recall that you are playing the long game. If the stuffing is gone before everyone has had a crack at it, the host can't make more but can easily look around and identify the looters. For the last two decades, Tom & Jerry's bar in downtown Manhattan has been the site of an open-house Thanksgiving to which any local restaurant employees with nowhere else to go are invited. Daniel O'Connor, an architect who is one of the hosts, said the event is notable for its spirit of cooperation and sharing. Still, not everyone plays along. \"You really see the divide when it's leftover time,\" he said. \"You have some people literally taking an entire turkey home, not a piece of a turkey. Or taking a whole pie. There's always someone like that.\" As you load your plate, remember the Wall Street saying: Pigs get fat; hogs get slaughtered. While taking modest initial portions, though, it's important to act as if you have never encountered such bounty. Leo Carey, a senior editor at The New Yorker, who was born in England and has successfully extracted an invitation from the same Boston family for 15 consecutive Thanksgivings, noticed this American technique of complimenting the host early on. \"Everyone self-consciously, self-mockingly but also weirdly proudly, talks about gluttony,\" he said. \"But the literal amounts of food consumed haven't struck me as totally unprecedented.\" Compliments should be delivered between mouthfuls and scattered far and wide. Keep in mind that there may be many cooks around the table and that each one is a prospective source for next year's invitation. Most of all, though, remember that no dish in the American canon provokes more performance anxiety than roast turkey, and the host needs to hear that all the effort was worth it. One year when I invited people to my house for Thanksgiving, I suggested, in one of those fits of neurotic self-deprecation that hosts are prone to, that the white meat was a bit dry. A guest I didn't know very well agreed. Amateur move. When you don't roast it yourself, the turkey is always perfect.

For the last eight years, Ms. You has been the chef and proprietor of the Tianjin Dumpling House, which is not so much a house as a narrow shaft of elbow room behind a sneeze guard in the basement of a Chinese food-vendors' market on Main Street. The first dumpling of hers that I tried had a sea-bass stuffing cut with minced ginger, which gave bracing clarity to the few drops of broth sealed inside. It was so satisfying that at first I felt no need to branch out. The dumplings were irresistibly priced, though, at about $5 a dozen, and I began to experiment with new ones: lamb and chopped zucchini humming with Sichuan peppercorns, maybe, or pork with threads of fresh dill. These were wildly good, too. One day, I noticed a sign inviting me to pick my own custom dumpling fillings from a grid of 24 ingredients. This paralyzed me. Ms. You clearly had a kind of genius for creating miniature worlds of flavor. Who was I to tell her what she ought to fold into her circles of dough? It was as if somebody had handed me a box of feathers, bones, beaks and flesh and said, \"Here, build a parrot.\" What I wanted was more of Ms. You's recipes, not mine, and I got my wish earlier this year when Ms. You opened Dumpling Galaxy a few blocks from her original stall. Dumpling Galaxy sits back from the street, inside a shiny new mall it shares with a Korean-French bakery and a purveyor of sparkly false eyelashes. Ms. You designed the striking, modern interior herself, splashing bold Chinese red across walls with a basket-weave relief and building deep semiprivate booths, each with its own TV screen showing highlights of the 100 dumplings on the menu. The Dumpling Channel goes heavy on cross-section shots that reveal the central core of filling. Take a good look, because this is a sight you should never see if you want to get the most out of a meal at Dumpling Galaxy. Resist the exploratory nibble. Dip one side in black vinegar and soy, and paint it with chile oil if you like, then pocket the whole thing in your mouth. It won't gush with a waterfall of broth. It will, however, hold a few drops of liquid shed by the filling as the dumpling boiled. Those drops belong to you. Sometimes those juices taste like fresh green herbs, as when Ms. You mixes cilantro with minced lamb, or dill with excellent softly scrambled eggs. Sometimes they combine those qualities with a whiplash of heat, as in the head-twistingly good spicy beef dumpling, seasoned with scallions, fresh red and green chiles, and searing dried chile sauce. As a young girl in Tianjin, China, Ms. You was taught to cook by her mother and grandparents. Her dumplings are sturdy, knobby, domestic creatures in the Northern Chinese tradition. Sometimes you see the ghostly outline of the fillings through the shiny white skins, and sometimes you can't. But her dumplings are stuffed to order, and Ms. You fine-tunes them with the sensitivity of a natural cook who listens to her ingredients. Mixing shrimp with two varieties of celery, the more bitter and self-assured Chinese and the sweeter, shyer Western kind, and using both stalks and leaves, she builds exhilarating harmonies. It would be a miracle on Main Street if all 100 varieties at Dumpling Galaxy were equally lovable. They aren't. The one with shrimp, scallops and crab meat didn't deliver the sweet seafood luxury it promised. Steamed har gow were less juicy than those wheeled around on the best dim sum carts. My strategy is to seek out the proprietary blends, which justify prices that can be slightly higher (as much as $7.95 for six) than those at other places in Flushing, including Tianjin Dumpling House. I've eaten entire meals that delivered less flavor than a single one of Ms. You's dumplings stuffed with terrific little meatballs of duck and shiitakes. And if those hadn't cheered me up, the fried dumplings would. Ms. You pours watery cornstarch into the pan, which bubbles and browns into a shatteringly thin, dumpling-studded pancake. Cracking that crust, I felt like the happiest guy in the galaxy. That feeling wavered whenever I had to lean out of my booth with one arm extended for minutes at a time to ask for water or the check or for empty dishes to be cleared. It was like hailing a cab on Broadway at 5 p.m., but less effective. As time dragged on, I wondered why nobody had invented Uber for waiters. Looking at the tables of Chinese families, I noticed that their dumpling consumption was considerably less piggish than mine. They might share a single order, a mere six dumplings, before moving on to the dishes from Northern China, Hunan and Fujian on the rest of the menu. (One cook specializes in each region.) I came to see the wisdom of allowing fish and vegetables to supplement all the boiled flour I was ingesting. The Hunanese preserved pork stir-fried with stubby lengths of pickled long beans was superb, both fiery and tart. Triple delight vegetables (green chiles, barely tender potato and eggplant so creamy it may as well be pudding) was an unusually good version of the Dongbei standby. Whole fish with spicy bean sauce was a hit at my table, even if we did use the marvelous sauce to obscure the fish's slightly muddy flavor. You can find these dishes elsewhere, but no other kitchen offers such an embarrassment of dumpling riches, including dessert. Some sweet dumplings are pinched in dough like the savory ones, such as tart dried hawthorn berries with white wood ears, or pear with eight treasures, which I now think of as fruitcake pirogi. Others, called tang yuan, are tinted orbs of dough that are springy and chewy, like mochi. My favorite was the pumpkin-flavored globe with a sugary paste of black sesame at the core. These orange globes arrived, not on a plate like the others, but bobbing in a thick, clear, steaming soup. I could stare at ingredient lists all day and never come up with a parrot like this.

It can take time to sort out which are borrowed and which have the sting of the new. Thomas Chen, fresh from the trenches at Eleven Madison Park and Commerce , opened his first restaurant in August, called Tuome. Like so many other places in the era of Noma , it is tastefully spartan in appearance. Its two small dining rooms are furnished with small tables set with small menus printed in small type. The wood chairs and metal bar stools are unsoftened by fabric or cushions. The lights are dim -- not flattering, first-date dim but I'm-too-young-to-be-going-blind dim. In terms of glitz and glamour, Tuome falls somewhere between a yoga studio and Thoreau's cabin . I've eaten in plenty of rooms like this over the last few years. And I've seen any number of dishes resembling these: the Nike swooshes of ultra-blended vegetable pur\u00e9es; the green leaves the size of chipmunk ears arranged just so over a deviled egg; the row of scallops all crouched together as if hiding from some scallop-hating predator on the other side of the plate. Clearly Mr. Chen and I have been following the same Instagram feeds. That egg, though. Wait a minute. This is something different. There is half of a hard-cooked white, deep-fried in panko. Spooned into the divot is a dot of deviled yolk, sharp with pickles and Dijon mustard. On top of that is a spoonful of fried garlic and dried chiles in their spicy red oil. It's fun to feel the temperatures and textures, creamy and crackling and slippery, meet in your mouth, and to taste the strange collision of church-picnic-style eggs with a Chinese condiment. How can half an egg do three or four things at once? Later, a server points a siphon into the crook of an octopus leg. Out comes a suede-colored snowdrift. He says it's brown-butter-and-potato espuma. I say it's foam and I say the hell with it. I focus on the octopus, which crunches emphatically and has a rounded, slightly fruity flavor. With it is a chewy, chunky, lightly gingered XO sauce. Chopped caramelized pork and Chinese sausage give it the sweetness of bacon; fish sauce and dried shrimp take it broader and deeper. I can't get enough of it. The foam will not be ignored forever, though. While it is not the most original notion, it does add something, unlike most foams. What it adds is a fluffy wave of toasted butter, like the frosting on a caramel cake minus the sugar and the heft. The dish is peculiarly good; it makes an extraordinary indulgence out of the octopus. And it shows off the clear and fresh point of view Mr. Chen brings to his cooking, particularly when he interprets Chinese flavors. Before working at Eleven Madison Park and Commerce, Mr. Chen was an accountant. The idea was to stay as far from restaurants as possible, and it came from his parents. After moving from China to New York City, the Chens operated a Chinese restaurant outside of the city. They wanted something higher for Thomas (he was Tommy at home, but on his parents' lips the nickname came out \"tow me,\" which is how Tuome is pronounced), but after shepherding balance sheets by day and attending culinary school by night, he came to see cooking as the higher calling. A little more than two months in, Tuome is already starting to feel mature. The one-page wine list is seriously eclectic, but it's not too cool for a Napa Valley cabernet and an Anderson Valley chardonnay. The servers take their jobs seriously, although I'm not sure the point has to be underlined by forcing them all to wear tailored T-shirts the color of wet cement. Mr. Chen doesn't need to make his staff look like a modern dance troupe to tell people Tuome isn't your average East Village spot; his cooking does that for him. (And the East Village average is getting higher every year.) He has terrific control over salt, spices, texture and contrast, weaving them together until you ask, why hasn't anyone done this before? Adding slick duck fat to packets of Cantonese sticky rice steamed in lotus leaves seems like an obvious good idea. So does the extra crackle he puts into the Chinese sausage bits to save the rice from gummy monotony. But they aren't obvious until you taste Mr. Chen's version. A few dishes show off Mr. Chen's technical command more than his originality. The scoop of chicken liver mousse with maple syrup pooled in a hollow on top, like the gravy on mashed potatoes, is exquisitely done, but feels familiar. Another dish fell out of focus between meals, when the carrot-miso pur\u00e9e accompanying seared scallops lost its savory, salty depth and became merely sweet. And there's one I'd like to forget, a dully sweet squash soup impaled with frogs' legs that were both mushy and stringy. But a striking number of dishes at Tuome are memorable for the right reasons. Serving sous-vide chicken on soupy rice cooked with garlic chives and shiitakes, Mr. Chen doesn't try to sex up his homey inspiration, congee; he just makes it more layered and modern, surrounding the chicken with a dark basil jus, and lets the flavors quietly win you over. I wish he would take the same approach with pork belly instead of forcing it to do double-duty as a marketing event. Right now it's called the Pig Out (a name meant for hashtagging), and it marches to the table as a $49 feast for two, 10 bite-size squares of pork belly riding on a slate shingle with a parade of sauces and bowls of spicy-peanut noodles following behind. The crashing cymbals can't disguise how easily the dish, and its price, could be divided in half. But Mr. Chen has done something amazing to this pig. His inspiration may have been Cantonese roast pork, but these compressed, intensely flavorful squares of well-rendered belly partake of Peking duck, too. After I'd topped the reflective pane of skin with ginger-scallion sauce and a few drops of sambal from a squeeze bottle, I wanted to tuck the pork into a steamed bun or a crepe, and then chew and crunch and chew and crunch some more. Forget the gimmick. There are fresh ideas in this dish, and they are all Mr. Chen's.

One was the common football-size butternut that weighs down shopping bags at this time of year. The other had the same shape but was about as big as a sparrow. I held it in my palm. It felt good in there. Without thinking about what I was doing, I began petting it. The couple at the next table asked if they could see my tiny squash, and I let them stroke its smooth, cool skin. Before things got too weird, our server took my pet squash back to the kitchen. When it came back, it had been roasted and cut in half. Specks of white pepper and strands of grated chestnut lay against its dark orange insides. It was sweeter than a normal butternut, but what I mostly noticed was that it tasted squashier, as if all the flavor had been compressed. Selective breeding was responsible, our server explained. Dan Barber, Blue Hill's executive chef and a co-owner with his brother, David, had asked a Cornell agriculture professor to design a squash for him, making it as small and tasty as possible. The result is the 898 squash , served exclusively at Mr. Barber's two restaurants, Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., and this one, just off Washington Square Park. Mr. Barber opened the one in Manhattan first, in 2000, with the idea of using local seasonal produce, including some from his family's farm in the Berkshires. This put him in the company of, oh, several hundred other chefs. A few years later, though, he was chosen to lead an ambitious project at Stone Barns that combined a farm and a restaurant with research and education programs. It turned out that he was born for the job. Patient, intense, curious, enthusiastic, articulate, Mr. Barber has become a dirt poet and kitchen philosopher whose time outside with the pigs and the beans has had a deep, lasting effect on the way he cooks. Today no other chef has the information he keeps in his head (how to make pure carbon out of a cow's femur) or the vegetables he puts in his ovens (sparrow-size squash). To get the Full Barber, you have to go to Stone Barns for a $198 menu-free, open-ended meal that may include, if you're lucky, a tour of the manure shed where hot compost is put to work as cooking fuel. The original Blue Hill sits in the English basement of a townhouse in Greenwich Village, a historically tolerant neighborhood whose tolerance does not extend to manure sheds. The city doesn't afford the time or space for the leisurely unfurling of Mr. Barber's complete vision of how our appetites should fit into the land and the climate. The low-ceilinged space is too much like a saloon, the tables too close together, the restaurant's many ardent admirers too accustomed to treating it as a place to catch up over an excellent weeknight dinner. If Blue Hill had as many cooks and servers as its more favored sister upstate, they would probably iron out wrinkles like the long, stranded layovers between courses; the wineglasses that sat empty and were finally cleared with no offer of fresh ones; and the $23 glass of Rully poured ice-cold, so it was clenched and astringent. It also seems far out of character that this intensely local restaurant sells just two New York wines on its Francophilic (and not very value-minded) list, and that its only cider comes from California when there is a cider revival going on in Mr. Barber's own, apple-rich state. But while it may give you only a Half Barber, Blue Hill is still an exceptional restaurant. Mr. Barber's long search for flavor out of town pays off downtown, where you find yourself thinking, again and again, that each new ingredient may well be the best example of its kind you've ever tasted. For this reason and others, Blue Hill is one of the few New York restaurants that seem to get better and more original as time goes by. This was true the last time it was reviewed in The New York Times, in 2006, when Frank Bruni brought it from two stars to three, and it is true now. Dinner at Blue Hill can go in one of two directions: a four-course, $85 menu that you choose, or a longer, free-form \"farmer's feast\" chosen by Mr. Barber or his chef de cuisine, Shingoon Hong, for $98 or $125, depending on how hungry the farmer is. Either way, the night will include a couple of surprise cameos by fruits and vegetables that drop in like the kooky neighbors in a sitcom. A meal in September started with wispy young fennel stalks that had a clean and pure licorice sweetness and ended with firm, green-skinned, yellow-fleshed plums on ice. Both made me happy I had come to Blue Hill then, not a week sooner or later, which is the effect that certain fruits and vegetables can have when they're picked at the right time. In a more recent meal, the kitchen sent out a raw hakurei turnip as big as an apple. In fact, it had been pushed through an apple slicer. I picked up a white wedge, swiped it through a pool of tarragon vinaigrette and braced for the harsh turnip aftertaste that never came. I won't tell you that I ate the whole thing, or that it was as sweet and juicy as an apple, but it came much closer than I would have thought possible. When it comes to actual cooking, Mr. Barber's approach is to intensify ingredients that are pretty intense already. Looking at the saturated orange color of fat slabs of roasted carrot \"cutlet,\" I could tell it was going to taste richer and rounder than any carrot I had met before. The approach works on things that once had a pulse, too. Grass-fed, dry-aged veal, carved into a sampler of cuts, some fattier, some leaner, was ruddier and more bloody-tasting than most veal, but it still had a focused, refined taste that set it apart from beef. The caramelized outside edge of a slowly roasted neck from a Blue Hill Farm goat had a profoundly satisfying chew; the meat hiding under it was astoundingly tender and juicy. It had some of the primal pleasures of barbecue, and I wanted to tear into it with my hands. In the early days of Blue Hill, I respected the cooking but didn't want to wallow around in it the way I do now. The whole complicated web that Mr. Barber oversees has many purposes, spinning off in all directions, but if you just sit down to dinner, you can believe that the point of the entire operation is to provide you with one delicious taste after another. And maybe it is.

The concrete tops are polished smooth with beeswax, and the sides are edged with copper. The shapes look irregular, but the sides are slightly bowed so that a pair of two-tops can spoon against each other and become a four-top. \"That's the idea, anyway,\" our server said. \"But they don't all fit together.\" Blenheim is like that, too. A tremendous amount of thought and effort has gone into the food, drinks and design, but they don't always connect. This seems to have been an issue since the beginning. The first chef left about three weeks in because of what the owners called \"irreconcilable differences.\" In July, they hired Ryan Tate, who had been the chef at Le Restaurant in TriBeCa until it suddenly closed. I admired the $100 set menus he served there enough that I happily gave the place two stars in a review last year. Mr. Tate has set his ambitions even higher this time. Besides a sizable \u00e0 la carte menu, he offers a $115, nine-course tasting loaded with extra dishes. At times, his cooking is as thoughtful and transporting as it was at Le Restaurant, but with a higher degree of intricacy. At other times, the kitchen is obviously struggling to keep up. Meanwhile, the service runs the gamut from charming and slightly lost to nonexistent. On my first night there, the disparity between the two was the widest I had ever seen in any restaurant. That is not the only disconnect. When tables are set up outside next to the cobblestone streets, Blenheim looks as if its only desire is to be your drop-in-and-hang-out corner tavern. The dining room, with an antique tree saw, a wooden yoke and a whole array of carpentry tools on the walls, looks like the historical society of some upstate village, where it would be the only tourist attraction. Underlining the point, servers tell you right away that this is a farm-to-table restaurant, that ingredients are trucked in from Blenheim Hill Farm in Schoharie County, southwest of Albany, owned by Mr. Sohlberg and his wife, Min Ye. You might reasonably expect pork cutlets, creamed corn, maybe pie. Mr. Tate has other ideas. Terrific ideas, often, even if they have as much business in a rusticated farm-to-table tavern as white tie and spats. The stream in Schoharie County where tilefish and sea urchin splash around together hasn't been discovered yet, but at Blenheim they swim happily side by side on one plate. The tilefish falls into big, sweet white flakes that taste of shrimp. The urchin is whipped into a creamy, slightly briny sabayon that is like a richer, more luxurious taramosalata. Also on the plate are fat blueberries and carrots roasted in coffee bean oil. I can't explain why blueberries taste so good with sea urchin sabayon, but they do. Alaskan king crab meat had been made almost as sweet and tender as some tropical fruit, but the midnight funk of squid ink sauce brought it back to the sea. With dense roasted chanterelles and wands of naturally pickled sea bean scattered around the plate, this was an appetizer you could go quietly crazy over. And it would take a crazy person to complain that Alaskan crab and sea urchin are insufficiently farm-to-table when they're cooked this skillfully. Not that Mr. Tate turns his back on the owners' land entirely. The carrots and the chanterelles come from Blenheim Hill Farm. So does the pork loin, which is slowly roasted until it drips with juices and then sent to the table with a cast of cool Southern characters: pickled peaches, okra charred to a crisp husk, and sorghum syrup, like molasses cut with espresso. Those are Blenheim lettuces and crunchy chips of smoked Blenheim ham in the gloriously crisp and fresh salad, and that's creamy Blenheim pork fat spackling the side of the bowl. The lemon balm, thyme and pineapple sage in a sensational group of herb sorbets: Blenheim-grown. The gap between the farm-to-table ethos and Mr. Tate's style is minor compared with the gulf between the restaurant Blenheim could be and the restaurant that currently sits at 283 West 12th Street. The same dish can be stunning one night and a contorted mess on another. The first time I had the roasted king mushrooms with spaetzle and sauerkraut, the mushroom stems had something like the flavor and texture of weisswurst. A German-inspired vegetarian main course with mushrooms standing in for sausages is a fantastic notion, and I couldn't wait to taste it again when I returned. But when I did, the stems were watery inside and rubbery outside, like a steamed hot dog wrapped in a balloon. An unusual dessert soup of cooked barley and Champagne grapes in a chilled barley-jasmine tea went out of whack between visits, going from fascinating to weird. And there were glitches that were surprising in such a technique-focused kitchen. The grapefruit pearls with cured Tasmanian sea trout were meant to burst with juice, but they had solidified. Eating them was like chewing on the drippings of a grapefruit-scented candle. On Blenheim's better nights, I might have ranked the food among the most exciting and interesting I've eaten in the last year. But it came to the table so very, very slowly that it was hard to stay excited or interested. It took more than three hours one night to order and eat appetizers, main courses and desserts. I wondered if the kitchen was overwhelmed. I was sure our server was. We had to flag him down to ask for more of the soft, warm and yeasty rolls made with Cheddar and Marmite. They never came. It took two tries and about 20 minutes to get a second glass of wine. We were left alone with menus for three-quarters of an hour before we waved like drowning sailors and begged him to take our order. \"There are some additions to the menu tonight,\" he began. Additions? When the kitchen can't send out more than one course an hour, the menu needs subtractions. And Blenheim has no business offering nine-course tastings unless it is ready to provide pajamas and sleeping bags. Maybe its pieces would fit together better if there weren't so many of them. I hope so, because I'd like to see it transform itself from a puzzle to a restaurant.

Chanterelle, a downtown pioneer when it opened in 1979, was an institution by the time it went out of business , just a few months short of its 30th anniversary. Like all institutions, it had become padded by ritual, tradition and reputation. You went there to eat, of course, but you also went because it was supposed to be one of the city's greatest restaurants, holding four stars from The New York Times at various points . You went to find out whether the artist who had drawn the cover of the handwritten menu would be at the next table. You went because Karen Waltuck, the chef's wife and partner, and her ballet corps of elegant, mildly bohemian servers knew how to make you comfortable even if grand restaurants like Chanterelle weren't usually your thing. At \u00c9lan , which Mr. Waltuck opened with George Stinson north of Union Square this summer, the institutional padding is gone. Restaurants like Chanterelle have a wine directory the size and mass of the Oxford English Dictionary, but \u00c9lan's fits on four very tempting pages of reds and whites up to $105, with a short appendix of more-expensive bottles under the heading \"treat yourself.\" The one reminder of Mr. Waltuck's downtown-bohemian past is the quintuple self-portrait by Chuck Close that hangs opposite the wide concrete bar, a black curtain from which disembodied Close heads stare grimly out of the darkness, like a trick in a haunted house. The monochromatic dining room is attractive enough, but a little too bright by night when the pinpoint lights beam straight down. Look along the banquette, and you see a row of shiny, illuminated noses. A heavy framed mirror seems to be suspended by a thick white rope, which somehow makes it look less secure. It's a reasonably quiet room, friendly to conversation, but not one whose innate beauty will draw you back. There is, in other words, little in the environment for the food to hide behind. Standing out in the open, Mr. Waltuck's cooking is revealed to be as variable, as prone to peaks and valleys, as anyone else's. This may rattle the Chanterelle sentimentalists, but it seems to have liberated Mr. Waltuck. A chef with stars to defend and a reputation to maintain does what politicians do in close elections: sticks to the script, tries to stay predictable. At \u00c9lan, Mr. Waltuck gets to play. He doesn't have to ask himself whether a pair of pot stickers filled with mashed potatoes can be a four-star dish. That's a boring question. The point is that finding potatoes inside crimped pan-fried dumplings surrounded by a haze of shaved summer truffles is a funny, delicious surprise. He must be playing, too, when he stirs sea urchin into a deep bowl of guacamole. Avocado doesn't need extra creaminess, but it takes extremely well to briny seafood, as you find out when you spread some on a grease-free taro chip. Occasionally, what seems like a fun idea will land like a bag of wet laundry. Foie gras lollipops sound decadent, but the cold wad of dull liver rolled in uncrunchy pistachios is a grim treat. General Tso's sweetbreads are another game gone wrong. If the sweetbreads were ever crisp, they aren't by the time they've been stir-fried with bok choy and sloshed around in an orange-chile sauce that seemed to need more spice and citrus tang. (This dish may fall into one of my blind spots, because the Chinese takeout classic doesn't ring my doorbell, either.) Servers at \u00c9lan will announce conspiratorially that there is an \"off the menu special,\" a burger of duck and foie gras, even though it's always available. The whispered hard sell is a tired ploy to begin with, and this slightly mushy pile of meat sweetened with onion chutney and figs isn't spectacular enough to make the gimmick pay off. At times, \u00c9lan seems a little unfocused, as if Mr. Waltuck is hedging his bets by combining a grown-up bistro with a gastro pub in the crazed-carnivore style of the past decade. One of \u00c9lan's least pleasant dishes is scallop fettuccine dressed with a sauce that seems to be pure duck fat. After one forkful, I wanted a salad. Fashions have changed since Chanterelle closed, of course, but \u00c9lan is at its best when it is not trying to keep up with the youngsters. The mere sight of tea-smoked salmon on the menu may cause Asian fusion flashbacks. (Enormous Buddhas! Chopsticks as hairpins! Raw tuna served over bowls of live Siamese fighting fish!) But Mr. Waltuck's salmon is no throwback. It is silky and elegant, given a sweet-sour depth by a lightly curried tamarind sauce. The dish that made Mr. Waltuck's name, the seafood sausage in which sweet bits of scallops and shrimp are bound together by a subtle fish mousse, is back, looking hopelessly behind the times in its sauerkraut beurre blanc. Do not be fooled: It is also one of the most delicious things at \u00c9lan. I enjoyed Mr. Waltuck's steamed zucchini blossoms at Chanterelle and enjoyed them again at \u00c9lan, where they were stuffed with zucchini and Parmesan and served with slow-cooked tomatoes and very fresh, clean-tasting lemon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. With dishes that call for lightness and delicacy, \u00c9lan comes into its own. The menu changes all the time, and at every meal, one or two recipes seemed to need more time in the test kitchen. A red-wine butter sauce with striped bass was very vague, as if it needed to be reduced longer. But a special I had the same night, fluffy fish quenelles bobbing in an aromatic Thai soup, skillfully combined Mr. Waltuck's longstanding love for Asian traditions with his habit of jumping outside tradition when the mood strikes. Diana Valenzuela, the pastry chef, seems to work the same way. She will be zigging in one direction, then she'll zag left on you. Panna cotta with Concord grape jam and fragile sheets of pine-nut brittle starts like dessert but ends like a cheese course; Ms. Valenzuela makes the panna cotta from Gorgonzola. A pastis-soaked chocolate cake might have been more interesting if it hadn't been topped with an oddly waxy chocolate mousse. But a swatch of basil pastry cream is an unexpected and excellent addition to blueberries in a thin, crisp corn-flour tart shell. Ms. Valenzuela's desserts are just right for a restaurant that takes the predictability out of tradition.

They'll call us.\" This was the grim report from inside the latest East Village restaurant to have turned its no-reservations policy into a viral marketing campaign. A small, hungry mob was gathering on the sidewalk. Hoping to find a pleasant place to drink and snack until the phone rang, I herded my group to Huertas, a new Basque-leaning tapas place a few blocks away. The room smelled like garlic and smoke. A cured pig's leg sat at the end of the bar, its ankle held tightly in a clamp. A sharp knife had exposed its interior architecture of meat and fat and sinew. Later, we ordered a few slices of this Iberico ham, and as it melted on our tongues, warm and salty, we all traded looks. We did it again when we ate crumbly shards of aged manchego that tasted of brown butter and caramel. The looks meant: This kitchen knows where to get the good stuff. That applied to many things we ate that night. Jonah Miller, Huertas's chef, has written a concise menu of Basque-inspired tapas, not all of which could be called cooking and a fair amount of which is canned. I am not revealing any secrets here. Some food is still in its can when it comes to the table, like the dense mackerel in olive oil, which we ate, happily, on sliced baguettes with piment\u00f3n aioli. \"All the best Basque seafood goes straight into cans,\" our server told us, and she was so convincing that we asked if she knew a store that sold these marvelous cans. She did. She also knew where we could buy the manchego, which she was as excited about as we were. From the front door to the table, our service had been proactively friendly and enthusiastic. In New York, servers who learn that night's menu are rare enough; here was one who seemed to know everything about every ingredient. She told us about a restaurant in San Sebasti\u00e1n, where the chef had come out of the kitchen to point out the most delicious parts of a turbot, showing her how to scoop out his favorite part, the cheeks. Then she took a deep breath and said: \"Spain, you guys.\" It wasn't all cans and hams in Mr. Miller's kitchen, not that I would have minded. We asked for something called Huertas rotos, which turned out to be the Basque dish huevos rotos interpreted as a kind of pasta dish. Skinny threads of potato were cooked al dente and tossed with chorizo and its oil, with a soft-cooked egg on top. It was gone in 30 seconds. We drank vermouth, made on site, while every few minutes somebody came around with a tray of small bites straight from the kitchen. There was egg salad on a slice of baguette, with a sweet red shrimp on top; a golden croqueta of rice with creamy mushrooms in the center; and sweet roasted piquillo peppers stuffed with a cheesy, porky froth of fresh sausage whipped into goat cheese. These came in single servings that you could take or decline, depending on how good they looked and how hungry you were. Each plate you took was marked down on a card, dim-sum style, by servers. Huertas calls these items pintxos, a Basque term for snacks smaller than tapas and pinned together with a toothpick. In Spain, pintxos do not circulate like dim sum. (Mr. Miller got the idea from State Bird Provisions in San Francisco.) Yet we felt much closer to the Spanish tapas-bar spirit than if we had ordered 10 or 15 \"small plates meant for sharing\" at once, passed them around the table and called it dinner. This is rarely a satisfying way to eat, but it's how many Spanish restaurants in New York deal with tapas. The Huertas modified dim-sum approach was perfect for people like us, who want to start with drinks and see how the night goes without being forced to turn tapas into dinner. The way this night went was that by the time the other restaurant called, we didn't want to leave. I went back to Huertas a week or two later. I had made reservations for the small, square back dining room, where Mr. Miller serves a set menu for $55. In the front room, the plates are unconnected episodes, and you supply the narrative yourself. In the back, you settle in while Mr. Miller tells a story in five courses. He started with a nod to the front room, a plate of little bites. There were gildas, found in every tapas bar in San Sebasti\u00e1n, sharp, clean and salty skewers of white anchovy threaded with spicy green pepper and an olive. There was a blistered mound of Padr\u00f3n peppers and garlic shrimp on toothpicks, too, not the sweetest or firmest I'd ever eaten. This was an anomaly; in general, the cooking at Huertas stands out for its pure, fresh flavors. Then a separated egg. The white, fried, lay under a jumble of corn and tomatoes cooked quickly with crisp-chewy piment\u00f3n-cured bacon. The yolk, raw, sat on top and served as sauce. Next was skate, sweet and still a little juicy inside, with roasted turnips and a pale-green, herbaceous sauce of pur\u00e9ed turnip greens and fennel. The seasonal Greenmarket aesthetic was familiar to me. Would any Basques recognize the dish? They would know the next course, wonderful garlic-and-piment\u00f3n-scented lamb hot dogs called chistorra, even though they would be used to seeing chistorras made with pork or beef. Alongside these house-made sausages, Mr. Miller had a wonderful succotash of late-summer beans. Dessert was a dream, a round and closely packed little goat-cheese cheesecake with a topping of candied almonds instead of a bottom crust. More tangy than sugary, the cake took beautifully to a sauce made from ripe nectarines. This night and a later one made it clear that dinner in Huertas's back room ranks among the best deals in town, up there with the how-do-they-do-it bargains at Contra and Delaware & Hudson. Mr. Miller shapes his menus so skillfully that it's hard to imagine wanting more. Still, once the familiar conventions of the modern tasting menu kicked in, I did steal a few looks at the front room, where a tray of hot croquetas always seemed to be going around. Maybe I wanted more spontaneity. Or maybe I just wanted a croqueta.

He looked like the boy in a tornado movie who notices that the birds have stopped singing. \"There's no music,\" he said. \"They have speakers all over the dining room, but they're not using them.\" The restaurateur Keith McNally opened Cherche Midi in June on the corner of Houston Street and the Bowery, in a neighborhood where you don't go out to dinner unless you are prepared to shout over some Pavement song the chef loved in college. But we were talking, with no recorded soundtrack, as if we were in some Continental restaurant off Sutton Place in 1964 eating veal Orloff by candlelight. This is the paradox of Mr. McNally. Food writers who were still eating applesauce through a straw when he opened his first restaurant ( the Odeon , 1980) write about him with the same reverence that music writers have for Leonard Cohen. He's \"the king of cool,\" the restaurateur who \"owns NYC.\" Yet when it comes to current dining trends, particularly those in favor downtown, Mr. McNally shows a healthy disregard, verging at times on hostility. Of the six restaurants he operates between 14th Street and Canal Street, Cherche Midi may be his most thorough repudiation of the downtown scene. It isn't just music that's missing. There's almost no view of the street. Tapas, shared plates, tasting menus, wine pairings, \"Chef recommends,\" two-hour waits for a table the size of a chessboard -- no, none of that. Nor did Cherche Midi's servers try to tell me \"how the menu works,\" as if it were some complicated and expensive piece of machinery that I was likely to break. In Mr. McNally's restaurants, chefs are rarely treated like stars. At Cherche Midi, two men, Shane McBride and Daniel Parilla, share the work and the credit. As a result, perhaps, their cooking is almost egoless; it's not about what they want. It's about what you want, especially if that happens to be red meat and French wine. The prime rib may be the only dish at Cherche Midi that could be accused of trying to make an impression. The dark, roasted edges had the irresistible intensity of the bark on great barbecued brisket, even on the night they were aggressively salted. Lending this slab of dry-aged beef a bit of finesse is the side dish of pommes souffl\u00e9es, like inflatable potato chips or, as one guest said, \"gluten-free beignets.\" The menu gives three more main-course slots to beef. Steak frites does a fine impersonation of a Parisian bistro steak, the kind you don't mind chewing and chewing between glasses of the house Beaujolais Villages, served at Cherche Midi in an $18 carafe. Filet mignon au poivre is far more tender, of course, with less sacrifice in flavor than usual. The tall, compact, rather lean, drip-free and wholly excellent burger is made from dry-aged prime rib; if you put your nose close enough, you can smell the meat locker right through the aroma of onion-bacon jam. All three dishes come with dark, skinny fries. Cherche Midi is so good with beef that even the best of the other main courses may register as a half step down: a pot of fat, clean mussels with bits of preserved lemon clinging to them; a roast chicken done right; a salade ni\u00e7oise that pays attention to the last detail, including, in a wonderful departure from tradition, the pile of smashed potato salad at the bottom of the bowl. Here and there, the kitchen tends to overembellish. The decent roasted salmon comes with a lentil salad that tries to do too many things at once, and limp white stewed onions and fennel did not give skate Grenobloise (billed as meuni\u00e8re) anything that it really needed. It would be nice, too, to taste the meat under the aggressive seasoning in the steak tartare appetizer, given the chefs are clearly buying good beef. At least it made a strong impression, which is more than I can say for the $18 heirloom tomato salad. Heirlooms from where, exactly? Food Emporium? Still, unless you are coming to Cherche Midi to commune with the essence of summer, it is a good enough salad. The desserts are much better than that. The floating islands, the mocha pot de cr\u00e8me, the small pink raspberry souffl\u00e9 hovering above a bed of warm berries -- the lineup is one argument after another for bringing back old-fashioned pleasures. After a recent tour of all his restaurants, I think Mr. McNally's great talent may be knowing which things are worth worrying about and which can get by with being just good enough. At Morandi , the main courses were almost impressive in their mediocrity, but the pasta was just swell, which may be all the place needs to keep its chairs full. The short-rib patty melt was the only good dish on a table full of disappointments at Schiller's Liquor Bar , but I enjoyed myself more than I have at far better restaurants. There is a limit, though, and Balthazar is approaching it. The cooking, under Mr. McBride, has become utterly mundane, a pretty but flavorless imitation of French food of the kind found at any generic fake bistro. Cherche Midi's salade ni\u00e7oise is delicious from start to finish; Balthazar's is a bowl of ingredients that can't remember what they're supposed to taste like. How can the same chef and the same restaurateur be responsible for both? Mr. McNally does worry about service, which at Cherche Midi manages to be everywhere without crossing the line to helicopter waitering. And, of course, he worries about the interiors. Cherche Midi's is lovely. Outside is a dystopian intersection. You'd never know it in the dining room, which feels intimate, almost private, although of course every face is on display, bathed in light the color of apricot jam. For three decades, Mr. McNally has been rooting around in the same Lego kit: distressed mirrors, chipped subway tiles, bottles backlighted to look like stained glass. In his hands, these well-worn tricks give restaurants the battered nobility of a vintage Saab. When anyone else tries, they end up with a 1986 Ford Escort. Sets and lighting will never be the whole show.

To know where we are, do you need to see the smeared pitchers of schmaltz on every table? Smell the chopped garlic on every steak? Hear the yip of the small child whose head hits the ceiling as he is hoisted on a chair by adults drunk on \"Hava Nagila\" and Stolichnaya? Did you think the person commanding the imaginary visitors from North Korea to get up and dance the hora was the ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel of Per Se? No, the only possible setting is Sammy's Roumanian Steakhouse , the most wonderful terrible restaurant in New York. What happens at Sammy's doesn't happen at other restaurants, and vice versa. The rest of the Lower East Side can obsess over filament light bulbs and salvaged barn beams; Sammy's, virtually unchanged since opening in 1975, will be ready when fluorescents and drop ceilings make their triumphant return to fashion. Inside the dining room, lighted like a bail bondsman's office in Detroit, are hundreds of faded business cards, yellowed newspaper clippings and curled snapshots taped and tacked to every surface. Outside on Chrystie Street, scaffolding obscures the faded red and yellow painted signs in front of the building, which looks as if it has been marked for demolition. Like a Mississippi juke joint, Sammy's seems to have been put together under the theory that nobody is likely to stay sober long enough to inspect the d\u00e9cor. (Known for selling vodka bottles encased in ice, Sammy's is New York's original bottle-service restaurant, and still the only tolerable one.) Other steakhouses can drive themselves crazy over internal temperatures. At Sammy's, the meat will be cooked. If you have something more specific in mind, if you want it medium or black and blue, then write your request on a sheet of paper, tear it into small pieces and throw them into the air when the piano player sings \"Happy Birthday.\" Two times I asked for garlic-smeared skirt steak, called Romanian tenderloin at Sammy's, cooked medium rare. One steak arrived medium well, and the other time a single steak ranged from well done to bloody, and every degree in between. I wasn't asked how I wanted a broiled veal chop. It was seared on the outside and raw inside, the way other places serve tuna. When nobody asked how I wanted sweetbreads broiled, I feared the worst. Another surprise: Scored and blackened on top, they were close to perfect. The servers follow a template unique to this restaurant, too, dressed in Sammy's T-shirts and jeans with a dishrag swinging from one pocket. Speed trumps ceremony. Standing over a metal bowl of chopped liver, they pour a cascade of schmaltz from on high, go at the liver with forks to mix in the shredded radishes, fried onions and lumps of fried chicken skin, and do not necessarily notice the stray bits that escape the bowl and land on the table. The ritual ends, not with \"bon app\u00e9tit\" or \"enjoy your meal\" but with, \"O.K., start eating.\" The classic style of waiting tables at Lower East Side Jewish restaurants, by turns cranky, funny and crankily funny (discerning one from another could take decades of practice) probably died with Ratner's, but flashes of it still surface at Sammy's. One night, when we kept asking our server if we'd ordered enough, he rolled his eyes, checked his watch and said, \"Tell you what: If you're still hungry, the Chinese food will be here at 9:30.\" Hungry we weren't. As always at Sammy's, I walked out feeling as if I had eaten a football stuffed with chicken fat and beef. The kitchen, so unpredictable when it comes to meat temperatures, is absolutely consistent in its ability to produce starch that detonates inside the stomach. The fried kreplach are grenades of dough with a tiny core of chopped meat that tastes like dough, too. The latkes are flavorless and textureless, but not weightless. Better than either, the kishke could stand some gravy and some salt. In fact, with the exception of the grandmotherly sweet-and-sour stuffed cabbage, almost everything at Sammy's needed salt. Once it was added freely, the chopped liver was beyond reproach, the skirt steaks and lamb chops were excellent, and the fried silver-dollar potatoes were worth talking about. I can't figure out why Sammy's is cutting back on sodium after all these years, unless it is suddenly trying to atone for decades of treating schmaltz as a dietary supplement. The menu is less distinctively Romanian than it once was. The last review of Sammy's in The New York Times, written by Mimi Sheraton in 1982, praised the Romanian salad of whipped eggplant with green peppers; the broiled brains; the mush steak; the pitcha, a seasoned gelatin made from calves' feet and garlic; and the baked unborn eggs. The recent menus, stapled inside manila folders as they have been since the Koch administration, haven't offered any of these specialties. This is how a culture disappears. But if Romania has faded, Sammy's is still loudly, raucously, endlessly, embracingly Jewish, a permanent underground bar mitzvah where Gentiles can act like Jews and Jews can act like themselves. One night, I went with a woman who had spent the summer in Europe, as synagogues and Jewish-owned shops burned in one city after another. In Sammy's basement, when strangers joined their hands in the air and danced between the tables, eyeing our food as they passed, I could see her grow less tense every minute. \"It feels so good to be back in a place where I can be out,\" she finally said. And if this is not your heritage -- if you aren't quite sure what is happening when the man at the keyboard belts out \"Sing us a song, you're the schmatte man\" -- the entertainers at Sammy's will still get to you. Dancing and singing along to some dumb old tune being played by a musician in the corner: This is how people had fun in the Old World, by which I don't mean just the parts of Europe where the Lower East Side's Jews came from, but also the world before amplifiers and apps and first-person-shooter video games and all the forms of entertainment that drive us into ourselves. Sammy's forces you out of yourself; I don't think there's another restaurant in New York where people talk to strangers as readily as they do here. \"Would you like me to take your picture?\" somebody at the next table asked one night. \"Do you want our seltzer charger for your egg creams?\" another asked us. As a table of about two dozen people filed out, a woman in the back called to them, \"Thank you for dancing with us!\" Is this a three-star restaurant, as Mimi Sheraton thought in 1982? By today's standards, of course not. It is closer to one. But if you need stars to tell you what to think of Sammy's, I'm not sure I want to share my seltzer charger with you. I'll give it to those nice North Korean Jews instead.

Today, that seems less like the end of an epoch than a salutary cooling-off period. If you are having trouble getting a reservation at a new place this year, odds are high that the menu is speckled with accents grave, acute and circumflex. Dirty French is turning away customers at the door. Keith McNally sent frogs' legs marching to the rescue at Cherche Midi after his pizzeria there fizzled. And just north of Washington Square Park, at an address that had started to look like a certain restaurant-killer, the doors at a new Proven\u00e7al spot called Claudette have been thrown open to reveal closely packed rattan chairs, none of them empty. Claudette's charms are many and begin with those doors, which replace the woebegone sidewalk enclosure that used to make it look as if nobody were home. Losing a few seats has made reservations harder to land, but the reward is that the doors have let in the atypically cool breezes all summer, along with a view of lower Fifth Avenue's wide, leisurely sidewalks, where somebody is always walking a bichon fris\u00e9. Inside, Claudette looks like an expensive summer rental that is being used as a French street-corner cafe. (Rattan connects the two motifs.) The beach rental aesthetic is supplied by the whitewashed tables, throw pillows and shelves lined with books that are arranged by color and separated by anonymous knickknacks. Contributing to the cafe look are the compact bar and the winning cast of aperitif cocktails, which all seem to be named after Roger Vadim's wives. Small, gentle and very appealing, the Brigitte and her cohorts cheerfully buck the trend toward potent, convoluted cocktails that don't know how to behave at the dinner table. Claudette's food follows the example of the aperitifs; it is light, approachable and unlikely to impair your ability to stand up at the end of the meal. If you are in the mood for an intelligent salad, Claudette has plenty: green beans and vinegared hearts of palm with heaps of fresh mint; a nest of freshly shredded zucchini, still crisp under its anchovy vinaigrette; a crunch-fest of raw radishes and snap peas tugged in an unexpected, intriguing direction by cumin. Even less expected was the cinnamon-laced raz al hanout spice blend dusted on the bistro-style fries. More brushes with North Africa lay ahead. Claudette makes an unleavened, layered flatbread, similar to traditional kesra, that is good when hot from the griddle, especially with a thick smear of pistou. (I couldn't see the point of another spread, the bland and expensive hummus with chopped truffles.) Gradually, it becomes clear that Claudette's chef, Wade Moises, and chef de cuisine, Koren Grieveson, have made a smart decision about Provence. Rather than treating it as if it were frozen in time and sealed off from the world -- Peter Mayle's \"A Year in Provence\" repeated forever -- they cast a few glances at the North African immigrants who live and cook there. Claudette's owners, Carlos Suarez and Mark Barak, were traveling in Provence when, like many English-speaking tourists, they fell under the sunny spell of Lourmarin. They had a charmed meal in that town at a restaurant founded by Claudette Sammut, a Frenchwoman who lived in Tunisia until the 1950s. Before it was over, they had asked her family if they could take her name back to Manhattan. They brought her bouillabaisse, too, an eccentric white version that has a puff-pastry hat and lemon juice but no tomatoes and an undetectable quantity of saffron. I was not as smitten by its tenaciously sour broth as they were. As a sauce for the monkfish, baby octopus and shellfish, it might get by, but as a soup, it lost its appeal after a few spoonfuls, and even sooner the time it was oversalted. A somewhat more successful souvenir from Lourmarin is the pieds paquets. Traditionally an all-day stew of sheep's trotters and tripe, it has been de-trottered for New Yorkers. Or, as a server with an oratorical flair put it, \"we absented the feet for cleanliness of flavor.\" What we get instead are tripe-wrapped bundles of pork shoulder braised in white wine and tomatoes. Tender but polite, they are upstaged by the grilled bread, fantastic when dunked in the expanse of rust-colored sauce. As the absented feet suggest, Claudette's exploration of Provence can be undercut by its impulse to play it safe, to water down the pastis. Braised chicken thighs on a bed of nutty toasted bulgur arrive in a tagine, but they aren't cooked in one. When servers lift the glazed lid, the mint and other aromatics don't rush into your lungs the way they would in Tangier. The tiny dab of harissa doesn't go far, either. But the chicken is moist and well browned, the sauce gets sunny Mediterranean sweetness from oranges, and for complexity and originality, the dish leaves the other main courses in the shade. After making its opening moves so gracefully, Claudette grows oddly clumsy at the end. The most reliable dessert is the pistachio cake sandwiching a layer of citrus cream, smartly accompanied by candied orange peel. But a chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me with harissa was grainy, and a supposed bread pudding of chocolate-almond croissants looked and tasted exactly like a stack of stale pastries. Most of the time, though, the kitchen does what it sets out to do, even if it seems to be holding back. If Mr. Moises and Ms. Grieveson choose to dive a bit deeper into their vision of an African-tinged Provence, they could make the Gallic revival more interesting by cleaning the dusty windows of nostalgia through which New Yorkers like to view French cuisine.

Narrow the list to those with the confidence to serve it raw, and you're probably down to one finger and one name: Dave Pasternack. The challenges of bluefish are formidable. If it isn't iced right after it's hooked, if it isn't killed and chilled properly, if too much time goes by before it arrives at the table, bluefish has a habit of tasting and smelling like discount cat food. Its flavor is strong but its flesh is soft, and when it is raw, a dull, unsteady knife can reduce it to a bruise-colored pulp. Of course I had to have it when I spotted it under the crudo section of the menu at Barchetta , which Mr. Pasternack opened in Chelsea in April. And of course it was immaculate: firm slabs of bluefish, standing at attention on a cold plate with olive oil, a few drops of lemon juice and inky green shreds of caper leaves. The rich oils melted while I chewed, and I was convinced that this particular specimen must have been slashing through the Atlantic while I had been brewing that morning's coffee. In 14 years as the chef at Esca , Mr. Pasternack has proved to be one of the city's most resourceful and skillful seafood cooks. It goes without saying that Barchetta, where Mr. Pasternack's partner is John Meadow and his chef de cuisine is Christian Goerner, is a seafood restaurant. It is a very good one at times, but not at all times. There were encouraging nights, including the one that started with raw bluefish, when I was sure that Barchetta would become one of the first places I'd send people who really love the taste of fish. And there was one when it seemed mired among all the also-rans. Inconsistency in a seafood restaurant presents a quandary. Great ones are rare enough that seafood lovers will feel a strong tug to check out Barchetta and hope for the best, but they'll also be tempted to stay away out of fear that they'll hit it on an off night. This is not a problem that plagues diners who simply want a grilled pork chop. Fish cooking tends to be an all-or-nothing game, though. An extra day between the ocean and the table or an extra minute in the saut\u00e9 pan can mean the difference between a memorable dinner and a wasted evening. The chefs who understand the factors that make that difference, and can navigate them, are in shorter supply than bluefin tuna. I knew I was in the hands of one of those chefs on my first and second meals at Barchetta. Monkfish liver was treated like foie gras, darkly seared on the outside but as wobbly as pudding within. On the side were figs roasted into a jam-jar sweetness. The idea was both obvious and inspired. The crudi were just the way I remembered them from Esca. Each fish was carved with a sushi chef's sensitivity to fish anatomy, then given only as much added flavor as it could handle. To bring out the minerality and sweetness of pink snapper, there were plum-red grains of sea salt blended with Long Island merlot. Subtle, supple halibut belly was splashed with sunflower oil that was so mild it almost wasn't there. Golden spotted bass, slightly more forceful, was given a light application of olive oil and lemon, while bluefish got a similar treatment but in the stronger dose that it needed. Main courses like wonderfully rich grilled kingfish steak, a roasted whole black sea bass and a bread-crumb-crusted hunk of pumpkin swordfish were pulled from the heat precisely at the moment their thickest sections had firmed, before they had a chance to seize up into a tough fist that would chase away their sweet oceanic juices. On the night when the kitchen seemed to fall behind the beat, though, the skin on a grilled Spanish mackerel was too severely charred and the flesh had been heated a few degrees beyond the ideal. Toasted cracked hazelnuts and orange sections helped make up for it, and the dish wouldn't have raised eyebrows in most other restaurants, but it lacked the finesse that I knew by then Barchetta is capable of. A handsome, thick cut of cobia had been left on the grill until it had the first signs of squeaky overdoneness and the grate had burned the bread-crumb coating. Raw blackfish dotted with pine-bud syrup was tougher than the crudi had been on other nights. Some greens in a relentlessly dull salad were showing their age. A bowl of pasta with mullet bottarga was swimming in olive oil that took the crunch right out of the toasted bread crumbs. A few excellent dishes surfaced from the murk, like the gently fried spearing and the appetizer of velvety marinated herring with raisins and cauliflower. The evening's most memorable dish was a grilled lamb porterhouse, though, which says less about the lamb than about the kitchen's struggles landing its catch. When dinner is less than transfixing, you have time to notice how incoherent Barchetta's dining room is. Gone are the nightclub intimacy of Bette and the Riviera sparkle of Bistro La Promenade, the last two tenants. In their place is a mishmash of ideas: old nautical flags hanging beside new art from Chelsea galleries; Danish modern chairs mixed with tan simulated leather banquettes that would suit a Midtown coffee shop. On good nights, you're more likely to notice how thoughtful the service is. Setting the tone is the outstanding rosemary focaccia that shows up while you're still scanning the menu. Assistance with the wine list, about half Italian and priced to sell, is quick to arrive, too, and unusually perceptive. The general manager and wine director, George Hock, always seemed to know what my table wanted, translating a few vague adjectives and a not-so-vague price limit into a bottle that was just what we were looking for and then some. At a fairly casual restaurant like Barchetta, wine service of this caliber is a gift. The total check, of course, is no gift, but it is very fair for fish at a place that never stoops to flabby farmed salmon. Barchetta could still turn out to be the seafood restaurant that downtown needs. If a nautical flag were flying over Barchetta's door on West 23rd Street, it would be the one that means \"Proceed, but exercise caution.\" ", "rec_dishes": ["Crudi", "charred octopus", "grilled and roasted fish", "lamb porterhouse", "fingerling potatoes with garlic", "fruit crostata."]}, {"id": 116, "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/dining/restaurant-review-bar-primi-in-the-east-village.html", "review_text": " Main courses are never as good as the starters, people like to say. I've always argued that a good chef won't let that happen, but I have to admit that it does seem true for a lot of Italian restaurants, at least in New York City. There are exceptions, of course, but as a general rule, it's all downhill after the spaghetti. One of several reasons to like Bar Primi , Andrew Carmellini 's new restaurant at East Second Street and the Bowery, is that there is almost nothing on the menu but appetizers and pasta. You can eat all the things you go to Italian places for without ordering a $35 grilled salmon simply to prove that you know fusilli is not considered a main course in Milan. Mr. Carmellini and his partners (Josh Pickard, Luke Ostrom and Sal Lamboglia) have not exactly discovered life on Mars with this concept. After all, this is the founding principle of cheap Italian restaurants across the country. It's unusual, though, to see it endorsed by a chef who knows better. Pasta is the whole point of Porsena , which the chef Sara Jenkins calls her \"pasta-centric restaurant,\" as you know if you've had the firm, chewy rings of anneloni tossed with fiery lamb sausage and bitter greens. But then her menu proceeds to a full roster of secondi. To be fair, Mr. Lamboglia, a longtime Carmellini cook who leads the kitchen at Bar Primi, does offer one main course a night on a weekly rotation. (On Wednesday, it's the Italian sausage served at Mr. Carmellini's Sausage Boss kiosks in Madison Square Garden .) Each time I was there, the servers also pushed a special, a grilled branzino \"muffaletta,\" which they said meant the fish comes with chopped green olives, like the sandwich. I ordered it once. It was fine. I preferred the pasta. The menu divides them into \"traditional\" and \"seasonal.\" We would be here for hours if I tried to figure out what is seasonal about orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe, a widely known classic from Southern Italy, or which tradition gave us spaghetti with a sauce inspired by clams casino. The important thing to notice is that there are 12 choices in all, and one of them is almost certain to be exactly what you feel like eating. For me, on almost any given night, that would be the linguine with golden bread crumbs and garlic that's been slapped around in hot olive oil for a minute or so. It may be because the kitchen is using this season's garlic, but the sliced cloves (four of them, the menu says) tasted as juicy and fresh as corn and, in their oniony way, almost as sweet. For this, I paid $14 and counted myself lucky. Spaghetti pomodoro, also $14, is just as uncomplicated and just as right, with green basil clinging to plum tomatoes cooked to the halfway point between fruit and sauce. Mr. Lamboglia makes those dishes with dried imported noodles. Most of the other pasta is fresh and very good. Its finest use may be the fiore di carciofi, a long, fat spiral filled with creamy artichoke and mascarpone. The sauce (a hot ladleful of fried bacon, garlic, chopped parsley and white wine) works mysteriously well with this mutant, vaguely flower-shaped cannelloni. Bar Primi applies its sauces more liberally than a place in Parma might. Italian verisimilitude is not the goal. Mr. Carmellini and Mr. Lamboglia, who was raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, by a father who cooked for years in restaurants on and off Mulberry Street, have given the menu a red-sauce generosity, even when the sauces aren't red. Sal's Antipasti Salad is basically an antipasto sampler of the kind usually seen on a checkered tablecloth -- sliced salami and provolone, raw celery and radishes -- thrown into a tossed salad with a small blizzard of Parmigiano-Reggiano. It's impossible to dislike. Shrimp and octopus with boiled potatoes and pickled cherry peppers make a cold seafood salad that few checkered-tablecloth joints could rival. There are even meatballs filled with melted fontina in a rough tomato sauce. You want them to taste handmade, honest and delicious. They do. Grilled broccolini dressed with stewed onions and Aleppo pepper sits on a shiny, smooth brick-colored emulsion. It looks creamy and soothing. It is fierce, fiery and garlic-drenched, a fantastic trick played by the kitchen. The menu has minor dips but no major sinkholes. That disassembled clams casino over spaghetti could do with more clams and less cleverness. The day I had orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe, the divots of dough weren't as shiny with pork fat and olive oil as they might have been. The idea for Bar Primi came to Mr. Carmellini years ago, before he left A Voce and built his fief of a half-dozen restaurants in New York and one in Miami. The chance to do it finally came along when Peels quietly shuffled out of business this year. Taavo Somer, an owner of that restaurant, was hired to rework his Peels design, mixing domestic idioms like white paneling and mullioned windows at tree-branch height with rustic Italian motifs, like wine shelves of unfinished wood. The result is an inviting, civilized spot, one that reaches back over the Bowery's skid-row period to the brief age when the East Village was on Edith Wharton's map of New York society. Within Mr. Carmellini's fleet, Bar Primi is more a neighborhood hangout in the spirit of the Dutch than a big, booming circus like Locanda Verde or Lafayette . Like all of those places, and unlike the stereotypical linguine slinger, Bar Primi has a deeply affordable wine list you could happily get lost in. Off topic for a linguine slinger but very much on topic for a hangout, there is at all hours a great hot roast beef sandwich, shaved thin and kicked into action with spicy red pepper sauce. So sure of itself it is known simply as the Sandwich, it deserves to join the venerable epitomes of the genre found at Brennan & Carr and Roll-n-Roaster in Brooklyn. New Yorkers who have watched Mr. Carmellini's game throughout his career may complain that he now rarely drives to the basket for the spectacular dunks he used to throw down when he was coached by Daniel Boulud. I made that complaint myself about the unimaginative, stubbornly un-French cooking at Lafayette when it opened. But a well-timed layup like Bar Primi can win games, too.

Nothing on his gracefully composed plates was chewier or crunchier or softer or saltier than it wanted to be. Mr. Glocker's kitchen chops were not exactly a surprise, given that he worked in Vienna for Heinz Reitbauer, in Chicago for Charlie Trotter and in London and New York for Gordon Ramsay , none of them ever known to have smiled indulgently at a young cook and said: \"Don't worry about burning those onions, kid. The customers won't notice.\" Technical prowess is a fine thing for a chef to have, but it's no guarantee of memorable, expressive cooking, just as a big vocabulary doesn't necessarily mean an author will write books worth reading. In both cases, you need to have something to say. Mr. Glocker has many things to say, and he says them clearly and with charm, as I learned over three excellent meals since B\u00e2tard opened in May. Some dishes were so successful they seemed destined never to leave the menu. One was the springtime-sweet bowl of minted pea soup with fried sweetbreads that seemed more flavorful than anybody else's sweetbreads. Another was a kind of bouillabaisse in which rabbit (a roasted loin, a perfectly cooked kidney and saffron ravioli with a light and delicately herbed rabbit filling) splashed around in the tomato-fennel-saffron broth. A month later, both dishes had been retired, and in their place was something new and just as wonderful. A fried zucchini flower, filled with bits of poached prawns and served with lightly candied lemon zest and whole pieces of poached lobster, was a full immersion in summer, a swim in a clear pond in the pines. A slab of octopus terrine, small circles of leg pressed together with smoky pastrami spices and dabbed with whole-grain mustard, evoked an entirely different terrain, nodding to the delicatessen, though the nuggets of braised ham hock, as rich and seductive as tuna belly, won't be found at Katz's. The complexity of Mr. Glocker's plates never blurs the focus of his flavors. Every drop of sauce and pinch of seasoning extracts some new pleasure out of the main ingredient. There is joy in his cooking. There are high spirits in B\u00e2tard's dining room, too, which hums and at times roars with the sound of people having a fine night on the town. This was not frequently heard during this restaurant's last incarnation , Corton . Everyone whispered as if a baby were sleeping in the next room. Even Drew Nieporent, the avuncular saloonkeeper who has held the lease on this address since he opened it as Montrachet in 1985, seemed to tread across Corton's carpet on tiptoes. The carpet is gone. Mr. Nieporent and his partners in B\u00e2tard, Mr. Glocker and John Winterman, last seen as ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel at Daniel , had it replaced with herringbone floorboards. The white tablecloths have been whisked away, too. The architect Glen Coben gently raised the temperature on the interior that Stephanie Goto designed for Corton, which was elegant but aloof, more like a modern-art gallery than a restaurant. The walls that lean in and their twirling vines in bas-relief are flush with a tobacco-resin hue borrowed from Keith McNally's crayon box. Banquettes that had been covered with scallion-green fabric are now dark leather and mohair. If the bare tables and floors weren't enough to raise the decibel level, the amount of drinking going on would. Mr. Glocker's cooking plays well with others, and his flexible \u00e0 la carte menu, with a choice of two courses ($55), three ($65) or four ($75), encourages you to get to know a bottle or two. For some drinkers, it will be impossible not to order Burgundy at a restaurant called B\u00e2tard, and Jason Jacobeit, the head sommelier, is happy to oblige. Swimming alongside the white whales, the La T\u00e2che and Roman\u00e9e-Conti grand crus, are some lesser-known Burgundies at what are, by the region's standards at least, reasonable prices. (The list, however, needs more bottles under $60, no matter where they come from.) Nonconformists will find blue-chip Napa Valley wines and a deep pocket of whites from Alsace, Germany and Austria, where Mr. Glocker was born. B\u00e2tard is hardly a cruise down the beautiful blue Danube, but the kitchen can give you an excellent Viennese dinner in the form of the Poussin schnitzel, a special in perpetuity, and the Sacher torte, a special on occasion. Both are classical, the chef's fingerprints visible only in details like the mouthwatering sea buckthorn jam and unaccountably exciting potato salad with the schnitzel. When B\u00e2tard begins serving food at the bar, I suspect that every stool will be taken by a schnitzel-eater. Full of ideas, Mr. Glocker comes up with the desserts, too. His caramelized milk bread with berries and brown-butter ice cream is already a certified hit, the song of the summer that radio failed to provide this year. A slice of white bread, rich like brioche, has been glazed on both sides with a shatteringly thin shell of melted sugar. It looks like the simplest thing in the world, but if it's so simple, why isn't everyone making it? Other desserts are good, but not so good that the restaurant can do without a full-time pastry chef forever. The flat-footed key lime pie should be repaired or replaced, and the poached fruit in a moat of sparkling wine was a little too Ladies Who Lunch for me. Mr. Winterman, the general manager, has put together a lovely little cheese cart, although he hasn't figured out how to show it off. \"We have several goat cheeses,\" my server said one night. \"Some cheese from France, of course. Some cheese from Vermont.\" Finding this picture a little vague, I asked to see them. This seemed to catch him off guard. \"I could bring the cart over,\" he said, \"but it would be a little tight with these tables.\" The cheeses are much too good to be stranded on a landlocked cart. For now, you have to rely on Mr. Winterman to choose, and hope you've come on a night when he has the honey made by downtown bees who do their buzzing above a Shoegasm store. There is another dance routine that needs practice. Maybe somebody imagined it would be fun for customers who get the vast, pink, terrific lamb chop to serve themselves lamb confit out of flame-colored Le Creuset pots. It's an awkward fishing party. The confit is some kind of new achievement in flavor and tenderness, but to get it out of the pot, you have to lift your butt off the seat. A few cards have yet to fall into place, but Mr. Glocker and Mr. Winterman are reshuffling the deck to get a fresh combination of refined and relaxed dining, a game Mr. Nieporent has played for years. One night, Mr. Winterman showed me a cross-section of a tree trunk. (Neither he nor Mr. Nieporent pretended not to recognize me.) He thinks it would be fun to drag it out to the dining room and let customers test their skill at Hammerschlagen, a game Germans play with a hammer and nails. If the baby isn't awake yet, that should do the trick.

I am. An old farm recipe, green tomato pie was new to me when I ate a small wedge of it at a very likable Brooklyn restaurant called Delaware and Hudson two weeks ago. Now I can't stop thinking about it. Double-crusted like an apple pie, bobbing between sweet and savory, it had the herbaceousness and tang of unripe tomatoes and the very old-timey flavor of molasses and brown sugar. The ingredients combined in ways that had me tasting spices that weren't, in fact, in there. Patti Jackson, the restaurant's chef and owner, called the recipe \"an agglomeration of Pennsylvania Dutch and Shaker pies, stuff that's always interested me.\" At this point, it's hard to find a New York chef who doesn't cook with ingredients from the mid-Atlantic, but ones who draw on the region's recipes are much more unusual. Delaware and Hudson, which opened in May, looks the part of the contemporary Brooklyn restaurant that preaches all things local and seasonal. The tables are bare wood. The ceiling rafters are exposed. Pickle jars sit above the kitchen door. The walls are pinned with glamour shots of farmers' market bins piled with strawberries and purple-tipped asparagus. The restaurant stands out from the pack, though, in part because Ms. Jackson draws on the traditions of long-gone Americans who would have been amazed to hear that farm-to-table would become a slogan one day. Old-time regional recipes (\"from Baltimore to Buffalo,\" says a sign by the door) flit on and off her weekly menus. They don't define the restaurant's cooking, though. Ms. Jackson does. Her four-course $48 set menus are drawn from her life, and their personal point of view helps make Delaware and Hudson so winning. She grew up in Clarks Summit, Pa., close enough to Pennsylvania Dutch country to know how a fresh pretzel ought to taste. You'll know, too, because the first thing to land on the table after you choose your main course is a galvanized pail of hot pretzel rolls, boiled in lye and studded with white salt crystals, like Amish rhinestones. The chewy, yeasty pretzels were wonderful smeared with ramp butter or a green mash of fava hummus that came out alongside breakfast radishes and crisp, cool slices of fennel. Putting herself through culinary school in Baltimore, Ms. Jackson cooked at the Harvey House restaurant for Rose Baumel, known to all as Miss Rose. \"Miss Rose was in the kitchen every single day in a housekeeper's dress,\" she recalled. \"She did all the money and all the liquor, and when it was time to do the crab cakes, all the guys in the kitchen would prepare separate parts of it for her and she would go off in a corner and secretly mix it all together.\" Ms. Baumel's precise formula probably disappeared along with the restaurant's sign, a rabbit in purple neon, but the young cooking student watched closely enough to have her own ideas. Delaware and Hudson served Miss Rose's crab cakes in June on top of hollandaise with purslane leaves. They were precisely the golden pan-fried patties of clean white crab meat, just barely holding together, that I see whenever I look at a blue crab. Pretzel rolls followed by three other small dishes, like the crab cakes or a hungry farmhand's salad of string beans and creamy new potatoes in vinegar and warm bacon fat, are the appetizer course. Next comes handmade pasta, and dinner suddenly veers toward Italy. This is inconsistent with the stated theme of the restaurant, but consistent with the life of Ms. Jackson. She was the chef at a string of Italian restaurants in Manhattan -- Le Madri , I Trulli and Centovini -- and she knows her way around a pasta roller. In June, sweet pea ravioli had delicate thin-skinned wrappers, perfectly formed little flying saucers in a butter sauce with slivers of Virginia ham. Her fresh spaghetti in a quick sauce of ripe tomatoes and basil dotted with milky ricotta got the dish, which often goes wrong, exactly right. Ms. Jackson's food doesn't have the buzz-cut professionalism of some restaurant food, which seems to have been produced by Adderall-chewing line cooks who practice their brunoise in front of a mirror while listening to \"Eye of the Tiger.\" Her cooking has a more relaxed, informal air. This is its charm and sometimes its weakness, too. Earthy and delicious noodles made from einkorn wheat and fresh herbs were clumped together one night, as if the noodles had not been sauced soon enough. A vegetarian main course called corn mush was as dense and bland as a bowl of hot cereal you made at breakfast and forgot about until lunch. Corn pudding was a nicer variation on this idea, sweet kernels of corn baked into a soft, custardy dome of cornmeal. But the ratatouille served with it wasn't the usual soft, sweet melting pot of summer; the vegetables were still half-crisp and noticeably bitter. These slumps may soften my recommendation, but they weren't enough to knock any of my meals seriously off-track. Any bad impressions were wiped out by a half-dozen good ones, by a duck breast with rhubarb or a hunk of wild striped bass with yellow cherry tomatoes cooked just until they wilted. Servers were stiff in the beginning, marching around with one hand awkwardly ratcheted up behind their backs as if their wrists were attached to bungee cords, but they are more at ease now, giving the restaurant a friendliness that can make you think you have traveled much farther than 10 steps from Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg. Then, a pair of desserts, small and homey, like a warm button of steamed chocolate cake next to a miniature peach shortcake. Why two desserts? Why four appetizers? I think it's the generosity implied by the out-of-print cookbooks Ms. Jackson reads, by the spirit of places like the Harvey House, by the old way of cooking to fill people up and make them happy at the same time. Finally, a plate of four mignardises arrives. There may be a chocolate-caramel candy and a one-bite macaron infused with the taste of ripe Tristar strawberries. The plate is always delivered by Ms. Jackson with the smile good cooks have when they know everyone will leave the table happy.

But if domestic intimacy is rare at Giada, the restaurant that the Food Network star Giada De Laurentiis opened in June inside the Cromwell Las Vegas hotel, there is little doubt whose place it is. Ms. De Laurentiis is invoked so often that it can seem she wants you to feel as if you're in her museum. The board of flatbread and grissini is announced as \"Giada's bread selection,\" and the plate of thumbprint and \"mega-chip\" cookies is \"Giada's cookie selection.\" \"Giada\" is stenciled on a large pink canvas that hangs on a wall. Her words, familiar to her television audience, are even repeated in six chandeliers around the dining room, cut out in silhouette so that light beams from behind: \"I eat a little bit of Everything and not a lot of Anything.\" As a quotation for posterity, this is not exactly \"Et tu, Brute?\" But it may describe Ms. De Laurentiis's philosophy for the food at Giada. All of it is in a relaxed, approachable California-Italian mode, and none of it is very hard to leave on the plate. A medium-size twirl of flaccid bucatini in bland fresh tomato sauce ($24) made the case against the common view that simple food is the best. The margherita pizzette ($10), soft as a Parker House roll and covered with mozzarella that had the pale-yellow color and elusive flavor of processed cheese, might have come from the children's menu of any restaurant in America except an Italian one. Sold as \"Giada's signature dish,\" the chicken cacciatore for two ($55) was a puzzle whose pieces didn't fit. First, a server brought out a pan with a trussed and roasted chicken, colorful peppers, cipollini onions and mushrooms. This was taken away. What was served sometime later was a stack of browned, dry chicken pieces that seemed to have no relationship to the original bird, along with a dish of tomato sauce made from some vegetables, but not (as far as I could tell) the ones I had seen earlier. Something was missing here -- maybe the commercial that on television would have run between the first chicken and the second. In May, two weeks before Giada was scheduled to serve its first meal, Ms. De Laurentiis fired her executive chef. She has been looking for a permanent replacement ever since, but the restaurant stays open. The ideal candidate should have experience with pizza and pasta.

Mio Ogasawara, the chef and a native of Japan, set a drum of coconut panna cotta in a wineglass, and surrounded it with buttons of mango mousse, balls of cantaloupe sorbet and bananas she had caramelized with a blowtorch. She covered the glass with something that looked like a coaster. Then, raising a pitcher that stood on little feet with red toenails, she poured hot mango syrup over the top. The sauce pooled and spread and was about to cascade over the edge when the coaster, made from white chocolate, melted away and dropped into the glass. At that point, I couldn't remember all the ingredients in this sweet tropical magic trick, but it was too late to check the menu. I had dipped it in raspberry sauce and eaten it. Of all the surprises that made my meal at Sweets Raku so entertaining, perhaps the most interesting was its location: a shopping plaza about two miles from the Las Vegas Strip, in the sprawling and still-growing Chinatown area. It is one of many excellent, intimate restaurants that have sprung up in the last two or three years far from the leviathan casinos where celebrated chefs have made the city a global dining destination. In a recent week spent restaurant hopping around this city, I was drawn back by remarkable meals in Chinatown again and again. I was well fed downtown, too, where little independent restaurants and cloistered cocktail lounges are helping that historic area climb back from years of decay. Every day, I would leave my hotel in the City Center complex for some other part of town, eat a couple of lunches followed by a dinner or two, then return to my hotel bed. I believe this makes me the first person in history who went to the Las Vegas Strip to sleep. When I did hike along the mountain range of glass towers, pyramids, Roman arcades and Manhattan skyscrapers on Las Vegas Boulevard, I kept seeing famous chefs used as advertisements for no-holds-barred indulgence. Giant photographs of Daniel Boulud and Thomas Keller hang from the Doge's Palace at the Venetian . At the Paris , a huge scrim superimposes the Arc de Triomphe with the scowling face and crossed arms of Gordon Ramsay. Seeing Europe's great monuments repurposed as billboards was almost enough to make me wonder why we fought World War II. For a taste of food that wasn't advertising anything other than itself, I veered off the Strip. The distinctive, original new restaurants there tended not to be ones imported from far away but ones grown here in the desert. They were built by and feed the year-round residents whose numbers have been climbing at a healthy clip since the housing-market crisis. The population of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, grew by nearly 4 percent from 2010 to 2013, and now stands at more than two million, according to the latest Census Bureau estimates. Many of those new arrivals come from Mexico, as evidenced by the tiny taquerias sprouting up around the city, and from a host of Asian countries. To get to Sweets Raku, I had driven past block after block of strip-mall restaurants: Hong Kong-style seafood houses, Filipino family restaurants, Korean barbecue grills and Vietnamese sandwich shops. Then there were the Japanese places: izakayas, sake bars, ramenyas, curry and tonkatsu specialists. Sweets Raku occupies a space on Spring Mountain Road, Chinatown's main drag, in a mall called Seoul Plaza. The name is as imprecise as Chinatown's. Seoul Plaza has become a one-stop-shopping destination for excellent Japanese food since 2008, when the chef Mitsuo Endo, who also owns Sweets Raku, opened Aburiya Raku, an exquisite yakitori grill. Aburiya Raku has won a measure of national recognition, but I knew it deserved even more with my first bite of Mr. Endo's oyaji tofu, as rich and fluffy as ricotta, served with a sauce of dried chiles and fried garlic so good I ate it with a spoon. Everything that passed over Mr. Endo's glazing-hot charcoal was seasoned and cooked with spooky precision, from flaky white yellowtail belly to the tender kurobuta pork cheek that made me think all the pork-belly worshipers are eating the wrong end of the pig. In 2012, a friend of Mr. Endo's opened Kabuto , a traditional Edo-style sushi bar across the plaza. This spring, he handed the chef's position over to Ken Hosoki, who was carving delicate sheets of rarely seen species like hairtail when I arrived while another chef rubbed a wasabi root on sharkskin. I wasn't thrilled with the overcooked omelet or the menu format, which forced me to take some lackluster grilled items I didn't want to get the sashimi that I did. But the sashimi turned out to be exceptional, skillfully chosen to bring out contrasts in texture and fat, and the nigiri was very good as well. My grudge against the menu softened with the last course, a sorbet made from the citrus called sudachi by Sweets Raku. For years, the one restaurant that justified a taxi ride away from the Strip for many visitors was Lotus of Siam , specializing in northern Thai cuisine. Two years ago, a manager and sommelier from Lotus of Siam named Bank Atcharawan struck out on his own to open Chada Thai & Wine . He placed it in another Chinatown plaza that he shares with one of the few North American restaurants serving the lamb-centric cuisine of China's Shaanxi Province. Chada's menu is shorter than Lotus's, the portions more dainty, but the cooking struck me as more exact and polished after one meal at each. The flavors at Chada tilt toward southern Thailand, as in the stunningly fine coconut-based crab curry served with nests of rice vermicelli. Quail eggs fried into little bull's-eyes were topped with dried shrimp and set in a superbly focused lime-chile dressing. A tamarind-chile dipping sauce that hit every flavor on the grid at once was sensational with chewy oddments of pork called lo-ba in Phuket. Has anyone in Phuket ever chased pigs' ears with Eric Bordelet's sparkling pear cider from Normandy? Mr. Atcharawan has priced the wine list to encourage experiments like that, with many bottles around $40. Like Raku, Chada stays open until 3 a.m., the better to ensnare cooks and servers on their way home from the Strip. Workers in the celebrity-chef restaurants, whether they stay for a year or decide to settle down, help many off-Strip restaurants stay in business. Sometimes they do more than that. In June, the chef Kerry Simon opened Carson Kitchen in the John E. Carson Hotel, a former flophouse downtown. Mr. Simon runs restaurants in casinos on and off the Strip, but Carson Kitchen has a personal point of view that's hard to find in dining rooms located within sight of the slot machines. On a chef's counter facing the kitchen, a glass urn labeled \"Swear Jar\" is quickly filling up with dollar bills. It's hard to imagine a swear jar on the Strip, where nothing is supposed to get in the way of the implicit message that everything is permitted. Mr. Simon, who recently learned that he has a severe form of Parkinson's disease, installed Matt Andrews as executive chef. The menu of small plates is antic and border-crossing in a way that could be awful or great. It turns out to be mostly great. A vertical caprese salad deserved sweeter tomatoes, but the gyro tacos were fantastic, with grilled pita instead of a tortilla, holding spiced lamb that spills juice as you eat it. Veal meatballs in a rich, camel-colored sauce of foie gras and sherry played the high-low comfort food game as well as any dish I've come across. The John E. Carson Hotel might have joined the vast graveyard of boarded-up hotels on and around Fremont Street if not for the Downtown Project. A $350 million effort to bring back the city's original core without demolishing it -- Las Vegas's usual solution to aging buildings -- the Downtown Project bought the hotel in 2012 and rents commercial space for $2 a square foot. One block from the resurrected hotel is Eat, another child of the Downtown Project. If I were staying nearby, I'd start every day with Eat's biscuits in strawberry sauce, an ingenious way to turn breakfast into dessert, and come back at lunch for corned beef hash, the real article, chopped by hand, a treat any time you can find it. And I would escape the afternoon sun on Fremont Street for a bottle of Beerlao Dark at Le Thai, a tiny room outfitted like a Bangkok pub. Le Thai, open since 2011, won't expand anyone's notions of Thailand's cuisine the way Chada or Lotus of Siam can, but among more routine stuff, I came across two finds worth seeking out: the deep-fried chunks of pork jerky, to be picked up with a wad of sticky rice and swabbed in spicy nam prik, and the woozily rich fried rice with bits of sweet and full-flavored short rib. More out-of-towners have been finding their way downtown lately, and places like Carson Kitchen should help. Far fewer make it to Summerlin, in the city's west end, an area rich in chain restaurants. That's why I was interested in Honey Salt . It opened there two years ago, owned by Kim Canteenwalla, a chef who has worked on and off the Strip, and his wife, Elizabeth Blau, a consultant who helped lure Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Michael Mina and many other chefs to the Strip. She and Mr. Canteenwalla were key figures in making Las Vegas a stop on the food-tourism route, and I wanted to see how they were treating the locals. Very well, it turned out. Honey Salt doesn't have pirate ship battles or indoor roller coasters. It's just a restaurant, with paintings by Ms. Blau's sister and cooking that's seasonal, up-to-date and refreshingly free of drama, like the summer salad of greens with honey-roasted peaches and the appetizer of fried squid and tender soft-shell clams with shishito peppers. If you're lucky, you have a place like this in your neighborhood. Honey Salt doesn't try to compete with the casino restaurants, but as a downstream effect of the Strip's high-end scene, it's an emblem of where the rest of Las Vegas is moving these days.

The camera will pan majestically across \"The Art of the Slurp,\" Nathan Fox's manga-style strip that hangs over the counter and starts with a fat boy in a Batman mask snapping his chopsticks apart, as a narrator intones: \"In 2014, Ivan Orkin, a Long Island native who grew famous cooking ramen in Tokyo, opened his flagship restaurant on the Lower East Side.\" The plucking of a samisen fades out; punk guitar chords clang; the screen is filled with a close-up of a noodle bowl. \"Developed in Japan around the turn of the 21st century, mazemen is a drier variation on ramen, more like pasta than soup. Mr. Orkin dressed fresh whole-wheat noodles with a slab of simmered pork belly, chopped bacon and enough pork-bone stock to moisten the noodles. Then came the garlic: raw, pickled and roasted.\" Cut to a heavyset, white-haired, unshaven, downtrodden man in pajamas, identified as a former restaurant critic for The New York Times. \"Actually, there was a fourth pork and a fourth garlic in there,\" he says. \"Garlic oil and pork fat. Maybe Orkin thought \u2018quadruple pork' sounded too much like \u2018quadruple bypass.' Those ingredients could have gotten into a shouting match, but they were harmonious. It was like a summation of all the lard-wallowing and umami-slinging that had rippled through American food since the first drop of grease ran down the chin of the first customer who tried a Momofuku pork bun. I could eat a bowl of that mazemen right now, if they would let me have anything besides kale pellets.\" Get that old guy off the screen. He's bringing me down, though he's right about the triple pork triple garlic mazemen. It's an undeniably intense dish that shows how energetically and skillfully Mr. Orkin colors outside the lines of Japanese cuisine. Since Ivan Ramen opened in May, there is usually a line for the single restroom but rarely one to get in the door. Some of the pent-up steam in the ramen community may have escaped late last year, when Mr. Orkin opened Slurp Shop, in Gotham West Market. A quick-service counter with a noodle-dominated menu, Slurp Shop is a fine introduction to Mr. Orkin's ramen philosophy (essentially, make everything -- noodles, broth, droplets of fat on the surface of the soup -- better), but not to his full breadth as a chef. For that, you need to go to Ivan Ramen, where he invests in creativity well outside the scope of standard ramenyas. Mr. Orkin supplements the noodles with dishes that cover many bases, though not the sweet one just yet. Desserts are promised down the line. As suggested by a dining-room collage made of hundreds of pictures of Asian and Western pop icons and foodstuffs, Mr. Orkin's cultural allusions are quick and funny, and come from several directions at once. He makes a whacked-out vegetarian chili dog with fried tofu in place of the frank, a rich and intense stew of mushrooms and miso as the chili, and a squiggly line of American yellow mustard. (There's no substitute for yellow mustard.) Called a Tofu Coney Island, it's a joke that tastes great. That was true for the JFC, too: deep-fried chicken hearts and livers with a honey-mustard sauce that tasted similar enough to the traditional McNugget garnish to make me laugh, and different enough (sharper, stronger and enriched with ponzu) to make me want more. The Japanese borrowed ramen from China, and Mr. Orkin keeps up the custom. There is steamed Chinese broccoli with soy-pickled garlic, as well as a salad of crunchy daikon threads topped with spicy, funky XO sauce. On tables that could become laden with pork very quickly, each was a cool, welcome oasis. The pork tended to disappear as quickly as it arrived. True, the scrapple waffle, a takeoff on Japanese okonomiyaki, hadn't moved beyond the gimmick stage; it was all crisp, bland surface without the peculiar bits of fat and face that excite scrapple fans and terrify everybody else. But the improbably fluffy tofu-pork meatballs catapulted themselves into my mouth at the slightest encouragement, and little do-it-yourself handrolls of nori spread with sushi rice and pulled roast pork, as slick and rich as carnitas, were gone almost before I noticed the bright, sweet-sour relief they got from roasted tomatoes. As our server promised, roasted tomato performed the same favor for a cheese mazemen, a kind of Japanese alfredo. Servers at Ivan Ramen are always pushing add-on garnishes for the noodles for an extra $2 or $3. \"All our ramens are improved by an egg,\" we were told one night. If Mr. Orkin thinks his ramen is better with an egg, he should put an egg on it, and charge accordingly. Value is a sticky issue with ramen. Because it is served in a minute and eaten almost as quickly, it seems to call for fast-food prices. It takes more than a minute to prepare, though, particularly at Ivan Ramen, where the noodles are made in the kitchen from rye or whole-wheat flour. Springy and hearty, they are exceptional. The broths are painstakingly simmered until their flavors are deep and focused, particularly in the vegetarian ramen's soy-mushroom stock and the shio ramen's base of dashi stirred into a golden chicken soup that a grandmother might want to steal credit for. The most expensive ramen is $15, or $17 with the suggested egg. The mazemens, a form Mr. Orkin has mastered more fully than anyone in the city, justify the price. (The red-hot cold mazemen, dressed with salty, spicy sesame and accessorized with two prawns, should settle any doubts.) The soup ramens do not, at least not yet. Several times, the broth arrived well below the scalding heat that gives ramen its temporal dimension, as you race to eat the noodles before they go from slightly undercooked to al dente to overdone. The soups at Ivan Ramen barely changed, so there was no rush, no need to illustrate the art of the slurp. Maybe mine sat too long in the kitchen. The ramens shouldn't stop just short of the finish line when so many other items on the menu sail right over it.

To which I'd say: What's wrong with that? The cafe, which opened in May, is modeled on the store, to an almost obsessive degree. Backlit signs in black and white proclaim the presence of sardines, chubs, rugelach and pickles by the barrel. Below the signs are boxes of matzo and jars of chocolate-covered jelly rings. In the center of the restaurant sides of salmon and whole, golden-skinned whitefish with their slit bellies pointing up wait in a refrigerated case until they are sliced to order by a counter worker in a white jacket, just as on Houston Street. But Niki Russ Federman and her cousin Josh Russ Tupper, the fourth-generation owners of the family business , have added to, elaborated on and deviated from the store in ways that make the cafe a three-dimensional restaurant, not just a theme-park homage designed to cash in on the original's popularity. Take, for example, the rye bread. Everybody talks about good Jewish rye but hardly anyone has tasted it. To get a rye that deserved to share the table with their smoked fish, the owners imported a baker from Massachusetts known for his artisan loaves, Gordon Weissman. His rye is dense and rugged, with a crisp, ragged crust, a sourdough depth and a generous strafing of seeds, not just caraway but also onion-scented nigella. Called shissel, the bread is as different from most ryes as bourbon is from light beer. Or take the way that items the store is known for have been worked into the menu. Halvah is sold by the block, but shouldn't be eaten that way. It should be eaten this way: broken into chewy bits and scattered over rich sesame ice cream along with salted caramel sauce and a spackling of sesame seeds. Or take the new line of dishes from the Eastern European Jewish canon that are not sold at the store, like the baby knishes stuffed with potatoes and caramelized onions. Over the years the New York knish has become so dense it could be used as an anchor for a small boat. These little specimens are light and fluffy, and they taste not like flour and grease but like baked potatoes. Or take the bar, situated by the front door on Orchard Street. How does a 100-year-old temple to sturgeon get into the cocktail trade? With a reimagined old-time soda fountain of the kind that would have blasted jets of seltzer into egg creams when Joel Russ, newly arrived from Galicia, in what is now Poland, was selling herring from the barrel on the Lower East Side. The white-jacketed bartender makes fresh cucumber soda, cherry shrubs, egg creams and excellent Bloody Marys. He looks as if he belongs there, and the drinks, with Eastern European flavors like caraway, taste as if they belong, for the most part, although my egg cream was not as volcanically fizzy as it might have been. There is a small but well-considered wine list, too. The sparkling wines, especially the less expensive ones from outside Champagne, might have been made to go with smoked-fish platters like the Anne, which collects some of the store's most luxurious treats on a briefcase-size board: its famous sable and Western nova smoked salmon, its underrated brook trout, its extraordinarily fine wild salmon roe and its \"private stock\" sturgeon. I asked our waiter what made it private stock. \"They get a lot of high rollers at the store, some very particular customers,\" he said. \"This one lady came in and asked for sturgeon, but when they started to slice it, she said: \u2018No, no, no. I don't want your regular sturgeon. I want your private stock.' \" This private stock of sturgeon did not, as of yet, exist, but the slicer obligingly found her an unusually sleek specimen. From then on, the fattiest fish would be kept under the counter for customers who would not settle for the regular sturgeon. (As with many stories about Russ & Daughters, the waiter's account has the ring of folk legend. When I asked Jen Snow, who has the title of Yenta at the company, whether it was historically accurate, her response was long and began with \"Oy vey.\") At the restaurant, private-stock sturgeon is advertised but is still a high-roller item; the Anne platter goes for $90. The Anne feeds three or four people. And it does come with a basket of the excellent rye and other breads; a very good, crisp salad of thin-sliced potatoes with mustard; the house cream cheese, which sets the standard for the rest of the city; and all the usual fixings. Still, $90 is not bupkis, and it is not the only disconcerting price at Russ & Daughters Cafe. Forget the caviar service, which starts at $105 for 50 grams of paddlefish and inclines swiftly from there. At the store, long admired for competitive prices on tins of fish eggs, the same 50 grams cost about half as much. The markups are an unpleasant surprise, and guarantee that for most value-minded diners, the caviar section of the menu will be strictly a curiosity. At $60, the scrambled eggs with paddlefish caviar may seem like a more reasonable splurge. But when I had it, Mr. Weissman's challah, although toasted, was going stale and the eggs didn't have the voluptuousness achieved at, say, Jean-Georges . Some everyday items seem out of line, too, like $22 for four slices of sturgeon with butter, capers, tomatoes, onions and a serviceable bagel. For most people, fish on a bagel may not be enough reason to go to a restaurant at night. Russ & Daughters Cafe is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., with the same paper place-mat menu day and night. You could certainly make a light supper from one of the egg dishes, especially the creamy and soft scramble with onions and lox. (How did the Lower East Side get along without this?) But that is a meal best enjoyed alone with a book. The kitchen offers very little that will provide enough traction for a group of friends engaging in a round of cocktails followed by a bottle of wine. Unlike most New Yorkers, the menu looks best by daylight. Most helpings are modest, good for noshing. Salmon roe and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche with latkes, with hard-shell exteriors and fluffy white interiors, seem like breakfast. So does the sturdy bagel chip piled up with whitefish and salmon salads and flying-fish roe infused with wasabi. At lunch the excellent cold borscht could lead up to the herring sampler featuring rollmops, Swedish matjes and pickled herring, which has immediately joined the small list of dishes whose flavor helps define New York. The cafe might have a stronger nocturnal allure with a separate dinner menu or beefed-up portions of plates like the latkes. And it might look into slicing Mr. Weissman's breads closer to the dinner hour so they aren't as fatigued. I'm not expecting to see any big changes right away, though. This is, after all, a business that took a century to give its customers a place to sit down.

We could, for instance, use a few wine bars of the type that began sprouting around Paris about a decade ago. Like traditional bars \u00e0 vins, they have closely considered wine lists whose length and prices are geared for the curious drinker, but they championed winemaking's noninterventionist avant-garde before that was the thing to do. They also flicked the dust off the traditional menu of ready-to-go standbys like hams, cheeses, terrines and open-face sandwiches. Sure, there is excellent charcuterie, but there is some cooking, too, and it betrays care and originality. For the chefs of small restaurants like Septime and Frenchie that are full nearly every night, the wine bar next door has become the preferred way to expand. Racines , which the chef Pierre Jancou opened in 2007 under the glass roof of a 19th-century shopping arcade on the Boulevard Montmartre, was an early example of this breed and one of the most militant. It poured only wines made without sulfur, which even most purists admit can keep good bottles from going bad. Mr. Jancou was a believer, and he could be intolerant of those who didn't share the faith. If you thought one of his wines smelled like a running shoe filled with Gorgonzola, fine. You could go elsewhere and drink Bordeaux with the rest of the heathens. If not for the name, you would never guess that Racines NY, which appeared in TriBeCa this spring, is any relation. It's three times the size of the 20-seat original. The service is solicitous. The sommelier, Arnaud Tronche, genuinely appears to care whether people like what they're drinking. Sulfur, in minimal doses, is tolerated. This being New York, prices at the low end of the long, mostly French list aren't as low. And although wine will be the main event for many people, Racines NY is not a wine bar. It's a restaurant -- or \"neo-bistro,\" in the words of the owners: Mr. Tronche; David Lillie, a partner in Chambers Street Wines, down the street; and David Lanher, who bought the first Racines from Mr. Jancou in 2009. In other words, the menu is meant for dining, not snacking. Nor for sharing, either, although my attempt to keep my fork out of my wife's plateful of whole, warm Oregon morels on a pool of half-liquid burrata failed miserably. For the most part, the chef Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Duca's appetizers are opening moves, and very elegant ones. Mr. Duca served a length of barely seared wild salmon, the raw flesh inside the intense orange-red of a persimmon, with a scoop of cucumber sorbet and a schmear of warm cauliflower cream. These are two of the mildest vegetables in existence, so combining them would not seem like a formula for excitement, but it was like watching summer and winter meet for the first time. Raw veal with warm mayonnaise probably doesn't sound like a bell-ringer, either. But with pine nuts and tarragon folded into cubes of meat, it made a delicious tartare, unorthodox but unmistakably French. Mr. Duca, who grew up near Marseille, had begun to win recognition as the chef of L'Instant d'Or, in Paris, when Mr. Lanher talked him into moving to Chambers Street. Transplanted chefs often need time to find the right suppliers. But almost every ingredient I tasted at Racines NY was fresh and swimming with flavor. If you haven't fully wallowed in berry season yet, go and get the full, dark-red strawberries layered over basil panna cotta. It's currently the star dessert, outclassing a tart of chocolate and salt caramel that comes across as a knockoff (though as knockoffs go, it's very well made). And his main courses are events: the hanger steak over a smoky eggplant pur\u00e9e with blistered shishito peppers and a rustle of cumin somewhere in the background; the red snapper with octopus and fantastic mussels fried in herbed bread crumbs, one of the nicest treatments I've seen anyone give a mussel in a long time; the lamb cooked two ways, most impressively as a braised shank with a deep, almost gamy intensity that fought it out with a teasingly bitter salsa verde made from arugula. All of these dishes are brought to a pitch of refinement that is somewhat at odds with the wine-bar spirit. True, Racines NY doesn't claim to be a wine bar. Neither does its Parisian ancestor. But New Yorkers keep talking about it as if it were one, and it's easy to see why. A big, open bar dominates the dining room, which doesn't have the sense of occasion you expect from a restaurant or bistro. In fact, it's pretty generic. The walls are white or brick; the light fixtures are black and simple; the small vineyard photographs are black-and-white on white matte inside skinny black frames. Bottles, an easy and cheap decorative motif, are inexplicably absent from the shelves behind the bar's barren white surface, which could be mistaken for the cosmetics counter at Barneys . Not every French restaurant in New York needs to look like Bofinger , but does this one really have to look quite so much like a spread from the Restoration Hardware catalog ? Especially if you are spending $35 for the morels or $38 for the lamb, prices that approach those of the entry-level wines, you might hope for a room that you could picture when you close your eyes the next day. Some New Yorkers will keep Racines NY out of their regular rotation because it doesn't look French enough. This would be, to put it kindly, dumb. Dinner and drinks at Racines NY come as close as anything in Manhattan to the flavors of Paris today. The last night I ate there, the wine directors for Piora and the Momofuku group were in the house, cherry-picking the list. It doesn't take an expert to get a great glass at Racines NY. Stuttering a few disjointed syllables to Mr. Tronche, I ended up drinking a rich, almost tropical Sancerre from Sebastien Riffault, poured from a magnum; a dessert wine from Fran\u00e7ois Pinon, a Vouvray with acidity and sweetness so closely balanced I found it hard to believe; a Reagan-era verdelho, a mere toddler as Madeiras go, that is one of the best companions for a cheese course I've ever met. Mr. Tronche could probably even find a wine to get me excited about macarons.

Almost immediately, the universe began sending her a message: don't. The space had structural weaknesses, and propping it up would become a long, expensive project. Gas burners would not be an option. Nor would the grinding and stuffing of sausages in bulk; as it turned out, there wasn't enough room. Ms. Norris ran out of money, raised more, blew through that, scraped up a little extra, spent it on the best kitchen equipment she could afford, and announced that she would open soon. The universe, surmising that the message wasn't getting through, sent a flood. The night of Hurricane Sandy, water filled the streets of Red Hook and filled Grindhaus, too, wrecking all that kitchen equipment. By this point, the signs had to be clear. Evidently Ms. Norris didn't care, because she mucked the place out, banged in new, mold-free walls, began a Kickstarter campaign to fund repairs and fresh equipment, and hired Aaron Taber, a chef she had met at the dog run. The 20-seat restaurant she opened last December, without the sausage theme, is still called Grindhaus. This may be a sign of Ms. Norris's stubbornness, or it may show that she grasps a basic principle of business: When you have a restaurant name that suggests a lost Russ Meyer film set in a German wurst hall staffed by karate-kicking supervixens who are barely contained by their black-leather dirndls, you don't give it up because you can't serve sausages. Grindhaus is not entirely sausage-free. I did eat a few pinches of fresh merguez there once. It was terrific stuff, rich and spicy, folded inside fresh cappellacci. Around these pasta bundles, Mr. Taber had set a snake-curve of charred scallion, confidently seasoned chickpeas and yogurt for a sauce. There were also balls of chickpea cakes called panisses. Panisses may not seem to go with pasta, but these were good enough to go with any dish they wanted. In his short cooking career, Mr. Taber has worked at the Pines in Brooklyn and made dough for a mobile pizza oven. At Grindhaus, his first post as chef, he cooks alone in a kitchen almost exactly the dimensions of the restroom. He makes the kind of earnest, fashionably austere, handsomely arranged food that is signified on menus by sans-serif lists of ingredients, with no capital letters, verbs, articles or hint of how one thing may relate to the next. In some restaurants, they don't relate. At Grindhaus, they do. The first thing I ate there was written this way: rutabaga carrot, sorrel, grapefruit Was it a salad? A soup? A purgative juice blend? No. It was a delicious and ingeniously simple vegetable tart. A buttery pie shell was just big enough to contain a thick, soft wheel of rutabaga held in place by a layer of pur\u00e9ed carrots. The lemonlike bite of raw sorrel and the true citrus of grapefruit acted as welcome rays of sunlight breaking into this ode to the root cellar. Mr. Taber's style of cooking is often found in druidic, wood-filled restaurants with tasting menus, cupboards stacked with hand-thrown pottery and painfully earnest names derived from natural materials, like Resin. Grindhaus isn't as high-minded as those places. It has some rock 'n' roll in its trousers. A steel silhouette of a broken wine glass hangs in the front window, and the jagged shards attached to the stem look like the fingers of a hand raised in a heavy-metal salute. The framed sketches of the heads of Keith Moon and Brian Jones were drawn in high school by a friend of Ms. Norris's whose later work, under the name Cynthia Plaster Caster, would depict other regions of rock-star anatomy. On the bar is the stuffed head of a white horse, its gaping mouth now a vase for eucalyptus branches. Like most things in Grindhaus, the head has a story. It was made to Ms. Norris's specifications by a taxidermist who waited three years for a dead horse in the right color to come along. \"The throat was to open up so it could have a lot of ephemera and antique drug paraphernalia, prescriptions from the 19th century,\" Ms. Norris said. Even if you never figure out what's in the horse's throat, the head with its flowing mane still works its spell as part of Grindhaus's invitation to let it loose and come on down. It's not a rowdy place, but it is one where classic rock may play all night. It's a place where I felt quite at ease singing along to \"Volunteers\" while tearing off a fistful of sourdough bread, which Mr. Taber bakes inside a cast-iron pot to give it a crust that is as stiff, crisp and dark as bread crust can get without being burned. It's a place where certain flavors, like the seared foie gras with ripe strawberries in warm strawberry-rhubarb juice, or the duck breast with morels and rye berries, were so intense that I called over the server and asked for the same dish again, please, before another course left the kitchen. Ms. Norris buys the wines. Almost all come from the natural school, and a few were chosen with more enthusiasm than discernment, so it's wise to taste before committing to a bottle. As they are all poured by the glass, this is easy to do. Wines that didn't seem quite ready and a slightly undercooked monkfish were the only tastes I regretted. I could also wish for more than one dessert on the menu. Recently it was a chocolate mousse with a caramel-like strawberry cream, cacao nibs and puffed rice; I liked it just fine, but the people at my table who didn't would have appreciated an alternative. Mr. Taber, no doubt, would appreciate a bigger kitchen and someone to share it with. Like the romance in a screwball comedy, though, Grindhaus gets its energy from the meeting of opposites: Mr. Taber's large ambitions and his tiny work space, the carefully considered cooking and Ms. Norris's wild paraphernalia. She hasn't decorated the place with canes or masks from her dominatrix days, but she believes the dungeon helped shape Grindhaus. \"That's also the hospitality industry, in a way,\" she said, adding: \"So it finds its way into how things are run and taking care of people. Making sure no one leaves scarred. Or unhappy.\" ", "rec_dishes": ["Sourdough bread", "Parkerhaus rolls", "cabbage and pork jowl with huckleberries", "fresh pasta", "duck breast", "cheese."]}, {"id": 125, "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/dining/restaurant-review-tavern-on-the-green.html", "review_text": " Restaurant critics are supposed to be impartial, but I can't help feeling some proprietary interest in Tavern on the Green . Not a financial interest, except insofar as a profitable Tavern is good for the city's budget, which, in a fractions-of-pennies way, is good for me as a grumpy taxpayer. It's more like a civic interest. Tavern on the Green belongs to the city and sits inside the most beautiful public park in which I've ever rowed, cycled, struck out in softball, misidentified a confusing fall warbler and illegally consumed alcoholic beverages. I'd let the city keep those fractional pennies if that helped Tavern on the Green live up to its setting. So you may detect an extra cup or two of enthusiasm in my voice when I say that under its new management , the building is woven into the life of the park more fully than in its last incarnation, a wedding-cake palace as imagined by a 6-year-old princess with a high fever. And you may hear a few teaspoons of added regret when I say that it's not a good restaurant yet by any measure. The place reopened just two months ago , which may not be enough time to get a 700-seat Winnebago like Tavern up to highway speed. In time, the kitchen may figure out how to get plates on the table while they are still hot. The chef, Katy Sparks , may rethink some of the overworked, underdelivering recipes. The hosts may learn how to read their reservations screen so they don't tell a customer he's the first to arrive and ask him to wait while the rest of his party is already in the restaurant's inner recesses, wondering if he's gone for a carriage ride. Somebody may tell the servers not to drop the check while people are still eating dessert. The sommeliers may turn down the thermostat so that red wines aren't the temperature of a kiddie pool. Still, compared with its last days before its death from insolvency in 2009 made it the subject of countless dry-eyed eulogies, Tavern on the Green is much, much improved. One of its real joys is seeing the exuberant Victorian building, constructed in 1871 as a dormitory for the grass-munching residents of Sheep Meadow, restored down to the last copper drainpipe. The snaggletoothed slate roof has been to the orthodontist. The Parks Department, determined to end the Tavern's sparkly isolation, tore down the Crystal Room, which used to galumph halfway across the courtyard. The Berlin Wall of giant topiary animals that blocked the view of Sheep Meadow is gone, too. Now if you eat on the terrace, you can see the runners and the pedicab drivers on West Drive, and they can see you. The restaurant's new operators, Jim Caiola and David Salama , have tried to put the tavern back into the Tavern. Ms. Sparks's plates are substantial, and any leanings toward fanciness are confined to the perimeters of the plate. The menu does not say, \"Aunt Althea's 80th birthday\" as much as it says: \"Hi there. If you happen to be going to Lincoln Center, don't forget about me!\" The glittering, un-tavernlike interior encrustations have been scraped off. Next to the entrance is a bar shaped like a racetrack next to a convincing artificial marble fireplace flanked by carved rams' heads. It's dark and reassuring, just the kind of sheltered saloon you'd want to end up in after working up a thirst in the park. In the main dining room, though, the tavern motif explodes in a whiteout. Everything is bright and off-white: tables, chairs, banquettes, floors. It looks like the indoor-outdoor, all-day, casual-dining option at a family-friendly resort in Florida. The servers have the determined enthusiasm of counselors poached from a summer camp in Maine and given a crash course in big-city restaurant customs during the bus ride down Interstate 95. One of them thought everything we did and said was \"wonderful\": our clever preference for sparkling water over still, our bold decision to look at dessert menus. Another picked up a few crumbs from the leather-topped table with his fingertips, then left the rest. Somebody showed up the instant the plates had been set down to ask brightly, \"How does everything look?\" I can't blame her for not asking how it tasted. The answer may have made it hard to stay chipper. Prying tiny quail bones away from meat that was griddled until it was as dry as a week-old English muffin wasn't very wonderful. Neither was the greasy scattering of mushrooms and gummy, flavorless farro strozzapreti baked under a mound of ricotta that had no idea it was supposed to act like a sauce. The ceviches aren't ceviches; they're rough-sawn carpaccios of seafood covered with garnishes that are either thuggish (harsh pickled onions and acrid, stale fried garlic chips on yellowfin tuna) or useless (avocado lumps on salmon). Then acid is thrown at them. The directive seems to be: terminate with extreme prejudice. Is it too late to bring back the sheep? No, no. Patience. Maybe the food, which isn't especially ornate, still needs to come down a notch or two. The pork chop could lose the stringy, sour, half-raw roasted rhubarb. The brisket in a sweetish barbecue sauce, which you'd be happy enough to find at your local brew pub, could do without the comatose potato salad. And the menu would be easier to handle if Ms. Sparks didn't organize it by heat source. (\"I don't really care what I eat, as long as it was cooked on a plancha!\") The most enjoyable dishes tend to be the simplest. The Serrano ham and melted Gruy\u00e8re sandwich was totally likable, which is my clever way of saying it was fried in butter. I couldn't taste any wood smoke in the hearth-roasted mussels, but they were tender and flavorful in their Spanish-leaning sauce of garlic and chopped almonds. The $56 strip steak was excellent, too, although it probably helped that it was the only main course that arrived hot that night. (It is by far the most expensive of what the menu calls \"large plates.\" The others hover around $30, which might squeak by as reasonable for dinner in the park if the cooking didn't get away from the cooks so often.) The prize dessert is also the most modest: the birthday cake. White and soft, with whipped ricotta between the layers and whipped cream on top, it's exactly what a plain-vanilla American layer cake should be. The other desserts are fine, but they could learn a thing or two from it. The berry shortcake needs a richer, creamier biscuit, and if the fudgelike brownies want to graduate to sundae status, they deserve more than a single scoop of ice cream. The best of my four meals at Tavern on the Green was brunch at a shady table in the courtyard, where I watched Sheep Meadow slowly fill up with weekend layabouts. The food wasn't so wonderful that it would lure crowds, but it wouldn't keep them away, either. No doubt the restaurant is aiming higher than that, but it wouldn't be a bad place to begin.

Will the replacement be a caretaker cook mimicking the style that made the place exciting? Or will the successor be a creative whiz who can make the menu jump through a new set of hoops? A Voce Madison and BLT Fish, two Manhattan restaurants that won enthusiastic three-star reviews from Frank Bruni in The New York Times shortly after they opened, have faced this question. Laurent Tourondel whipped up BLT Fish in 2005, but walked away from it and his other BLT restaurants around the country four years later in a messy split with his business partner. Andrew Carmellini put A Voce, as it was called then , on the map in 2006, but he is long gone, too. The two restaurants didn't capsize after their captains jumped ship, but some of the wind has gone out of their sails. The companies that own both restaurants are not run by chefs, which may explain why they have hired successors from outside; neither organization has the deep bench of up-and-coming cooks that a Daniel Boulud or a Mario Batali can draw on. A Voce Madison is on its third chef. Mr. Carmellini was succeeded by Missy Robbins, who also opened the sister A Voce in the Time Warner Center. At the original, off Madison Square, she was replaced last summer by Ben Lee. Mr. Lee is an assured cook who earned his stripes working for Marc Vetri and Michael White , and under his watch the kitchen at A Voce Madison has taken an understated turn that still offers a rewarding interpretation of modern Italian cuisine. He exerts a fine-tuned control on brawny, rustic flavors, setting octopus stewed in red wine on a savory semolina pancake with a thick ridge of concentrated tomato sauce and browned crumbles of fiery \u2018nduja . He has a five-minute egg on toast that sounds like a desperation dinner scavenged from an empty refrigerator, but as the liquid yolk coats lightly pickled hen-of-the-woods mushrooms under a nutty Parmigiano-Reggiano cream, it turns out to be a very elegant appetizer. There was an echo of Mr. White's silky way with pasta in the fettuccine tossed with a meaty braise of rabbit with rosemary and black trumpet mushrooms, and in the tender yellow packets of agnolotti filled with lovely lemon-scented ricotta. Other pastas lacked a sense of proportion, like the buckwheat pizzoccheri that needed more than a few stray leaves of chard to balance the gooey slick of melted bitto cheese. And one was just strange: the cassoncini, pale fried ravioli with a filling of mozzarella, anchovy and sundried tomatoes that tasted like pizza run through a blender. In the main courses, Mr. Lee shows more nuance with seafood than with meat. A hulking braised lamb shank in midwinter was more blunt than focused, while a lukewarm pork chop that was probably never going to get off the ground didn't get much aerodynamic lift from the mushy, oily mass of pine nuts and raisins on top. He brought more finesse to wild striped bass with fennel braised in orange juice, and to satiny olive-oil poached cod with sweet littlenecks. A new pastry chef, Kristin Menton, is making desserts that are as charming as a handwritten thank-you note. A honey-lavender panna cotta with fresh peaches and peach sorbet had an understated hum of sweetness, and extracted a gentle perfume from the lavender without giving in to potpourri overkill. Service has been variable -- so lethargic one night that it must have added an hour to the meal, almost pushy on another, when a server loomed over the table with a grappa bottle the size of a softball bat. \"They make it for us. It's very nice,\" she said. We showed no interest, but still: \"You want to try?\" This time we said no. \"Just a little bit?\" At least she didn't start swinging the bottle at us. When Mr. Carmellini ran the shop, the food felt imperative, almost insisting that you give in to its full-flavored seductions. Mr. Lee's style doesn't have the same strong personal imprint, but he has kept A Voce Madison among the city's more enjoyable practitioners of contemporary Italian cuisine. BLT Fish, in Chelsea, was always a trickier proposition. The engine that drove its initial success was the tension between Laurent Tourondel's sophisticated French technique and the crowd-pleasing trinkets he tossed out like Mardi Gras beads. (A meal might kick off with fried rock shrimp in Buffalo wing sauce and blue cheese.) The restaurant was serious and fun at the same time, \"the culinary equivalent of a poetic page-turner or a mass-market movie helmed by an auteur,\" as Mr. Bruni put it. With the poet and auteur subtracted, the formula grew creaky. Last spring, the owners brought on a new chef, Luke Venner. Most recently the chef de cuisine at Millwright's in Simsbury, Conn., Mr. Venner seems miscast here. He doesn't hit the high notes as effortlessly as Mr. Tourondel did, so the populist touches don't feel witty and self-aware anymore. They just feel like gimmicks. Often enough, the kitchen outfits seafood in flattering ways. Very sweet raw scallops were minimally but effectively dressed with lemon oil and thyme leaves. Spaghetti in a parsley-cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche sauce flickering with red Thai chiles provided a bright setting for sliced razor clams. Ham-hock broth, white polenta and sweet spring peas made for a winning version of shrimp and grits. Lightly charred octopus was served on briny, intense black olive pur\u00e9e above a bed of potatoes, which came together as a combined condiment and side dish. But there are also sauces that don't click, like the washed-out mandarin emulsion with halibut, or the dashi broth with scallops and nine kinds of mushrooms, which proved that more umami is not always the answer. There are odd pairings, like the curried oxtail stew served with smooth shrimp that refused to cling to the sauce. There is inattention to detail, like the crunchy, gritty morels in a thin, salty asparagus soup, or the branzino left to bake inside its salt crust until it was slightly dry and tough. The prices at BLT Fish, never gentle, are hard to support now that the food is uneven. The branzino, meant for two, cost $68. A $70 seafood platter offered bland, not very tender lobster tail; undercooked mussels with their beards left intact, and big, rubbery shrimp. It held some very good tastes, too, but they delivered about $35 worth of pleasure, rounding up. Desserts are a mixed lot as well, but the first choice should be the excellent tarte Tatin, baked in a little cast iron pot with a thick swirl of caramel. While you're eating it, a glass jar of cotton candy arrives. In the beginning, this circus flourish was like a wink from a chef with the heart of a carnival ringmaster. Now it's one of the few claims BLT Fish has to being more than another expensive place to eat seafood.

The first new restaurant Mr. Flay and his business partner, Laurence Kretchmer, have opened in New York City in nearly a decade, Gato is nominally Mediterranean, but the chef rides herd on pastas and pizzas and romesco sauces with a go-for-broke intensity that's 100 percent American. Mr. Flay brushes flavor on his ingredients in thick impasto strokes, making each plate a three-dimensional aggregation of char, smoke, capsicum, sugar, acid and fat. The cooking at Gato is many things, often all at the same time, but it is rarely shy. \"Tons of olive oil,\" Mr. Flay promised in a January interview in The New York Times as the space in NoHo was under plywood. \"Tons of salty flavors like anchovies and olives and capers. Lots of citrus. Tons of things like tomatoes and peppers, both hot and sweet.\" Stand aside, all you chefs fiddling with tweezers and eyedroppers; Bobby Flay is backing up an 18-wheeler loaded with anchovies. Of the first generation of gunslinging Food Network chefs, Mr. Flay is the only one who stayed in the saddle as the channel's mission shifted from dump-and-stir cooking lessons to ticking-clock gladiator contests. He also kept his dignity; he acts like a professional, not a cartoon. Still, playing a chef isn't the same as being one, and as the real estate market picked off first Bolo and then Mesa Grill , his New York presence was whittled down to just Bar Americain , a Whitman's Sampler of American regional favorites. To audiences who don't remember how skillfully he conjured up bursts of sunlight in Mesa Grill's prime, Mr. Flay was in danger of becoming another Old West sharpshooter who'd joined up with Buffalo Bill Cody to delight big-top crowds by blasting holes in playing cards. With Gato, he's a grizzled sheriff pinning on his badge again and returning to the precincts where he first laid down the law. He's out to prove he's more than just a big hat. But the frontier is a-changin'. The townspeople expect all kinds of newfangled foolishness. If they aren't amazed by every bite, they'll yelp like coyotes. Worse, they can't live without small plates. Fine, Bobby Flay can do small plates. He can crush small plates with one hand. His bar snacks, three porcelain bowls lined up on a slate for $17, are compact flavor bombs that detonate quickly and leave a vivid afterimage. He'll stuff cubes of tuna tartare inside a piquillo pepper, pitting cool and raw against roasted and mildly spicy. He makes a tiny powerhouse of fresh chorizo wrapped in caul fat, and gives it some shaved pickled fennel to calm its hotheaded tendencies. Many chefs leave burrata to its own, oozy devices; Mr. Flay piles on roasted beets and a vinaigrette made from oil in which black olives have stewed, and suddenly it's a dish with something to say. I'm omitting some other stuff on these plates both for brevity and because they never swamped the rest. The size of the bar snacks may limit how much flavor-troweling Mr. Flay can do. Some of the bigger plates show his maximalist embroidery at its bring-it-on best; others seem to leave too much space for his BeDazzler . Rabbits have a famous love for carrots, but I've never seen one take to the vegetable the way Gato's juicy braised rabbit leg takes to its carrot hot sauce, which tastes like sweet fire. Nor have I tasted a tarragon chicken in which the minty-licorice character of the herb had the flute-note brightness it has at Gato, which carpets the bird's crisp skin with a variety of salsa verde made from chopped raw tarragon. Mr. Flay can put a crust on a paella like nobody's business, and the crunchy grains of rice, once you unstick them from the bottom of the pan and mix them with a steamed egg, fried artichokes and big, tender leaves of saut\u00e9ed kale, have a flavor-texture dynamic that's just fun to eat. Steamed halibut promises all the thrills of curling up in bed with a bond fund's quarterly report. Mr. Flay plunks the fish into a bowl of saffron-tomato soup made from halibut stock and bulked up with couscous, and if it's not quite thrilling, it still has a winning depth of flavor, and some nuance, too. Nuance has never been Mr. Flay's middle name, but he can achieve it, particularly in the main courses. With some of the more hyperactive dishes at Gato, though, it's as if his years of competitive cooking have trained him to go for the knockout punch right away. He'll funnel every ounce of flavor into the first bite, and he seems to be afraid that if he leaves out some trick, the judges will have enough taste buds left to notice what his rivals are up to. Fettuccine was soaked with potent, briny squid ink and mussel broth until it elbowed everything else -- red prawns, mussels and a quiet green-onion pur\u00e9e -- right off the plate. A side of piment\u00f3n-dusted potatoes fried to shattering bits, like crumbled bacon, was oily enough on its own without the extra richness of a runny poached egg and salty enough without a frosting of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Cheese is wheeled out again and again: soft shreds of fontina in a chicory salad; crumbs of pecorino over asparagus and fava beans whose spring freshness would have been better off with just the yellow romesco; goat cheese with crunchy potatoes alongside that tarragon chicken; gobs of bucheron in a plate of scrambled eggs blitzed with romesco. Sweetness can turn up where it's not needed, too, whether in the romesco with an unprepossessing pork chop or in the apricot-almond dressing in that chicory salad. But if Mr. Flay sometimes lights up the tilt sign on his pinball machine, there is still a lot to love on the menu. There is a lot, period. Gato shows an all-too-rare generosity in its flavors, its eager service, its good-tempered desserts, like the summery blackberry crostata and the fromage blanc cheesecake whipped into a froth by the pastry chef, Clarisa Martino. Seeking a decent bottle of wine for $50 or under at an ambitious New York restaurant is becoming a lost cause, but there are more than a dozen of them at Gato. The wine list brings together affordable, everyday bottles with others that will sing their song to advanced drinkers. (It makes a happier hunting ground than the humdrum cocktail menu.) Given Mr. Flay's fan base, the dining room might have been a pack-'em-in nightmare, but there's space to flex your elbows. The architects at Rockwell Group, past masters at injecting life into big, boxy rooms, have turned this onetime homeless shelter into a flickering lair where the heat-lamp glow of hanging lights is set off against receding pools of darkness. It looks like a set for a TV show about sexy young downtown vampires who unwind over blood sausages -- \"Cheers\" for the undead. All the reviews of Gato note that Mr. Flay is really, truly working in the glassed-in kitchen. I saw him, too, not twirling cilantro sprigs at the pass but facing the burners, his back to the audience, like Miles Davis. He says he's sticking around indefinitely. Nobody can say he's giving us anything less than the full Flay.

It is a classic Manhattan restaurant that seems to have emerged on East 82nd Street fully formed out of a time capsule sealed in the last century. When you call the restaurant, which is the only way to reserve one of its 11 tables, Ms. Vaughn will write your name in something called a \"book,\" holding an implement known as a \"pen.\" She applies the same antique tool to the menu, which she writes out in cursive and photocopies each time Mr. Smith changes it. The Simone's search-engine strategy is the opposite of optimized. The restaurant is not on Open Table, Menu Pages, Twitter or Facebook, and an Internet search will turn up an unrelated martini bar's website before the Simone's . I often think that restaurants with outdoor-concert noise levels, backless benches and no-reservations policies are deliberately trying to scare off older diners. The Simone seems to be attempting something like that in reverse: If you wanted to keep away anyone under 35, this is how you'd do it. But as some of those youngsters know, the worn grooves of an old LP can sound richer than the shimmering precision of an MP3. And the Simone has the kind of textured, lived-in, analog warmth that has become rare in Manhattan's increasingly corporatized, professionalized restaurant scene. Though expensive, with main courses fluttering into the low $40s, and formal, with waiters in vests and neckties primping white tablecloths, the Simone isn't starchy at all. It's a living, breathing mom-and-pop outfit where Ms. Vaughn will gush with bubbly pride about the Proven\u00e7al bottle she spontaneously offered to work into a flight of ros\u00e9s, while Mr. Smith, no showboat, channels his pride into the cooking. (A third owner, Robert Margolis, keeps a poker-faced watch on the dining room.) Like the rest of the Simone, Mr. Smith's kitchen is a bit of a throwback. The winds of New Nordic and modernist cuisines do not ruffle the surface of his stockpots. He works within French tradition in a manner that was almost the default New York style 15 to 20 years ago. Mr. Smith, who trained under Patrick O'Connell and Jean-Louis Palladin, is not rewriting the rules of French cooking. It's simply the language he speaks, and he's fluent enough that he can use it to talk about the ingredients in his part of the world. If you were designing a dish to go viral on Instagram, you'd start by ruling out flounder, which has the must-see quotient of a \"Matlock\" marathon on TBS. The fish is a favorite of Mr. Smith's, who served me two flounder dishes that rank among the best seafood I've tasted this year. In late winter, he rolled juicy, big-flaked fillets around a mousse of flounder and black truffle flecks; I would have burrowed into it until spring if I hadn't also wanted to eat the whole thing. The flounder's cold-weather swaddling disappeared a few weeks ago, and a jaunty new May outfit appeared: a golden sheet of bread crumbs speckled with fresh green herbs on top of the fish, a platform of crushed, minted favas below. Mr. Smith's main courses often pair two takes on a protein, one very good and the other exceptional: a juicy roasted chicken breast with fried croquettes of dark meat, ham and foie gras so hard to ignore that dinner came to a dead stop while we passed them around; a drum of braised lamb shank with a single rib daubed with a Moroccan spice blend that landed with a menacing uppercut of heat; a crisped boneless duck thigh with thin slices of breast that were pink right out to the edges and almost surreally tender. One time, Mr. Smith doubled down and lost. The grilled loin and braised thigh of rabbit, both on the dry side, must have been a fluke, because he usually showed the intuition of a chef who knows just how his ingredients want to be handled. He has good sense with appetizers, too, and an admirable sense of restraint; he doesn't turn them into scene stealers that leave the main courses nowhere to go but down. The first king salmon of the Alaskan season were shown off handsomely in a tartare with crisp cucumbers and bright preserved lemons. His goat-cheese souffl\u00e9 was more warm custard than eat-it-now atmospheric condition, but it was still an excellent custard. He carves sweetbreads into long planks, creating more surface area for the crunchy coating of bread crumbs and Dijon mustard that was more than half the point. House-made charcuterie sits at the top of the menu, and it belongs there. Mr. Smith treats the tradition with a rare classicism, as in his recent bacon-wrapped terrine of pork, chicken liver, pistachios, pink plugs of foie gras and Armagnac prunes. I wished that the brioche toast served with it had been a little softer and lighter, but I was happy enough eating the terrine alone. It was like a rousing chorus of \"La Marseillaise\" made of meat. One night, Ms. Vaughn explained that during some lean times at a previous restaurant when they had to let the pastry chef go, Mr. Smith taught himself to make desserts. He has more of a feel for the last course than many chefs, although there were a few false moves, like a lemon tart that wasn't puckery enough to withstand a sugary overload of meringue. But other desserts fell right into line, like a tart of Mr. Smith's own marmalade with a crushed almond topping, and a little tower of Lord Baltimore cake , the yellow layers filled with pecans, dried fruits and coconut that were addled with bourbon, the way Lord Baltimore intended. There is no bar \"program\" at this restaurant, no list of nine-ingredient cocktails with dingbat names like Simone Says. But if your drink request is normal enough, it will materialize on the staircase in the hands of a waiter who presumably got it from some unseen, unheard Jeeves on the second floor. The Simone is a personal restaurant, and it has some personal quirks. The sophisticated-lady playlist can push nostalgia a step too far; raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, on the original cast recording, may not be everybody's favorite thing at dinner. And Ms. Vaughn has a funny habit of sidling up to the table to ask single-word questions: Delicious? Lovely? The thing is, there was always a single-word answer: yes.

Grandpa wants to tell you a story about wealth, power, real estate, pornography, carrots and a sweet-faced dairy cow named Narcissa. About 90 miles north of Manhattan is a 76-acre triangle of land on the Hudson River whose owners over the centuries have acted out the history, in stop-frame animation, of social power in New York. When Dutch families ran half of the Hudson Valley, it was farmed by the son of a settler from the Netherlands. He sold the place to one of the Livingstons, an aristocratic Scottish family who ran the other half. As Gilded Age capitalists crashed New York society, the property was bought by William B. Dinsmore, a founder of a company that was the U.P.S. of the Civil War era , but with stagecoaches instead of brown vans. The Dinsmores had a Gatsbyesque time there, entertaining trainloads of weekend guests with a private golf course and a greenhouse full of orchids . Pipe down, I'm getting to the porn. There are always fun new ways to get rich in America, and in the prolonged group grope between the invention of the Pill and the Meese Report , Bob Guccione got rich by printing photos of Penthouse pets, who exposed things that the blushing Playmates didn't. With his earnings, Mr. Guccione bought the old Dinsmore estate. But when we chased pornography off our streets and onto our laptops, Mr. Guccione wasn't rich any more, and his country retreat was seized by creditors. Now we save our soft-focus pictures for pork chops, and restaurants are one of the last places where moaning in public is still acceptable. So of course the person who bought the property at auction is a restaurateur, Andr\u00e9 Balazs . Renaming the estate Locusts-on-Hudson, Mr. Balazs rents it out for weddings ( the website tastefully passes over the gold-chained Guccione years) and farms the land again. Today it is home to vegetable plots, laying hens and a retired cow, Narcissa. She gave her name to Mr. Balazs's latest restaurant, inside his Standard East Village hotel, and her moony eyes look down at the dining room from framed photographs. Narcissa the cow has no role in the restaurant's rib-eye steak, but the farm is supposed to help in other ways. Last fall, Narcissa's chef, John Fraser, started planning this summer's menu by choosing the vegetables he wanted from illustrated seed catalogs. These books, he said, were \"food porn in and of themselves.\" Whether teenage boys will hide pictures of undressed kohlrabi under their mattresses remains to be seen, but Mr. Fraser has already come up with one of the year's most photographed carrots. A take on beef Wellington, it has salt-cured roasted carrots inside the puff pastry where the meat should go. It's a startling success. The carrots are tender without a trace of mushiness, and a walnut paste darkened with cocoa and coffee gives them a brooding, bittersweet depth. Mr. Fraser is known for his refined, thought-out vegetable tasting menus at Dovetail , on the Upper West Side. His vegetable plates at Narcissa are more unbuttoned and generous. They're complex, but in a relaxed way that fits this casual, many-things-to-many-people dining room, where tables of chef chasers sit next to narrow-waisted colts who look as if they get their nutrients from air kisses. Beets are spit-roasted for hours until their outsides are charred like grilled steak and the insides have a focused, waterless intensity; then they're lightly crushed into deep-ruby hunks that drink up a horseradish cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Plum-size sweet potatoes go on the rotisserie, too, getting a hot allspice-heavy jerk sauce completely right for their sugary flesh, which can taste flabby on its own. This kitchen knows how to build a salad, mixing vinaigrettes that have a switchblade edge and tossing in sophisticated-hippie handfuls of sunflower seeds (with saucerlike leaves of brussels sprouts) or crunchy chopped pistachios (in the mixed-greens Narcissa's salad). Side dishes are often a crass adventure in check-padding. That's not the case at Narcissa, although the carrot fries -- overdone carrots in a greasy battered shell -- just made me miss the Wellington. (This is why magicians never repeat a trick.) But I could eat Narcissa's steamed new potatoes in green garlic and olive oil all summer long, and I wish steakhouses would steal its \"supergreen spinach,\" wilted leaves folded into a b\u00e9chamel-fortified pur\u00e9e that has a Sprite-bottle gleam. I'm giving these vegetables lingering close-ups because they have a swaggering originality that the meat and seafood rarely match. Hake with a south-of-France trio of tapenade, oranges and artichokes, and a poussin the size of a mango with legs, in a vaguely truffled chicken reduction, were extremely pleasant, but wouldn't get Narcissa noticed on their own. Other dishes seemed designed for jet-lagged hotel guests who don't want any back-talk from their dinner, like the not-quite-juicy roasted branzino with a standard-issue salsa verde. Mr. Fraser could use a few more main courses like the steamed black sea bass, which worked up some excitement -- an uphill battle for steamed fish -- by means of a toasty coconut-curry broth and hollow cross-sections of green almonds, squeaky-crisp as an unripe pear. Deborah Racicot's desserts are just clever enough; if you're paying attention, you can tell that she is, too. To go with a round chocolate tart, like a brownie with a melted center, she lightly curries bananas, using slightly green ones so they're not too cloying. The nicest thing I can say about the long winter is that it allowed her citrus salad with tapioca pudding and orange-blossom granit\u00e9 to stay on the menu until May. Tableside patter can be strange. A server one night talked up the \"day-trip scallops\" (lucky them) and pushed carrots Wellington as a mid-meal \"palate cleanser.\" There was no song and dance from the wine staff, led by Ashley Santoro, only to-the-point advice on a very appealing list. The design has a disjointed feel. Wooden chairs hang from pegs, in the aspirational Shaker Zen style, but the low zigzag partition along the bar could come from a Vegas coffee shop. Then there's the steep staircase to the restrooms with crazy diagonal stripes reflected in the mirrored ceiling. It looks as if the director of \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" had remade \"The Lost Weekend.\" If you've been drinking, tie a rope around your waist and have a friend slowly lower you down.

He saw enough flowers for a year of proms, he saw a piano player massaging a Steinway, he saw a curtain of glass framing the Brooklyn Bridge and the lights of Fortress Manhattan on the other side. All of this he saw floating on a barge in the East River. After pleading for permits for 12 years, he persuaded City Hall to see it, too, and in 1977 the River Caf\u00e9 dropped anchors. Did Mr. O'Keeffe see men producing diamond rings from their jacket pockets? He has seen it hundreds of times since. So have I, sitting at the bar one summer a few years back when a young man talked his date into catching the view from the deck outside then dropped to one knee, right next to the swiveling mounted binoculars. I'll never forget it, or the look in the couple's dewy eyes when they discovered that the door to the dining room had locked behind them. No questions were popped at the River Caf\u00e9 for more than a year after Hurricane Sandy dished out a surge tide that even a barge couldn't stay on top of. When the River Caf\u00e9 opened again in February, the walls, ships' deck floorboards, the grand piano, most of the wine cellar and nearly everything else was new. You'd never know it. Mr. O'Keeffe paid for a museum-quality restoration. As before, you reach the River Caf\u00e9 by traveling down a cobbled driveway with lanterns and a miniature forest of plants on either side, as if Snow White's cottage were at the end of the road. The entrance casts its fairy-tale spell on a good number of wanderers who follow the winding road only to be sent away because they don't have jackets (for the men) or reservations (for everyone). Those who are allowed inside cross a short gangplank to the floating dining room, where captains in black tuxedos stand guard. On the right, flowers; on the left, a pianist who gently spoons out ballads for hours on end without ever seeming to need a break. He doesn't sing, but memory dredges up the words: When I'm close to you, dear, the stars fill the sky. So in love with you am I. This trickling brook of melodies babbling away in the background is more pretty than beautiful. Like many things about the River Caf\u00e9, it is white-limo elegant. But so few New York restaurants today reach for elegance of any kind that the resurgence of this one is a gift to the city. Even harder to find are restaurants where tourists can go to gape at the view and New Yorkers can go without being embarrassed. Windows on the World, once straight across the river, is gone for good, and the return of the revolving dance floor at the Rainbow Room, scheduled for October, can't come soon enough. No place in the city combines spectacle with hideaway intimacy and undiluted romance the way the River Caf\u00e9 does. And if more customers will take photographs of the Brooklyn Bridge's steel underbelly than of their plates, the food is still much better than you might fear if you've been to other restaurants with souvenir views. \"The kitchen aims to please but not to shock,\" William Grimes wrote in his two-star review 12 years ago , the last time the restaurant was assessed in The New York Times. That hasn't changed. Neither has the chef, Brad Steelman, who has been in his post since 2000. The sailor's \"steady as she goes\" might be the River Caf\u00e9's motto. An opening salvo from the kitchen, a single shrimp on a Southeast Asian papaya salad with crushed peanuts, makes it clear that flavor epiphanies are not in store. The rack of lamb I ate recently, which was inside a skinny ring of mint jelly zipped up with mustard seeds, appeared to be the same dish Mr. Grimes described. (We both liked it.) Radiating like spokes from a hub of firm, hand-chopped steak tartare are lines of mustard, chopped capers, shallots, cornichons and chives: the usual suspects. Mr. Steelman doesn't need his garnishes to provide hologram moonwalks, though. His main ingredients are almost always good enough to be their own special effects. For his shrimp Oscar, he sets hollandaise boosted with blood-orange juice against beautifully sweet Pacific blue shrimp and meaty white lumps of crab. In another appetizer called Three Shells, strips of abalone dunked in a yuzu-kaffir bath and firm little kumamoto oysters in a classic mignonette had the shining immediacy of great seafood, too, even if the third shell, Taylor Bay scallops ceviche, didn't quite keep up. And while poached lobster could probably find more exciting companions than celery root pur\u00e9e and slightly sweet-sour butternut squash dice, the lobster itself was tender and sweet enough to be a solo act. A duck breast whose skin has a terrific crisp shellac, seasoned with lavender and a trace of dried chiles, was better served by the cozy Eastern European comfort of glossy braised red cabbage and crisp squiggles of sweet-potato spaetzle. Some of Mr. Steelman's ideas can be questioned. His extremely good Barolo-braised oxtail appetizer would get along nicely with either polenta or pasta, but perhaps not with polenta stuffed inside pasta. And he piled too much breading on fried oysters, which were rescued from dryness only by their topping of smoked salmon and caviar. In general, though, he sticks to classic notions and we get the rewards; his mushroom Wellington turns the obligatory vegetarian main course into a real event. Desserts, included in the three-course $115 fixed-price dinner, could use refreshing. Vanilla ice cream and vanilla ice milk turn up on several, with no noticeable taste of vanilla. But that didn't hurt the milk-chocolate souffl\u00e9, already sweetened by a melting cap of toasted marshmallow, or the chocolate marquise straddled by a dark chocolate replica of the Brooklyn Bridge's towers and cables. Maybe a chocolate bridge is a little hokey, but so is dropping to one knee in front of the Manhattan skyline. In both cases what counts is not the originality of the gesture but its sincerity. In its desire to sweep us into its secluded, flower-strewn island, the River Caf\u00e9 is sincere in a way that restaurants hardly ever are these days. At the end of a night there, I always regret that it's time to come back to the mainland.

The thumbnail curve of the sardine-can tapas bar is just the way it's been since the beginning, packed, every seat there and on the opposite wall a few inches away taken almost any time you show up. Turn right at the door, though, and you'll find something new. Last fall, El Quinto Pino's owners and chefs, Alex Raij and her husband, Eder Montero, took over the lease on the apartment next door and filled it with tables, making their sardine can a real restaurant. \"It won't make a bid for your entire night: You will snack at El Quinto Pino and almost inevitably eat more somewhere else,\" Peter Meehan wrote in a \" $25 and Under\" column in 2007, its last review in The New York Times. With a reservation for that side room you won't need to go anywhere else for dinner. You won't want to, either, once the food starts zooming out of the kitchen. Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero also own Txikito, across Ninth Avenue, which digs into Basque cuisine, and La Vara, in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where the menu is a master's thesis on Moorish and Jewish imprints upon Spanish cooking. A short \"men\u00fa tur\u00edstico\" at El Quinto Pino investigates a different region of the country every few months, which gives regulars a reason to keep coming and gives the kitchen a launching pad for dishes that may hit the permanent roster. Other than that, the two chefs haven't tied themselves down. Having laid down their Iberian credentials in their other restaurants, they've given El Quinto Pino a passport to roam around. Among the bar sandwiches tightly wrapped in paper is a visitor from New Orleans, a po'boy with closely packed, terrifically crunchy fried squid legs at its core. Another is a fortified Cubano, in which the ham and crisp pickle have more oomph than usual, the cheese doesn't taste processed, for once, and the braised pork is supplemented with a red wallop of blood sausage. The chefs do a takeoff on Catalonia's version of the croque monsieur, the bikini, but they aim a double-barreled blast of Mexico at it, topping the melted cheese with roasted poblanos and huitlacoche, the flamboyantly weird, mushroom-tasting black fungus that grows on corn ears. Geographic freedom between pieces of bread was written into El Quinto Pino's charter from the start, when Ms. Raij brought out (all rise, please) the uni panino. A pressed ficelle filled with creamy sea urchin, melted butter and a lashing of mustard oil, it became one of the city's essential sandwiches. It still is, even though one night mustard-oil supplies must have run low and the panino wasn't the same without its throat-catching rumble. The rest of the menu is made up of tapas-style plates, and the servers are careful not to overload the small tables, bringing just one or two at a time. The kitchen mostly presents these dishes as tangles that are easily shared, and resists the impulse toward multicomponent platings. With Raij-Montero portions, four people seems to be the breaking point at which you're not so much eating as nibbling. I enjoyed El Quinto Pino more in a party of three, and best of all with just one accomplice. Some of the seafood is so appealing and out of the ordinary that dividing it can test your ability to play well with others. I hated surrendering the last fried lump of sea anemone folded into soft scrambled eggs. Called ortiguillas, they tasted almost like fried oysters, but not quite, and I wanted to get to the bottom of that \"not quite.\" My curiosity and my appetite also wanted a few more runs at the Catalan salad xat\u00f3, which mixed chicory and canned bonito with raw salt cod, soaked to pull out the salt and to reveal a flavor of quietly intensified fish. Dressed with both romesco and an uncooked tomato sauce, this salad seemed to get more lively with each bite. Tender, apple-blossom-pink gambas al ajillo get a little fresh ginger along with the garlic, an addition that made me want to eat them twice as fast. (Mashed and sliced avocado don't have the same effect on an oddly inert salpicon of shrimp.) Smaller shrimp from Cadiz, the size of a paper clip and intensely flavorful in their shells, are pressed into a tortillita, a wonderful fritter that looks like a latke cooked under a brick. Fried on their own, these shrimp turn up again to bring a marine undertow to a jiggly poached egg with slivered snow peas. The kitchen's hand is so steady that it's easy to pass over its occasional bobbles, unless you're unlucky enough to be served two or three in a row. My disappointments were spread out: dully spiced lamb skewers; underseasoned bits of fried pork whose name, \"bag of bacon,\" raised undue expectations; seafood fideua, like paella made from noodles, that lacked the oceanic depth I loved when I had the same dish at La Vara. And it's unclear how the xocolata dessert is meant to be served. One night the salt-sprinkled ingot of chocolate ganache was filled with fruity green olive oil that spilled out at the touch of a fork; I don't think I've ever enjoyed the pairing of the two ingredients more. On another, the oil was cold and congealed like Vaseline. Fortunately I had the excellent crema catalana, roused from its usual custardy slumber by cinnamon and lemon zest, to fall back on. Everything I know about dating could be carved onto the head of a pin with a butter knife, but a younger man who lives down the block from El Quinto Pino assures me it's a great date place. He didn't mean the bar, with its was-that-your-foot? dimensions, but the new dining room. Separated from the drinkers by a galley kitchen, its 30 seats feel secluded and romantic, but not in an obvious way. The architect Silvia Zofio gave it a quietly domestic, midcentury look, with an earth-toned tapestry covering one wall and a chandelier that suggests the swoosh of a flamenco dancer's skirt in mid-twirl. It's a room for talking, and if it's not exactly the boondocks, it's easy enough to get lost there for an hour or two.

In between came a dozen courses made from turnips, carrots, peas, beets, cauliflower and potatoes. Two see-through bands of lardo on grilled white asparagus and, down at the bottom of vegetable minestrone, some bits of chorizo that would have fit into a gum wrapper were the only visible signs of animal flesh. My employer paid $375 for my dinner. While I can't call it a bargain, I can say without pausing to think that I would skip espresso for two months until I had enough money to try Alain Passard's vegetable tasting menu at L'Arp\u00e8ge again. There are tasting menus that leave you glutted and blunted. This one made me feel more awake. I don't just mean that I didn't need to be carried out to the Rue de Varenne on a stretcher at the end of the night, although that was nice, too. Mr. Passard's cooking pulled me in like a conversation with a smart, literate, funny friend. When he sent out a mirrored bowl of quartered baby turnips, saut\u00e9ed in butter, with firm, barely sweetened rhubarb, I leaned forward -- wait, what? -- then sat up. The carrots and peas and so on tasted as bright and vivid as any I've had, but there was something more. If vegetables can have feelings, these did. They tasted happy. The emotional valence of the turnip and its friends is a hot topic in cooking these days. Many chefs have been saying lately that their imaginations are no longer fired by pork chops and chicken wings, that the most exciting frontiers in cuisine are growing in the garden. Vegetables are both medium and message in the arty, sculpture-park assemblages by chefs including Dominique Crenn and Christopher Kostow in Northern California and John Fraser and Shaun Hergatt in New York City, to name just a few. In the rising cult of the vegetable, L'Arp\u00e8ge is seen as an example, an inspiration and an early adopter. If you have been following global restaurant news, you've probably read that France stopped mattering after nouvelle cuisine flared down. By 2000 the culinary zeitgeist had decamped, fluttering over Spain for a while before winging its way north to sprinkle magical lichen powder around Scandinavia. Recently, it's been sighted in South America. According to this narrative, France may be fun for a no-reservations meal in a hipster bistro whose chef goes camping with David Chang , but it's certainly not one of the countries that call the shots anymore. I'm sorry to say this, but that narrative is a lie dreamed up by people who want to put France in its place. The most dramatic example of a restaurant that won't fit into that story is L'Arp\u00e8ge. While chefs in other countries were racing into the future, Alain Passard was tortoising around his three farms, learning about soil amendments and natural predators, picking vegetables in the morning so they could ride the high-speed train into Paris in time for lunch. Now that this seems like useful stuff to know again, chefs are starting to pay tribute. In David Kinch 's recent book \"Manresa,\" named for his restaurant in Los Gatos, Calif., he devoted a chapter to Mr. Passard. \"Passard, who recognized the importance of a cook's relationship to the land and those who work it long before it became fashionable, is now rightly considered a visionary by the best chefs in the world,\" Mr. Kinch wrote. \"His philosophy helped change the course of gastronomy by inspiring chefs to reflect their immediate natural environment in their dishes.\" Mr. Kinch had the latest in perhaps a dozen meals at L'Arp\u00e8ge last month. \"It's a better restaurant now than it ever has been,\" he said. \"There's been an evolution in his understanding of vegetables. He seems to have reached another level in his cooking, right now.\" The chef Dan Barber , who researched Mr. Passard's career for his recent book, \" The Third Plate ,\" points out that L'Arp\u00e8ge's devotion to vegetables expands on ideas pioneered by the nouvelle cuisine generation. What Mr. Passard contributed was \"this idea of bucking what's expected,\" which Mr. Barber called \"a throughline in his career.\" Today, he said, Mr. Passard's iconoclasm has given him a freedom that many of his peers envy. \"I don't know a chef who wouldn't want to cook like that, an improvisational vegetable experience,\" Mr. Barber said. After L'Arp\u00e8ge opened in 1986, Mr. Passard's slow-motion method for cooking meat to an unrivaled juiciness in pans that were barely hot enough to melt chocolate made him one of the leading chefs in France. Then, in 2001, he announced that he was done with red meat and seafood. Customers at his restaurant, perhaps the most expensive in Paris, would dine mostly on leaves, roots and stems. Alain Ducasse and Charlie Trotter had served elaborate vegetable tastings, but they didn't bet the farm on the idea. Mr. Passard did, in more ways than one. At his three farms in various regions of France, the agriculture goes beyond organic. The soil is turned over by horse-drawn plow at one, and ponds have been dug so bug-eating frogs can do the work of insecticides. Mr. Passard's break was not dogmatic or final. Roasted lamb and lobsters cut lengthwise into four equal quadrants, another early innovation, have reclaimed their slots on the menu. Even so, the vegetable experiment has grown into something important, and the only way to understand how far it has taken him is to eat at L'Arp\u00e8ge. There is no Arp\u00e8ge Bistro or natural-wine bar, no Passard Pizzeria at Charles de Gaulle Airport. A big yellow caution flag flies from any write-up of a single meal. In this case, the flag is bigger and yellower than usual. Even googly-eyed fans admit that meals at L'Arp\u00e8ge are not always transcendent, that the Art Deco dining room can look a bit weary, that the level of cooking and service can thud to the ground while the prices remain above the clouds. I saw hints of a more gravity-bound Arp\u00e8ge when, 10 minutes after I'd eaten wafer-light miniature tarts of beets and turnips, the same course arrived again. There was more redundancy when two vegetable medleys were served back to back. So with one hand I'll wave that yellow flag but with the other I'll type out this message: For its lightness, brightness, beauty and elegance, my single meal at L'Arp\u00e8ge was in an eye-opening class by itself. Apart from the radishes and the extraordinary mesclun salad dabbed with a vinaigrette of fresh-ground hazelnuts, heat was applied to most of the vegetables I ate, but they tasted more fresh and unmediated than if they had been raw. The green garlic soup under white peaks of ham-infused whipped cream, the vegetable ravioli in their glassine-thin wrappers bobbing in a precise, utterly clear vegetable consomm\u00e9, the young yellow carrots and sweet peas in a beautifully done vol-au-vent shell surrounded by a fresh, milky white onion sauce: The cooking was so unfussy and purposeful that it was almost transparent. How does he do it? Don't ask the chef unless you collect aphorisms. I wondered aloud in a later phone interview about the idea for that turnip and rhubarb saut\u00e9, and Mr. Passard told me, through an interpreter: \"I did not create that dish. Nature created that dish.\" It's worth noting, too, that he gets his effects without rare, bragging-rights species that look as if they came from the far side of the moon. \"It's tough to get a good tomato, a good carrot,\" he said. \"It's best to focus your effort on the quality of known products rather than trying to go around and offer things nobody has ever heard of.\" That insistence that the ordinary can be luxurious is going to be part of Mr. Passard's legacy, along with some of his other ideas: farming as a logical extension of cooking; time and place not just as passing inspiration but as the whole point; the fresh creativity made possible by ditching old achievements and starting over; and finally the example, almost unknown these days, of a renowned chef who, at 57, still cooks in his restaurant almost every day. If all that time in the kitchen weighs on him, it didn't show when Mr. Passard entered the dining room. When he reached my table and asked where I was from (\"Ah, New York! I have never been there.\"), he seemed to have springs in his shoes as he bounced lightly on his toes like a bandleader. He looked free. 84, rue de Varenne, Seventh Arrondissement, Paris; 011-33-1-47-05-09-06; www.alain-passard.com .

Glossy and dark, it looked, if you had a suggestible turn of mind, something like the barrel of a snub-nose revolver, with a metallic sheen it got from its seaweed wrapper, a rare blend of green and black kelp. The gunpowder was inside: an extra-hot, nostril-punishing slug of wasabi implanted alongside strands of sweet squash, waiting to go off when I bit into it. The maker of this nifty loaded firearm is Toshio Tomita, the chef and owner of Cagen, which opened last summer in the East Village. Mr. Tomita worked for 16 years for Nobu Matsuhisa , and he has his mentor's ability to bend Japanese tradition in his own directions. If you've tasted the shiso chimichurri at Nobu , you won't be surprised to hear that Mr. Tomita serves it with sashimi at Cagen, but this is his own version, made not just with shiso but also with wild Japanese wild ginger, yuzu juice and more than a little jalape\u00f1o. Next to it is a dish of soy cooked with mirin, but it was the chimichurri I kept coming back to, basting it on pliant slices of skipjack, sea robin or suzuki, the Japanese sea bass. One minute Mr. Tomita will do the unadorned, noninterventionist thing you expect from a Japanese chef. His ingredients, especially the fish he brings in from Japan, are often exceptional. Three broiled fillets of ayu, a Japanese trout, wore nothing but their shimmering skins, the better to show off their delicate freshwater taste. The next he will throw a curve. A plate of small appetizers offered ham deep-fried katsu style with a splotch of Worcestershire on its panko crust, along with a single mouthful of the Nobu classic, miso-marinated black cod, as irresistible as ever. But then there were two little flavor bombs of grape tomato halves barely cooked in white wine and yuzu. Were they pickles or candied fruit, or both? Either way, I wanted more. And what was inside this little paper parcel secured with a twist-tie? A pea-size speck of goat cheese, white chocolate and wasabi. It tasted like an after-dinner mint from another planet. Cagen inhabits the empty shell left behind by Kajitsu when it moved to Midtown . Kajitsu specializes in the vegan cuisine of Japan's Zen temples, and the two basement-level dining rooms of the East Village original had a monastic severity; the walls were coated with sand from Kyoto, and everything else followed that color scheme. Mr. Tomita appears to have moved in and gotten right down to work, without putting too much energy into redecorating. Time has not brightened the interior's subterranean charms, which could use a fresh coat of good cheer. You notice this more at the tables than you do at the counter, where Mr. Tomita's samurai intensity supplies extra atmosphere. Cagen is a kappo ryori restaurant, in which the chef prepares most of the food facing the diners across a counter. (Mr. Tomita's son, Rei, works on hot dishes out of sight in the kitchen.) You can pick a path across the \u00e0 la carte menu or just free-fall with a seven-course, $120 omakase meal. It's a question of budget and time, but the big splurge shows off all the things Cagen does very well: sashimi with that nervy chimichurri, sushi wrapped in grilled seaweed that crackles like autumn leaves, and zaru soba, served as three small ponytail bunches of cool soba noodles. The first is plain, the next is dusted with yuzu peel, the last is freckled with kuro shichimi, the black seven-spice blend. They all get dunked in a soy dipping sauce. When they're gone, you get a pitcher of the hot, cloudy water they were cooked in, for pouring into the dipping sauce. Good as this fancy Cup-a-Soup was, I always wished I had more of the firm, nutty noodles. Then I would look over the counter at the two matching stones that grind each day's soba flour out of whole buckwheat. Each stone is the size of a birdbath and they are powered by hand -- Mr. Tomita's hands. The thought of all that labor was the only thing that stopped me from asking for seconds. *** Given the rate at which Michael White's Altamarea Group spits out restaurants these days, this column has adopted a new policy. The amount of time spent critiquing each Altamarea place will be proportional to the time Altamarea spent coming up with the idea. This review of Ristorante Morini, open since December, will be brief. The name, a tribute to Mr. White's mentor in the kitchen, has been used before, at Osteria Morini , which this new restaurant doesn't resemble in any way. The downtown osteria serves the fun, lusty food of Emilia-Romagna, while the ristorante, on the Upper East Side, is not defined by Italian geography or, really, much of anything. The website promises \"pan-Italian regional cuisine with a menu that covers various seasonal specialties, both inland and coastal.\" Well, that narrows it down. The menu is most similar to that at Mr. White's Marea , and while seafood isn't the only choice, in my experience it tended to outshine other options, like the fine but slightly dull sage-roasted chicken or short rib braised in red wine. Main courses were mostly memorable for their prices, which start at $35 and inflate from there. But dull dishes are rare. Gordon Finn, the executive chef, is turning out the most carefully prepared and well-considered food that the Altamarea Group has given New York since Ai Fiori opened in 2010. You should get an excellent meal if you stick to the cured and raw crudi, like the wonderful bay scallops with bits of pink grapefruit and dots of pistachio pur\u00e9e; the pastas, which are as good as they are at any Michael White restaurant, which is to say they are as good as at any place in the city; and dessert, overseen by Altamarea's corporate pastry chef, Robert Truitt. What you won't get is a solid argument for going there and not to another Altamarea subsidiary. If you want refined, expensive seafood, you can get it in much more attractive surroundings at Marea. Inside Ristorante Morini's split-level space, the chandeliers look like grotesque experiments in stretched skin, and the artwork is the type that speaks eloquently of corporate tax write-offs. Ristorante Morini hasn't bestirred itself to become a unique destination; it seems to want nothing more than a piece of the action in a neighborhood whose residents proved long ago that they don't mind overpaying for pasta.

After a friend and I had finished a small opening snack, the server brought our appetizers and main courses. At the same time. It's impossible to imagine any kitchen, even the most tragically inept one, making the same mistake five years ago. This was a pure symptom of the current small-plates epidemic. The old two-course menu has broken down so badly that some restaurants feel no obligation to send dishes out in any particular sequence, even if diners clearly order appetizers and mains, as we did. Until we work out some protocols for small-plate dining, the way cultures like Spain's have done, we're going to be eating on a lawless, fast-changing frontier. Sometimes innovative restaurants like Recette or Pearl & Ash come swirling out of the chaos. At other times it coughs up half-formed and unconvincing places like Telepan Local. It's easy to imagine what Bill Telepan was thinking. Since 2005 he has done all his sensible, seasonal, ingredients-first cooking in one restaurant, Telepan , on West 69th Street. In a perfect city, Telepan's success would have lured more places of its caliber to the Upper West Side. Instead, the center of gravity of Manhattan's dining scene has migrated steadily downtown, while a looser style has swept in to make even relatively youthful places like Telepan look a bit antediluvian. A small-plates menu in TriBeCa must have seemed like a way for Mr. Telepan to reach diners who couldn't find Columbus Avenue without the aid of an Uber driver. In practice, Telepan Local, which Mr. Telepan opened on Greenwich Street in early January with Joel Javier as chef de cuisine, offers most of the drawbacks of small-plates eating and almost none of the advantages. As at so many of these restaurants, the dishes at Telepan come out whenever, they land wherever, and you have no idea if you're going to get too much food or too little. The meal unfolds, or unravels, on tables built in Nicaragua from dark and white slats of wood approximately cobbled together. They are the size of the ones in cocktail lounges where, in another era, people had manhattans and mixed nuts while waiting to be moved to the dining room. Now, this is dinner: glasses for water, wine and cocktails; blue carafes for carbonated water and clear ones for filtered tap; bottles of wine; plates for eating and plates for serving; and a votive candle, all vying for two or three square feet of real estate. Something's got to give, and it is the silverware, which falls to the floor with surprising frequency. Or maybe it jumps, through some instinct for self-preservation. \"We're a farm-to-table American tapas restaurant,\" my server said one night. \"All the food is small plates that you can share.\" In fact, many plates struck me as too small, even for one. The carrots, tiny and multicolored and al dente, tossed with oregano and bits of feta, come in a dish slightly bigger than a coffee lid. They cost $8, which in many restaurants would get you a side dish two or three times larger. A special of bay scallops with black-trumpet-mushroom pur\u00e9e was delicious, but there were six of them, and three of us. The price was $16. A $12 plate of eggs scrambled with smoked trout and fried bread worked out to about two forkfuls for each of us. These dishes were all sensitively made from great ingredients, but they were all a bit well-mannered for this style of dining. The best small plates cause a clamor. Sharing them provokes tension: Who's getting the last bite? That question came up with the wonderful little grilled cheese panini topped with a Spanish tomato-garlic-olive oil spread. And I could imagine arguing over the sea scallops and diced fried potatoes bathed in warm olive oil and spicy Aleppo pepper. But far more often, after a bite of, say, soft cauliflower in Cheddar sauce, or a mini-pizza with fried calamari over tomato sauce, or corned tongue with charred cabbage (really good) and Russian dressing (not quite as good), I would nod happily, and move on to the next thing. A single taste of some plates was too much. With its shrimp poppers -- peculiarly bland fried shrimp stuffed with peculiarly bland crab and fish mousse -- Telepan Local seemed to be trying to imitate Red Lobster and not quite succeeding. Fried watercress with cashews and chile sauce was an obvious homage to a Thai dish, yet it lacked the rippling energy of lime juice and fish sauce that any number of restaurants in Queens would have given it. Telepan Local's pigs in blankets, however, perfectly mimicked everybody else's pigs in blankets. Some of the best small-plates restaurants are glorified bars; picture tapas joints in Barcelona or izakayas in Tokyo or wine bars in Paris. Telepan Local looks at first as if it might fit the bill, with its long line of white barstools in an aggressively mirrored corridor up front. And the wine list is intriguing and affordable. But I had a hard time finding anybody who knew the bottles; one night my server couldn't tell me about any of the three Greek whites except the one poured by the glass. The cocktail list comes on strong, too. Most of the spirits are distilled locally; bitters are made on site. And I was surprised by the low-key sophistication of the Mai O Mai, a pineapple juice and rum concoction. The rest were too sweet, except for a gin and tonic that was too flat and a martini variant, the Jabberwocky, that was too warm. I had one of the worst desserts of the year at Telepan Local, a galette of underripe, undercooked pears on a gummy, doughy crust. I also had one of the best. Larissa Raphael, who pulls double duty as pastry chef here and at Telepan, has come up with a champion recipe for coconut cake that is rich like poundcake but lighter -- poundcake that could fly. Maybe it can fly right out of this small-plates version of Telepan Local and into one that makes sense, not an American tapas restaurant but simply an American neighborhood restaurant. Some of the understated cooking that gets lost when it's shared by the whole table might, in more generous portions, make lovely appetizers or main courses for one.

Mr. Chang's unpredictable appearances in the kitchen are at least as famous as his Sichuan-style dry-fried eggplant. He used to have a habit of quitting any restaurant where his food had attracted a fanatical following or, worse, a good review. This, of course, made his followers all the more fanatical. He hopscotched around Chinese restaurants in Virginia, turned up at several in Georgia and was briefly sighted in Virginia again before surfacing in Tennessee for a minute or two. He must be the only chef in America whose Wikipedia entry contains a section called \"Disappearances and movement.\" The current, stable period of his career began when he struck up a business partnership with Gen Lee, a Chinese chef in semiretirement. Three years ago, they opened Peter Chang China Grill in Charlottesville, Va. An owner at last, Mr. Chang did not quit this time. Not that he stayed put, exactly. He and Mr. Lee quickly began colonizing the rest of the state, planting Peter Chang restaurants in Fredericksburg, Williamsburg, Virginia Beach and here. They hope to open one in Fairfax, outside Washington, later this year. Now, instead of worrying that Mr. Chang's menu will disappear overnight, his admirers play a different kind of shell game. On any given day he will probably be cooking in a Peter Chang restaurant, but which one? Before coming to Virginia with a plan to eat at three of his places in 24 hours, I asked one of my operatives in the state to gather intelligence from a source inside Chang headquarters. \"The betting on Chef's whereabouts -- and he generally informs no one of where he intends to pop up -- is Monday-Tuesday in Virginia Beach, Wednesday-Thursday in Richmond, and Friday-Saturday in Fredericksburg,\" my informant wrote. \"I'm assuming it's subject to change on a whim.\" In fact, when I got to Virginia Beach that Monday, I learned that Mr. Chang was in Fredericksburg. But the night before in Short Pump, where I hadn't expected to spot him at all, he was lingering casually by the front door. At some point, he slipped into the kitchen. Scallion pancakes led off. These were not the flaky pancakes I knew, though. They were air-filled puffs, as round and light as a beach ball. I tore off a patch, dipped them into a dish of warm curried broth, and wondered how the puffs still kept their shape. A minute later there were spring rolls, green leaves of cilantro showing through the wrappers, with an airy filling of flaky ginger-seasoned flounder. It sounds too simple to be as delicious as it was. Then we were given a piece of woven cane, the kind used for chair seats, bent into a cone and pinned with a skewer. Inside were chunks of crisp, nearly greaseless fried flounder tossed with a small salad of cilantro sprigs, sweet onions, dried chiles and cumin. Cilantro, chiles and cumin appeared again with dry-fried eggplant, float-away sticks that made me think of eggplant marshmallow. There were Sichuan standards, too: spicy dan dan noodles with an expertly gauged sweet-sour ratio and a numbing blast of Sichuan peppercorns; outstandingly crisp and tender twice-cooked pork; beef with tofu-skin noodles lightly scored on one side to catch the searing chile oil; and, to tamp down the fires, cooling chunks of firm raw cucumber dressed with garlic. This was Chinese cooking with true finesse. The muscular Sichuan dishes were unusually well balanced, while the charm of some others was arrived at through subtle and delicate means. The United States has any number of very skilled Chinese cooks. It has far fewer who put their skills in the service of the imaginative leaps we expect from major chefs. By the end of my dinner in Short Pump, I had no doubts that Mr. Chang is one of them. At one time, talent like Mr. Chang's was not so rare in this country. After the Communist takeover of mainland China in 1949, many of the country's top chefs fled. After the federal Immigration Act of 1965, a number of them moved to New York, which was exposed for the first time to extraordinary Sichuanese and Hunanese cooking. In 1971, Raymond A. Sokolov wrote in The New York Times that \"Chinese chefs have emerged as figures of the same importance as French chefs.\" The most famous of all was probably Tsung Ting Wang , the chef of Shun Lee Dynasty on Second Avenue in Midtown. Ed Schoenfeld, the operating partner of the two RedFarm restaurants in Manhattan, began his career in Chinese restaurants during that era. He recalls T. T. Wang as \"world class, a Ferran Adri\u00e0. Just an incredibly great chef.\" \"I met a group of people like that,\" Mr. Schoenfeld said. \"When they died, I didn't come across any others.\" The profession of chef nearly vanished from mainland China, and with it the apprenticeship system through which highly trained chefs passed on what they knew. Peter Chang was born in 1963 in a poor village (\"not even a village\" Mr. Lee said) in Hubei Province, next door to Sichuan. By the time he was a teenager, China had begun to value its cooking traditions again, and he was sent to culinary school in Hubei. He worked in hotels and on cruise ships on the Yangtze River, where the woman he would later marry, Lisa Chang, was his supervisor. In 2000, after auditioning for the government, he was dispatched to Washington as chef of the Chinese Embassy. After two years, he left that job and began his suburban wanderings, as chronicled by Calvin Trillin in a 2010 New Yorker article . The restaurants where he alighted were as unlikely as the ones where he has now settled down, in his restless way. He has a special affinity for strip malls in cities that are not particularly known for the vibrancy of their Chinese restaurants. When he opens a new place, local newspapers tend to tell readers that it is not affiliated with P. F. Chang's . Sean Brock, the chef of McCrady's in Charleston, S.C., and the Husk restaurants in Charleston and Nashville, estimated that he had eaten about 15 meals in Mr. Chang's restaurants, and said that each time, \"I feel like I'm sitting in a roomful of people who don't know how lucky they are. He's got legions of fans, but you can tell that not everybody in the dining room knows where they're sitting.\" Peter Chang's servers, most of whom look like local college students, do not push too hard when they inform customers that the kitchen makes familiar dishes like General Tso's chicken along with more adventurous, chile-laden items. Pointing to the list of cold Sichuan appetizers, one explained: \"They tend to be a little more out of the box. I like a lot of them, but that's just me. The other menu has some more Americanized dishes. It's not as weird as the other stuff.\" In Williamsburg, before I could eat pigs' feet stir-fried with dried chiles and Sichuan peppercorns, I had to overcome my server's gentle concern. As I had hoped, the feet were fantastic. The Sichuan hot-and-numbing effect put an electric charge in the sticky, crunchy bits of skin, but the spice never overpowered the deeply flavored pork. Tea-smoked duck stir-fried with sticks of ginger, another high point of that meal, was more restrained, but just as flavorful. A couple of other dishes there did not have the same sharp focus. That was true in Virginia Beach, too, where I ate crispy pork belly that looked like the great bamboo shrimp I'd had in Short Pump but didn't have nearly the same impact. Other dishes, though, were remarkable. Cold cucumber with garlic and cilantro outraced the Short Pump version; noodle soup with brisket seemed to get better as the meal went on; and a kind of pan-fried ravioli called Golden Marble, filled with soft tofu seasoned with shrimp and cilantro, was a subtle knockout. Virginia Beach also had a dim sum menu devised by Mr. Chang's wife. I would return just to find out whether it is all as delicious as the domed, pan-fried bun stuffed with lightly sweetened pork I tried. The fans who say that the best Peter Chang restaurant is the one where Mr. Chang is cooking may be on to something. The best of my three meals, start to finish, was the one in Short Pump. But the others still offered cooking of unusual power and subtlety, and introduced me to dishes I'll remember for a long time. In fact, I could make a strong case that the best Peter Chang restaurant is the nearest one, as long as you order so many things that the server starts to act as if you might be insane. And then eat until you think you can't hold any more. For that, Mr. Brock has developed a strategy: \"You run outside, you go to the parking lot, you run around, you go to the bathroom, you splash cold water on your face until you can eat again.\" When that stops working, he said, he orders it all again, to take home.

That is all. Thank you for your time. On second thought, there may be a little more to say. Because great restaurants can fade fast, especially these days, and Jean-Georges Vongerichten's serene flagship serves a city vastly different from the one it set out to dazzle and seduce 17 years ago last month. Back then, Jean-Georges was a radical reimagining of the grand style of French dining, \"an entirely new kind of four-star restaurant,\" as Ruth Reichl put it in her review for The New York Times. Jean-Georges didn't just blow the dust off the candelabra; it tossed them out. In a room that was all right angles and Manhattan energy, men and women servers (a rarity in formal restaurants then) circulated with unfussy, level, American poise. Most of all there was the brilliant cooking, which was lighter, brighter and more embracing of other cultures than French food had any right to be. What we want from restaurants is changing, though, along with our notions of luxury. The kind of comfort Jean-Georges excels at providing makes some diners distinctly uncomfortable. Chefs who couldn't peel a banana when Jean-Georges Vongerichten got his first four-star review ( for Lafayette , in 1988) now run adventurous, unluxurious dining rooms where people come for the journey and where the thrill of the ride is more important than the condition of the shock absorbers. Jean-Georges glides like a Mercedes sedan, but Mr. Vongerichten takes the curves like a Formula One driver. Consider the squab dish that just popped up on the menu. It comes on like jerk chicken, coated in a blackened rub, and while the seasonings are Middle Eastern, the searing heat is almost Jamaican. And here comes the creative leap that separates Mr. Vongerichten from other spice-peddlers: a hot sauce has been splashed around this charred squab, and it is made from flowers. A bright-orange blend of lime, fresh red chiles and peppery nasturtium petals, it makes the already fiery squab into what may be the spiciest dish ever served in a French restaurant. Over and over, Mr. Vongerichten takes risks that are almost shocking. A little canal dredged into a pool of sweet parsnip pur\u00e9e is filled with a fruity riesling raisin vinegar, straight up. Taste it alone and you pucker, but swirl it into the parsnips with a forkful of meltingly soft Arctic char under an airy black-truffle crust, and it's spectacular. In the same vein, the buttermilk sauce under red sea bream sashimi or the unsweetened lemon mousse with raw sea trout and roe are almost acidic enough on their own to clean copper pots. Taste a little of everything, though, and the sourness takes its place and galvanizes the rest. There's not much sleight-of-hand in Mr. Vongerichten's cooking. Nearly everything is visible, and the effects can still take you by surprise. Won tons stuffed with grilled foie gras are squirted, somewhat randomly, with a spiced red-wine reduction, but what makes the dish take off are the tart, crunchy passion-fruit seeds and the raw papaya chunks livened up with a dab of lime gel. This skill for getting the greatest impact from just a few components is Mr. Vongerichten's foremost talent. Most of the time, you couldn't take something away from one of his dishes without hurting the whole. This is why so many of his classics still jump with energy; they're not dragged down by pointless ornamentation. Was the sweet sea urchin with slivers of green chile and drops of yuzu on a tongue of black bread invented last week, or last century? What about that intensely aromatic lobster sauce seasoned with fenugreek and lemon grass that surrounds lobster on toast? Or the chicken with the Parmesan crust that stays crunchy for an improbably long time, even after crumbs have fallen into the lemon-butter sauce that has more lemon and more balance than ought to be possible? If you are having your first $118 four-course dinner at Jean-Georges, you won't always know. Regulars will, though. And they may start to wonder, along with me, how many of Mr. Vongerichten's new dishes are as indelible as his greatest hits? I couldn't imagine improving on any of the six savory dishes I enjoyed on a $198 tasting menu of classics. They had all snapped into place for good. The only dish on a spring tasting (same night, same length, same price) that I could pay the same compliment to were the stout asparagus stalks under morels in hollandaise, and I recall people rhapsodizing about them in 1997. This could become a danger to Jean-Georges's pre-eminence. Mr. Vongerichten and his business partner, Phil Suarez, run a company that is responsible for 22 restaurants around the world. Diners tend to worry about this empire-building in terms of quality control: Does the food suffer when the head of state is traveling? It can, even at Jean-Georges. At a recent lunch while Mr. Vongerichten was in Japan, a salmon tartare spring roll, one of the three little bites that opened the meal, wasn't crisp enough to stand up to its lettuce wrap, and the fish was barely seasoned. Gulf shrimp in an appetizer were overpowered by the heavily toasted flavors of fried artichokes and mushrooms, and a lemon-fennel aioli lacked the verve to pull it all together. These were blips, though, well within the standard deviation for one of New York's most daring and high-performing kitchens. In the long run, the greater question is whether Mr. Vongerichten is channeling more of his creativity into building new restaurants than into building dishes that might run 10 years from now on the classics menu at Jean-Georges. Because each dessert is made of several mini-desserts that riff on a single theme, it's hard to tell whether any of them has the staying power of the molten chocolate cake. (It has a permanent spot on the chocolate-themed dessert, and remains better than its imitators.) But as constructed by the pastry chef, Joseph Murphy , almost all of them are deeply, instantly lovable. For anyone feeling left behind by the current fashion for scattershot, disputatious desserts, Mr. Murphy's citrus tasting -- with its tiny, crisp strudel filled with candied kumquats and pistachios, and its plush, delicately floral citron snow and citrus sections over amber riesling jelly -- is an answered prayer. The wine list is book-length. But it is unusually nimble, built for versatility. The chief sommelier, Laura Williamson , has a bottle up her sleeve for any trick the kitchen might pull. Listening to her or one of her colleagues suggest a wine can be a quick, thoughtful education in the principles of pairing. The rest of the dining room staff has the original poise and unfawning attentiveness, but servers can seem remote. Smiles bloom beside some tables, but not all. Lately some top-tier restaurants have invented a new style of service that is seamless, intuitive, guided by a species of emotional intelligence. Jean-Georges hasn't quite evolved. Examples are so minor that they may sound petty, but here's one. A guest of mine approached the reception desk, a sci-fi podium populated by a row of three or four humans with unnervingly perfect teeth, at the same time as two other diners. A host tried to pair them off: \"Are you two together?\" Um, no. Another attempt was made: \"Are you two together?\" Unless Mr. Vongerichten is trying to run a matchmaking service, there are smoother ways to begin. The game can always be played at a higher level. That is the challenge for any restaurant that wants to shine among the striving competition. And Jean-Georges does shine. The restaurant was redesigned in graceful, gentle curves by the architect Thomas Juul-Hansen in 2008 (two years after Frank Bruni's four-star review, its last evaluation in The Times) and is the most elegant modern dining room in the city. The enormous windows let in the setting sun, and sometimes they catch the moon rising over the treetops in Central Park. You are in the city and hovering slightly outside it all at once. Then the food arrives, the flavors fall into their startling alignments, and there is only one place you could be: Jean-Georges.

A Williams College graduate, she remembered its earlier incarnation as the school's alumni club. \"I practically lived here at one point,\" she said, looking over her shoulder at the stuffed peacock stashed in one corner. \"I took almost all my meals here.\" How was the food? \"Ghastly.\" By the end of the night, she announced it is much better now. For that, she can thank her fellow alumni for selling the building on East 39th Street to a developer who turned it into a boutique hotel. Called the William , it opened before Christmas with two upholstered cocktail lounges and two distinct places to eat reformed English cooking. We were upstairs in the Peacock , a civilized, grown-up restaurant where Ray Charles shimmies from the speakers and the wine list is refreshingly nondenominational. One floor below, in the English basement (what other kind would an English restaurant use?) is the Shakespeare , a rustic pub with a rock soundtrack, soccer on both televisions and taps for British lagers and cask ales. The two spots share a kitchen, a chef named Robert Aikens and just enough dishes to justify corralling them into a single review. The food I ate during two dinners at the Peacock and one at the Shakespeare was always appealing; the settings were somewhat less so. This was particularly true in the Shakespeare, where in the early evening packs of beer drinkers can crowd out those of us who are there to find out if the shepherd's pie made by Mr. Aikens is better than the mound of ruined groceries that went by the same name in our mothers' kitchens. It is, by leaps and bounds. The potato crust, golden with sharp Cheddar cheese, blanketed a lamb stew, thickly spiced with thyme and rosemary. All winter, I had hoped something would push back at my interior polar vortex. This cast-iron pot of ground meat buried under mashed potatoes finally did. Other pub standards at the Shakespeare were true to form, like the highly credible bangers and mash and the fish and chips, with a light sheath of custardy batter around a hunk of very fresh cod. The Scotch eggs, molten at the yolk and wrapped in juicy, salty sausage before being plunged into the fryer, were good enough to eat by the dozen, although I would be round as an egg if I had tried. I was annoyed, though, when the $16 \"pint of prawns\" turned out to be a pint glass of ice cubes holding up five nearly flavorless boiled shrimp. The Shakespeare needs to do better than that if it wants customers to put the emphasis on the first word of \"gastro pub.\" Right now, it lands firmly on the second. The Shakespeare's two rooms have low timbered ceilings, and the one with the bar, where I sat, has two TVs bigger than some movie screens. I couldn't make out much beyond that because the place was crammed with after-work warriors there for the drinks, not the food. I couldn't hear much, either. But I did feel something: the creeping damp chill of a full pint of beer that someone, in the crush of bodies, had knocked over on me. A champion drink spiller myself, I wasn't upset. My soaked jeans did undercut the warming effect of the shepherd's pie, though. If I had wanted to get out of those wet clothes and into a dry martini, one of the two cocktail dens at the top of the stairs would have been the place to do it. The armchairs are plush, the paneling is polished, the fireplaces are burning (with gas, but still) and the bartenders don't smirk as they mix cocktails as well structured as a Savile Row suit. The William has given Midtown the hotel bar that I've always wanted out of the Algonquin. The fireplaces came with the building. The plush and polish were supplied by Reid & Taylor Studios, which also designed the Peacock's two contrasting dining rooms. One has the flickering allure of the cocktail dens up front, along with emerald wallpaper in a peacock pattern. I wanted to eat below those peacocks. Apparently so did everyone else, because there were never any free tables. Instead, I was seated in what's called the Garden Room. Bright and oddly underdecorated, it is probably a better place for lunch than for the nocturnal consumption of meat pies. Mr. Aikens, a veteran of Le Gavroche in London, has done the gastro-pub thing before, as chef of the Dandelion in Philadelphia. He is far from a flashy cook. He just believes in doing things the right way, which often means the hard way. As our server put it, \"The simpler the dish, the more complicated he makes it.\" For gammon steak, which in most parts of England would mean a slice of ham on a plate, canned pineapple optional, he starts from scratch. The ham is pork loin, brined in the kitchen, then grilled, as is the slab of fresh pineapple. Potato pur\u00e9e below, a sunny-side egg on top. I can't imagine finding a better gammon steak in England. Details elevate dishes like an honest chicken soup, or grilled Spanish mackerel on toast: the velvety, chardlike softness of the wilted spinach; the sweet-tart tension of the sherry vinaigrette; the crisp snap of the bacon. Roasted chicken came with a terrific plank of fresh pork-and-sage sausage and a run of gravy that neatly managed to taste rich but not oily. I appreciated the robust and musky spices and the fluffy grains of biriyani rice with a lamb curry straight from the kitchens of the Raj. The desserts are staunchly English and tended by Mr. Aikens himself. In another restaurant, this might relegate them to stepchild status, but not here. Mr. Aikens lavishes care on them, not to mention historical research and generous amounts of cream, eggs and butter. The result is a roster of sweets as deeply gratifying as any I've spooned my way through in the past year. One night, Mrs. Beeton's Snow Egg appeared on the Shakespeare's blackboard. The dish, a version of the French oeufs \u00e0 la neige, comes from Isabella Beeton's 1861 manual on household management. In Mr. Aikens's hands, the meringue egg, rising from a sea of warm custard like steam from a hot bathtub, was studded with cracked pralines and decorated with kumquats in syrup. English cooks can work a hundred variations on the same idea, so another night brought a bowl of custard mixed with brioche crumbs below dime-size domes of meringue, melting and soft like marshmallows on a stick. Sandwiched in the middle was warm, fresh raspberry jam. It goes by the name the Queen of puddings, and asking for it is almost as good as eating it.

All'onda is the name, and in truth it's not quite like any other place, although it's not as far-out as the elevator pitch makes it sound, either. The space glows with warm invitation to passers-by on East 13th Street, who can see the communal table and bar downstairs and, through second-story windows, the main dining room. Inside, there are no terrifying beasts with Japanese heads grafted onto Italian torsos, no teriyaki calf's liver or soba pesto. There is nothing terrifying at all. Chris Jaeckle's cooking at All'onda is recognizably and elegantly Italian, and for the most part it's wonderful stuff. Mr. Jaeckle is a sophisticated chef whose marriage of Ligurian and French-Mediterannean cooking at Ai Fiori , under the guidance of Michael White, helped the restaurant win three stars from The New York Times in 2011. At All'onda, he has teamed up with the restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow. The relationship between the two cuisines at All'onda is less a marriage than an infatuation. It's as if an Italian menu had a raging crush on Japan and couldn't stop bringing it up in conversation. Most of this is done so smoothly, you hardly notice. Black truffle risotto, slick with Parmesan and butter, would strike you as old school if you didn't know that Mr. Jaeckle finishes it with the rice mash left over when sake is fermented. The Japanese ingredient adds a rounded, softly fruity flavor that quietly works its way into the risotto. Far more prominent are the flecks of winter truffles, whose aroma, part onion and part animal, goes directly from your nostrils to your brain. Long quills of garganelli are tossed with chunks of sweet crab and toasted bread crumbs. It's all very classic, as is the warm spiciness that lifts up the pasta. But the source of the spice is yuzu kosho, the Japanese condiment fermented from yuzu peel and a weaponized dose of chiles. The way Mr. Jaeckle uses it, though, nearly convinced me that yuzu kosho should be sold at Eataly . As usual with crushes, the object of affection occasionally comes up in a context so strained you have to roll your eyes. All'onda's winning dark chocolate tart grew menacing when it came with a salty scoop of soy gelato. And the most regrettable dish I ate was an ill-advised twist on tortellini in brodo, in which the pasta parcels stuffed with unmelted cheese sat in a gelatinous, lukewarm and indistinct stock made from Parmesan and dashi. Other slight misfires can't be blamed on Japan. The aged-duck rag\u00f9 with bent tubes of pasta called lumache simply needed more depth, as if the soffritto had not been caramelized enough, and the very dark chocolate in the rag\u00f9 and around the rim of the plate didn't cover the deficit. For the most part, though, good sense and good taste prevail. All'onda just opened in early January, and already Mr. Jaeckle has come up with two dishes so appealing that he will have a fight on his hands if he tries to take them off the menu. First, there is the bucatini with sea urchin. Sea urchin pasta is so popular now, it will probably turn up on the menu at the Olive Garden before the year is over, but Mr. Jaeckle has done something novel and delicious with it. The urchin is cold-smoked, which makes it something like briny bacon and, when folded into egg yolks, cream and garlic, makes the rest of the dish something like spaghetti carbonara from the deep. The first time I had it, the bucatini were too soft and doughy, but the next time they had the proper snap to offset their creamy sauce. And there is the short rib for two. The side dish of saffron risotto calls osso buco to mind, but this is not another brown, sticky braise. It's cooked sous vide for three days until the meat is glistening pink-red with veins of rich fat inside, then grilled to give it a spicy black crust. It looks like pastrami, and I can't get it out of my mind. As has been widely reported, New York law now requires raw seafood appetizers in all Italian restaurants. The ones here are generally very good, like hamachi in a soy sauce bath with strands of pickled kuri squash and tiny cubes of peperoncini. Among the main courses there is not one that isn't well thought out, from the skate under a veal glaze to the guinea hen, separated into a roasted breast and confitted leg beneath a naturally sweet pur\u00e9e of parsnips. Like many new restaurants, All'onda isn't strong across the board. Service can be rushed and not exactly polished, and I can't say the soy gelato was the only disappointing so-called sweet. Affogato is no treat when the espresso tastes charred and the ice cream has big ice crystals. Panna cotta flavored with Fernet-Branca is an oddity that would be easier to bear if it were a palate cleanser before a real dessert arrives. Until All'onda gets the rest of its lineup in shape, the dense and lightly crunchy olive oil cake is your best hope. Despite the risks, All'onda is fun and lively enough that I can imagine dropping in once a month or so for a short-rib reunion. This is late-period Chodorow, with the nightclub grandiosity stripped away. The dining room staff looks almost ostentatiously casual -- none more than Chris Cannon. New Yorkers who remember Mr. Cannon in a stiffly knotted necktie standing at attention behind the host stands at Marea , Convivio , Alto or Palio won't recognize him here, where he works as a consultant. He lopes beneath the exposed rafters outfitted in jeans, a plaid shirt, a quilted vest and a backward wool cap. With a dead rabbit or two over his shoulder, he'd look like an Italian winemaker coming back from a hunting trip. If he lopes to your table, get him started about wine. He knows who makes the good stuff in Italy, and laid the foundation for the wine list before Nathan Rawlinson took it over. The list doesn't trawl for big spenders the way some of Mr. Cannon's others have, but many of the bottles taste more expensive than they are. Especially impressive is the carefully edited selection of affordable nebbiolos and the range of 40 sparkling wines, which makes welcome detours beyond prosecco. There's a bit of sake, too, as there is in all the best Japanese-Venetian places.

Now David Chang has. At M\u00e1 P\u00eache , his sunken restaurant at the bottom of the Chambers Hotel in Midtown, the long cross-shaped table that used to bisect the dining room is gone to make room for the carts. Apart from a few dishes that Paul Carmichael's kitchen will prepare to order, like the fried chicken, most of the menu will eventually show up if you wait long enough. \"These are David Chang's pork buns,\" a server says, wheeling by with stacks of bamboo steamers. A minute later comes a portable raw bar, and I say yes to chilled lobster knuckles dipped in a lemon-grass butter that the server just swirled together. Bringing Europe to Asia, some of the trolleys double as gueridons so meats can be carved and sauces heated at tableside. As uses of dim-sum carts go, it's much more clever than stowing a plate of preshucked oysters on the bottom deck. No doubt they were opened just minutes ago, but as they circle the room, they become as inviting as conveyor-belt sushi. At least the raw-bar cart has a theme. A few minutes later comes a server who's hawking about 10 items: two kinds of fritters, several raw seafood dishes and some salads. I can't keep all the choices straight and take only the shrimp balls, although they are so crunchy and juicy I can't consider that a bad outcome. When the trolleys have less to carry, they can turn ordering a meal into a point-and-shoot adventure. Despite a few misgivings (Wouldn't that roasted lamb taste better straight from the oven?), I enjoyed my dim-sum meal much more than the one I had at M\u00e1 P\u00eache a year and a half ago, when the flavors were less focused and Mr. Carmichael's menu seemed to be struggling to emerge from the primordial soup of Momofuku tropes. In its four-year life, M\u00e1 P\u00eache has skittered from one concept to another. If Mr. Carmichael really commits to dim sum, and gives some thought as to which dishes are flattered by the format and how many to send out at once, M\u00e1 P\u00eache may finally find its identity. Or the trolleys may keep rolling right out the door. M\u00e1 P\u00eache, 15 West 56th Street (Fifth Avenue), 212-757-5878, momofuku.com/new-york/ma-peche/ .

This is meant as praise, and not the damning-with-faint kind. The cult of the new in restaurants has brought us many wonders, but it has also left us with the curse of compulsory creativity. It's no longer enough for chefs to cook hot food that makes us happy; they are supposed to dumbfound us with flavors the human tongue has never tasted. This is why writers like me devote energy to, for example, puzzling postmodern taquerias while taking for granted the simple excellence of traditional ones. The change in restaurant culture is something like the shift that overtook popular music after the Beatles. Singing old Cole Porter tunes was out; suddenly every kid with a guitar and an amplifier was supposed to have the songwriting chops of Lennon and McCartney combined. R\u00f4tisserie Georgette isn't writing any new music. The kitchen, now under Chad Brauze, plays standards from the French songbook and plays them well, with what a colleague who has eaten high and low around the city calls \"a refreshing lack of creativity.\" If this restaurant had a clock, its hands would be stopped at five minutes before nouvelle cuisine, when meat was carved to cover the plate and sauce came on the side and nobody turned down potatoes, when people eating a roast with a good but not-too-expensive Bordeaux could hardly imagine a better night out. You can feel this way at R\u00f4tisserie Georgette, although the joys of time travel end with the Bordeaux. Jean-Luc Le D\u00fb 's list has an affordable 2002 Haut-M\u00e9doc from Ch\u00e2teau Lanessan for $62, but the other red Bordeaux have been adjusted for inflation and then some. R\u00f4tisserie Georgette has a real rotisserie and a real Georgette, both easy to spot. There are two rotisseries, in fact, standing back to back in the open kitchen. The one facing the dining room is a tall steel model with brass trim, loaded up with pudgy chickens, small flocks of stuffed quail, dorade locked in a cage with lemon wheels and thyme branches. There is one Georgette. Her last name is Farkas. A coiled spring of proprietary energy, Ms. Farkas started cooking in restaurants at 15, attended hotel school in Switzerland and interned with Alain Ducasse in Monte Carlo. She was on her way to running a restaurant of her own when Daniel Boulud offered her a job. After she said yes, she learned that she would be handling marketing and public relations. That little gig lasted 17 years, which may be one reason that R\u00f4tisserie Georgette seemed to have traveled from another decade when it landed on East 60th Street last November. The loft-height walls are hung with a cluster of antique mirrors, an Aubusson tapestry and bronze Louis XV-style sconces. Carpeting helps muffle the noise, which tends to wane around 9 p.m. This is an early-to-bed crowd, and with an 8:15 reservation one night I was the last to leave. At one end of the room is a porter's chair, its egg-shaped back upholstered in leather. Now I know where to seat the dowager countess when she comes to visit. In some ways R\u00f4tisserie Georgette is a delayed-gratification version of the restaurants opened in the '70s and '80s by young Americans who fell for European ways of dining. What set Ms. Farkas's heartstrings humming were the rotisseries of France. R\u00f4tisserie Georgette will sell you half a chicken for $24 or a whole one, which feeds two people for $36 each. The economy model, raised on an Amish farm in Indiana, is rubbed with herbes de Provence and cracked coriander seeds. Roasted chickens don't always pick up the flavor of the herbs they're stuffed with. These birds do. The legs are tender without disintegrating into strands, as rotisserie dark meat can do. The white meat is close to ideal, with just a whisker of dryness at the narrow tips. The pricier chicken is called the poule de luxe, French slang for a woman with high upkeep costs. It is brought up in Pennsylvania under Mennonite supervision, hides a terrific mushroom stuffing under its skin, and features a slab of seared foie gras that is both unsatisfying and beside the point. Too bad you can't get the stuffing without paying for the liver, but I'm sure if I were French I'd understand that this is always the way with a poule de luxe. There is nothing fancy about the quail, just juicy meat wrapped around a pale-pink poultry forcemeat seasoned with paprika and piquillo peppers. The dorade, roasted whole and then filleted, breaks into beautiful white lemon-scented chunks. A special one night was rotisserie duck \u00e0 l'orange, carved and arranged on a silver platter. Mr. Brauze had defied the modern rule of duck cookery, taking the breast all the way to medium. He knew what he was doing, because medium-rare meat wouldn't have taken as well to the bittersweet orange-peel sauce. Only once was I served meat that didn't come off the spit at the ideal moment: a crumbly, dried-out lamb shoulder with a merguez stuffing that tasted as if it had been left out in the rain. With any main course, the fat-basted rotisserie potatoes are almost required, although the frites, fried to a mahogany crisp, will also do. But a strict meat-and-potatoes diet can be supplemented by creamed spinach with garam masala, tiny and fiery-hot brussels sprouts and purple cabbage stewed with cider and bacon. I'd be surprised if the vegetables at Ms. Farkas's long-ago French rotisseries were worth noticing, but these are. Ms. Farkas put her first initial on the better of two salads, the salade G, with a time-tested mix of endive, pears, blue cheese, bacon and candied walnuts. There is also a salade Francine. If I were Francine, I'd be on the phone with my agent trying to get my name taken off it. Nicole Kaplan, the pastry chef who made her name at Eleven Madison Park and Del Posto , handles the desserts, mostly stock characters from the bistro repertory. The tarte Tatin has been circling the target: the caramel was too scorched one time, not scorched enough the next. But the chocolate souffl\u00e9 hit the bull's-eye, and so did the dark chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me in a coffee mug. Neither was the least bit surprising. That's a compliment, too.

A glass wall stares out at a not-yet-trendy block of Orchard Street. It's blank except for the small menu posted by the door, offering five courses for the relatively modest sum of $55. Hanging on one inside wall, more art than ad, and almost invisible unless you are walking southbound very close to the window, is the restaurant's name in red neon script: Contra . At work in a compact kitchen at the far end of the earnest and narrow dining room are two chefs whose ambitions for Contra are anything but small. They want to create a style of cooking that New York can call its own. \"This is an incredible food city, but sometimes you can see a lack of identity in the restaurants here, where people want to channel another place, another time,\" Jeremiah Stone, a former sous-chef of Rino in Paris who helped open Isa in New York, told Eater shortly before the restaurant opened in October. \"They want to do modern Thai, Roman, creative French.\" His partner in the kitchen, Fabian von Hauske, who worked in the pastry kitchen of Jean Georges and, briefly, at Faviken in Sweden, pursued the idea. \"I don't think there's that much of a style here,\" he said. \"You go to San Francisco and there is definitely a style there when you go to places like Coi or Commis . I think there should be more of an identity here, something that's contemporary that you can't find anywhere else.\" In most other cities, hatchets would be out for a pair of 20-something chefs who rode into town promising to show everybody how it's done. But not New York. Here we just say, All right, kids, let's see what you've got. What Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have is a personal, understated, modern approach to deeply seasonal cooking. Mr. von Hauske makes the desserts and the bread, which costs an extra $3 and is worth it for the supremely creamy butter alone. Mr. Stone does the rest, but their styles are compatible. I'm not enthusiastic about what strikes me as a Northern European phobia of spices, but I came to admire their restraint with salt and added fat. You can see this approach catching on among other young chefs, some of whose food gets lumped in with the New Nordic movement . A more accurate name for their quiet, naturalistic, drama-averse approach may be mumblecore cuisine. Contra, at the moment, pulls it off with an originality that is sometimes dazzling and always worth following. The monkfish that appeared one recent night was cooked with faultless timing, roasted slowly, with the kind of tender pink center you'd find inside a seared scallop. It shared its chunky earthenware plate with leaves of charred kale, a marmalade of caramelized onions and a fish-sauce foam, but if you are thinking Vietnamese-molecular fusion, forget it. The fish sauce was a complex and milky froth made of monkfish bones and smoked trout, and it was very, very good. This was truly expressive cooking, exploring shades of flavor more watercolor than acrylic. The dish is either changed or gone by now, no doubt, but the impression lasted. And I won't forget Contra's pairing of chicken breast with pickled daikon, toasted sesame seeds and blood sausage. The sausage had been transformed into a swipe of soft, tangy, beet-red paste, dotted with marjoram leaves and tart nubs of dried raspberries. It all came together in a way so unexpected and right that I had to shake my head. New dishes roll onto the tasting menu every few days, and old ones are subject to restless tinkering. (Old, at Contra, means anything that was invented before today.) The first time I ate monkfish there, a mash of raw walnuts and garlic in miso was trying out for the role that was later played, with more depth, by the onion jam. And I liked watching the evolution of a raw scallop dish outfitted with noodle-like ribbons of raw kohlrabi. As wide as seatbelts the first time, they had slimmed down and looked more like fettuccine the next. On the other hand, the dried raspberries had gone from the blood-sausage swoosh the second time I saw the monkfish. I missed them a little. You get the luck of the draw at restaurants that offer only tasting menus, but the format suits Contra's food unusually well. The flavors are subtle, and on first encounter it's a bit like walking out of the daylight and into a candlelit room: you need to adjust. Five courses is enough time to open your eyes (you may get more time than you need on nights when the pace drags). Another advantage of the tasting menu becomes clear when you are served dessert, followed by a second dessert. As you may have guessed, Mr. von Hauske is judicious with sugar and quite comfortable with vegetables. I liked a beets-and-yogurt number more than I did a creamed gianduja studded with tough sunchoke chips that put up more of a fight than I could face at the end of the night. But at least I knew everybody else would be crunching along with me, and I'd already smiled my way through a less-antagonistic dessert, a kind of rebuilt apple crisp, with an oat crumble and whipped oat-infused custard around a cider-like apple granita. This dessert was pure fun and charm, like Mr. von Hauske's partnering of tangerine granita with a smooth popcorn-infused mousse and smashed bits of caramel popcorn. Linda Milagros Violago, who stocked the cellars at Mugaritz in Spain and Geranium in Denmark, has put together a list of bottles from the kind of small winemakers who think of themselves as farmers and avoid modern tricks. The results aren't always what you'd predict; a French cider, she said, had a note of blue cheese, and it did. The list almost forces you to try something unfamiliar, which feels just right for this restaurant. I hope Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske achieve all their goals except the one about creating a shared New York style. The crazy riot of voices chattering in hundreds of accents is the whole point of this crazy, riotous city they have adopted. We don't need other chefs imitating Contra's style. We've got the original now.

He cleared his calendar the next morning, canceling all reservations and putting off new ones until he could talk to these prospective partners. \"I literally got inundated with investment opportunities,\" Mr. Smookler said in a phone interview on Thursday. \"I was trying to meet with all those people, so I had to stop that anyway,\" referring to the existing reservations.

With the first bite of my first course at a new restaurant in Brooklyn called Dover , I knew I'd been missing something else, too. Broiled oysters. Specifically, these were Wellfleet oysters, keeping warm under a lightly toasted blanket of one of those eggy, creamy Gallic sauces. Vaguely old-fashioned, the oysters were just rich enough to feel like an extravagance without bringing on gloomy reflections about the brief duration of our time on earth. It turned out that my winter had been missing more than just broiled oysters. It was missing the style of cooking that they represent. The style is often French in spirit if not in all its particulars. It is both refined and generous, and it responds to the time of year not just in its choice of ingredients but in its instincts for feeding seasonal cravings. It is a style that Dover's chefs, Joseph Ogrodnek and Walker Stern, practice fluently and charmingly. If the rigorously tweezered austerity that is in vogue in the city's kitchens has begun to seem as comforting as an icicle, Dover's cooking will strike you as a sweet relief. Mr. Ogrodnek and Mr. Stern met in culinary school. Their orbits crossed again at Alain Ducasse's satellite in the Essex House , and then in 2011 when they built Battersby, a broom closet of a restaurant on Smith Street. They worked side by side in a space as roomy as the back seat of a Mini Cooper. (Think of them the next time you say you'd do more cooking if your kitchen were bigger.) Since Battersby opened, long waits have been routine , except for diners who are hungry at the stroke of 5:30 p.m. or who reserve for the much-praised tasting menus. At Dover, a few blocks away on the Carroll Gardens end of Court Street, anyone can make a reservation and everyone gets more breathing room. Fifty or so pale bentwood chairs match the bare wood tables set on bare wood floors. The walls are white or brick, and the paint on the paneled wainscoting is the color of modeling clay. It has the elegant severity of a 19th-century parsonage inhabited by a very neat, unmarried New England minister. There is also a bar in one corner, suggesting that the minister enjoys his cocktails. With some 16 choices under the headings Raw (what it sounds like), First (appetizers), Second (seafood main courses) and Third (meat), the menu is more expansive, too. The servers, bright-eyed and polite, may tell you that it is designed for four-course dining, or may suggest three courses instead. As a professional overeater, I will tell you that four followed by dessert is too much. Three is a fun route if you are hungry and curious, and two with dessert is what, in another era, used to pass for a full dinner. Dover's chefs do not cook for hummingbirds. Caviar pie, at $35, is the cocktail-party classic last seen in the ritzier suburbs, a layered dip of chopped egg and thickened cream under the midnight gleam of American paddlefish roe. Mounding some on folded blini or white toast will make at least two people smile as they scheme to get the last spoonful without looking greedy. For an earthier opening, there is a spicy lamb tartare in yogurt sauce brought to the table with a stack of newly grilled pita. Unannounced on the menu, the pita is an example of the care Dover gives to the small details that make a dish. It's one of several warm breads and savory pastries that appear without notice, like the goug\u00e8res filled with fondue, and a skinny loaf of stecca with a smooth white-bean dip. One of the four slots on Dover's menu should be handed over to vegetables, because the chefs handle them very nicely. An appetizer of roasted cauliflower with toasted hazelnuts and raisins built contrasts (sweet and savory, crunchy and soft) so successfully that every bite was different. A $95 seven-course tasting menu brought sunchokes that had been caramelized until they looked like seared scallops. Even the best sunchokes can use a little help, and these got it from tahini and za'atar, along with candied pine nuts that were sweet and airily crunchy, like kids' breakfast cereal. A French grandmother would say Dover's cream-saturated root vegetable gratin was old hat. Then, if she were smart, she'd eat the whole thing. The gratin is served alongside a roasted chicken for two that has been likened to the NoMad's . The comparison is inevitable in that both birds are presented whole to the table, carved in the kitchen, and brought back in two forms (in Dover's case, the breasts with a simple jus and the legs shredded in a lukewarm salad with a hint of truffles). On my scorecard, the NoMad takes the gold medal in both the dark-meat and white-meat events. Dover's gratin is a winner, though. You never get the sense that Mr. Ogrodnek and Mr. Stern are grandstanding. They are cooking to please, whether they are carefully balancing the lemon juice and cream in an artichoke sauce for black sea bass or trying to inject luxury into the buckwheat served with a terrific duck breast that has a filet mignon tenderness. In the colorless trudge of January, carrots and orange sections arrayed around excellent seared scallops were a treat for tired eyes; the melding of carrots and orange in the sauce made a clear appeal to the taste buds, too. The energetic Vietnamese dressing of lime, peanuts, mint and chiles was a welcome break from the wintry mix, too, and from the richness of grilled lamb ribs. Did a long, bittersweet slab of Brooklyn blackout cake need a scoop of beet ice cream? Does anything? Maybe not. But the clean taste of verjuice sorbet was an elegant counterpoint to the buttery tang of a cheesecake mousse served in a jelly jar. That jar was Dover's one nod to Brooklyn's shaggy armies of picklers, and I'm not sure it was meant that way. Mr. Ogrodnek and Mr. Stern don't seem very interested in playing along with the clich\u00e9s about the borough. It's one reason their restaurant stands out. When you're the last one on the block without a tattoo, you become the conspicuous one.

Every corner of the city is churning out affordable hits of deliciousness, and a long wait is often the only obstacle between wanting some and getting some. Even acclaimed chefs are in this game now, making creative cooking more accessible than ever. And if the meal turns out to be less exciting than you had hoped, you've lost only a few hours and a few dollars. The next day will bring some new taste, a Filipino tapas bar or an artisanal spaetzle truck. So while much of the nonconformist Mexican food at Mission Cantina is curiously unsatisfying, the disappointment does not sting the way it would if the prices were higher. The chef is Danny Bowien, who has a deep talent for short-order cooking that takes loopy twists and turns. His first New York restaurant, Mission Chinese Food , bent Sichuan cuisine into strange new shapes. Its kung pao pastrami, which sounds like a parody of modern food trends, is something I crave on a regular basis. (For now, I am out of luck. A family of mice believed it had squatter's rights on the address, and Mr. Bowien, following a Department of Health order, has closed the restaurant until he can evict the unwanted residents.) Starting with Mission Chinese, Mr. Bowien has been committed to keeping his restaurants within reach of the nonrich. This has become all the more admirable as awards and accolades have piled up around his limited-edition sneakers. Mission Cantina, which opened on the Lower East Side around Thanksgiving, charges less than $10 for almost everything on the menu and gives away sparkling water. For those prices, you don't grumble too loudly when a dish fizzles. And while some of the food can be remarkable and original, a surprising number of things do fizzle on this menu, a book of wet matches from a chef who can make sparks shoot from his fingertips. Like April Bloomfield , Dan Kluger and Alex Stupak , Mr. Bowien brings the habits of a modern American chef to Mexican food. When making tacos, he sees the tortilla not as an edible utensil but as an edible plate. Chile vinegar is available if you ask, but otherwise there is no do-it-yourself taco doctoring. Each taco is a composed dish, garnished and sauced in its own way, theoretically complete. The theory was sometimes true in practice. I loved the mushrooms hiding under what looked like a mutant pepperoni wheel but was really a round of shredded Jack cheese browned on the griddle. A white mush of stewed zucchini with fresh oregano was much more appealing than it will ever sound, and a warm gust of Mediterranean ingredients like pine nuts and raisins did wonderful things for small, sweet eggplant. After the skin-rippling heat of Mission Chinese, the calmer spicing at Mission Cantina is a small surprise, though not necessarily a liability. I didn't taste much cumin in cumin lamb, but the meat got by on its own assertive flavor. A hunk of braised pork cheek was soothing and warm under shredded purple cabbage and pickled habaneros. In some tacos, though, the main ingredients faltered. Fermenting the pineapple in tacos al pastor gave it a tingly acidity, but the pork belly beneath it was flabby and flavorless. The shrimp in a mixed marriage with fried beef tripe tasted heavily of iodine. Carnitas had been disassembled into little fragments of cracklings folded into excessively mild pork shoulder. The parts didn't go back together again, like a clock taken apart by a 5-year-old. Underwhelming fillings like these rarely drew much energy from salsas, which tended to fade into the background. A cucumber salad was dressed by a peanut salsa that seemed to be just ground peanuts. It didn't do much for the cucumbers, which had been left in their thick, bitter skins. Some of the best things on the menu are not in taco form. I would run back for the fried chicken wings, dusted with a spice mix that's like a dehydrated mole poblano, down to the sesame seeds and chocolate. Mexican cousins of the magnificent ones from Mission Chinese Food, the wings are one of the few dishes in which Mission Cantina pushes so hard against the original cuisine that it breaks through to the other side. Crunchy, fiery and messy, they are both recognizable and new. There's almost nothing recognizably Mexican about the bowl of supple, tender collards braised in beer above fluffy, creamy masa treated like grits. With an angry orange sluice of hot sauce on top, this masa is Southern, if it's anything, and it's so good I ordered a second bowl while I was still spooning up the first, shaking my head over the profound corn flavor. Consistency was beside the point at Mission Chinese Food, which could have been subtitled Fast, Cheap and Out of Control. None of the dishes there tasted the same way twice, but they always tasted good. That's not the case at Mission Cantina, where little variations from night to night can mean trouble. Deep-fried chicken livers on a tostada spread with pur\u00e9ed white beans were as creamy and sweet as whipped butter one night. On another they were hard, dry, unlovable things, and the pickled chipotles that had made the tostada so exciting the first time were applied stingily. Maybe the kitchen was running low on supplies, because the tacos were missing the white onions that usually lent them a crisp, juicy lift. Later in the meal, a rotisserie chicken, good if not earth moving, came with rice so greasy I put down my fork. The tortillas varied, too, but they have been getting better. A little dense at first, they have started to bloom on the griddle into a low-rise fluffiness. But from the start they have had that deep, fragrant corn flavor that I had admired in the bowl of collards. Mission Cantina makes all its masa from excellent dried field corn kernels, which is not especially complicated but takes time and effort. The work is absolutely worth it, opening up flavors and aromas that are as alluring as they are short-lived. Making masa from scratch is not, to put it mildly, the easiest way to run a Mexican restaurant. If you are running an inexpensive Mexican restaurant on the Lower East Side, it's almost lunatic. And it's awesome. It tastes like a promise from Mr. Bowien that one day everything on the menu will soar to its level.

After that, I sharpened my sales pitch. I told people that we would be inhaling ramen that is famous in Tokyo, and for good reason. I said that we would be drinking beers that were more unusual and delicious than what they were used to, and that for ballast we'd put down a layer of lamb sausage. I noted that we might sit at a tapas bar that in flavor and spirit comes as close to the Spanish ideal as any place in New York. That worked. Once I had convinced them, my guests tended to like everything about this food court, called Gotham West Market , except getting there. It occupies a block of 11th Avenue in the West 40s that lately feels less like Hell's Kitchen than Hell's Freezer. But the inconvenient address is the reason this new eating adventure exists. It was built to lure renters to Gotham West , the 1,238-unit apartment complex above and behind it. As any New York real estate agent can tell you, even buyers who think of themselves as pioneers don't want to mill corn and slaughter hogs like Pa Ingalls. Gotham West's developer tried to answer that objection by bringing forth a troop of places to eat in a spot that had almost none. It is not the only effort to upgrade the food court , long the province of soft pizzas, sludgy stir-fries and swollen cinnamon rolls. A few blocks south, the sprawling Hudson Yards development will have a food hall (the preferred term these days), as will Brookfield Place in Battery Park City. This spring, Crown Heights in Brooklyn will get Berg'n , a beer hall with food from stalwarts of the Brooklyn Flea and Smorgasburg. Anthony Bourdain, meanwhile, has driven his fans into a near frenzy with his plan to bring street food from around the world to Manhattan. With an unusual degree of imagination, Gotham West smartly stakes out a middle ground between the star power that packs Eataly and the hope of discovery that drives small-business proving grounds like Smorgasburg and the Golden Shopping Mall in Flushing, Queens. Somewhere between famous and brand new, at least to New Yorkers, is Ivan Orkin , the American chef who taught himself to make ramen in Tokyo. Manhattan is becoming enmeshed in ramen, but his noodles at Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop stand out from the tangle. Of the traditional ramens, my favorites are the shio, a supercharged chicken soup of phenomenal depth and clarity, and the vegetarian shoyu, darker and heartier, tasting of soy sauce and roasted mushrooms. Both broths were scalding hot, with a fatty richness that made my lips slippery. After the first few mouthfuls of rye noodles, I put down my chopsticks and stared into the white ceramic bowl, trying to see where all that flavor was coming from. If I ever showed up at Slurp Shop in a linen suit, I might forgo slurping and order roasted-garlic mazemen, a more recent style that dresses the noodles in a thick sauce, something like Italian pasta. Or I might eat a rice bowl. The one with smoked whitefish tastes like a Japanese translation of a morning at Russ & Daughters. But I was even more taken by the one topped with tender, soy-rich pork and a smear of salty, sour plum paste. The chef Seamus Mullen is here, too. His tapas bar, El Colmado, expands on the Spanish menu he developed at Tertulia but is set up so it's easier to drop in and graze and drink wines from Catalonia or Bierzo and pretend that 11th Avenue is in Spain. El Colmado feeds the illusion. The cooks are dressed in sky-blue grocers' jackets and dark gray caps, and the counter is propped with jars of squid and cans of piment\u00f3n next to oysters on ice. They are excellent, as is the Serrano ham, which falls from a vintage Berkel slicer in shaggy pink leaves that are meltingly pliable. With the exception of fried artichokes smothered below overdressed arugula, the cooking has a light hand that befits the elemental flavors of Spanish cuisine. Frying is a strength, in croquettes filled with smoked eel, or fried whitebait, their pinpoint black eyes staring up from a swirl of lemon-yellow aioli. Lamb meatballs are a model of the form. So are the gambas al ajillo, red shrimp in a quarter-inch of garlic- and shrimp-infused olive oil that I would drink from a shot glass. The market showed some discernment in electing Caroline Fidanza's Little Chef as a delegate from Brooklyn. Ms. Fidanza helped create the borough's current restaurant aesthetic as the first chef of Diner in Williamsburg, before she downshifted to a smaller shop, Saltie . Little Chef's menu expands a bit on Saltie's, adding soups and spirited juice blends. (I'm a fan of the carrot and fresh turmeric cocktail.) The core mission is the same, though: lavishing care on breakfast and lunch with a modest roster of eggs and sandwiches. Simplicity is luxury in the Ship's Biscuit, a raft of creamy scrambled eggs and ricotta on very fresh focaccia studded with crunchy sea salt. Across the hall, staring down the largely vegetarian pleasures of Little Chef with a meaty gleam in its eye, is the Cannibal. An outpost of the cultish East 29th Street original steered by the chef Francis Derby, this baby Cannibal makes do without a full-fledged kitchen. Sometimes it shows; the brussels sprouts I had tasted like Thanksgiving leftovers. There is a baked Japanese sweet potato that was a wonderful thing to find at the end of a cold walk, but in general charcuterie is the strong suit here, like spicy lamb sausages in natural casings or a surprisingly gentle sausage of juicy rock shrimp with fennel pollen. Even better is the beer fridge, shelved with obscurities that the servers expertly match with your tastes. Some spots are geared for the day-to-day needs of locals. Genuine Roadside is an all-day diner annex designed and run by AvroKO , the design firm that did the rest of the market. I got more of a kick out of the hipster-truck-stop d\u00e9cor, with its shelf of vintage beer cans that includes deep verticals of Schlitz, than I did from an uninspiring pulled pork sandwich or the hard-shell ceviche taco spackled together with guacamole. But if I lived upstairs, I would make an occasional lunch of the fried chicken sandwich. And I would be devoted to the high-end heroes built by the Court Street Grocers Sandwich Shop. Dessert is a weak spot, especially at night. Little Chef, which bakes homey sweets during the day, closes at 6 p.m. Another early closer is the Blue Bottle Coffee kiosk. The baked goods devised by one of its owners, Caitlin Freeman, like crisp almond biscotti with more than a hint of saffron and the excellent, sweet-and-savory shortbreads, taste best between sips of state-of-the-art coffee and espresso. After dark, the best choices are the old-school flan from El Colmado or the s'mores icebox cake from the Cannibal, worth ordering just so you can see the toasted marshmallow slab. Nearly every vendor has counter seating, but servers will run food out to the communal tables and benches in the center of the hall, which is handy if you want ramen and your friends want tapas. The offer is always made with a smile; while the businesses are separately run, they share a common spirit of friendliness. It's as if everybody knows you didn't really want to come to 11th Avenue.

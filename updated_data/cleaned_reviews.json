[{"id": 0, "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/dining/babs-review-pete-wells.html", "review_text": " Over the years, I have eaten many bowls of pasta with clams that have been rewired by a chef who was trying to stand out. But I had not come across one that made as much sense to me as the big, sloshing platters you get at old-line Italian-American clam bars like Randazzo's until tripping into a new Greenwich Village restaurant called Babs this summer. Mind you, virtually the only Italian thing about the tagliatelle with clams at Babs was the tagliatelle. The sauce was a mustard beurre blanc, one of those French sauces that all culinary-school students are supposed to be able to make in their sleep. Mustard beurre blanc is often found providing a decorous yellow veil over a chicken breast or salmon fillet. It is not normally poured over noodles. But, tossed with salty French ham and Manila clams smaller than a thumbprint, it made a strangely exciting bowl of pasta that was much more coherent than it sounds. Once I got to know Babs better, I understood that strange excitement is what it does best. Its chef, Efr\u00e9n Hern\u00e1ndez, has talked about Babs as a European grill, and many of the dishes are seared over hot charcoal, but he has a wider frame of reference than that. He was raised in Southern California by immigrants from Mexico, and Mexican cuisine runs through his menu like an underground stream that sometimes gurgles up to the surface. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez is not particularly interested in fusion, though; as far as I can tell, he likes rubbing cultures together to see what color the sparks will be. See, for example, what the menu calls divorced sea bream, a handsome dish that would be splashed around Instagram even more frequently than it already is if the dining tables were lighted by ceiling pinspots rather than disco-era chrome globes that look as if they were salvaged from Regine's . The bream is split, and one side brushed with a red sauce and the other with a green sauce, before it is grilled over charcoal. The dish is an allusion to the two-tone pescado a la talla served at Contramar in Mexico City, itself derived from huevos divorciados, a breakfast of two fried eggs beneath two contrasting salsas. In Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez's kitchen, though, the red adobo at Contramar is replaced by a Catalan romesco, and the parsley salsa becomes a French pistou. But surely the tortilla on its own plate off to one side brings it back to Mexico? Not so fast. According to the menu, it is a taloa, a Basque cornmeal cake that cooks from Bayonne to Bilbao have been griddling for centuries. The taloa at Babs is tender, smooth and floral. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez has been cooking at Babs since it opened in July. He is also the chef at Mimi , a French restaurant a block away that is owned by the same people (Daniel Bennett, his brother Evan, and Louis Levy; they named Babs and Mimi after their grandmothers.) I haven't been back to Mimi since Liz Johnson was the chef . She was aiming for a style that was at once brawny and lavish, and since taking over last year Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez has seemed to continue in that vein while bringing his far-ranging curiosity to bear. As they did at Mimi, the owners have planted a small curved bar right by the door at Babs. The cocktails stirred and shaken there are mostly recognizable relatives of classics, like a martini made with two brands of gin. There's something charmingly self-deprecating about a cocktail list that includes Mount Gay and tonic, which seasoned barflies know as one of the drinks you can safely order in dives that don't do anything else right. The wine list, meanwhile, is mostly French and sticks to the old guard; you can tell it's not trying especially hard to be cool by the way it has just one orange wine, lumped in with the sparkling wines. Only the wine geeks will wish for more, but the rest of us might wish there were as many bottles costing around $50 as there are in the $90 range. The numbers on the menu can sneak up on you, too. My $48 lobster was a small creature that couldn't have weighed much more than a pound. The server brightly suggested dunking its tomalley into the smoked potato pur\u00e9e, and I would have tried it if I had found any tomalley. And while I can imagine happily paying $36 for Babs's lamb chops, I'd want them to be served with something more compelling than the cold, underseasoned \"Basque potato salad\" into which some baby sardines had apparently disappeared without a trace. But there is nothing wrong with the charcoal-grilled swordfish with mint salsa verde, fennel and green olives, and if you ordered the chicken andouille this summer you found Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez knocking cuisines together again, this time with a corn-and-chanterelles risotto under a slow-burning splash of Calabrian chile oil. He shows how well he can work in small strokes with a layered appetizer of raw sea scallops, sweet potato pur\u00e9e and trout roe, seasoned with a briny and fascinating salsa of chopped cucumbers, seaweed and fermented serrano chiles; or the fried cod cheeks, tender and crunchy over an orange slick of romesco aioli. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez's imagination fights against predictability. A crab salad, for instance, doesn't need to be interesting if it is fresh, but the one at Babs is both. It's seasoned with a gribiche that's full of chopped fresh dill, and then it's piled up in a big beehive on top of a smoked potato pancake. Like many small restaurants these days, Babs doesn't offer many desserts, but the ones it does are far more intriguing than average. A fine apple galette is improved by a grating of Swiss-style cheese from Edelweiss Creamery in Wisconsin and by a drizzle of 20-year-old Pedro Xim\u00e9nez sherry, thick as syrup and tasting like chocolate and coffee. Why sherry with Swiss cheese? I don't know, but Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez does. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

There is the insistent smell of broiled dry-aged steak that hits me the minute I open the door and sometimes sooner, while I'm still outside on the South Williamsburg sidewalk, producing a raised pulse, a quickening of the senses and a restlessness familiar to anyone who has seen a tiger that has just heard the approach of the lunch bucket. There is the hiss of butter and melted tallow as they slide down the hot platter, past the sliced porterhouse or rib steak and their charred bones, to make a pool at one end. The server will spoon some of this sizzling fat over the meat he has just plated, generally with some line like \"Here are your vitamins.\" There is the thunk of a bowl filled with schlag landing on a bare wood table when dessert is served, and soon after, the softer tap-tap-tap of waxy chocolate coins in gold foil dropped one at a time on top of the check. And after I've paid, there is the unshakable sense that I've been scammed. The last sensation was not part of the Peter Luger experience when I started eating there, in the 1990s. I was acutely aware of the cost back then because I would settle the tab by counting out $20 bills; cash was the only way to pay unless you had a Peter Luger credit card. At the end of the night my wallet would be empty. Because a Peter Luger steak made me feel alive in a way that few other things did, I considered this a fair trade, although I could afford it only once a year or so. I don't remember when the doubts began, but they grew over time. Diners who walk in the door eager to hand over literal piles of money aren't greeted; they're processed. A host with a clipboard looks for the name, or writes it down and quotes a waiting time. There is almost always a wait, with or without a reservation, and there is almost always a long line of supplicants against the wall. A kind word or reassuring smile from somebody on staff would help the time pass. The smile never comes. The Department of Motor Vehicles is a block party compared with the line at Peter Luger. [ Sign up for Sam Sifton's Cooking newsletter for recipes, food writing and culinary inspiration. ] The management seems to go out of its way to make things inconvenient. Customers at the bar have to order drinks from the bartender and food from an overworked server on the other side of the bar, and then pay two separate checks and leave two separate tips. And they can't order lunch after 2:30 p.m., even though the bar and the kitchen remain open. Since its last, two-star review in the Times , written by Frank Bruni in 2007, the restaurant has started taking online reservations. It accepts debit cards, too, which is nice. But the credit card you use to buy a cortado at the cafe or a bag of chips at the bodega will still not buy you a meal at Peter Luger. The servers, who once were charmingly brusque, now give the strong impression that these endless demands for food and drink are all that's standing between them and a hard-earned nap. Signals that a customer has a question or request don't get picked up as quickly; the canned jokes about spinach and schlag don't flow as freely. Some things are the same as ever. The shrimp cocktail has always tasted like cold latex dipped in ketchup and horseradish. The steak sauce has always tasted like the same ketchup and horseradish fortified by corn syrup. Although the fries are reasonably crisp, their insides are mealy and bland in a way that fresh-cut potatoes almost certainly would not be. The sole -- yes, I'm the person who ordered the sole at Peter Luger -- was strangely similar: The bread crumbs on top were gold and crunchy, but the fish underneath was dry and almost powdery. Was the Caesar salad always so drippy, the croutons always straight out of a bag, the grated cheese always so white and rubbery? I know there was a time the German fried potatoes were brown and crunchy, because I eagerly ate them each time I went. Now they are mushy, dingy, gray and sometimes cold. I look forward to them the way I look forward to finding a new, irregularly shaped mole. [ Readers respond to the Pete Wells review of Peter Luger .] Lunch one afternoon vividly demonstrated the kitchen's inconsistency: I ordered a burger, medium-rare, at the bar. So had the two people sitting to my right, it turned out. One of them got what we'd all asked for, a midnight-dark crust giving way to an evenly rosy interior so full of juices it looked like it was ready to cry. The other one got a patty that was almost completely brown inside. I got a weird hybrid, a burger whose interior shaded from nearly perfect on one side to gray and hard on the other. The same issue afflicted a medium-rare porterhouse I was served one night: The fillet was ideal but the other side of the T-bone, the strip, ranged from medium-rare to medium-well. I could live with this; big cuts of meat don't always cook evenly. What gnaws at me every time I eat a Luger porterhouse is the realization that it's just another steak, and far from the best New York has to offer. [ Melissa Clark shows you how to cook a steak at home . ] Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, can put a formidable crust on both sides of the cut; Luger caramelizes the top side only, while the underside is barely past raw, as if it had done all its cooking on the hot platter. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, buy beef that is tender, richly marbled and deeply flavorful; at Luger, you get the first two but not the third. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, age that beef to make flavor grow and intensify and double back on itself; dry-aging at Luger still results in a tender steak, but it rarely achieves a hypnotic or compelling or even very interesting one. But those other restaurants are not Peter Luger, as Friedrich Nietzsche might have said. \"When in this essay I declare war upon Wagner,\" Nietzsche wrote in \" The Case of Wagner ,\" \"the last thing I want to do is start a celebration for any other musicians. Other musicians don't count compared to Wagner.\" I could say the same thing about other steakhouses -- compared to Peter Luger, they don't count. Luger is not the city's oldest, but it's the one in which age, tradition, superb beef, blistering heat, an instinctive avoidance of anything fancy and an immensely attractive self-assurance came together to produce something that felt less like a restaurant than an affirmation of life, or at least life as it is lived in New York City. This sounds ridiculously grand. Years ago I thought it was true, though, and so did other people. The restaurant will always have its loyalists. They will laugh away the prices, the $16.95 sliced tomatoes that taste like 1979, the $229.80 porterhouse for four. They will say that nobody goes to Luger for the sole, nobody goes to Luger for the wine, nobody goes to Luger for the salad, nobody goes to Luger for the service. The list goes on, and gets harder to swallow, until you start to wonder who really needs to go to Peter Luger, and start to think the answer is nobody.

It isn't hiding anything; its glass facade on Orchard Street wants to strike up a conversation so badly that it almost follows you home. The windows are stenciled with cartoon characters and with text-message bubbles that call out in English (\"Hello! New York\"), Spanish (\"que rico!\"), French (\"bon app\u00e9tit\") and Tagalog (\"masarap,\" for delicious). The language lessons continue on the front door, which gives translations for \"tuloy po kayo\" (welcome) and the restaurant's name (gossip), pronounced chiss-miss. In case you miss all of this, a sandwich board straddles the sidewalk, advertising discounted beer, wine and wings at the bar during happy hour (\"5:thirsty\"). If you accept the facade's invitation to benaquitodits (come here here, a repetitive bit of Tagalog slang), the conversation will continue inside. Tsismis, which opened in June, is a chatty restaurant. At times, when one of the owners pulls up alongside your table and expounds on how the chef's interpretation of the dish you're trying to eat differs from what you might find in the Philippines, you may find yourself eyeing the exit. If you've found your way to the menu's strengths, though, odds are you won't want to go anywhere. Kinilaw, a Filipino ceviche in a piercingly sour calamansi and cane vinegar marinade with a jab of bird's-eye chile, is worth sticking around for, especially on those nights when it's made with bay scallops instead of fish. After that, you might look into the fried pork-and-carrot won tons called pinsec frito (or, as the menu has them, pinsit frito). They are typically folded into triangles, but the ones at Tsismis are twisted into little cones that look like Hershey's kisses, though slightly bigger and golden-brown. Once they stop steaming, you can hold them by the cowlick of fried wrapper at the top and swish them around in the sweet chile sauce. Won tons with the same filling flop around in the soup called pancit molo, although these are boiled. There is almost as much ground pork inside them as outside in the broth, which is thick with garlic and chopped scallions. Even if it's well after 5:thirsty and you're not sitting at the bar, Jappy's wings are worth considering. Jappy is the chef, Jappy Afzelius, and he fries those wings with thinly sliced garlic and sends them out to the dining room with a salsa of raw mangoes, charred onions and chiles. The heat of the salsa will not cause your shirt to burst into flames, but it is hot enough to make your memory of Jappy's wings a lasting one. Mr. Afzelius is a native of the Philippines and a graduate of a cooking academy in Manila, which shipped him off to Paris to intern in one of Alain Ducasse's bistros. The Ducasse masterminds then sent him to work at Benoit in New York, after which he turned up as the sous-chef at a Filipino restaurant in Brooklyn that was best known for its $100 doughnut -- ube-filled, Cristal-frosted and gold-leafed. Happily, nothing at Tsismis approaches that level of look-at-me desperation. Mr. Afzelius's cooking is loose, unfussy and liberated. He tosses tradition under the bus when it suits him. The result is Filipino-American drinking food that tends to be charmingly offhand. From time to time, it can lean toward sloppiness. One night the fried milkfish in pritong isda was so overdone that even topping it with calamansi juice, fish sauce and a crisp, juicy spoonful of marinated chayote on top didn't revive it. A version of adobong manok, which Mr. Afzelius makes as a roasted chicken plus a soy-turmeric sauce rather than an all-in-one stew, would have been more successful if the smoked eggplant hadn't been so undercooked it squeaked. But the grilled eggplant on top of the kare-kare was as soft as warm marrow, and the other vegetables -- crisp green beans, bok choy, enoki mushrooms -- made a refreshing counterpoint to the stewed oxtails in thick peanut sauce. Already pungent with shrimp paste, the kare-kare comes with extra on the side that you can add to your heart's content. As they do at Bad Saint in Washington, probably the country's most talked-about Filipino restaurant, Tsismis makes its laing by simmering local kale, rather than the more traditional taro leaves, in coconut milk. And if this version doesn't have the perspective-altering funk of Bad Saint's, it still draws plenty of depth from the shrimp paste and smoked fish in the milk and the big handful of dried baby shrimp dropped on top. By this point, you will probably want to have a glass in your hand. Housemade calamansi soda sounds lovely, but mine was a little flat and weak. In lieu of hard spirits, sake is the backbone of most of the cocktails. They are typically fleshed out with half a dozen other ingredients -- vermouth, Aperol, artichoke liqueur and bitters, in the case of the A La Bira -- which sound at first as if they had been assembled by walking through a liquor store blindfolded, but which after a closer look reveal a degree of inner logic. If this does not pique your curiosity, the list of wines by the glass is almost long enough to qualify Tsismis as a wine bar, although the choices are not as outr\u00e9 as they are across the street at Wildair . In a city crazy for kakigori , patbingsu and other varieties of flavored snow, Tsismis's halo-halo will probably be an instant hit. Mr. Afzelius has the very good idea of putting coconut sorbet where the shaved ice would usually go; from there he goes to town with coconut jellies and what seems like every fresh fruit he can put his hands on. But discerning collectors of Filipino sweets should note that Tsismis serves excellent silvanas. A silvana is either a shrunken cake or a cookie with big ideas, depending on your perspective. It is made of two cashew meringues that are sandwiched together with buttercream and then painted with more buttercream, which holds cashew crumbs to the outside of the whole package. Once frosted and crumbed, it has to be refrigerated or the buttercream will melt before it gets inside your mouth. No gold leaf adorns the silvanas. It would only get in the way.

The ones that cared the most about upholding traditions, maintaining quality and so on -- like Totonno's , John's of Bleecker Street , Kest\u00e9 , Lucali , Una Pizza Napoletana -- emphatically did not. Today, we live in the era of the elevated slice joint. Some of them, like Scarr's , grind wheat berries into new flour every day. Many use minuscule quantities of yeast; others abandon commercial yeast altogether in favor of the natural leavening in sourdough starters. There are slice joints that ferment their dough for a day, some that let it bubble away for two days and a few that go in for three days. A new example of the breed, F&F Pizzeria , opened in Brooklyn last week with the help of a baker whose starter dough has traveled internationally and another baker who has decades of experience at the end of a pizza paddle. Among themselves, these new-school pizza makers speak of hydration levels, fermentation periods and digestibility. Many of these slice masters are chasing an ideal version of the foldable, portable triangle sold across linoleum counters in all five boroughs, a search suffused with nostalgia for an era before processed cheese, sweetened sauce and wholesale dough. Others are celebrated for achievements in the square slice, a descendant of the Sicilian, with an airier, less doughy crust; leaders in this style include Corner Slice and Mama's Too . Perhaps the smallest group of all are the bakers who turn their eyes toward Rome, where the slices are rectangular and are known as pizza al taglio. They resemble focaccia more than a $3 slice from Ray's , and it's doubtful that the practitioners of this style even think of themselves as belonging to the elevated-slice movement. But I'd argue that they do belong to it, and that some of the most elevated slices in the area at the moment are the Roman-style ones that Bread and Salt sells inside its bakery and restaurant on Palisade Avenue, up in the Jersey City Heights. At any given time, three to six pizzas sit on the counter. They are oblong and, because they are baked without a pan to shape the dough, they have rounded corners, like a horse track. The crust is noticeably lightweight when you pick it up, an impression that is confirmed by the mouth and, later, the stomach. The interior is honeycombed with air pockets. The underside of each slice is strong enough to carry a relatively heavy load of toppings without bending or collapsing. This structural soundness is key to the pleasure. The toppings on a Bread and Salt slice are not decorations or seasonings, as they often are on round pizza. Each one is the point of its slice: a mix of fresh mushrooms with pepper, parsley and flecks of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano; zucchini shaved into fine threads and showered at the last minute with mint leaves; slices of late-summer red and yellow peppers picked while they still had few faintly bitter streaks of green reaching up their sides; a rough, dark pesto spooned around cherry tomatoes that were roasted until their skins turned black and pulled away from the globes of pulp inside; Concord grapes that blotch the dough with purple like exploded jelly grenades. A chef's hand is at work here, tossing black pepper and rosemary over the grape pizza, adding salt and excellent Sicilian olive oil to the tomato pulp, and hammering basil and hazelnuts for the pesto in a mortar. The hand belongs to Rick Easton, who oversees the pizzas and the nonpizzas and owns the restaurant. He also owned its predecessor, the Bread and Salt that operated in Pittsburgh for all of 2015 plus a few weeks on either side. For a short-lived place, it got a lot of media attention, luring restaurant hunters and recipe gatherers from across the country. By the start of 2016, he had decided to move to New York City. When his first job fell through, he began shopping for a location for Bread and Salt. The real estate market had ideas of its own, as it often does, which is how the incarnation of Bread and Salt that Mr. Easton opened early this summer wound up in New Jersey. In addition to cheaper rents, Jersey City has ordinances that allow customers to show up with bottles of wine or beer and drink them, a handy policy because Bread and Salt's beverage list has nothing more potent than Italian sodas and sparkling water. Each night's menu, written in chalk on a blackboard next to the counter where you order, contains at least as many things that are not pizza as things that are. Generally these other items are modest in size and trattoria-ish in spirit; prepared ahead of time, they need at most five minutes in the oven before a cook will arrange them on a board and carry them to one of the 25 or so seats. I wish the tripe stewed in spicy tomato sauce, the way Romans do it, were available all the time. It is not, but the meatballs almost always are, and they are wonderful, made with enough bread that they are extremely tender in a bright marinara. Another reliable find is a sandwich of some kind, made with plain, untopped pizza. Twice I've had a warm mortadella sandwich there, and both times I was convinced there was no way to improve on it. One dish was denoted on the menu by a single word: beans. I've thought of it nearly every day since, partly because the beans -- scarlet runners -- were perfectly intact but perfectly tender; partly because of the brooding depth they took on from being finished with sweet red peppers that the kitchen dried and fried, an ingredient the Italians call peperoni cruschi; and partly because their broth tasted so good when given a chance to soak into the slice of thick-crusted sourdough bread that came on top. That bread is Mr. Easton's, too. It comes with a lot of things, and it is excellent. Bread and Salt is still settling into New Jersey. Some ingredients may be better when Mr. Easton has had time to infiltrate the local farm scene. In August, when the state was rolling in juicy peaches, he was serving crunchy unripe ones in red wine for dessert. There was also a very strange cantaloupe pudding. By September things were looking up; one day there was a scoop of Tristar strawberry sorbet served with anise-seed-flecked polenta gelato, both made by Superiority Burger. (Mr. Easton is friendly with that restaurant's owner, Brooks Headley , and helped devise the recipe for the focaccia Superiority Burger serves on Fridays.) Although Mr. Easton has a handful of employees, Bread and Salt has some of the blind spots of a one-person operation. It is not the easiest restaurant to communicate with, having an Instagram account but no website or phone. On a recent Sunday, when the restaurant was supposed to open at 1 p.m., a sign on the front door announced that it would be delayed until 1:30. That was the last communiqu\u00e9; the doors were not unlocked until 2. But Mr. Easton has a singular vision, and it is the reason the food is so compelling. Looking around at the place, you're not sure how it can keep going like this. But then the plates start to come out of the kitchen and you don't want them ever to stop.

At first, there was no reason to doubt him. That the man is comfortable with long time horizons was clear to anyone who watched how patiently he studied the science of indirect heat at his first establishment in the neighborhood, Hometown Bar-B-Que . After Hurricane Sandy flooded streets and knocked out power in the area shortly before the scheduled opening in 2012, he gave away smoked briskets, ribs and shoulders to local residents until electricity was restored almost three weeks later, honing his technique all the while. The years rolled by without a drumstick in sight. But as recently as March, it was still possible to take Mr. Durney at his word when he talked about the star attraction of his nearly completed fried-chicken emporium , to be called Red Hook Tavern. The doors were finally unlocked in July, revealing a row of tables under electrified gas lamps and a row of stools in front of a white-oak bar that looks as if it was built to last at least until Van Brunt Street sinks into the sea. Wearing wallpaper and wainscoting and pressed tin, Red Hook Tavern does a straight-faced impression of a whiskey-simmered New York corner bar of a certain age. The attention to detail was to be expected, given how convincingly Hometown conjures a Texas Hill Country barbecue palace. What was something of a surprise, though, was that chickens were not being fried anywhere on the premises. In fact, Red Hook Tavern's star attraction turned out to be a cheeseburger. To be fair, Mr. Durney probably would not have drummed up much enthusiasm had he gone around telling people he was going to open a bar that served hamburgers. New York has so many of those already that the style they typically serve is a recognized subgenre that George Motz calls \"the New York City pub burger.\" According to Mr. Motz, a filmmaker and author whose work explores all things ground-beef-and-bun-related, the hallmarks of a pub burger are a thicker-than-average patty and a relative lack of adornment. It is the plain, sturdy and hunger-calming burger you get at P.J. Clarke's , JG Melon and Fanelli Cafe in Manhattan and at Donovan's Pub in Queens. Mr. Durney has said that he intends the Red Hook Tavern burger as a homage to the one at Peter Luger Steak House . (You might think that Luger traffics in the style known as the steakhouse burger, but most burger taxonomists agree that what it serves, only at the bar and only at lunch, is a pub burger.) Like Peter Luger, Red Hook Tavern employs a toasted and buttered hard roll with a smattering of sesame seeds -- about as many as the stars you can see in the sky over Manhattan on a very clear night. In both places, the patties are made with some portion of dry-aged prime beef, stand about an inch and a half tall, and possess a dark crust that fills your head with the instinct-triggering aromas and flavors whose creation in browned meat was described by Louis Camille Maillard . There are some minor divergences. At Peter Luger, cheese is optional, while the top and sides of the burger at Red Hook Tavern are tightly wrapped in glossy yellow American cheese by default. A thick cross-section of white onion is laid below the top bun at Luger. At Red Hook Tavern, the onion is stationed below the patty, where it helps keep the bottom bun dry, like a coaster. They give you a half-sour pickle spear and fries, too, which are about the same dimensions. The important difference between the burgers, though, is that lately Peter Luger's have tended to be better in memory than in reality, while the Red Hook Tavern's is, right now, one of the few absolutely mandatory burgers in New York City. The kitchen is overseen by Allison Plumer, a chef who has done most of her cooking in Brooklyn. She has an excellent dry-aged steak -- New York strip, naturally -- impressively browned and served with a small cast-iron skillet full of creamed spinach, a touch so right it may qualify as art. It is the kind of detail that makes Red Hook Tavern something more than a place for the locals to get beer and burgers. Another is the golden chicken gravy with a hint of butterscotch that is ladled into a well in the mashed potatoes that come with the half-chicken, which is advertised as simply pan-roasted, although it has the wonderfully stiff shards of skin you get from weighting down the bird as it cooks. Everybody who has eaten at Red Hook Tavern will tell you to get the country-ham-and-Cheddar croquettes on a creamy pool of whole-grain Dijonnaise. Everybody is right, too. Consensus has also formed around the wedge salad, which is clearly not a wedge, but is still a very fine salad, with blue cheese and a thick, Lugeresque bacon slice flopped over individual leaves of romaine. There is considerably less unanimity about the roasted corn, kernels of which you are supposed to wrap in radicchio that you've first smeared with 'nduja; I'm in the camp that thinks it would be a fine dish for another restaurant. There is no restaurant where I'd be glad to see littlenecks steamed with way too much stale, acrid garlic. Of course, there's no correct amount of stale, acrid garlic, but the kitchen really goes all in. There are two desserts. Both are sundaes . They do not have the thematic inevitability of the creamed spinach, but they're put together with more sophistication than average. The truth is, though, that nothing on the menu gives the burger a real run for its money. What does, or at least equals it as a reason to reserve a table a couple of weeks in advance, is the list of drinks Mr. Durney has put together with Jeff Porter and Kenneth Crum. Mr. Durney's enthusiasm for wines made by small, eccentric producers is on view at Hometown, surely the only place on earth where you can drink Milan Nasterec's skin-fermented Moravian pinot noir alongside a taco filled with a slice of barbecued brisket and, in lieu of salsa, a glowing yellow stripe of queso. Mr. Durney indulges his curiosity more deeply at the tavern. Ten grower Champagnes can be had for under $100 a bottle, and there's a $40 sparkling red from Maryland. Darlings of the nonconformist wine movement such as Radikon , Marcel Lapierre and Frank Cornelissen are all given the space you'd expect, but there are also less familiar names like Subject to Change , a Forestville, Calif., outfit that has the peculiar idea of making a bright-toned, low-alcohol zinfandel-syrah blend and calling it Moon Juice. A small number of brews from Other Half, Folksbier and Threes Brewing, leading lights of the Brooklyn suds scene, are on tap, along with uncredited light and dark ales billed as \"A Tribute To McSorleys Ale House.\" McSorley's, famously, has you buy two mugs at once, which Red Hook Tavern doesn't do. It's less well known that McSorley's serves a burger. Like the one at Luger, it's only available at lunch. It is, of course, a pub burger.

When I asked where he wanted to eat, he answered, a bit wistfully, \"Somewhere that speaks of New York, a city I have lost touch with.\" At first, I looked for a place where we could be in the thick of it all. I thought of Bar Pisellino , that narrow glass sarcophagus run by Rita Sodi and Jody Williams, where you drink your sgroppino standing up between the window along Grove Street and the one along Seventh Avenue. People trickle in, eat some olives and a tuna tramezzino, and head out again. Although it's about the size of a subway car, you get the feeling that if you stayed long enough, you'd eventually see everybody you know. But a restaurant that truly speaks of the place New York has become over the past decade or so would be nearly the opposite of Bar Pisellino. This restaurant would not be in the thick of it all. It would be hushed, sheltered, exclusive, admitting no more than a handful of people at a time. It would protect those people, once they were inside, from crowds spilling in from the street, even from the street itself. It would join the steady march of new tasting counters and omakase hideaways. And it would illustrate the growing ease with which New Yorkers of means can glide through and above the fray, slipping from one cloistered room to another in black cars without touching down. That restaurant would be a lot like Frevo , which has been serving suave, $124 tasting menus with a modern-French sensibility in Greenwich Village for the past four months. Frevo is the work of Franco Sampogna, who is the chef, and Bernardo Silva, the manager. Mr. Sampogna is from Brazil and Mr. Silva comes from Portugal; they met 10 years ago while working in restaurants in France, and quickly decided that one day they would open a restaurant in New York City that would give diners \"that feeling of being in your own secluded safe haven,\" as Mr. Sampogna put it. To get into Frevo, you first need to know that Frevo exists. There's no sign. When you arrive at the correct address, what you see is an art gallery with just enough room on its white walls for the six abstract paintings that hang there fairly close together. The paintings are real paintings made by a real artist, Thomas Labarthe, who goes by Toma-L , but the gallery is not entirely a real gallery. If it were, the young woman who sits there keeping an eye on things would stare blankly ahead when you entered, instead of walking up to you with a smile and reassuring you that, yes, you've come to the right place. Then she reaches behind one of the canvases and it swings out on invisible hinges, leaving in its place a doorway through which you can see, illuminated in a large, dark room, a stainless-steel kitchen and a long, curving counter of polished quartzite. You hop up on one of the 18 padded seats, and the door clicks closed. You are in. When the door opens again, typically not for another half an hour, in will walk another set of people who, like you, knew that the gallery was not a normal gallery. Let's say that the misdirection of the gallery and the secret door do not make these newcomers feel sufficiently insulated from the outside world. Frevo gives them the opportunity to sit at a round chef's table in a back corner around which a curtain can be drawn, as in a hospital room. Much of this comes right out of the neo-speakeasy handbook, although Frevo does throw itself into the act with an unusual level of commitment. The gallery, for instance, installed a new batch of Mr. Labarthe's canvases around Labor Day. But each time I went to Frevo, I stared at that curtain. Nobody ever closed it while I was there, but it still reminded me how easy it is now for some New Yorkers to climb into the treehouse and pull the ladder up behind them. I have to admit, though, that I like Frevo more than I like the version of New York that it brings to mind. The pleasures of this secluded safe haven are real, and Mr. Sampogna's cooking is focused and refined. I haven't been able to get his halibut dish out of my mind, for instance. The fish rests on a thin, crisp platform of fried bread shellacked with a dark mushroom marmalade; this miniature mushroom tart drinks up the flavor of the halibut as it goes, in the oven, from raw to that just-cooked state where its flesh slides apart into thick and almost fluffy white flakes. Alongside the fish are bulbs of melted fennel, their spiced cooking juices boiled down to a bittersweet syrup. Mr. Sampogna's opening salvo often involves quinoa doing something quinoa doesn't usually do, and doing it quite nicely. I liked its freshness when it was used in a salad spooned over a demitasse of creamy hummus; I liked its crunch when it was dehydrated and sprinkled over a few mouthfuls of black lentils topped with glistening orbs of smoked trout roe. A dish from early July brought peas, at the tail end of their season, together with a rich pistachio-tarragon cream and white puffs of coconut mousse: light and charming. I wished Mr. Sampogna had exploited summer produce as sensitively when I went back in August and September. His kitchen is small enough that he could respond to the market day by day, but so far this doesn't seem to interest him. Frevo, at $124 for five courses, is not a huge splurge by New York standards, but servers try to inflate the total by pushing supplements. For $30 you can get Kaluga caviar troweled on to your first course; $20 gets you upgraded to a foie gras torchon instead of the less-thrilling mushrooms with gnocchi; it's $18 for a serving of aged Comt\u00e9 before dessert, and another $30 to have white truffles with the cheese. This tactic is not as grating as it is at Per Se , where the supplements are piled onto a base charge of $355, but it is still a snag in the otherwise smooth hospitality provided by Frevo's small crew of servers and cooks. Everyone I've brought to Frevo has fallen under its spell, which is hard to resist. The music is slinky and sinuous. The room has a nocturnal theatricality; sitting at the counter with darkness behind you facing the spotlighted kitchen can feel like attending an extremely elegant campfire. I still think Frevo is a perfect spot to familiarize yourself with the frictionless New York of 2019. Still, when my out-of-town friend arrived, we had our dinner at Bar Pisellino. We were hungry for a taste of the old chaos. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

In fact, dim sum is only a small portion of what the menu offers at Hutong, which opened in Midtown in July. But you would do well to make it a large portion of what you order, because only one or two other restaurants in town can plausibly claim to make dim sum that rivals Hutong's. Where else will you find cooks who have the dexterity to make Wagyu-beef mille-feuilles whose flaky layers of pastry overlap each other by only a few millimeters, like the feathers on a songbird's wing? Who can craft steamed buns that look just like shiitake mushrooms, which happen to be the chief ingredient in their filling? Or who knows the secret that allows the crunchy, chewy, charcoal-black mini-footballs stuffed with pork (in what is known in Sichuan as \"fish-fragrant\" seasoning) to sparkle as if diamond chips had been kneaded into the dough? There is real skill in the kitchen at Hutong. You see it most clearly in the dim sum, but much of the other cooking evinces the kind of discipline, precision and technical mastery that has rarely been seen in this city over the past few decades, to the dismay of eaters who know what Chinese food is capable of. \"While expensive French restaurants in New York can hold their own against many places in Paris, if you want to move beyond steamed dumplings and stir-fries to experience the complexity of Chinese banquet cuisine, the possibilities grow dimmer each year,\" Ruth Reichl wrote in The New York Times in 1998. She gave reasons for the poor showing, including talented chefs being paid more in Hong Kong and China. That is as true as it was 21 years ago, but what has changed is the rise of global Chinese restaurant groups, from the disappointing duck specialist DaDong to the surprisingly solid Hao Noodle outposts and, now, to Hutong. The original Hutong opened in 2003 on the 28th floor of a glass tower overlooking the Hong Kong harbor, but the dining room tries to conjure the atmosphere of Beijing's vanishing premodern alleys, or hutongs, by means of red paper lanterns, carved wooden doors and birdcages. The Manhattan branch makes a different impression. The entrance is on the east side of the circular driveway below the Bloomberg Building between East 58th and 59th Streets. Turn right and you are in a narrow hallway between two soaring glass stacks of wine bottles, every one of them for decorative purposes only. Turn left and you are in a glittering, soaring, hard-edge dining room. The inspiration seems to be Art Deco with a pinch of cocaine; the blue leather banquettes, beveled mirrors and chandeliers of mirror-polished steel could come from the set of a nightclub in some cross between \" Scarface \" and \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\" A guest who has lived in China allowed his eyes to adjust to the glinting light as he looked toward the ceiling, which seemed to be far away. \"It's very \u2026 yin,\" he said. Hutong is ostensibly a Northern Chinese restaurant. This is more apparent in Hong Kong than in Manhattan, where the menu has been pruned to about half the size. Lamb, a mainstay in the northern provinces, was represented in August by a single dish, cumin-speckled ribs roasted languorously to a mind-altering tenderness. By the time of my last visit, lamb had ambled off the menu entirely. The most famous preparation from northern China, Peking duck, arrived at my table worse for wear and tear, carved haphazardly, with blobs of unmelted fat clinging to limp skin. The second course, a dark-meat stir-fry to be folded in iceberg lettuce, was more skillfully done, but the sting of paying $84 for a whole duck with uncrisp skin lingered. Much of what hasn't been trimmed from the Hong Kong menu comes from Sichuan. So does Fei Wang, the executive chef of the New York branch, and a native of Chengdu. Most recently seen running the kitchen of the Hutong in London, Mr. Wang weaves chiles -- fresh, dried, roasted, pickled, name it -- into nearly everything. In the dish known as Red Lantern, the whole dried peppers the size of cherries are mostly decorative; fried soft-shell crabs are buried under the chiles in a pan with an arcing bamboo handle, like jelly beans in the plastic grass of an Easter basket. The ground spices on the crabs' shatteringly brittle crust -- lightly sweet and more aromatic than searingly hot -- may remind you of a Chinese rice-cracker snack you grew up on, or it may make you think of Old Bay. Fermented chiles provide an electric buzz, and a modicum of heat, to the steamed halibut that arrives boxed up inside a red bell pepper and sitting on a nest of rice noodles. (The pepper opens into a six-pointed star that gives the dish its name, halibut red star noodles.) Kou shui chicken is nearly submerged in an orange lake of excellent chile oil, although the adroit way the oil is balanced by rice vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger and other flavors is what gives Hutong one of the city's most impressive versions of this traditional cold dish. If Hutong has another appetizer that equals it, I haven't found it yet. I did, however, have a cryptic encounter with a log-cabin stack of okra doused in a sweet wasabi sauce, and an inconclusive rendezvous with some steamed asparagus stalks whose tips were enrobed in white sesame sauce; it was as if somebody had tried to replicate strawberries dipped in white chocolate without access to strawberries or white chocolate. You could attempt to unknot these mysteries. Then again, you could simply begin your meal with dim sum. And then, after picking your way through the chile-besotted main courses, you could end it that way, too. There is a dessert that mimics the shape of a steamed bun, pleated and twisted into a pucker at the top. It is made of white chocolate, the wrapper on this trompe l'oeil bao, and filled with white sesame cream and a core of bittersweet salted caramel. Alongside it is a single scoop of ice cream made from lightly sweetened soy milk. The soy milk is extremely fresh. I don't mean that the carton won't expire for another three weeks; I mean that somebody in the kitchen was squeezing the soybeans shortly before the ice cream was frozen. This is a snack from a Chinese childhood, bread and a glass of milk, and it would be hard, after several courses of spice, to think of anything more welcome.

He began with a counter in the Gansevoort Market food hall called Mission Ceviche ; there is now another in Canal Street Market and a third is supposed to open in Norwalk, Conn., later this year. At all locations, the stock-in-trade is citrus-marinated raw fish with sweet potatoes and kernels of chubby Andean corn, in both its soft and crunchy forms. This is of course the standard Peruvian formula, but Mr. Ch\u00e1vez had the inspiration of serving his ceviche in a clear plastic bowl over a base of salad, rice or, for a dollar more, quinoa. The supplemental ingredients make a plausible desk lunch out of a dish that some New Yorkers still aren't quite sure what to do with. The surprising thing about Mission Ceviche's salad bowls is that they taste like real Peruvian food. The raw fish is firm and cold and neatly cut up into solid pieces that hold their shape. The leche de tigre marinade in Mr. Ch\u00e1vez's \"ceviche cl\u00e1sico\" is a bright and precise cocktail of lime and rocoto chiles, although you might wish that the rocotos had been applied with a little less restraint. You get a higher-caliber shot of spice, this time from aj\u00ed amarillo chiles, in the ceviche mixto, a combination of octopus, shrimp and fluke enveloped in a creamy, goldenrod-colored leche de tigre. The cl\u00e1sico is accessorized with sweet potato pur\u00e9e; the mixto gets avocado pur\u00e9e, too. The pur\u00e9es are piped out of pastry bags like buttercream roses on a wedding cake, and they are delicious. When I wandered into the Gansevoort Market location in February, it seemed clear that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez could run an interesting restaurant if he ever decided to put his food into something other than recyclable salad bowls. Then, at the beginning of the summer, he did just that, opening a sit-down restaurant on the Upper East Side with real plates and bowls. The new space is not particularly large or lavish, but compared with the earlier efforts, Mission Ceviche Restaurant & Bar is a palace. There is seating for 65 or so people beneath a wall sculpture of a fish that glows from behind and a pink neon sign that reads \"tiger milk effect,\" probably a reference to the belief that drinking leftover leche de tigre can put extra topspin on sexual performance. The menu now paints a slightly fuller picture of Peruvian cuisine, extending into new foods including the grilled skewers known as anticuchos. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez dresses up the country's most popular anticucho, grilled beef heart, brushing it with a creamy rocoto sauce and serving it with newly fried blue potato chips and kernels of choclo corn. The trio of rocoto, blue potatoes and choclo is so solidly Peruvian that it can withstand the chimichurri that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez brings in, by way of Argentina, as a final touch. He clearly has a soft spot for chimichurri because he deploys it again with the shrimp anticuchos (the shrimp are very big and look even bigger because they're grilled with their heads on), served with a squirt of huanca\u00edna, the spicy yellow cheese sauce that is something like Peru's version of queso dip. My favorite anticucho is a more straightforward situation, grilled scallops under arugula, lime zest and a smooth Parmesan fondue. But Mr. Ch\u00e1vez has the ability to put several flavors in motion at once and keep his balance, as evidenced by the beef-heart skewer and his octopus causa. This is, reduced to bare bones, a tendril of octopus curled around a disc of mashed potatoes. But the potatoes, seasoned with lime and yellow chiles, are coated in a smooth lavender-colored sauce made from Peruvian black olives; the octopus has been rubbed with cumin, oregano and aj\u00ed panca paste and grilled to a crackle; the plate is decorated with a few wobbly curls of paper made with purple Peruvian potatoes. Mission Ceviche's servers, while eager to be helpful, have a habit of singling out the most obvious dishes -- the classic ceviche, the octopus leg -- and pushing them so hard you might suspect the rest of the menu is a minefield. It isn't. There is nothing to avoid unless the kitchen brings back the bizarre strawberry-kiwi ceviche that showed up as a special one night. If you are being herded into getting the \"Peruvian paella,\" you should know that the other three main courses are also worth looking into, like the aj\u00ed de gallina, shredded chicken breast in a creamy aj\u00ed amarillo sauce that is both soothing and spicy; or the seco norte\u00f1o, a slowly braised short rib in cilantro sauce. All are larger than average, too. Still, nothing on the menu quite rivals the ceviches. They are served, yes, without lettuce or rice, and they are better for it. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez's creative engine seems to have a high idle, and he has come up with different ways to present dishes that are also on the menu at the fast-casual counters. The \"Nikkei\" ceviche, for instance -- tuna in a kind of modified ponzu sauce seasoned with aj\u00ed amarilllo and togarashi -- now comes with watermelon and a bloop of ginger foam that would never survive a trip from the food court back to the office. Neither would the odd but intriguing attempt at a vegetarian ceviche where the fish is replaced by shiitakes and the leche de tigre takes the form of snow, frozen by liquid nitrogen. The art of ceviche-making has at least as much in common with mixology as with cooking, so it is no surprise that the cocktails are well calibrated and sing out with fresh lime. There is a twist on the pisco sour made with passion-fruit juice and another with the purple-corn drink chicha morada, although neither quite achieves the bracing elegance of the original. And it's nice to see the less well-known chilcano, a pisco highball made with lime juice and ginger ale. (Would ginger beer be better?) Chicha morada appears again in the raspadilla dessert. This time it is a syrup poured over shaved ice and sprinkled with lucuma foam. When I had the raspadilla, it was sprinkled with candied pecan crumbs but in a phone interview on Monday Mr. Ch\u00e1vez said he had replaced the nuts with crumbled Oreos. This, it hardly needs pointing out, was not exactly a staple in the diet of the Incas. \"What can I say?\" he asked. \"I just really like Oreos.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

The city is not yet in the same league as, say, Chongqing, where the dish is said to have originated and where an association dedicated to keeping track of such things says there are about 50,000 places to eat it. New York, by my count, has a mere two or three dozen, most of them in the sections of Brooklyn, Queens and Lower Manhattan that have considerable Chinese populations. But new hot pot restaurants seem to arrive every few weeks, with some independent operators among a growing number of chains from China. Downtown Flushing, Queens, has Little Sheep Hot Pot , founded in Inner Mongolia and one of the first hot pot purveyors in New York to move beyond the all-you-can-eat model, which led to widespread improvement in ingredient quality; Mister Hotpot, known among the city's pig worshipers for its creamy, ivory-toned pork-bone broth; and Liuyishou Hot Pot , a Chongqing-based concern where the spiced beef tallow that is an essential component of Sichuan hot pot is molded into the shape of a smiling, bow-tied cow. Farther south in Flushing is Niu Pot , the city's best hot pot establishment by several measures, including the number and complexity of its broths. Niu Pot cooks a very good winter-melon soup and serves it inside the melon's hollow shell, although it is most widely known for serving marbled slices of raw beef wrapped tightly around a Barbie doll , like a dress for Lady Gaga . In Manhattan, hot pot outposts have been planted along the Bowery in a line advancing toward Chinatown, starting with Zhen Wei Fang . If there had been a hot pot restaurant in \"Blade Runner,\" it would have looked like Zhen Wei Fang, an import from Miami that has private booths, simultaneous videos projected side by side on the walls and a robot host by the entrance. (Adding to the sense of a future gone awry, the robot wasn't working the last time I went.) A few blocks south is Tang Hotpot , probably the most luxe hot pot in the city. The menu is illustrated with still-life ingredient photographs that look as if Vermeer painted them, and the pictures aren't that far off from reality. Almost all of these emporiums offer Sichuan hot pot, a broth covered in a deep slice of chile oil in which dried red chiles, Sichuan peppercorns and various other spices churn around like the remains of toy sailboats after a hurricane. But Da Long Yi Hot Pot, which opened in May in a second-story space above Canal Street, has the advantage over most of its competitors of having originated in Sichuan. Its home base, from which more than 200 Da Long Yis have issued, is the provincial capital of Chengdu. Chongqing was administratively sheared from the rest of the province in 1997. Although you key your name into a touch pad at the top of the stairs to get on Da Long Yi's waiting list, and you learn that your table is ready from an automated text, you order by penciling an X on the paper menu, in a box next to the item you want. The menu also suggests the length of time each item should be held down in the boiling soup. It goes without saying that you will want a Sichuan hot pot at Da Long Yi. You will be asked whether you want it mild, medium or spicy, although in my experience there isn't much difference. A more important question is whether you will cook your meal in Sichuan broth alone; in a split pot with Sichuan broth on one side and either tomato or mushroom broth, neither of them spicy, on the other; or in a three-chambered pot with some of each. The narrow range of choices can be an advantage for a novice hot potter, who might be swamped by the maximalist menus at Tang or Niu Pot. The split pots make Da Long Yi a good place to take somebody with a low tolerance for heat, although as a practical matter it is impossible to eat a Sichuan hot pot meal without ingesting at least a spoonful or two of chile oil. Old hands know that the oil tends to pool away from the region of the broth that is bubbling most furiously, and ingredients that, after cooking, are removed from the pot in this area will emerge relatively clean. Whether this is desirable varies from eater to eater and from ingredient to ingredient. Deeply furrowed, folded or layered foods -- the Kungfu beef tripe spread out on a mound of chipped ice; the tofu skins; the fried dough sticks known as youtiao or, on Da Long Yi's menu, \"fried bun\" -- retain spicy oil in quantities that may become challenging. Extremely smooth items, like the hard-cooked quail eggs, the rabbit kidneys speared on a toothpick, or the long and surprisingly slippery tubes of duck intestine, on the other hand, can survive a trip through the deepest patch of chile oil without any appreciable damage. You can, if you like, follow the custom of Chengdu or Chongqing by focusing on ingredients that are prized more for feel than flavor. The duck intestines, for instance, which quickly contract in the hot broth and come out about 30 seconds later with the texture of barely cooked squid. Or the pale ivory sheets of flattened artery, which after cooking about twice as long have a long-lasting chew that reminds me of geoduck. On the other hand, more flavorful ingredients, once they've cooked for a few minutes, can help punch up the broths, which aren't quite as deep or complex as they are at some other hot pot providers. This does not apply to the lengths of corn on the cob, which don't taste like anything to begin with. And I would avoid the \"vegetable platter,\" which was more like a lettuce platter. But it is useful to keep in mind that if you toss sliced king oyster mushrooms, or crown daisy greens, or bands of kelp tied into knots, or even the Hershey's Kiss-shaped fish balls with gooey orange roe inside, into the soup and forget about them for a while, both the ingredients and the soup will rise to the occasion. Some ingredients, though, you hold in your chopsticks, watching for 30 seconds or a minute until you can see they're ready. The marble tiles of Wagyu rib are in this category, and the New Zealand lamb shaved as thin as prosciutto, and the Kurobuta pork belly from Japan. The whole prawns on wooden skewers will be tender and running with juices in just over a minute. The sweet, small flounder fillets might need twice that. Even if you are careful to pull these bites out in the bubbling center of the pot, away from the oil, the chiles and Sichuan peppercorns will catch up with you sooner or later. They build up on your tongue, they slowly infiltrate your dipping sauce, and the mala tingle will take over. There is no fighting it at that point, of course, though a bowl of white rice is a good investment in the future. And when conversation at the table has stopped completely, when the water you keep pouring into sadistically small cups won't help any more, there is one thing that will: fresh watermelon juice, sold by the carafe.

The cooking there is hard to pin down, geographically. Stopping in a few weeks ago, I ate Low Countryish wild red shrimp on grits, with sweet corn off the cob and a potent saffron-lobster sauce. More recently, I had skinless pork sausage inspired by sai ua, the spicy and tangy specialty identified with the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai. The soft tripe I enjoyed the other weekend had been simmered with 'nduja, the fiery and malleable Calabrian sausage, and then covered with a few thin shingles of shaved pecorino. If I had started hanging around at Foxface sooner, especially during the cold months after its opening, in February, I might have run into a wider variety of cuisines and main ingredients. I did manage to get some of the elk osso buco while that was still on the menu. I never got to try the wild hare, though, stewed in red wine with a bit of chocolate and thickened with its own blood, a formula that students of very old-guard French cooking will recognize as li\u00e8vre \u00e0 la royale. Nor did I make it in time for the venison, left to bubble for hours in white wine with mushrooms and dark juniper berries. The Foxface dish I may never forgive myself for missing, though, is the kebabs served with preserved lemons and tahini, because the kebabs were made from ground lamb and camel. Although these foods may lack any unifying cultural background, they did have one thing in common: They were all served on rolls. Apart from an occasional salad or soup, everything cooked at Foxface arrives in sandwich form. And with the exception of a muffuletta that briefly manifested a few months back, every sandwich at Foxface is filled with hot, cooked meat or seafood or vegetables. In Mexico, certain taco stands specialize in tacos de guisado, tortillas filled with one kind of stew or another. Most of Foxface's offerings are, in effect, sandwiches de guisado. Which reminds me of another impressive Foxface sandwich, a magenta and green tangle of cilantro stems and pickled onions pressed into an engagingly tart pile of pork, marinated in sour orange juice and roasted very slowly under a banana leaf in emulation of cochinita pibil from the Yucat\u00e1n. There is no guarantee that any of these items will be available when you go to Foxface. The menu is printed daily and taped up next to the window on St. Marks Place where most of the business is transacted. Sometimes a new sandwich appears after the printed menu has already been posted, so it will be written out by hand on a card that has in its upper left corner the restaurant's logo, a drawing of an elegant fox in cat's-eye glasses with a cigarette holder in one gloved hand. The sandwiches have names like It's What's 'Nside (for the tripe with 'nduja) or 120 BPM (bison heart with tahini and \"many spices\"). The Smoking Fox is sold every day. It is filled with smoked pork rib the color of a dry ros\u00e9, separated from the bones and covered with coleslaw, pickles and a few splashes of habanero-orange vinegar. Your mind, of course, goes either to Memphis or to the McRib , and neither is exactly wrong, but the meat is of a superior grade and is smoked with the attention to timing and nuance that characterizes Foxface's cooking. It's a great sandwich. To place an order, you lean in to the window and speak with Sivan Lahat, who owns and runs Foxface with Ori Kushnir, her partner in life and in sandwiches. They immigrated to New York from Israel almost 20 years ago and have lived here ever since, apart from a brief flirtation with the Midwest and a longer experimental period in Tokyo. While they were in Japan, they operated a pop-up restaurant, which is the closest either of them came to running a food business before opening Foxface. Like the fox in the logo, Ms. Lahat has coppery hair and wears cat's-eye glasses. She prepares the orders in the room behind the window, which measures 48 square feet. Inside the building, under the stairs, Foxface has a second room. Mr. Kushnir thinks it could be as large as 14 square feet. A variety of equipment is stowed in the two rooms, including three induction burners, a roaster, a smoker and a dishwasher. After business hours, some of it comes out as Mr. Kushnir supervises the more time-consuming roasts and stews. He describes the food that he and Ms. Lahat cook as \"dishes we like to eat, reimagined as sandwiches.\" I like to eat a lot of the same dishes, as it happens, but they have been hard to come by lately, especially those shapeless brown stews that are so out of style. Following some of the world's most influential chefs and shamed, perhaps, by the unflattering lenses of a million amateur photographers, restaurants have shifted away from plain and plain-looking cooking. The subtlety and the thrill of plain cooking comes from searing, simmering, reducing, skimming and so on. All the people who own Instant Pots know this, but the segment of the restaurant scene with artistic leanings has forgotten it, focusing instead on plating, arranging six or seven things in some photogenic design and hoping they will cohere. Slapping a roll on it is one way to get a shapeless brown stew ready for its close-up, although it has to be said that on the mean streets of Instagram, an elk osso buco sandwich is no match for a rainbow unicorn ice cream sundae. Because space is at a premium, there is no room to sit and eat your Smoking Fox at Foxface itself. You can, however, take it to a table a few steps away inside an adjoining business called the William Barnacle Tavern . This is a reassuringly gloomy bar that is said to have originated as a speakeasy. Model ships and other nautical paraphernalia are strewn about, references to the rumrunning operation a former owner of the building presided over during Prohibition. (The stairs that Foxface's dishwasher is housed below lead to an exhibition space called the Museum of the American Gangster .) The bar's current owner has resisted some modern conveniences. Most of the lighting at night comes from small candles, and all of the music is provided by old films -- of Irish folk recitals, Cab Calloway concerts -- that run in looping, watery projections on the back wall. All Foxface sandwiches are presented in a trim little white box that can be unfolded into a place mat. You can purchase an Italian fruit soda for $3 from Foxface, or buy alcohol from the tavern. The beer is not expensive, but the specialty of the house is absinthe. Most patrons drink theirs diluted with ice water poured from a four-spigot absinthe fountain at the end of the bar. The bartender will make absinthe cocktails, too, including the one Ernest Hemingway supposedly invented that is just absinthe and Champagne in a big glass . He called it Death in the Afternoon, and it is what I intend to drink if I ever get my hands on that camel sandwich.

Nearly every place Mr. McNally has built since then has been a firm rejection of all that is fashionable in food, and each one has been, at least in its first few months, the most fashionable restaurant in town. The one he opened in early June in the meatpacking district, Pastis , was assembled partly from the salvaged bones of a nearby restaurant he closed five years ago, Pastis. (He salvaged the name, too.) The onion soup, the meaty snails sloshing around in the divots of a black iron snail pan with what must be half a pint of garlic butter, and a few other old war horses from the original menu have been summoned for one more joust on the battlefield. In short, the new Pastis takes almost everything straight from the old Pastis , which in turn took almost everything from the stodgiest, least trend-conscious sort of French cafes and brasseries. Needless to say, reservations are harder to come by than at any other New York restaurant that's opened this year. The paradox of this is that Pastis is really meant for those nights when you decide to cancel your reservations at the little nine-seat tasting counter where the menu is inspired by Kieslowski's \"Decalogue.\" It is for those times when you get an urge to eat a Gruy\u00e8re omelet after 10 p.m., cooked medium-rare, flecked with herbs, skillfully rolled and staunchly backed up by a cold white from the Savoie. Urges like that do not typically announce themselves three weeks in advance, and they don't tend to survive exposure to rooms filled with people who have read about Pastis on the blogs but haven't yet figured out what it is for. For much of his life, Mr. McNally has been chipping, cracking, distressing and weathering interiors that are the architectural equivalent of rumpled sweaters two sizes too large. Perhaps the largest and certainly the most rumpled of all is Pastis. It doesn't have the corner entrance it had at its former address, or the long communal table that sliced through the front room like a surfboard. And the shelves of cigarette packs are definitely gone. ( You could still smoke in restaurants in 1999, when Pastis opened.) But the magazine racks are back, along with the overhead fans turning steadily below a stamped tin ceiling. Once again the walls are covered with chipped subway tiles, white, framed by black grout. The chairs still don't match. The ambient light is the color of a Scotch and soda and makes everybody look the way they do after you've drunk one. On an antique mirror, or one that looks like an antique, someone has scrawled a menu of desserts, almost none of which Pastis actually serves. You can, however, get an energetically whisked dark-chocolate mousse under shaved curls of chocolate, or a baba au rhum so drenched in booze that it might spontaneously combust if it weren't being restrained by a white dune of whipped Chantilly cream. The most significant change from the first Pastis to the second happened offstage. Mr. McNally, who had a stroke two years ago, has brought on the restaurateur Stephen Starr as a partner who, essentially, manages everything except the design. Familiar faces from La Mercerie and other Starr enterprises work alongside loyal retainers from the McNally empire. The McNally troops are exquisitely poised, self-assured, able to spot a misplaced butter knife from across the street. The Starr cadre is more casual, and occasionally a server will ask your opinion of \"the flavors so far,\" a question that has surely never been uttered at Minetta Tavern . Mr. Starr has oversight of the wine list, which is less conservative than a typical McNally lineup, and of the food, which has not been a strong suit of the McNally organization since the chefs Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr went out on their own. Pastis's chef, Michael Abt, was until recently in charge of the kitchen at the Washington restaurant Le Diplomate , which Mr. Starr owns. Better qualifications would be hard to conjure, given that Le Diplomate is essentially an imitation McNally restaurant. Taking his cues from the old days, Mr. Abt is putting out simple, unadorned, hunger-obliterating French cuisine drawn from the era before supermarkets and fast food. The salad of pickled herring and carrots with boiled potatoes might come straight from Brasserie Lipp . The country p\u00e2t\u00e9 is laden with chicken livers and riddled with soft white pork fat in gobs the size of gumdrops, although it could stand more salt, and I'd be happy to trade the slab of butter that comes with it for a pot of mustard. The p\u00e2t\u00e9 is made in house, as is the gorgeously smooth boudin blanc. With the boudin, you want pur\u00e9ed potatoes that are almost liquid. That is what you get. You might argue that, when it offers chilled king crab legs to be dipped in aioli, this unextravagant cafe breaks character. Does the same apply to garnishing sardines served in the can with an ingot of prized, costly butter made by Jean-Yves Bordier? Maybe. I thought, in any case, that the sardines and the olive oil they are packed in tended to talk over the butter. The half roast chicken is not in the same class as the birds that Antoine Westermann cooked when he was still at Le Coq Rico , but it is probably as good a roast chicken as any normal restaurant can produce. The duck in olives, though, is misconceived; the sauce is thin, acrid and one-dimensional instead of head-spinningly rich, the way it is at Allard in Paris . The seafood -- the trout amandine with its saut\u00e9ed skin taut beneath its armor of toasted almonds; steamed mussels in a lemon broth that's satiny with melted butter; an entire steamed branzino with enough crisp summer vegetables to make a salad -- is very appealing, though that won't stop the people who are going to get steak frites without even a glance at the menu. Those people may get fries that are crunchy and golden, or they might end up with a limp, oily batch, or they may get both in the same night, as I did. At the length of 20 years, memories are untrustworthy, but I'm reasonably sure the food at Pastis is better than it used to be. The wine is certainly more interesting. What's gone, and won't be back now that the surrounding addresses have been taken over by shops like Loro Piana, Sephora, Herm\u00e8s and RH, is the pure downtown electricity Pastis once generated. Sharing real estate with meat cutters in blood-smeared aprons and prostitutes in dresses as tight as the skins on a boudin blanc, Pastis did a drop-dead perfect imitation of the coolest restaurant in France. The French part was fake, but the cool was real. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

Rezd\u00f4ra doesn't. A few steps down from the sidewalk, on the same block of East 20th Street as Gramercy Tavern and the brownstone where Teddy Roosevelt was born, Rezd\u00f4ra lists a \"regional pasta tasting\" for $90 on its menu. The region in question is Emilia-Romagna, whose refinements in the art of rolling and saucing noodles are admired even by Italians from other parts of the country. Chances are that most of the five pastas in the tasting are exactly the ones you picture when you think about Emilia-Romagna, starting with tortellini in brodo. This would seem to make it an easy sell, and yet servers at Rezd\u00f4ra never tried to sell me on the tasting. Until I asked about it one night, I had never seen the separate menu card that describes each course. With some hesitation, I ordered it. Every one of the pastas was excellent, and one or two would be worth walking a long distance for. After the fifth course was gone, it slowly dawned on me that Stefano Secchi, Rezd\u00f4ra's chef and one of its owners, had just laid down a straight flush. The tortellini were penny-size hoops rolled around minced and blended pork in a parcel just big enough to suggest the idea of meat. \"This is a special broth made from older chickens,\" a server said as he poured a steaming liquid from a kettle over the tortellini. It was the color of turkey gravy. The broth spent about half a day on the burner; drew some of its power from melted Parmigiano-Reggiano; and was more intense than canned chicken broth in roughly the same way that a dry-aged rib-eye is more intense than a McDonald's all-beef patty. This was followed by a smooth, almost fluffy tomato-basil sauce over maccheroni al pettine, delicate tubes with ridges they get from being rolled by hand along a comb made for the job. Three straw-colored blobs that looked like melted Brie turned out to be a glossy and wonderful fonduta made from Parmigiano-Reggiano. From there it was on to tortelloni, each about three bites big, filled with plush fresh ricotta and shiny with melted brown butter in which a few sage leaves had been bubbled. If we are talking about Emilia-Romagna we have to talk about rag\u00f9, and that was the next course, tossed with slim ribbons of tagliolini. Some people will find the rag\u00f9 saltier than they like. Almost everyone will find it more tender and smooth than the last 20 or 30 rag\u00fas they ate. The tour winds down with round, meat-filled anolini, a branch of the ravioli family that resides in Parma. They are served in something called crema di Parmigiano; you will not be far off if you imagine an Alfredo sauce cooked for one of the more sybaritic Roman emperors. This is not Rome, though, and the sauce gets the tart counterpoint it needs from an inky, 25-year-old balsamic vinegar poured straight from the bottle. Mr. Secchi blew into town in May on a small gust of publicity whipped up over his time at Osteria Francescana , the Modena workshop where Massimo Bottura reconfigures the touchstone flavors of the region in dishes with names like \"memories of a mortadella sandwich.\" Mr. Bottura's approach to menu writing seems to have rubbed off on Mr. Secchi more than his experimental urges did. At Rezd\u00f4ra, you are unlikely to catch the kitchen using any overtly modernist techniques, but you may well encounter \"cherry season in Vignola,\" a pleasant if somewhat too soupy plate of stracciatella with toasted almonds, almond milk and cherries both sweet and sour; or \"cow grazing in Emilia-Romagna,\" a sirloin basted with butter whose richness is modulated by a sauce of sweet red peppers; or \"Grandma walking through forest in Emilia,\" a transfixing plate of mushroom pur\u00e9e, slivered snap-pea pods and little hats of spinach pasta filled with braised leeks. If we are tracing influences, though, Mr. Secchi's cooking at Rezd\u00f4ra seems to have been molded at least as deeply by his time working at the pasta station of another restaurant in Modena, Hosteria Giusti . Laura Galli Morandi, Giusti's chef, steadfastly defends the style of the local nonna tradition that Mr. Secchi channels in his pasta tasting and other parts of his menu. Like a meal in Giusti's four-table dining room, one at Rezd\u00f4ra can and probably should start with prosciutto and other manifestations of salted pork draped over warm pillows of fried dough called gnocchi fritti. Before leaving Italy, Mr. Secchi also cooked at Antica Moka in Modena and All'Enoteca in the Piedmont; after coming back home to Dallas, where he grew up, he ran the kitchens of two restaurants his parents own there. Still, I suspect the Bottura connection is responsible for the speed with which the bar stools fill up when the restaurant opens at 5:30 each night, for the difficulty of reserving one of the other 48 seats, and for the way would-be customers collect in eddies outside the door to strategize. Not much about the interior is likely to lure crowds; with its brick walls, timbered ceiling and bare wood tables, it looks like any number of Manhattan restaurants that emulate the trattorias, enotecas and osterias of Italy. And of course, people who eat at Rezd\u00f4ra have a way of becoming repeat customers. They come back even though it is still a young restaurant and occasionally makes a young restaurant's mistakes. One night, the stewed cannellini beans placed alongside black sea bass and black garlic zabaglione were still crunchy; the rock shrimp served with strozzapreti could have been a little less tough and tasted a little shrimpier. And some of the original pastas aren't quite as stunning as the classics, but then every grandmother in Emilia-Romagna could have told you that. Mr. Secchi is still one of the most appealing new talents in years to enter the city's Italian restaurant scene, the kind of cook who can unite ordinary people who just like to eat pasta and the fanatics who collect menus from Osteria Francescana. (The date-stamped copy of the regional tasting menu that's given out at the end of the night, signed by Mr. Secchi and his kitchen crew, must be for this crowd.) He also has the good luck to come along when some of the figures who dominated New York's Italian landscape for the past two decades or so have either disappeared or gone into hibernation. There is one more workplace that I hope has left a mark on Mr. Secchi: his parents' restaurants in Texas, both of which are called Ferrari's Italian Villa & Chop House . The first has been in business since 1983, a life span that any restaurateur would envy. The odds are against Rezd\u00f4ra's being around 36 years from now, but Mr. Secchi and his business partner have made one move that tends to be associated with longevity in New York restaurants. They bought the building. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

The tuna tartares start to run together; we can't recall whether it's served in lettuce cups with threads of shiso at Perry St. or at JoJo . At some point it's hard to recall what makes the chicken breast inside a resoundingly crunchy Parmesan crust at Nougatine different from the Parmesan-crusted chicken at the Mark. With his partner, Phil Suarez, Mr. Vongerichten has founded scores of new restaurants around the world. Nearly 40 of them are still up and running, 15 in New York. Devising menus for each new place, he repeats himself occasionally, but more often he rearranges old patterns. Lime juice is traded for yuzu, cherry vinegar comes in for balsamic. Almost always, the result is a dish that is similar enough to his past work to be recognizably Vongerichtenesque but different enough to seem fresh. Maybe he can keep track of it in his head, but for the rest of us it would be really useful to have a family tree of every dish he ever invented, with its parentage and offspring. Something like 23andMe , it could tell you which strands of kitchen DNA are shared by which Vongerichten restaurants -- 23andV. This service would come in handy in times like the present, when critics and superfans are trying to metabolize the two restaurants Mr. Vongerichten opened in New York City during a single week in May. One is the Paris Caf\u00e9 , a casual, all-day proposition inside Eero Saarinen's T.W.A. terminal at Kennedy International Airport, now gloriously resurrected as the TWA Hotel. The second is a polished seafood house that sits out in the East River on the end of Pier 17, next to the wreck of the old Fulton Fish Market; it's called the Fulton . Because I've been to both so recently, I can report confidently that the Fulton slices deep-red strawberries over strawberry ice cream and a sorbet made from strawberries and red wine to make its strawberry sundae, while the one at the Paris Caf\u00e9 substitutes dried strawberries. That version isn't bad, but there is an undeniable difference between fresh summer berries and dehydrated ones, and that difference suggests the quality gap between the two restaurants. The best reasons to go to the Paris Caf\u00e9 are Saarinen's glass walls, gliding curves and suspended catwalk, although the dining areas are swell, too, smartly evoking Raymond Loewy's original design for the space, which looked like a coffee shop on the moon. The place has some likable pizzas and salads, and it vaults clear over the other restaurants at the airport. But the recipes seem designed not to push the kitchen too hard, the menu is even more Vongerichtenesque than usual, and any dishes involving fruits or vegetables will make you wonder whether the produce truck drove to La Guardia instead. The Fulton, though, is a grown-up production. Under the day-to-day command of Noah Poses, the executive chef, it is easily the best seafood restaurant to open in Manhattan since the Pool , and easier to afford. Yes, a handful of items on the menu have that glassy-eyed stare, but almost everything else comes through. To get to the Fulton, you have to walk almost all the way to the end of the pier, where some tall planters cordon off the Fulton's outdoor tables. All the tables, indoors and out, have a view of the Brooklyn Bridge, but the best backdrops are inside and upstairs, where you can see that you're surrounded by water. Mentioning the view as a selling point will make some New Yorkers cringe. But Pier 17's developer, clearly hoping to erase the stigma, has recruited David Chang, Andrew Carmellini and Mr. Vongerichten. Day trippers and tourists will love the Fulton, in any case, and they will be right. True, the outdoor patio feels like the beachside bar of some island resort, with soft-core club music playing and servers carrying too-small trays slinking around in long skirts. Once you get inside, though, the tension in the open kitchen lets you know this is, in fact, New York. Running a seafood house gives Mr. Vongerichten an opening to lead with one of his strong suits, raw fish. The sea trout tartare is stirred with raw oysters and horseradish, which creates the uncanny momentary illusion that you're eating beef. White ponzu, made from white soy sauce, is the centerpiece of a platter of iced sashimi. Local fluke, taking a bath in habanero vinaigrette, is topped with mint and Sichuan buttons; even if you know what's coming -- Sichuan buttons are the flower buds of the toothache plant, which when chewed, produce a numbing and cooling sensation -- the dish is a surprise. The Fulton's Manhattan clam chowder is spicy, thick with potatoes and a healthy portion of clams. It's the rare version that tastes as good as it sounds, although purists will deduct one point for the absence of oyster crackers. There's a very intriguing sesame-poppy crust on the soft-shell crabs; you have just enough time to register the seeds before a potent green salsa of coriander and jalape\u00f1o kicks in. Few chefs are as skilled at using acidity, heat and salt to bring definition to a dish. So it's a surprise to realize how generic the Fulton's fish stew is, or to wonder what the ingredient is that throws the red snapper ceviche in watermelon juice out of whack. A separate menu card lets you know that most of the seafood in the main courses can be ordered \"simply cooked.\" I was never curious enough to try it, being too distracted by the salmon in a cumin-coriander seed crust so fragrant it turns heads; the sea bass and carrots in a life-affirming pool of lemon-turmeric sauce; and the detailed-oriented fish and crisps, a brick of flounder kept at scalding temperature by a leakproof and supernaturally crunchy buckwheat batter. Served with mashed fresh peas, it could almost pass for English if it didn't come with saffron aioli. Most distracting of all is the whole black bass baked inside a fish-shaped pastry lavishly decorated with golden scales, fins, gills and other parts the bass itself won't be needing anymore. It takes a good 10 minutes to unveil it, fillet it and then plate it together with slices of crust, some tomato concass\u00e9 and a sauce choron, and I doubt many movies playing in theaters now can rival it for entertainment. Wonderful as it is to see one of the showpieces of pre-nouvelle cuisine given so much attention, you could ask whether whole fish en croute really makes sense after, say, kale salad. Mr. Vongerichten's technical approach may let him generate a menu full of smart, reliably pleasurable food, but it doesn't guarantee that it will all hang together. The pastry menu does, though, by sneakily staying true to classic American desserts. What's sold as Meyer lemon pudding turns out to be more like a lemon meringue tart with a quick, pulsing acidity; the apricot pie is more like a crisp, with oatmeal streusel on top; and the highlight of the strawberry sundae isn't the fresh fruit but the strawberry ice cream, its flavor straight out of the summertime ice cream shacks in a thousand vacation towns.

If Darryl and Melissa Burnette had been able to afford to rent a space bigger than 275 square feet for their restaurant, Belle Harlem , Mr. Burnette might do the cooking behind a wall instead of behind a counter. Ms. Burnette, his wife and business partner, might spend all night going in and out a swinging kitchen door instead of paying attention to the customers sitting at the 12 seats in the restaurant's single room. At this point, after three years in business, Belle Harlem might be run by employees, and the Burnettes might come in a few times a week to keep an eye on things. Instead they have a paid staff of one. His name is Alex Geudelekian. He was eating dinner there one night, noticed that the weeds were growing up around Mr. Burnette's ankles, asked if he needed help, and has been the sous-chef ever since. The smell of foie gras gravy with duck breast being seared on one of the three induction burners might not rush up to meet you when you step through the door, on the opposite side of Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard from Striver's Row. You might not hear the hiss of chicken being fried inside buttermilk batter before it is arranged between standing partitions of pizzelle and tied together by an amber river of truffled maple syrup warmed with jalape\u00f1os and bananas. If you didn't hear the low roar of a Searzall torch as it warms a plate and then melts and browns a patch of Cheddar, you might not know that you're about to be served Mr. Burnette's cheese-steak crostini. (These are small toasts stacked with seared filet and melted cheese, and in between are onions that have been caramelized until they're sweet enough to be a dessert topping. The Cheddar would cause every Philadelphian who lives within 10 blocks of East Passyunk Avenue to pick up the nearest blunt object, but it makes a certain amount of sense when you taste it.) Some of Belle Harlem's space limitations are, in fact, a little constricting. When the place is full, some customers have to ride sidesaddle, their knees angled away from the counter, because if they faced it head-on they'd cut off the narrow path to the restroom in the back. But 275 square feet are what the Burnettes have to work with, and they have made this shallow sliver into something rare not just in Harlem but in all Manhattan. One of the peculiarities of dining in the city, circa 2019, is that the more high-functioning a restaurant is, the less likely you are to encounter a proprietor. There are exceptions, of course, but often the most successful restaurateurs are very busy people, so they leave their dining rooms in the hands of professional managers. Proprietors aren't always as smooth as professionals, but they are as attuned to what goes on in their dining rooms as new parents are to the noises coming from a bassinet. I never quite felt as if I were attending a dinner party in the Burnettes' apartment, which is the feeling they say they're going for, but I always knew I was in a place that somebody cared about. Their original plan was to feed everyone the same meal -- a tasting menu. \"We found out pretty quickly Harlem wasn't ready,\" Mr. Burnette said in an interview. How quickly? \"We tried one night.\" Belle Harlem rolled out an \u00e0 la carte menu the next day. It stuck. The first half is given to smaller plates, although one of the hallmarks of the restaurant is that the Burnettes don't serve anything truly small. They want you to eat. Two people could get away with ordering one main course and two appetizers, though I'd urge anyone going to Belle Harlem not to overlook dessert. These introductory dishes are where Mr. Burnette takes casual American vernacular food like chicken and waffles out for a stroll. His fried chicken has a convoluted, frilly crust, with plenty of golden surface area for the jalape\u00f1o-banana syrup to get lost in. The pizzelles are a new idea of his, replacing the regular waffles he used to make, and they work best when he cooks them to a dark crisp. This is also where you'll find the cheese-steak crostini, as well as spring rolls stuffed with macaroni and cheese -- kid food in a fried shell, yes, but a bacon marmalade with fresh dill makes it unexpectedly complex, a chef's dish. The bottom of the menu is more substantial: The pan-seared, smoked pork tenderloin, for instance, is bigger than what usually crosses a 12-seat tasting counter. This month, Mr. Burnette is laying the barrels of pork over a cherry compote with basil leaves, with a few snap peas for added sweetness. He brings a keen sense of what to do with ingredients as they come into season to the vegetables he grows on the roof of the Burnettes' apartment building, a block away. The tiny yields of an urban garden wouldn't satisfy a larger restaurant, but they can shuffle right onto the menu at Belle Harlem, and shuffle off again when they're all gone. This month, there are thin bands of zucchini under the beef tenderloin, and young, soft favas around the lobster salad. There are more favas over pan-seared dorade and garden chives, with the almost transparently thin noodles tossed with butter and cream and tucked under the fish fillet. Mr. Burnette, who is black and who grew up in rural southwestern Virginia, has said he worked up the nerve to move north for culinary school after seeing the chef Marcus Samuelsson on television . (\"I thought, hell, if he could do it, I could do it, too.\") Sometimes today, in his restaurant less than a mile away from Mr. Samuelsson's Red Rooster Harlem , he reaches back to his childhood for ideas. A dessert in a glass called the Triflin' Ho-Ho is an acknowledged homage to Hostess cakes, although there is an English trifle in the mix, too, as well as a trace of Spice Market , where Mr. Burnette once worked. The chocolate in the broken shards of cake pulses, intriguingly, with Urfa pepper; its heat rubs up against the passion-fruit cream, brandied cherries and whipped cream that fill the glass. A year ago, Belle Harlem eliminated tips and raised prices. If you take that into account, check totals can still seem high, especially if you happen to be served pale, limp housemade potato chips or a $42 duck breast with a bitter arugula sauce and a poached pear that tastes like alcohol. The margins must be tight. At times you almost hear them squeak, as when Ms. Burnette anxiously reminds you that you were a few minutes late and suggests you order quickly so she can turn the seat in time for the next reservation. A professional manager might have brought a more soothing manner to the exchange. But a manager might not be as genuinely happy to see a party of three walk in without a reservation just when three seats had opened up, and might not smile as widely when told that the sparkling ros\u00e9 is fantastic with the lobster salad, and would she mind pouring another glass? No, she doesn't mind at all. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

One of several operations he is running in the new Times Square Edition hotel, it is clad in paneling on the walls and ceilings. Velvet curtains and banquettes are the slightly alarming color of a blue macaw's tail feathers. Wooden blinds are usually snapped shut against the strobes of 47th Street and Seventh Avenue. To get to your table, you must first pass between two identical Champagne trolleys. An iced reservoir in the center of each is loaded with about half a dozen bottles that range in price from a Blanquette de Limoux for $26 a glass to a 2006 brut from Dom P\u00e9rignon for $66 a glass. Before you sit down, you've already learned that wine is front and center, literally and figuratively; that it is more likely to come from classic, mannerly European estates than, say, Macedonian villages still using amphoras that Odysseus drank from; that the ideal customer is not likely to get up and walk out upon being offered a $66 aperitif; and that the restaurant expects to attract so many of these customers that a single Champagne trolley is not enough. Which is to say that Marriott International and the hotelier Ian Schrager installed 701West on the 11th floor of the Edition for people who still think a leisurely, three-course dinner with a few interesting bottles and some of the customary niceties is worth spending money on. It belongs to a species of restaurant that is no longer in great supply in Manhattan, let alone on the intersection where the green neon of the Olive Garden faces off across Seventh Avenue against the giant candy bars of Hershey's Chocolate World. It also marks Mr. Fraser's first arabesques on the stage of formal dining since Dovetail closed last year. These are early days for 701West, but so far I've found the cooking more original and appealing than Dovetail's in its final phase. As you know if you've tried the fried-cauliflower buns at Nix, or the ramen-style boiled eggs at the Loyal whose yolks are red with a film of jellied chile oil, Mr. Fraser has a playful, imaginative streak. He needs it at 701West, where there is no real theme beyond wine and style. But there is enough creativity across the menu, on which he collaborates with the chef de cuisine, Rob Lawson, and the pastry chef, S\u00e9bastien Rouxel, to make dinner the engaging, somewhat eccentric experience it is clearly meant to be. Before the first courses appear, for example, there may be a \"cauliflower mille-feuille,\" the raw vegetable shaved into white sheets that are softened by chilled mezcal cream and then topped with sturgeon caviar. It's enticingly off-kilter, and another frequent amuse manages to outdo it: a spoonful or so of white-asparagus foam above a warm custard of sunflower-seed butter, dense and nutty and sweet with a few drops of honey. This is luxury dining in its way, which is not the predictable way. The menu proposes three courses for $98, but a server informed me that \"we also have \u00e0 la carte, if that's more your rhythm for the evening.\" Frequently the surprises come in the form of an unexpected tweak dealt to a vegetable. Slowly cooked in beet juice, a whole beet takes on the glistening ruby intensity of raw bluefin tuna. There is an appetizer of actual bluefin as well, and it has the precise, Japanese-informed minimalism of a dish you'd get at Jean-Georges, with tiny spring peas and young turnip greens and an electrifying white cloud of grated horseradish. In a dish of fava agnolotti, the X factor is the bright, almost effervescent sparkle of vinegar-marinated tomatoes and their juices stirred into a Parmesan-rind broth. There is one mystifying appetizer in which the dueling tidal flavors of sea urchin and squid-ink risotto are allowed to cancel each other out. For the most part, though, the plates don't overreach, for all the inventiveness on display. Asparagus dipped in aioli is a good idea, of course, but what if the asparagus has been steamed inside a wrapper of thinly shaved cedar until it is nearly as smoky as country bacon? And what if the aioli is enhanced by truffles? It may sound overworked, but it is such a thrill that one of my guests asked for another plate before we could move on to the main courses, throwing the rhythm for the evening right out the window. The night will pause again if one of the main courses is the sweet potato, as everyone tries to figure out where it got its creaminess and savory depth. Even once you know it's been sealed up and baked inside a little coffin of sourdough that is streaked with green threads of wakame seaweed, you still can't quite believe that all this flavor has been achieved with an ordinary sweet potato. Some of the large pieces of fish and meat are showstoppers on their own, like the lobster that rests for four days in aged-beef fat before being broiled and set over some jammy ratatouille. When they are not, something else on the plate usually is. The long slab of roasted duck breast dredged in powdered herbes de Provence would keep my attention even without its sidekick, a curiously likable risotto made from pine nuts. In the case of lamb, the firecracker is a cocotte of fresh, creamy cranberry beans. Mr. Rouxel, recently of Upland and the Clocktower, brings a lighter-than-air quality to the desserts. Hovering over a crunchy buckwheat pastry crust is a wavy sea of pastry cream infused with parsnips. It's earthy and ethereal at the same time. He even knows what to do with white chocolate, aerating it into a mousse to frost an English-pea sponge cake, and giving it a piercing sour-cherry sorbet as a foil. All seven captains working at 701West are sommeliers, listed by name on the menu; they are assisted by back servers who are sommeliers in training. This is one of those innovations in service that seems obvious now that somebody's actually doing it. The meal can become an evening-long conversation about wine; the sommeliers even invite you to play the wine-insiders' game of guessing the identity of a mystery pour in a black glass. It is slightly incredible that a restaurant that tries so hard to give wine equal status with the cooking does not have more bottles for under $80. That said, the ones it does have tend to be very good and fairly priced. Besides 701West, Mr. Fraser is in charge of the deep-dish focaccia, carrot Bolognese and \"billboard burger\" at the Terrace and Outdoor Gardens, which is open all day on the ninth floor. He also oversees the dinner-theater menus at the Paradise Club on the seventh floor, which is currently staging \"The Devouring,\" a neo-Burlesque extravaganza (juggling, sword swallowing, aerial acrobatics) purportedly inspired by William Blake. This was no doubt the destination of the stilt walker I nearly ran into in the lobby one night. Dressed in scarlet from head to heel, she got along faster on her stilts than I do on my own legs.

Realizing that this was somewhat ambiguous, especially applied to a dish as laden with stuff as the brew of lambs' snouts, ears, tongues, cheeks and eyeballs known in Turkey as kelle paca, I tried again. \"Is it very filling, I mean?\" My concern was a familiar one, to me at least. I was in Queens, at a new Turkish restaurant in Astoria called Lokanta , and the menu was so appealing that I wanted to try it all. Already I was set on a few bourekas, some labneh, the fava dip and some form of braised lamb over eggplant. I'd spotted another three or four dishes that I was probably going to tack on at the end of my order, as if by afterthought. I suspected that I could add a small bowl of kelle paca and still eat everything else. But a big bowl, one so thick with bits formerly affixed to a sheep's skull that a spoon would stand up in it, might tip the scale. The server pondered this for a while until a wiry man got up from his marble-topped table in the corner and conferred with her. Wearing baggy jeans, a white T-shirt and a baseball cap that kept his zinc-colored ponytail in place, he looked like a contractor, maybe a painter who'd come by to touch up the moldings and had been invited to stay for a Turkish coffee. Then he spoke to us about the sheep's head soup. \"I am a genius,\" he began. \"And even I don't know how to answer this question. I think that the question must be wrong.\" As those who chase the scent of lamb and charred eggplant around the city have probably guessed, this was no contractor. This was Orhan Yegen, the Turkish-born chef and restaurateur who has opened close to 20 Turkish restaurants over the past two decades or so while keeping up a running monologue that made him a favorite of food writers . In 2004, Mr. Yegen opened Sip Sak in Turtle Bay, then proceeded to surprise those who had charted his career by embarking on a long, stable period . All was quiet, relatively speaking, until April, when Lokanta arrived in Astoria to supplement the Greek and Cypriot menus along its stretch of Broadway, and Mr. Yegen arrived to tell customers that their questions were wrong. The kelle paca colloquy ended when I agreed to order it. After hours on the stove, the meat on the head had fallen away into about eight different textures, from frilly to ropy to collagenously chewy to tender and lean. All of this suspended in a slippery, almost sticky broth the color of cappuccino. And no, it was not too filling. Soups, braises, stews and other recipes requiring plenty of time and even more olive oil are the basis of Mr. Yegen's reputation. They set his menus apart from those at other Turkish restaurants around town, which tend to revolve around the grill. Lokanta makes very fine kofte, but for a full medley of minced and skewered meats, you are better off under the swaying chandeliers of Taci's Beyti on Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn. Lokanta will grill or roast a whole fish, but it will not be all that different from what might be served in Brooklyn at Liman , where your bass will be filleted within view of the fishing boats and swans of Sheepshead Bay. Diners in Lokanta's custody have signed on for a more nuanced view of the Turkish kitchen. Take, for instance, the shadings that lamb takes on. In hunkar begendi, chunks of it are stewed in tomatoes and peppers and ladled over an eggplant mash beaten to a memorable richness with cheese and milk. Ali nazik is, in schematic form, the same thing, built on the same foundation of milky eggplant, but in Lokanta's version the lamb is ground and simmered with onions and red and green peppers; somehow it achieves a rich, unctuous consistency that is amplified by the eggplant and the scoop of strained yogurt dropped on top. Lokanta's \"roasted lamb and rice\" is in the pilaf family, which means that the rice is not just a side dish but the heart of the recipe, baked until alluringly sweet with currants, allspice and cinnamon, then sprinkled with fresh dill at the last minute. The lamb's job is to be obligingly tender, and it succeeds, one reason the dish is requested by so many tables. To fend off boredom, I imagine, Mr. Yegen fills his manti with both lamb and beef. Each little dumpling is rolled by fingertip and is roughly the size of one. The meat has been seasoned just forcefully enough that it will announce itself, politely but clearly, as it breaks through the dough. It would be possible to sit down in front of a bowl of these, spooning them up with their warm yogurt and chile oil and dried mint, and call for another bowl a minute later. Of course, the meal should begin with strips of nigella-dotted Turkish bread and a spread or two -- maybe memorably creamy pur\u00e9e of dried favas; or the roughly mashed eggplant, smoky without a trace of bitterness; and one of the strained-yogurt dips, either the tangy cacik, laced with minced cucumbers, or the labneh, as firm as a new mattress. Either will prove useful as the meal goes on. So will a simple salad, especially the one with white beans and purple onions. The tightly rolled, golden bourekas are like skinny Turkish spring rolls filled with dill and melting feta. Cold poached leeks, a frequent special, are more appealing than the cold poached artichokes that have a permanent spot on the menu. If Mr. Yegen tells you that the grilled octopus is the best in the city, keep in mind that he rarely seems to leave his own restaurant. It's quite good, though, with a fugitive sweetness that may be supplied by the tomatoes and purple onions. Desserts run toward milky white puddings, nice if you are looking for a mild sedative. The baklava, imported from Turkey, is a treat for those of us who like pistachios and think sugar syrup makes a better baklava sweetener than honey. The unlikely champion, though, is the butternut squash that has been languorously baked in its own juices with nothing but sugar. The technique is one of those small tricks that helps Mr. Yegen's cooking stand out, like the perfume of lemon peel in the Turkish lemonade. Lokanta has no liquor license yet. Some customers smuggle wine through the door and keep the bottles on their tables, which are topped with radiant white marble from Turkey and surrounded by classic bentwood cafe chairs. But it is hard not to want the lemonade, which is cold and just tart enough and not very filling at all. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

TAK Room is so determined to be \"timeless,\" as Mr. Keller has often called it, that it seems clueless. TAK Room opened in March, one of 11 restaurants inside the 720,000-square-foot mall at 20 Hudson Yards. Parts of Hudson Yards are still under construction, but enough has been finished for most New Yorkers to figure out that this fistful of glass needles stabbed into the West Side wasn't built for them. Just as the helipad the city offered to build for Amazon crystallized anger about the cruddy state of our subways, the glittering new home on 10th Avenue for global luxury brands, investment funds, law firms, business travelers and hunters of seven- or eight-figure apartments spurred a lot of New Yorkers to ask, What's in it for us? Mr. Keller's answer is a restaurant that looks and acts like a millionaire's hangout in an old New Yorker cartoon. It charges like one, too, with adjustments for inflation. An eggplant Parmesan is the least expensive main course, at $30, followed by the New Zealand salmon for $42. After that, please turn off all electronic devices and place your tray tables in the upright, locked position, because we are going up to $66 and $75 before reaching a cruising altitude of $85. Look down there -- don't the people look just like ants? TAK Room's timing is off in other ways, too. Hudson Yards has stirred up New Yorkers' latent resentment of chain stores from beyond the Hudson, and what does Mr. Keller offer them but a clone of his restaurant in Florida, the Surf Club ? The name has been changed, but the menus are nearly identical; they glorify the strait-laced, spice-free food that rich white Americans used to feed on when nobody was shaming them into being adventurous. It is the food of \"21,\" of three-martini lunches, steakhouses and country clubs: prime rib and Dover sole, iceberg lettuce and oysters Rockefeller. Of course, being a Thomas Keller production, TAK Room serves the most refined, meticulous country club food you've ever seen. Most of it is very good, and a few things are so inexplicably delicious that you have the sensation of slipping the knots of gravity and floating an inch or so above your seat. The entrance is on the fifth floor, just past Neiman Marcus. But the action is on the sixth floor, up a Deco-cubist staircase so grand that you may feel a little underdressed unless you have Carole Lombard on one arm. (There is no dress code.) At the top, you find yourself in a lounge where a pianist and upright bassist glide through satiny jazz standards. Bartenders whip up streamlined, uncomplicated drinks that are either genuine classics, like the Pendennis Club, or modern drinks built along classic proportions, like the Tritter rickey, a tall, fizzy gin number that shimmies with absinthe. Around sunset, when pink light trickles through the western windows, it has to be the most pleasant room within a mile for fighting vainly the old ennui . They let people eat in this room, too, and it is tempting. But there is more to see, room after room, all laid out by the London interior-design firm David Collins Studio. There are leather banquettes deep enough to lose a small child in. Facing them are mohair-velvet chairs that swivel so you can quietly surveil the room without craning your neck. Each table gets a white linen cloth and a flickering oil lamp behind a white porcelain shade. The other colors are black walnut, midnight blue and law-firm green. At some point a captain in a crisply tailored suit will deposit the wine list. It mostly avoids the latest fashions, like a croquet party on Nantucket. Later there will be a preamble to the menu. Under the day-to-day care of Jarrod Huth, TAK Room's chef de cuisine, it has a continental theme and an \u00e0 la carte format. Highlights will be pointed out, and the prime rib will certainly be mentioned, as will the restored 1930s silver trolley on which it is ferried from table to table. Here comes a French onion dip surrounded by newly fried potato chips that are dark without a hint of charring. This is TAK Room in one extremely crunchy, lusciously creamy bite: an hors d'oeuvre from the age of Naugahyde and polyester, transformed into something so good and pure it's beyond reproach. The Parker House rolls are gravity-defying orbs served with soft cultured butter that, in the evening's best magic trick, rises from a custom-made dish in six identical ridged curls , like shrimp performing a Busby Berkeley routine. Bespoke flourishes like that are a TAK Room hallmark; see also the oyster crackers, like down pillows shrunk to the size of Chiclets, served with the silk-smooth New England clam chowder that is one of the most likable appetizers and, at $16, the best value. Another hallmark, though, is unevenness. Avocado Louie with a small bouquet of other vegetables is thrillingly right, thanks to a Thousand Island dressing that crackles with energy; the Caesar salad, made while you watch, has almost no personality. Grated Parmesan and anchovies vanish into it without a trace, along with dull croutons that could take some pointers from the oyster crackers. Something called \"warm soft boiled egg\" is a quietly joyous celebration of luxurious flavors and textures, the yolk running like lava over a buckwheat blin and a heap of warm osetra caviar in cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. (Yes, warm. It's wonderful.) And the chilled prawn cocktail is going to be my platonic ideal of the dish from now on. But the crab cake had very little crab flavor, on two different nights, although it contained almost nothing else. Lobster thermidor (now there's a name I've not heard in a long, long time) is so tender, its sauce so fluffy and rich, that eating it becomes an intimate act. Dover sole meuni\u00e8re, though, has neither the crisped skin nor the juicy flesh that can make this fish so alluring. Yes, life cannot be one giant plate of dancing butter-shrimp. Still, the gap between great and non-great items -- nothing comes close to bad -- is a bit too wide and comes into view a bit too often. Regulars will learn to work the menu the way golfers learn their way around the eighth hole at Pebble Beach. Some will love the prime rib, which could not be any more moist without breaking several laws of chemistry. Others will wish that it had more concentrated beef flavor and that the flaps and handles had not been trimmed off, perhaps in pursuit of some Kellerian quest for bovine symmetry. A large number will settle on the roast chicken for two. The meat is juicy but not gushy, the flavor full but not salty, the jus dark but not over-reduced. After the chicken, the pastry chef, Alex McClenaghan, can offer a highly refined coconut cake or an urbane lemon meringue tart, but you'd almost have to be insane not to get the chocolate cake. Certainly a close relative of devil's food cake, his version weaves dark-chocolate cremeux between its many, many layers, all of them wrapped in a dark-chocolate frosting. And there will be regulars, because the rewards of TAK Room, if you can find them and pay for them, are as intense as the chocolate in that cake. The core audience may turn out to be travelers on loan from the Surf Club and Mr. Keller's California strongholds, or they may just be people who like the feeling of crashing the country club. Anti-plutocrat fevers come and go, but the trappings of American aristocracy are always in style somewhere.

Banh beo, a species of small rice cake, are a favorite afternoon snack in the central Vietnamese city of Hue. Each one is steamed in a ceramic dish just big enough to hold a few spare coins. Faced with a platter of banh beo, you realize fairly quickly that you have essentially two choices: You can use a spoon, or hold the dish to your mouth and tip it up while throwing your head back, as if doing a Jell-O shot. If you go the Jell-O shot route, it may help to bring a pair of chopsticks or a fingertip into play at the last minute to encourage the banh beo to leave the nest. You have now transferred to your mouth a warm divot of steamed rice and tapioca flours that has a consistency like panna cotta's and a negligible flavor on its own. All the action is in the toppings. At Van Da, these include a spoonful of chopped scallions and the green oil in which they were sizzled, red rings of fresh Thai chile, some fish sauce, rehydrated dried shrimp and a flap of fried tofu skin, standing in for the pork rinds a banh beo vendor in Hue would use. The divot of rice cake is still warm, which helps the aromas drive their way into your head. It's over in a minute. If you're lucky, there will be another banh beo on the table so you can start over. Van Da joined the East Village's growing hub of interesting Vietnamese restaurants three months ago. Like Hanoi House , Madame Vo and Madame Vo BBQ , it is semitraditional and semimodern. Those two strains are embodied at Van Da by, respectively, Yen Ngo and Hannah Wong. Ms. Ngo, who owns the place, was raised in Dalat, Vietnam, and while she has worked in restaurants and catering in New York City for years, she has never had a chance before to show off the food of her childhood, like the banh beo steamed by her mother, who had grown up in Hue. Ms. Wong is the chef. Though she has cooked at Gramercy Tavern and Battersby , her background in the food of Vietnam before Van Da was more or less confined to the roughly two weeks she spent traveling there while living in Hong Kong on a Fulbright grant a decade ago. Nevertheless, she has put together a trenchant, concise and pleasure-focused menu of Vietnamese dishes. Some she learned directly from her boss, and on those recipes she was apparently discouraged from drawing outside the lines. Others are more freely interpreted. It's a credit to Ms. Wong's sensitivity that if you don't already know the original templates, it can be hard to tell where they end and her imagination begins. Banh beo and the other snacks from Hue that Ms. Ngo taught Ms. Wong get their own berth on the menu. As you'd imagine, they tend to be very good. Banh it ram are chewy, fried balls of mochi, filled with a coconut-soaked mash of mung beans and shallots. Banh khot are little rice-flour pancakes molded into edible cups about the size of a Ritz cracker. In Vietnam, the cups would be filled with shrimp. Ms. Wong instead spoons saut\u00e9ed mushrooms into hers, along with a crisscrossing of fresh herbs and a spill of coconut cream. Ms. Wong makes an effort to bring out regional differences in Vietnamese cuisine by devoting sections of the menu to Saigon and Hanoi, hundreds of miles apart, as well as Hue, somewhere in the middle. She doesn't have quite enough dishes from any one place to paint a full picture, but the project is intriguing. Like other New York chefs, she has been caught in the tractor beam of cha ca la Vong , the turmeric-and dill-scented fish dish that is a specialty of a 100-year-old Hanoi restaurant of the same name. Her version, though, supplies less dill, less sauce and less satisfaction than some others. Her two improvisations on the theme of Hanoi's best-known contribution to gastronomy, pho, are more effective. One gives you the soup without the noodles; floating in a rich and cloudy broth are ghostly white, billowing won tons that contain chopped beef fillet freely seasoned with black pepper. The other dish is, humbly enough, a plate of soupless pho noodles stir-fried with springy mushrooms, bitter greens and chopped scallions. Its simplicity makes the impact of the dish hard to explain until you learn that it has been showered with Maggi Seasoning , a soylike sauce that is the invisible secret of many Vietnamese dishes. Nodding toward Saigon, Ms. Wong makes a rendition of shaking beef by stir-frying tender and chewy marinated hanger steak with potatoes and then throwing a fistful of watercress at it. If you think that sounds like a French bistro plate, then you are starting to understand how her mind works. Ms. Wong cooks skillfully, with an appreciation for nuance, and she doesn't abuse her freedom by innovating pointlessly. It's possible, though, that she could stand to be less shy with chiles and herbs. The table salad of greenery to be wrapped around grilled shrimp offers no herbs other than mint and basil, and you'll run out of lettuce before the fourth shrimp has been dressed. The green papaya salad is a little too innocuous, and while her version of the street snack of grilled corn in fish sauce is a real success, fresh chiles would have more impact than the chile threads Ms. Wong balances on top. (Incidentally, the kitchen at Van Da makes a fine hot sauce that is like a milder and less acidic Sriracha, but servers never seem to remember to mention it until the end of the meal.) There are just three desserts. By the time you order, one or two may have been 86ed. With luck, though, the che will have survived. In Vietnam, che is thought of as a drink even though it can take the form of a pudding, as it does here, where warm pearls and threads of tapioca are cooked in coconut milk with cubes of soft taro. It is just sweet enough to qualify as a dessert. A black dust darkens the surface: black-sesame brittle, ground to powder. Even a single dessert qualifies as an impressive feat inside Van Da's tight quarters. Through the miracle of careful design, the space almost never feels cramped, but this is still an intimate restaurant. In the basement is a small seating area laid out as efficiently as the cockpit of a fighter jet; above it, at the top of a staircase, is an even smaller seating area sharing a room with a window-facing dining counter, the kitchen and a bar. The cocktails that roll off that bar, like the gin-and-celery duet called the White Tiger, are much more sharply drawn than the drinks at restaurants with twice the space and four times the budget.

No doubt it went through the same birth pangs as all the others. As far as I can tell, though, it simply materialized one morning this March at 70 Pine Street, and was open for business that afternoon by the time the financial district's elevators began disgorging traders, bankers and analysts in search of 5-o'clock refreshment. One reason it seems to have crept up on the city is that it's a large, well-capitalized, big-time restaurant of the kind that only established groups seem able to get off the ground these days. Yet Crown Shy doesn't come from Danny Meyer, Andrew Carmellini or any of the other usual suspects. Its two main players were recruited after talks among April Bloomfield, Ken Friedman and the building's developer fell apart in 2016, before accusations of sexual harassment engulfed Mr. Friedman. Crown Shy's chef, James Kent, used to run the kitchen at the NoMad , and his partner, Jeff Katz, is the managing partner at Del Posto . Neither exactly fell off the turnip truck last week. As a team, though, they're unproven, and as they went through construction and hiring, the drumbeat of publicity was more muted than it might have been if marquee names had led the project. Then there is Crown Shy's location, a sprawling, soaring, street-level space that, as far as anyone recalls, has never held a restaurant before. Many New Yorkers have seen the 1932 building's distinctive, hulking, pyramidal silhouette on the skyline, but until recently, when the offices on its 67 stories were repurposed as expensive apartments and hotel rooms, not many had encountered the frenzied exuberance of the lobby, which makes use of polished marble in at least five contrasting colors. It looks like something Bernini would have designed if he'd lived to see the Jazz Age. Depending on which entrance you use -- the revolving doors are crowned with aluminum reliefs of Art Deco flowers being pollinated by elongated stylized butterflies -- you may want to allow an extra five or 10 minutes to take it all in before you eat. Above all, it's the extent to which Crown Shy already has its act together that makes you ask: Where did this place come from? The whole operation radiates confidence from start to finish. The finish brings real desserts from a real pastry chef, Renata Ameni. She comes to Crown Shy fresh from Manresa, in Los Gatos, Calif ., and before that, she put in half a decade at Eleven Madison Park . Her desserts at Crown Shy look uncomplicated, and you don't realize how intelligently they've been put together until you start to eat one. There's a milky-white yogurt cheesecake under tender spring strawberries, with smooth strawberry sorbet in the center and a pistachio crumble sprinkled over that. Her chocolate tart gives her a chance to show off about half a dozen different effects she can work with chocolate, starting with a crunchy, crumbly, almost salty chocolate crust, moving on to a soft, souffl\u00e9-like filling and ending with curls of dark chocolate. Ms. Ameni's side of the kitchen is also responsible for the savory churros filled with Gruy\u00e8re sauce -- the menu calls them fritters, they taste like goug\u00e8res and the texture is something else entirely. Also her work: the miniature loaf of pull-apart bread that appears after you order. With dried olives on top and olive tapenade between every skinny slice, it is one of the most memorable parts of the meal. Even the obligatory scoops of ice cream that restaurants seem required to offer aren't allowed to leave her pastry station until they've been turned into a composed dessert, and not some kind of slapdash sundae , either. Satsuma ice cream gets to wear a toasted turban of marshmallowy meringue and some cracked honeycomb candy on the side. The effect is witty and delicious, progressing from purely sweet to bittersweet to tart and bittersweet. Mr. Kent's savory dishes pursue the same strategy. This is to say, they regularly over-deliver, starting with the iced Wellfleet oysters dressed with cucumber jelly, diced cucumbers, grains of jalape\u00f1o and microleaves of purple shiso. An almost absurdly creamy pur\u00e9e of white bean hummus under a fiery red slick of melted 'nduja is probably meant to be shared, but as soon as I'd tasted it I came up with other ideas, as my dinner guests will testify. Two tartares show Mr. Kent's talent for carrying bright new ideas with him into well-traveled territory. In the first, he laces hand-chopped raw beef with toasted walnuts and earthy rye croutons; in the other, chopped raw snapper is sprinkled with individual juice-filled vesicles of grapefruit, lime, lemon and orange that pop between your teeth, a kind of instant, interactive ceviche. Maybe one or two ideas should have been left by the side of the road. The chicken liver rag\u00f9 tossed with housemade cavatelli doesn't need to be so sweet with sherry; a rough pesto is a fine use for fresh chickpeas, but isn't there a better partner for it than shaved jicama? All is forgiven when Mr. Kent turns a mainstay like grilled chicken into a main course as exciting as the one at Crown Shy, which keeps the sunshine brightness of its citrus marinade, and is served with a pur\u00e9e-slash-hot sauce of fermented hot and sweet peppers. The vivid orange of that hot sauce almost matches the marble in the lobby. But Crown Shy's two big dining rooms and extended bar are a little more restrained, dominated by cream tones, blond wood tables, and chairs with saddle-brown leather seats and backs. The only echoes of grandeur are the enormous windows and the ceiling high up overhead. The wine list is one to get lost in. Finance wizards with bonuses to expunge can certainly do that, but it's great to see lots of bottles under $100 on almost every page. Anyone who knows what some of these wines cost wholesale will be able to locate any number of good deals, but even the unschooled will notice the value regions. They jump off the page: Portugal, Greece and New Zealand, for instance, along with vast stretches of Germany and pockets of Spain, France and Italy. With so many strengths, Crown Shy must have at least one thing wrong with it. And yes, it does. Obviously that name is ridiculous. Knowing that it refers to a tendency of very tall trees not to let their upper stories grow into their neighbors' branches doesn't help, either. But we should probably get used to it, because we're going to be hearing more about this restaurant. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

The sheer number of restaurants in the city -- about 27,000, according to the health inspectors -- makes the argument absurd. How many of them are slipping? All of them? Just the first 20,000 or so? In reality, people who gripe about the state of New York restaurants are usually talking about a sliver of a slice of a fraction, probably around 50 places whose names are in steady circulation, with the newest weighing most heavily in the results. The number of really good ones is higher than anyone can count. Places that other cities would brag about get lost in the crowd here. The chef G\u00fcnther Seeger, for instance, was a national star when he cooked in Atlanta. The tasting-menu restaurant he opened in the West Village three years ago should have been a major destination, especially after he dropped the prices. Mr. Seeger can make ingredients bend to his will almost without touching them. His cooking outshone that of some of the city's more famous chefs, who whip their ingredients harder with far less payoff. Yet he struggled to put G\u00fcnther Seeger NY on the map. I reviewed it, but some other critics didn't, and by the time it closed, last month, Chris Crowley of Grub Street wrote , \"it wasn't a restaurant you heard a lot of food geeks talk about.\" Mr. Seeger complained to one acquaintance that he couldn't even get on a list of New York's 100 best restaurants. Of course, good restaurants fail everywhere, but it's hard to imagine Mr. Seeger vanishing into the crowd in San Francisco, Chicago or Los Angeles. Considered and rejected, maybe. But overlooked? Not likely. I'm not sure that any words of mine could have persuaded the city to cuddle up to Mr. Seeger, who isn't particularly cuddly. But I wish I'd found ways to remind New Yorkers that his breathtakingly pure cooking was there to be enjoyed while that was still true. Which brings us, by a circuitous and not particularly well-paved route, to Anthony Mangieri of Una Pizza Napoletana . Using naturally leavened dough and a short shopping list of ingredients, Mr. Mangieri makes what is unmistakably the finest sit-down pizza in the five boroughs. (I doubt he has any rivals in the stand-up joints, either, but slice pizza is a different game.) Two years ago, I posited that Razza, a pizzeria in Jersey City, made \"the best pizza in New York.\" I don't regret writing that, but I would like to point out that Mr. Mangieri was not cooking in the city at the time and that Razza's chef, Dan Richer, has said that he began taking pizza seriously only after he met Mr. Mangieri. Una Pizza Napoletana saw a rush of curious pie-eaters after it opened on Orchard Street a little more than a year ago. But the last few times I've gone, there were too many unclaimed chairs and bar stools. When Anthony Mangieri is making pizza, the right number of empty seats is zero, as any New Yorker who waited in line at the old Una Pizza Napoletana, in the East Village from 2004 to 2009, could tell you. Press interest in the new place has died down, too. So when I heard a rumor that Mr. Mangieri was thinking of leaving the city and taking his pizza with him, I was unnerved, to put it mildly. Asked about it, he told me he was considering it but hadn't made up his mind. Mr. Mangieri has left New York before, and I didn't like it then, either. This time, I wasn't going to let him get away without a fight. It is true that my review of Una Pizza Napoletana last year was decidedly mixed. It is also true, though, that almost every criticism I made has been addressed. It has gone from one of the most confounding pizzerias in the city to one of the most enjoyable. The problem with Una Pizza a year ago was that it was trying to be two things at once. It was, of course, a Neapolitan pizzeria, serving classic, unadorned pies baked for about two minutes inside a wood-burning oven shaped like an igloo. But it was also a cutting-edge Lower East Side experiment. At the instigation of Mr. Mangieri's partners, the chefs Fabian von Hauske Valtierra and Jeremiah Stone, the kitchen brought forth appetizers that had rarely if ever been asked to live under one roof with a pizza. There was a jellylike mass of raw lobster inside a ring of chickpeas, and a rust-colored puddle of 'nduja under raw turnips and nasturtium leaves. The wine list was virtually a treatise on natural wines, a long document full of the names of eccentric producers and obscure European villages. In another restaurant, all this would have been the departure point for some adventurous evenings. But in a pizzeria it led to some peculiar pairings, made the check a bit higher than you wanted and resulted in long waits before you were finally allowed to eat the delicious pizza you'd come for. Over the past year, Mr. von Hauske and Mr. Stone have stepped aside, letting Mr. Mangieri call the shots. The wines on offer now number about 15. They are still a likably eccentric lot, but picking one doesn't feel like studying for a master sommelier exam. The appetizers are simpler and less expensive: a plate of marinated white anchovies, a dish of warm Italian olives or a bowl of Little Gem lettuce with sunflower seeds in a Caesarish dressing. I do miss the tiramis\u00f9 from the opening menu, but the new cannoli filled with ricotta -- a blend of domestic cow's milk and Italian sheep's milk -- are nearly as good. It's common for a new restaurant to trim its sails, but this one has trimmed its prices, too. In the beginning the five regular pizzas were all $25; now they range from $19 to $25, and the two extra-complicated Friday and Saturday pizzas are priced at $26. I liked Mr. Mangieri's pies in the East Village, I liked them more when he came back to town, and it's possible, just possible, that they've improved over the past year. He is, like Mr. Seeger, a minimalist. He lets you notice each ingredient: the little ping of sourness in the Campanian buffalo mozzarella, for instance. Or the unruly, windswept-hillside aroma of dried Sicilian oregano. The precise crunch of each unrefined Trapani sea-salt crystal waiting to dissolve. The crust is so tender it barely fights fork, knife or teeth. Some diners will wish it put up more crackly resistance. You inhale it at least as much as you eat it. When you have finished, some of the most popular pizzas in town will seem tough, leathery, overworked. Even if this is not the style you crave, you'll know that it's the work of a baker who has spent years listening to the dough. There is a place for people who are as obsessed with pizza as Mr. Mangieri, and the place is New York City.

By the time people reach Kawi they tend to look rattled; New Yorkers who will easily weave their way around broken sidewalks, potholes, garbage piles and al fresco rat conventions come undone when faced with the interior of a shopping mall. Kawi, now two months old, can be disorienting in its own way, but at least you can have a seat and a drink while you get your bearings. Space there is used, or not used, the way it is in Las Vegas. There's a very long bar behind a line of black, geometric bar stools receding toward the vanishing point; low lounge tables; taller, square wood tables; round wood tables; black-leather booths; red-leather booths; red-leather banquettes; and a row of chairs facing a kitchen counter. Between all this furniture are aisles wide enough for a Zamboni. All those seats have backs, too. Kawi is loaded with the comforts and accommodations that critics, including me, were begging Mr. Chang to pay more attention to as recently as the opening of Nishi three years ago. Has anybody complained before that a David Chang restaurant was too quiet? They're saying it about Kawi. If there is anybody left who still thinks of Mr. Chang as a downtown punk, Kawi will clear up that misconception. The early Momofuku restaurants were skateboards; Kawi is a minivan with sliding doors, armrests, cupholders and Don Henley on the stereo. The ride may not be as fast, but it's a lot smoother. Kawi is also the first Momofuku restaurant in New York to address Korean cuisine head on and at length. Majordomo , which opened in Los Angeles last year, is at least half Korean, but the menu is loaded up with other stuff, a lot of which is big and showy and seemingly designed to dazzle the high rollers. It can be hard to remember you're eating galbi-jjim after a server buries it beneath a tableside avalanche of shaved raclette. Eunjo Park, Kawi's executive chef, avoids this type of distraction. This is lucky, because she makes food that you want to concentrate on. Before joining the Momofuku stable, she worked in the formal and highly fastidious kitchens of Daniel , Le Bec-Fin and Per Se . She later returned to South Korea, where she had lived until she was 12, for advanced studies at the Seoul restaurant Gaon and at the kitchen of the Chunjinam hermitage, presided over by Jeong Kwan , certainly the most celebrated cooking Zen nun in her country. A strong interest in tradition marks Ms. Park's food at Kawi. Her dishes are set apart from versions you may have had before by the exactitude of the technique and the quality of the ingredients. One section of her menu is turned over to kimbap, those wide, nori-wrapped sushi rolls often spotted at salad bars, languishing under plastic wrap. Most kimbap is designed to be portable, filling and inexpensive. Ms. Park's kimbap, on the other hand, is built for pleasure. She has a pickled vegetable kimbap on the lunch menu that is truly exciting; you are meant to dip it in a dark liquid that tastes a bit like soy sauce but is made with beets. The dinner menu brings kimbap filled with chives, pickled daikon, citrus jelly and a buttery pink vein of foie gras terrine. Has this really never been done before, you wonder as you eat it, and if not, why not? Among the other gussied-up raw fish that you expect in Momofukuland, like a refreshing if somewhat staid madai tartare, are some dime-size clams in chile sauce and an elegant, inspired interpretation of gejang. Blue crab legs and claw are cracked and given a three-day soak in soy sauce, among other things, which gives them an impressive amount of flavor. Then, in case you haven't noticed that you're dealing with a real chef, Ms. Park stirs the crab's roe with creamy rice and spoons this Korean risotto into the open belly of the shell. At moments like this, or in the hwedupbap filled with raw fish as strikingly good as any you'll find in a $200 omakase, or in the doenjang jjigae, a potful of braised fermented bean paste with pork belly that appears on the menu as \"yesterday's stinky soybean stew\" and manages to be homespun and polished at the same time, it's possible to see Kawi as Ms. Park's response to Atomix . It's as if she had looked at Junghyun Park's dazzlingly complex compositions at his year-old modern Korean restaurant and decided that she could cook in a style that was every bit as modern and painstaking, but that instead of turning traditional dishes into tasting-menu food she would keep the old forms and innovate inside them. With her tidy, refined, French-influenced neo-traditionalism, Ms. Park could become something like the Alain Ducasse of Korean cooking. It's not obvious, though, that Kawi needs an Alain Ducasse. Certain appetizers seem to belong on another planet, more beautiful and gentle than ours, such as the soft tofu with soy syrup that, sitting under a shattering thin crust of caramelized sugar, is like a savory cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e by way of Seoul. And there are others, such as the sticks of fried cod that a server pointlessly snips in half with scissors and then spritzes with atomized yuzu juice, that are right at home at Hudson Yards. The presentation seemed forced. That could also describe the boiled chicken dish, one of the menu's showiest items and, at $64, one of its most expensive. The whole bird is steamed, then the breast is sliced and served plain while the dark meat is fried and coated with spices. Neither is spectacular on its own, and the combination is bizarre. More successful versions of elaborate, oversize, multicomponent dishes are proven moneymakers elsewhere in the Momofuku republic. But arm-waving platters like that seem out of place at Kawi, which is the least Momofukian of the Momofukus. The most uncharacteristic thing of all is that the dining room has never been operating at anything close to capacity, at least when I've been there. Maybe tables are being kept off the reservation books to give the cooks time to learn where the spice cabinet is. Or maybe the fans who are so devoted to Mr. Chang's downtown spots are still trying to figure out the escalators.

The condoms became the subject of a series of advertisements on which the production company worked; in one of them, called \"Acts of Love,\" dancers in London re-enact, with surprising grace and dignity, the mating rituals of blue-footed boobies, fiddler crabs and other animals. Well, kids, when two companies like each other very much, sometimes they decide to create a new company together. That is what happened with the production firm and the prophylactics people when, for reasons that are perhaps best not to question, they hit upon the idea of expanding their product line from condoms into noodles. The restaurant lies across Union Avenue from Kellogg's Diner. Its door is marked during business hours by the fluttering white noren curtains. It is the second Hanon location. The first is about 6,700 miles away, in the city of Kamakura, which lies south of Tokyo and is known for soba, not udon. This gave Hanon the advantage of not competing against any of Japan's established udon styles, leaving its chef, Takahiro Yanagisawa, free to come up with his own. Mr. Yanagisawa, who had spent 25 years making sushi before turning to noodles, focused his innovative urges on the dough. He began by adding wheat germ and bran to the white flour that in udon is typically used alone. The resulting noodle is called zenryufun or whole wheat. The bran and germ are Mr. Yanagisawa's attempts to make a more healthful udon, but they also add flavor, a mottled color and a slightly rough texture that holds on to the dashi-based broth. This dough is also made into a green noodle, called sasauchi, by mixing in powdered barley shoots and leaves of kuma-zasa, a bamboo variety that pandas dote on . To the human palate, or at least this human's palate, sasa tastes something like green tea. Both the speckled zenryufun and the green sasauchi are flat noodles, resembling fettuccine that has been working out. Avoiding extremes, they are moderately chewy and reasonably springy. Either flavor, or both, can be ordered cold and spread on a bamboo mat for dunking into a sauce, either a peanut-buttery sesame sauce or the traditional dashi-based dipping sauce. For larger or more curious appetites, these dipping noodles, called seiro udon, can be dangled into a hot duck soup in which a few hunks of well-boiled duck meat swim. The cold noodles can also be accessorized with whipped mountain yam or tempura or both. If you had stumbled into Hanon under the impression that it was another generic Williamsburg noodle mill, the tempura would set you straight. The crust is engineered for udon, thick and substantial enough that it will not dissolve and float away in the soup, yet somehow not oily or clunky. The tempura is served with sea salt, which will not only season the fried blowfish tails, shrimp, mushroom and vegetables, but will also do very good things to any noodles it happens to meet. With the hot soups, there is no choice of noodles. All are made with zenryufun. The plain broth, a dashi augmented by white soy sauce, is not so salty or concentrated that I didn't want to drink it all. It also performs well made into a thick-but-not-sludgy curry soup with thin pink slices of washugyu beef; a shaggy, mossy, salty-sour mass of ume and kombu; and a soup of shaved beef and onions that tastes like a deeper, stronger version of French dip jus and is blitzed by a little grated yuzu peel at the end. A few near-relatives of udon make it to the menu as well. The beef-and-onion combination can also be had over rice. Creamy, slightly spicy cod roe is tossed with zenryufun for an excellent mentaiko pasta that, for once, relies on the roe rather than Kewpie mayonnaise to make an impression. The eventual plan is to sell both colors of noodle to grocery stores and other restaurants -- to become, in essence, the Sun Noodle of the udonisphere. This would be a gain for New York, but for the moment Hanon's udon is found only at Hanon, where the noodles are made fresh each day. Any plan for world domination is not hinted at on the restaurant's Facebook page , which seems to be its home base online, though nobody has bothered to post a menu there yet. Nor does the dining room suggest a budding global chain. Atmospheric and presumably expensive prints by the photographers Takashi Homma and Nobuyoshi Araki hang over the tables, and a signed Cy Twombly lithograph has been placed by the door to the backyard. The music -- torch songs, jazz piano -- seems to be coming from a radio tuned to another decade. A lot of this cocktail music will make more sense once the liquor license comes through. Hanon is getting set to offer sake, shochu and wines chosen by Jorge Riera, who built the list at Frenchette and has turned countless New Yorkers on to the fizzy, fuzzy and furry delights of natural wines. The idea of Hanon is not to slurp and slide out, but to stay for a meal: a chilled French red with the fried chicken and Japanese omelet, maybe, and something a bit brawnier with curry soup. Dessert could be a tofu blancmange, smooth and white and somewhat sweet, but there is more satisfaction in the grainy, earthy bricks of red bean paste. The meal might end with tea, to which the restaurant takes the same unhurried approach it applies to everything else. The iced oolong is slowly cold-brewed; a bamboo whisk and ceramic chawan are kept on the dining counter for painstakingly whipping up bowls of matcha; an appliance imported from Taiwan will transform freshly steeped hojicha and ice into a tan froth, a process that takes about five minutes. This foam tea is dairy-free, unlike Taiwan's infamous cheese tea. It is served in a wine glass, and the experience of drinking it is similar to tackling a pint of Guinness before the head has settled down.

The restaurant had changed significantly since the last time it had been evaluated by a Times critic: Sam Sifton promoted it from three stars to four in 2010, when Mark Ladner was the executive chef and Brooks Headley was running the pastry kitchen. First, Mr. Headley had quit this stately, expensive Italian restaurant in Chelsea so he could sell fast, cheap vegetarian burgers . Next, Del Posto had spent about $1 million on crystal candle vases, white leather chairs and other luxurious fittings that made it even more stately and expensive. Finally, Mr. Ladner had left to sell fast, cheap pasta. A fresh review was clearly in order. Before I could write it, though, a number of women who had worked for Mario Batali, one of the owners, started talking about the sexual harassment and abuse that they say he had doled out. Suddenly there seemed to be more important questions than whether the braised-rabbit agnolotti were cooked al dente. Negotiations took more than a year, but Mr. Batali no longer profits from Del Posto, having sold his stake in March to a group led by his former partner, Joe Bastianich . Employees have said that Mr. Bastianich himself helped, at a minimum, to build the sexist and disrespectful environment in which Mr. Batali operated. Mr. Bastianich has apologized, saying that he had heard Mr. Batali speak inappropriately to employees, and that he should have done more to stop the sexual harassment. Some diners will stay away, feeling that Mr. Bastianich has not sufficiently atoned. I understand this, but I am also interested in the way employees may be treated at the restaurant now and in the future. Here, there is reason to hope. Among other human-resources reforms, employees can now report complaints about owners or corporate officers to an independent investigative firm with the power to refer cases to outside counsel. As part of the restructuring, Melissa Rodriguez, who has been the executive chef of Del Posto since 2017, was made a partner in the restaurant, along with Jeff Katz, now the managing partner. A new pastry chef, Georgia Wodder, was appointed last spring. Del Posto is, with the possible exception of Aquavit , the grandest and most expensive restaurant in New York where women are in charge of everything you eat, starting with the miniature saffron waffle rolled like a cannoli and stuffed at one tiny end with taleggio and at the other with fennel pesto, and ending with the prosecco marshmallow tucked into the wooden drawer of a custom-made cheese grater. The cooking is more subdued now. The kitchen is not seen as a beacon of innovation the way it used to be, perhaps because Ms. Rodriguez is less interested than Mr. Ladner was in feats of technical derring-do like 100-layer lasagnas . She gets her effects by following old Italian templates and putting them together so elegantly that they seem to light up from inside. There's an honesty to her approach -- she doesn't try to shoot out all the lights by supercharging dishes with fat -- but it's not the kind of peasant simplicity people usually mean when they talk about honesty in Italian food. It's a sophisticated honesty. You know chicken cacciatore, of course. Ms. Rodriguez's version is made from guinea hen breast, roasted until the skin crackles like parchment. What would be the body of the stew is now a sauce; the tomato, celery and onion in it come through distinctly. Occupying a little sidecar is a pressed puck of braised leg meat under a single, Roman-style gnocco, a small featherbed of semolina held together by eggs, milk and cheese. One side has been broiled so hard it is nearly burned, which seems like a mistake at first, but turns out to supply the bit of campfire that this hunter's stew needs. It has to be far more complicated to prepare than the cacciatore at your neighborhood Italian restaurant, but it seems simpler, pared to essentials, and wonderful in every bite. I've never seen anyone wring as much flavor out of salsify as Ms. Rodriguez does. Sliced transparently thin and fried, it makes crunchy brown chips about half the size of an M&M. These decorate the top of a grilled-salsify pudding that has the refreshing bittersweetness of one of those plant-based Italian aperitifs. If it were not garnished with streaky leaves of radicchio, it could pass for a dessert. The menu structure has not changed, although the prices have. Everything can be had \u00e0 la carte. Lunch is still a relative bargain, though the price has shimmied up to $59 for three courses. For a blowout $194 dinner, the Captain's Menu yields eight courses or so. Most people, however, go with the $164, five-course Menu del Posto. The primary argument in favor of this strategy is, to me, an overwhelming one: Two of those five courses are pasta. Del Posto's pastas are worth doubling up on. They can come in many forms. Delicate conical tortellini have hidden pockets of nettles and spring peas; they are half-submerged in a light spring-vegetable brodo in which Parmigiano-Reggiano rinds once bobbed like bay leaves. This is the spring minestrone. A single, plate-spanning raviolo, called a fazzoletto, is topped with poached mussels and filled with spinach and fresh herbs -- not a lawnmower-mulch of greenery but a layer of emulsion as thin and velvety as the dough that envelops it. The sauce of mussel juices, white wine, butter and saffron makes this the only convincing mussel pasta I've ever had. The range of flavors Ms. Wodder commands in her pastry kitchen seems unnecessarily limited to me, although I may be unfairly comparing her desserts with Mr. Headley's, which roamed all over the place. Individually, her desserts are soothing, often showcasing the comforts of dairy. More emphasis, some extra acidity or bitterness, might have brought an assemblage of quince paste, brown-butter gelato and griddled brioche into relief. But I appreciated the way winter squash in the batter modified the sweetness of an olive oil-orange cake, and I enjoyed the moody sulkiness that amaro lent to a citrus salad served with the cake. Del Posto has in recent years picked up a reputation as a restaurant for one-percenters. It rarely gives that impression once you are inside, where servers solemnly accommodate just about anyone. There is a vegan menu at Del Posto. A vegetarian meal can be put together easily, and almost everything can be made without gluten, including the pasta. Yes, the stockpile of Champagnes includes some lock-and-key stuff, and should you require a Barolo costing between $2,000 and $4,000, one will quickly be added to your bill. But among the 3,100 or so Italian labels superintended by Evan Clagnaz, the wine director, are more marked from $60 to $75 than I can count. Piemonte is a place to hunt, and Friuli, and the Valle d'Aosta, for starters. Though the restaurant is not exclusively for rich people, it is explicitly for occasions. Once, when a reservationist called to confirm and asked whether I was celebrating anything special, I said no, and was gently laughed at: \"Just a normal Tuesday night at Del Posto?\" There is little danger that anyone will mistake a night at Del Posto for normal. If nothing else, the napkins and towels are a tip-off. First, there is a small hot linen napkin scented with tomato-vine oil, to wipe the dust of the outside world from your hands. Then a large white linen napkin, followed just before dessert by a small yellow one. It is given to you, and the white one is taken away, by a server using a large fork and spoon as tongs. When you go to the restrooms, you may encounter an attendant who has just restocked the hand towels from a large basket she carries on one arm, like Heidi out gathering wildflowers for Grandfather. There are little ceremonies like this from start to finish; I don't know of any other restaurant that performs quite so many tasks whose only real purpose is to draw attention to themselves. And these things are rarely done with a smile; employees seem to have been directed to keep a respectful, formal distance as they carry out your requests and perform other services you'd never think of requesting. They rarely seem comfortable. Their solemnity is underlined by the sepulchral lighting at night, so gloomy it makes the crypt of Grant's tomb look like a tiki bar. A good deal of the service is the attentive, helpful kind that you really want, but the rest of it seems designed only to give customers the sensation of temporary power over other people. Some people may love this, but it reflects a serious lack of imagination when you think about the ways the service at Blue Hill at Stone Barns or Noma , for instance, is integrated into the experience. Is it stretching a point to ask if enshrining subservience, as Del Posto does, reflects the same twisted sense of priorities that allowed Mr. Batali to get away with abusing his own power for so long? (And is it a coincidence that far more men than women seem to work in the dining room, particularly in the upper ranks?) Now that Ms. Rodriguez owns a piece of the restaurant, perhaps she can lead a reconsideration of priorities in the front of the house, and find a tone that more closely matches her philosophy in the back. She shouldn't have to clean up the messes men made. But having worked her way to the top of a restaurant that has always aspired to provide luxury, she has a chance to decide what, in New York in 2019, that word might mean.

At least it has escaped now. For the past decade or so, Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana , the 93-year-old establishment said to have invented the regional delicacy, has been exporting it to its other branches in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. There is also a small cult of the clam pie among New York pizzaioli. It has become a fixture at Lombardi's and some Staten Island pizzerias, as well as inspiring lovingly considered tributes at Pasquale Jones , Motorino and the Clam . I have eaten most of them, and happily, but on a recent trip to Connecticut I was led to what I now realize is the clam pie against which all others should be measured. It is baked at Zuppardi's Apizza in the city of West Haven. Unlike the coal ovens used to fire New Haven's more famous \"abeetz,\" to use the Connecticut-Neapolitan dialect, the ovens at Zuppardi's are fired by gas. As a result, Zuppardi's pies are not nearly as blackened as the ones from Pepe's, but the crust still bulges with air pockets and emerges with a pleasingly dry, thin and crackery crunch. [ Learn how to make pizza at home with this guide from NYT Cooking. ] Zuppardi's tops its clam pizza (market price, typically $32.45 for a medium pie) with fresh garlic, olive oil, dried oregano, cracked red pepper and littlenecks. Smaller clams may be opaque when they reach the table. Larger specimens will be just warmed through. All will taste as if they had just been shucked, as in fact they were. Opening clams to order means that the clam pizza takes longer than Zuppardi's other specialties, like the plain pie (tomato sauce, grated cheese, no mozzarella), itself worth a detour from Interstate 95, which rumbles by about a cherrystone's throw away.

These flattened cod fritters are the size of pie plates in Puerto Rico, while in Queens they are roughly the diameter of a coffee can. Dimensions aside, they give off all the right signals. They are the color of a corn muffin, with green specks of chopped cilantro under the surface that let you know they are not made from Goya's mix. They don't leave your fingertips entirely free of grease, but they come close. They have an exterior crunch that surrenders quickly to the firm, chewy interior of mashed salt cod; the texture is less fried dough than fish taffy. You could start to build a business around bacalaitos like these. That, in fact, has been Derick L\u00f3pez's plan for some time now. Mr. L\u00f3pez, who was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the South Bronx, is the Freakin Rican's chef and, with his husband, Victor Vargas, its owner. About four years ago, armed with picnic coolers and a couple of folding tables, the two men began selling a short menu of Puerto Rican staples at the street fairs that seem to infiltrate a different New York thoroughfare each weekend. As they promoted the Freakin Rican catering operation, the Freakin Rican product line, the Freakin Rican Facebook page and the Freakin Rican YouTube channel, they saved their earnings so they could found the Freakin Rican restaurant. After a false start in another part of Queens, it opened a short distance from the Museum of the Moving Image one year ago this month. The dining room has 19 seats. The banana-plant wallpaper on the left wall is reflected in the mirrors on the right. In between are some metal chickens and bright-green figurines of coqu\u00eds, the little frogs that chirp from every Puerto Rican tree. Diners sip on tropical-fruit shakes or bottles of Kola Champagne, Coco Rico and Malta India, the Harry, Ron and Hermione of Puerto Rican soft drinks. H\u00e9ctor Lavoe may be playing over the speakers, or V\u00edctor Manuelle, not so loudly that they can't be drowned out by the sounds of a small number of employees singing \"Happy Birthday\" while wielding a tambourine and a pair of maracas. If you have spent any time at all on the trail of chicharrones, mofongo, sancocho and other wonders of the Puerto Rican kitchen, you know that Astoria is not a primary hunting ground for any of them. You also know, though, that blinking-light cuchifritos parlors and family-run cocina criolla luncheonettes have been disappearing from the Bronx, East Harlem and the Lower East Side over the past few decades, along with many of their customers. The Puerto Rican population in New York peaked around 1990, when residents of the old barrios began to flow to the suburbs in large numbers, according to Laird W. Bergad , the director of the Center for Latin American, Caribbean and Latino Studies at City University of New York Graduate Center. Beacons of Puerto Rican cuisine still survive; Casa Adela, for instance, is still busily dispensing chickens from its venerable lemon-yellow rotisserie on Avenue C, despite the death last year of its founder, Adela Fargas. But there are not so many of these places left that we can take an unlimited supply of tostones and mojo de ajo for granted, either. The Freakin Rican developed its act on the street-fair circuit, but it applied the same tactics that succeed at Smorgasburg and similar urban foraging grounds, where the ideal dish can be held in one hand, gets immediate attention, costs under $10 and can serve as a plank in a branding platform. This may explain why appetizers are the strong suit on the Freakin Rican menu. The sorullitos, Puerto Rico's answer to hush puppies, are an exception; they are dense and dry, as if the cornmeal hadn't absorbed enough water. Mr. L\u00f3pez's alcapurrias, though, are very good, even if the picadillo that runs down the middle of a tube of mashed fried plantains like the graphite in a pencil could be seasoned a little more forcefully. And his pasteles are exceptional. Pasteles are structured like tamales. Where the masa would be, Mr. L\u00f3pez makes a sweet, enjoyably gummy mash of green plantains, taro root and kabocha squash. The filling is a soft, rich vein of stewed pork shoulder with ham, bacon, red peppers and green olives. Rolled up in a banana leaf, these pasteles probably deserve their own float in the Puerto Rican Day Parade. Mr. L\u00f3pez fries chicken in two styles. One, the chicharrones de pollo, is traditional. The other, the Freakin Crispy Wings, is not. Each has its rewards. The chicharrones, hacked into three-bite hunks, taste of cider vinegar and garlic powder and have a smooth, achiote-tinted buttermilk crust that breaks open with a pleasing crackle. The Freakin Crispy Wings are spicier, and the shell is thicker and more deeply crevassed. These wings may owe more to Atlanta than to Mayag\u00fcez, although you can get them with a guava barbecue sauce that's reasonably tropical. Leave behind these appetizers, the core of the street-fair business, and the menu can start to appear unsteady. At dinner, the main courses tend to be fairly plain fried or grilled meat. Grilled pork chops splashed with mojo can be dry and dull, and the grilled chicken breasts are not much more interesting. Baked pork ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce are tender enough, but they aren't very persuasive. On several nights, I found myself gazing longingly at the lunch specials on the back of the menu, wondering why I couldn't have a brick of pastel\u00f3n for dinner. (I came back for it one Thursday afternoon, and was glad I did.) Until more long-cooked dishes like it appear at dinnertime, consider a bowl of sancocho. Listed as \"vegetable root soup\" for $7, it doesn't sound like much of a meal. But it is a grab bag of a stew with at least two kinds of meat, great hunks of taro and yuca, a couple of inches of corn on the cob and a magical squash broth that has the consistency of heavy cream and the color of very ripe mango. In the unlikely event that you finish it and the bowl of rice that comes with it and then cry out for more, the Freakin Rican has just the thing for you: mofongo. A dome of mashed plantains possessed by garlic, the mofongo is cooked to order to keep the crunchy bits crunchy and the whole thing from getting boggy. You can have it with chicharrones or sliced roast pork, which leaves behind a happy impression of garlic, oregano and salt. If you have come for a birthday, a candle stuck in the meringue icing of a tres leches cake is probably in your future. If not, flan and espresso will do, and a bag of pasteles for tomorrow.

Again the flavors come from Asia and the methods, generally, from France. Again the far-off tropics are evoked through the play of indirect, dappled light, as if filtered through jungle foliage or a carved wooden screen. Again the presiding culinary sensibility belongs to a Vongerichten. Jean-Georges Vongerichten put together Spice Market in 2004, a confection of teak, silk, vodka, peanut sauce and high heels that brought the Asian Party Temple restaurant genre to its apotheosis. All the earlier examples suddenly seemed fumbling and unsophisticated, and with the possible exception of the Spice Market spinoffs in Qatar and Mexico, the ones that would follow seemed increasingly mindless and out of touch. Interior design that rummages through the musty old trunks of Orientalism doesn't look as alluring as it did 15 years ago, and cooking that filters Asian flavors through a Western sensibility isn't automatically met with gales of excitement. Wayan, where Mr. Vongerichten's son, C\u00e9dric, is the chef, avoids both traps, I think. The restaurant is a tribute to Indonesia, the home of his wife and business partner, Ochi Vongerichten, and the site of two restaurants that he opened recently. (He is also the chef of Perry St. in Manhattan, which his father owns.) The scale is more personal and the cultural references are more specific at Wayan than at Spice Market and its kind. The menu is far from encyclopedic, but it is clear that Indonesia's cuisine has been given more than the quick glance that informs a lot of Asian fusion. Ms. Vongerichten works in the dining room, stopping by tables to offer explanations of the menu and how the cooking differs from that at some other Indonesian restaurants in New York, which she cheerfully calls \"more authentic.\" More than any other factor, she helps keep Wayan from turning into a junior version of one of her father-in-law's restaurants -- Young Vongerichtenstein. Servers will tell you to start with a stick or two of satay. You can, although the skewers are cooked on a flattop instead of a grill, and inconsistency is an issue. The pork skewers that are so appealingly juicy and savory with sweet soy one week can be scorched and bitter the next time you see them, and just ordinary the following week. (The pickled watermelon radishes on the side, though, are always terrific; they're brined with lime leaf.) The peanut sauce on chicken satay may hum with red curry and chiles, or may present as a sweet, inert blob. A more promising opening move, and one that will help place C\u00e9dric and Ochi Vongerichten's mental map of Indonesia in perspective, would be the Jimbaran-style clams. This is not a dish that is likely to have been stirred by generations of sainted grandmothers since the dawn of time. It is, in fact, a specialty of the seafood vendors who sprang up on a stretch of Balinese beach where resorts first began to appear sometime around the birth of Taylor Swift. Littlenecks, flavored with soy sauce and garlic paste, are grilled under flakes of coconut, which form the golden crust that would be provided by bread crumbs if these were clams oreganata. A slice of pickled red chile sits on each one, waiting. If you were on vacation, you would order tray after tray of these. Here on Spring Street, other things will keep you distracted. In the hearts-of-palm salad, sweet and sour are carefully pitted against each other by means of a mango vinaigrette, a lime-and-fish-sauce dressing and a neon coat of passion-fruit pulp. The crab cake is, despite its sweet chile sauce, about as Indonesian as Betty White, but it is fresh and fluffy and not worth arguing about. Wayan's rendition of the street snack bakwan jagung is a golden agglomeration of corn kernels and shallots fried into a flat, crunchy disc. There had better be nasi goreng at any restaurant that is even playing at being Indonesian. There is, the rice fried just until it crackles a bit between your teeth. It has a gentle but genuine spice undercurrent that would be welcome in more of the cooking. Of course there is a gado gado, and this being 2019, of course the main ingredient is avocado; the hard-cooked eggs belong to quail. This time the peanut dressing isn't cloying or clumpy. As the plates get larger, few dishes really come forward as the kind of knockout that everybody will talk about later. The closest contender must be the lobster and basil with wavy noodles in a sauce containing, among other things, sweet soy and melted butter -- a combination that the senior Mr. Vongerichten has used so successfully that it may be his son's inheritance. Should the calamansi vinaigrette poured over the steamed black sea bass be more sour and spicy? Probably. But if there are few stars on the table, the contrast of flavors, colors, textures and techniques makes the meal into a memorable ensemble piece. The drumsticks in yellow chicken are crunchy, and the thighs are tender; both are mellow with a yellow curry seasoned by lemongrass and ginger. The tomato-chile sambal pressed into the surface of cod \"bilindango\" is potent enough to carry over to the spears of asparagus and fiddlehead ferns sprawled alongside. All of this looks very come-hither in the dining room, where the Rockwell Group has abandoned stadium-size props, building atmospheric effects instead out of contrasting textures and light values and the movement of shadows. This is the visual language of expensive tropical resorts, and Wayan seems to give people the feeling they're on vacation. It is not necessarily a loud restaurant, but New Yorkers are a loud people, and around 10 the noise can start to press down. It is a good time to call for dessert. The purple-yam ice cream with banana cake and caramelized bananas is good if sundaes are your thing. The pandan custard under passion-fruit pulp gets a lot of mileage from just a few flavors. But the one that sounds too boring to bother with (\"assorted exotic fruit?\") is worth a second look. Lychee, mango, pineapple and dragon fruit may not be particularly exotic, but a dip or a dunk into a dark, spicy syrup of tamarind and palm sugar will wake them right up.

And they did, in a sense. Soon Mr. Haraguchi had established his own free-standing establishment, Yuji Ramen in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where he serves that bacon-and-egg mazemen along with his possibly visionary \"tunakotsu\" ramen. In 2014, when Ivan Orkin came to New York , he brought along his own mazemen recipes. Over the next few years mazemen turned up in other restaurants, too, but all of them remained better known for soup ramen, and sold more of it. It began to look as if mazemen would never be more than a sideshow act, the one-armed ax-catcher of the ramen circus. Then at the start of the year, the chef Shigetoshi Nakamura, who operates an intimate ramen shop on the Lower East Side, opened an annex next door that is dedicated to mazemen. All the seating at this new place, Niche , is at a dozen or so stools arranged around one long, narrow table. When the dining room is fully occupied, the only way to get from one end to the other is to walk sideways while holding your breath and picking up all the coats that you are going to knock off their wall pegs as you go. Not that there is much reason to roam around. Orders are taken from and delivered to the table, and there is no public restroom on the premises. As is the case next door at Nakamura, seats by the window offer a close-up view of the stone walls that support the last few yards of the Williamsburg Bridge before it empties onto Delancey Street. Before he came to New York, Mr. Nakamura was already well known in Tokyo, where he proved to have a theatrical streak. Before filling a bowl with noodles, he would yank them from the boiling water with his left hand and then hold them high in the air for a few seconds, letting them drain while standing completely motionless. Suddenly he would drop his arm and the basket would plunge toward the water again, before stopping just in time and getting one quick, emphatic shake. When Mr. Nakamura was immortalized as one of four \"ramen gods\" in a set of Hello Kitty notepads and phone straps, Kitty was posed with her left paw raised high in emulation of the Nakamura Shake. If Mr. Nakamura has been practicing his choreography on the spaghetti-like, crinkly noodles at Niche, I haven't seen it yet. The Nakamura Shake seems designed to extract cooking water as quickly as possible before the noodles cool, and temperature is not especially critical in mazemen. The idea of noodle soup without the soup has been on the loose in Japan for decades. Broth is the most expensive and labor-intensive part of a bowl of ramen; in the 1950s, a Tokyo noodle shop, in the pitiless logic of the restaurant business, began omitting the broth when ladling out noodles at staff meals, or so the story goes. This \"abura soba\" -- oil noodle, because it was moistened with lard along with the seasoning sauce called tare -- wasn't half bad, so it went on the menu at a discounted price. As an even cheaper version of an already cheap and filling meal, abura soba was quickly embraced, especially by students. As food ideas tend to do in Japan, it evolved rapidly. Today, abura soba tends to refer to dry soups that have more or less the same toppings you'd find in a bowl of normal ramen, while mazemen generally has toppings that are rarely seen in soup and often would not respond well to being submerged in hot liquid. There is Italian-style mazemen, with anchovies, salami, olives and tomatoes. Some mazemen shops specialize in fried beef cutlets. At a Tokyo restaurant called Beefst , the centerpiece of each bowl is sliced roast beef, served rare. Mr. Nakamura has an answer to that: steak mazemen. The steak is rib-eye, in cubes that have been browned with a kitchen torch. When you stir them with the noodles and a smooth, creamy spoonful of something the menu simply calls \"pork sauce,\" their juices and flecks of char flavor the whole bowl. Plain spinach and fermented bamboo, meanwhile, keep the total effect from being queasy-making. Novel, straightforward, refined, unruly and impure of heart, steak mazemen has the makings of a classic New York dish. So does the duck, a common special. A sliced breast of moulard duck cooked to a deep violet-pink, it is served with a bright, focused sauce built on soy and enough warm duck juices to lubricate the whole-wheat noodles. It is not an austere dish by any means, but it is balanced and restrained. The same cannot be said for another special that is always offered on the same nights: a bowl of liquefied foie gras topped with pistachios and truffle oil. It is not clear what will happen to anyone who tries to eat this with a spoon, but the prognosis does not seem good. Instead, everybody orders it with the duck mazemen and dips the noodles into the foie gras, after which conscious thought tends to stop for a minute or two. When cerebral activity resumes, you might wonder why the sauce doesn't come with its own noodles. No other mazemen is such a joy ride, but the vaguely Italian one with tomatoes, mushrooms, kombu and an angry red soak of chile oil is not the kind of thing you want to turn your back on. Even the tribute to Russ & Daughters , where the noodles are coated with spicy cod roe and the topping is sliced smoked salmon, can sneak up on you. Niche is one of the few ramen-yas in town where the appetizers are worth noticing. Sea urchin perched on tiny corners of toast is a strange and awkward affair, but the sardines on toast, dressed with chile flakes, are very good, as are the raw scallops with yuzu juice and the avocado salad showered with tempura flakes. Should fries be an appetizer? Maybe not, particularly Niche's \"umami kombu fries,\" which have been sprinkled with powdered shio kombu until they are almost subliminally green. Apart from the color, they look like the fries at McDonald's. The difference is that the shio kombu makes them almost diabolically hard to stop eating.

Her third restaurant, Haenyeo was about three months old and already filled with people who looked as if they'd been going there for years. It sits on a prime corner lot, on a stretch of Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that is rich in local minichains serving banh mi, burritos, lobster rolls and so on, to take out or eat in. Intimidating restaurants don't tend to prosper here. Very few people inside Haenyeo look the least bit intimidated as they lift grilled oysters by the shell to pour the dregs of hot seaweed butter over toast; or carve wedges of zucchini-scallion pancakes fried to a dark and satisfyingly rich brown; or stir mushrooms, squid, bean sprouts, steamed spinach and cabbage kimchi with a just-cracked egg into a bibimbap whose bottom layer of rice is golden and crunchy where it meets the hot stone bowl. The customers at Haenyeo seem to have an easy familiarity with Korean food. Some of them, at least, can probably thank Ms. Kwak for that. In 1992, when she began serving the cuisine in the East Village at her first restaurant, Dok Suni's, the words tteokbokki and seolleongtang and jajangmyeon did not roll off the tongues of most non-Koreans. But that's who she wanted to lure in with American music, date-night d\u00e9cor and Western-style service. Once she had them, she would tempt, teach, turn them on to the flavors she'd grown up with. Her mother, Myung Ja Kwak, shared cooking duties. Ms. Kwak's was not the take-it-or-leave-it approach of 32nd Street, and she kept at it. She wrote \"Dok Suni: Recipes From My Mother's Korean Kitchen,\" which was one of the few Korean cookbooks in English when it came out, in 1998. At her second restaurant, Do Hwa, she and her mother led customers deeper into unfamiliar ground. Each of the restaurants stayed open for about two decades, which is a very long time in New York. If you want a metaphor for how effectively Ms. Kwak paved the way for restaurants like Atoboy , Soogil, Danji and others whose chefs weave Korean cuisine into new patterns, consider that one of them, Oiji, moved into its address on First Avenue right after Dok Suni's moved out. What Ms. Kwak is doing in Park Slope isn't all that different from what she has done all her career, except that by now South Korean comfort food has become comfort food for New York in general. Haenyeo does pay more attention to seafood than Dok Suni or Do Hwa did, though. Ms. Kwak hasn't gone pescatarian on us. She still serves impressive pork and beef bulgogis with ssamjang and lettuce, and the pan-fried dumplings are filled with high-fat ground beef seasoned with kimchi, garlic and soy. But her menu's orientation has shifted slightly toward the ocean. This is good news, because the seafood at Haenyeo has a sparkle and sweetness you don't always find in the smoke-filled rooms of 32nd Street. A bibimbap variant may be the menu's sleeper dish, partly because it starts out looking like a lunch bowl from Sweetgreen. It is a version of hwe dup bap. At first you just see raw tuna, shredded romaine and perilla leaves, grated carrots and cucumber, and strips of seaweed. Hidden underneath is warm rice. But there is a pink mound of spicy cod roe in the bowl, too, with cured salmon eggs and a few lobes of sea urchin. Both of them will break apart as you stir, bringing their distinct saltwater intonations to the rice and vegetables. What the menu calls \"white fish fillets\" -- pan-fried cod with rings of scallion showing through their thin gold sheet of egg batter, otherwise known as saeng seon jeon -- is so modestly named it might get overlooked; it shouldn't. The menu plays Don't Mind Me again with \"mackerel, grilled or braised.\" Just get the mackerel, because the kitchen knows how to cook it, whether over a flame or in a dark, smoky pan of garlic and gochujang. In truth, the kitchen seems to know how to cook every kind of seafood, although perhaps it could come with a better partner for the fried scallops than the sweet, yellowish tartar sauce with corn in it. The walls are hung with photographs of Korean women in wet suits. These are the haenyeo of Jeju island , who dive up to 30 feet deep for conch, abalone and seaweed while holding their breath for several minutes at a time. The money they made diving is probably the reason parts of Jeju have a matriarchal family structure. Naming the restaurant after them, Ms. Kwak continues a theme started with Dok Suni's, which means \"strong women's.\" One dish that seems out of place is a revival of Dok Suni's fried chicken. Was the batter always so pasty and airless? That's not how I remember it, but it's possible my standards have changed as Korean fried chicken has infiltrated nearly every part of town over the past decade. In any case, there is better chicken to seek out here, not just the home-style dokdoritang stewed in chile sauce but also the wings. Haenyeo double-fries wings that have been dipped in potato starch, then coats them with a fine version of a yangnyeom chile sauce, tangier and a little less sweet than some. When Ms. Kwak detours from the Korean straight and narrow, consider traipsing along behind her. You may wind up having beignets for dessert, buried under a fresh coat of powdered sugar in the best Caf\u00e9 du Monde style. (This and the grilled oysters may betray the hand of her business partner, Terrence Segura, who is from New Orleans. He is also her husband.) Or you may follow her all the way to the joyous rice cake fundido, which starts out as tteokbokki in chile sauce and becomes totally atypical through the addition of chorizo, sliced jalape\u00f1os and a melted, browned topcoat of Oaxacan cheese that comes up in long, stretchy strings when you pull on it. It is, in all likelihood, the best Tex-Mex dish in New York. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

At the very least, it has paused to catch its breath. Since the seven-story food court in Hudson Yards was unveiled last month, the public reaction has been somewhere between shrug and ugh. Attitudes may improve as visitors eat their way to the top floor. So far, though, the response hasn't come close to matching the greeting bestowed on the restaurants at Time Warner Center in 2004, even though the project represents the same basic idea executed by the same developer with at least one of the same chefs, Thomas Keller . Even more striking has been the low-key reception to Rocco DiSpirito's return. Late last year Mr. DiSpirito took over the kitchen at Standard Grill in the meatpacking district. At one point, when he was the chef at both Union Pacific and Rocco's on 22nd while starring in a television show, he was arguably the most famous chef in the country. Then both places closed, and the show was canceled. Mr. DiSpirito has not been in charge of a restaurant since George W. Bush was in the White House. For that matter, it has been some years since Standard Grill itself has done anything noteworthy. In 2009, when it was new and Dan Silverman was the chef, I reviewed it, gave it one star and then lost track of it. In other words, the selection of Mr. DiSpirito did not just come out of left field. It came from the weeds across the street from the parking lot behind left field. For surprise value alone, it should have been one of the year's most buzzed-about news items. But the trumpets have been muted, and the back handsprings seem to lack a certain bounce. This, at least, is the view from outside the restaurant. Once you're sitting at one of the tables -- newly topped with leather pads in a major retrofitting that has made the dining room look like an expensive cabaret, blue velvet and all -- you will hear quite a lot of talk about Mr. DiSpirito, or as they call him here, Chef Rocco. Chef Rocco, you learn, conceived each dish on the menu so that it can be eaten by one person or shared with others. No, I didn't believe it at first, either, but apparently it's true: Rocco DiSpirito invented food. There is also something that servers call Chef Rocco's Game Changing Toast, although sometimes they shorten it to Rocco's Game Changing or simply Game Changing, as in \"Here's a little more Game Changing for you.\" The item in question is a toasted, cracker-thin slice of bread made of nuts, oats, seeds and psyllium-seed husks held together without benefit of wheat flour. Like nearly everything on the menu, it is free of gluten. Being mostly made of browned nuts, it is also delicious. Whether it is truly Rocco's is up for debate. It seems to strongly resemble the Life-Changing Loaf of Bread recipe that Sarah Britton published on her blog, \"My New Roots,\" in 2013, and that appeared on another blog two years later, with minor changes, as Game Changing Nut & Seed Bread . It's one of the items that reflect Mr. DiSpirito's recent obsession with nutrient-dense dietary supplements , although the way it keeps coming up in the servers' patter makes you wonder if Mr. DiSpirito spent too much time as a QVC pitchman. Anyway, somebody-or-other's toast sits under the smoked gravlax, red with beet juice and very silky on its bed of coconut cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, that Mr. DiSpirito sends out as an amuse. A plate of the toast will also appear if you order the platter of acorn-fed, hand-sliced Ib\u00e9rico ham or the chilled Maine sea urchins served on the spiky half-shell. Either one will convince you that Mr. DiSpirito knows how to get his hands on raw materials that can stun with almost no assistance. The best things at Standard Grill, and there are quite a lot of them, depend on very good ingredients touched as little as possible. Back in the Union Pacific days, Mr. DiSpirito's interest in East Asian cuisines came out in the form of complex preparations, arcane ingredients and out-of-nowhere juxtapositions. Now he seems to have moved on to the luxury minimalism of an omakase sushi chef, a style that was foreshadowed by the only Union Pacific dish he's brought back, bay scallops and sea urchin with a few throat-searing drops of mustard oil. Standard Grill's ice-cold cubes of bluefin chu-toro stirred with golden osetra caviar, meanwhile, could have come straight out of Masa , while the yellowfin tartare, barely dressed with crushed macadamias and freshly grated wasabi, is like one of the better items at Tetsu . Each night there are half a dozen or so skewers cooked over Japanese charcoal and wheeled to the table on a mini-grill the size of a toaster oven. Speared on a stick might be fantastic small scallops out of Peconic Bay; a feathery mop of maitake mushrooms; buttery chicken livers with barely a hint of bitterness; or firefly squid, a little bigger than a fava bean and grilled whole so they can be swallowed guts and all. Again, the ingredients are exceptional. The skewers look simple enough, but they are all, you learn, brushed with \"a little sauce Chef Rocco came up with to complement the charcoal.\" The sauce for seafood involves coconut nectar and lemongrass, and what it actually does is put you, vaguely and pleasantly, in mind of Thailand. While I am one of those increasingly stooped and wizened diners who remembers, in detail, Mr. DiSpirito's cooking at Union Pacific, far more people recall him as the meatball-pushing antihero of \"The Restaurant,\" an NBC series about Rocco's on 22nd, an actual (and doomed, it turned out) Italian-American restaurant. The show, which debuted in 2003, was a pioneer in the genre of cooking-focused reality television, although when everybody started suing everybody else, it became clear it was a pioneer in the way the members of the Donner Party were pioneers. The handful of Italian dishes at Standard Grill may be meant for \"Restaurant\" fans. Neither of the two pastas showed Mr. DiSpirito at his best, but a chewy risotto with red shrimp and what seemed like half a dozen forms of black truffles may make you understand why Ruth Reichl started her 1998 Times review of Union Pacific with a woman moaning at the next table. Standard Grill's Norwegian salmon on an ivory puddle of vegan cashew sauce won't inspire the same reaction, but the steaks might; they are dry-aged until ripe, and earn their deep-brown crust over extremely hot Japanese charcoal. Given what Mr. DiSpirito is capable of doing with a piece of halibut and some goose fat, I can't quite believe that I'm recommending the rib-eye over the seafood, but I am. It may be that Mr. DiSpirito knows exactly what he is doing. Simplicity is the whole point of a grill, which is first cousin to the steakhouse. He has also designed a menu so straightforward that if, after a respectable period of time, he is no longer in the kitchen, the food quality can stay roughly the same as long as the hotel doesn't argue about ingredient costs. The Standard has not left the restaurant's fate entirely in his hands, either; besides redecorating, it hired a ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel, Michael Cecchi-Azzolina, away from Le Coucou ; he is hard at work building an audience every night, handing out old-school business cards to old-school producers, chefs and publishers, sitting down to chat with Brooke Shields and Ms. Reichl. Standard Grill is so much better than it used to be, and so much better than almost any restaurant serving a comparable menu of grilled meats and chilled seafood, that it's foolish to wish for the return of the same Mr. DiSpirito who gave us Union Pacific. It's a little bit as if Barbra Streisand had returned to Broadway, and then sang all her songs in a whisper sitting on the edge of the stage. It might not be what you had been waiting for, but you'd watch. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

In fact, in Blue Smoke's attempt to bring together the barbecued game hen of Cozy Corner , in Memphis, with the fried hot chicken of places like Prince's, in Nashville, the bird has been through a good deal more than that. The process goes like this, approximately : spatchcocked, brined, rubbed with spices, smoked, chilled, dunked in a frothy batter, tossed in seasoned flour, deep fried, dipped in spicy oil and sprinkled with four kinds of ground pepper. \"Just a little pop-pop dust right on top\" is how Jean-Paul Bourgeois, Blue Smoke's chef, describes the last step. \"That introduction of fresh chile onto that fried chicken, it just brings the zing.\" Then came one final touch, he said: \"a little swirlybird of Tabasco hot honey.\" Handily, this can all be shortened to smoked, fried hen when you order ($24 at the Battery Park City location and $26 on East 27th Street).

That small children routinely bought coffee-flavored milk in school cafeterias; that \"beer\" was not pronounced with an \"r\" at the end, but pizza was; that a hot dog shortened to about four inches and topped with meat sauce is called a hot wiener , and that a counterman preparing six of them at a time may deploy a maneuver known as \"wieners up the arm\" -- all of this apparently strikes people who grew up more than 20 miles from Providence as very funny. When New Yorkers hear that Violet , a new restaurant in the East Village, serves a style of pizza that comes from Rhode Island, they start to smile, as if getting ready for the punch line. In fact, though, Violet's pies are a homage not to the whole state but to a specific restaurant, Al Forno, in Providence. If you know one thing about Al Forno, you know that its pizza is not a joke. One of the restaurant's two founders, George Germon, originated the recipe in the early 1980s, more or less out of desperation. After failing to get an oven hot enough to produce a crust as thin and crunchy as the ones he remembered eating in Italy, he tossed dough on a wood-burning grill and watched in awe as it stiffened to a crisp almost instantly. The pizza he and his wife, Johanne Killeen, would develop and elaborate from there was in a category of its own. The skills required to bake dough in a pizza oven, whether it runs on gas, coal or wood, don't apply to grilled pizza at all. This makes it an unending source of fascination to pizza technologists including Violet's chef, Matt Hyland. With his wife and business partner, Emily Hyland, Mr. Hyland paid tribute to wood-fired New Haven and New York pizza at his first place, Emily , then took on Detroit pan pizza at Emmy Squared . They have expanded both restaurants to new locations, including Citi Field, where Emmy Squared is now the \"official pizza.\" But Mr. Hyland has been a student of the Al Forno school of pizza for years, since going to college in Rhode Island. Violet, which he opened at the start of the year, is dedicated to the style. He has worked allusions to other features of the state's cuisine into the menu, which makes forays into pasta and small seafood dishes, but the pizza grill is at the center of the action. Anyone who has eaten at Al Forno will recognize the lineage of Violet's pies. Both are as thin as a saltine all the way to the edge, with parallel lines of grill marks on their undersides. Al Forno puts fontina on its margheritas, as Violet did with all its pizzas until recently, when it began experimenting with havarti. In any case, the cheeses are on the dry side and grated for fast, thin distribution. Sauces are splashed down by the spoonful, quickly, before the crust burns. That's the template for a pie called the Atwells: a base coat of grated havarti and pecorino under big blots of a garlic-laden pesto made even greener than usual by the inclusion of broccoli and pistachios. While Al Forno tosses raw, slivered scallions on almost every pie, Violet may chop its scallions or grill them. One appealingly eccentric pie that combines a New Haven clam pizza with a Peking duck pancake is finished with fried julienned leeks. Olive oil does give Al Forno's crust extra crackle and flavor, but Violet's less lavishly oiled dough, made with a sourdough starter, has more flavor of its own. It's a little salty, crunchy but not brittle, more substantial than you expect, and highly chewable. Violet gives you a heavy pair of shears to snip the pie into wedges, or any shape you like. Wielding them supplies the palpable thrill of using exactly the right tool for the job, and it's even better than that because the job is eating pizza. A trip to Providence last weekend, though, turned up more than structural similarities between Violet and Al Forno. Three of the four pizzas on Al Forno's menu reminded me of pies I'd eaten at Violet. One resembled the Atwells, but its pesto was made with asparagus rather than broccoli. For Violet's Beech Vibes, a thin layer of duxelles is spread from rim to rim, then topped with tahini, caramelized onions and pickled beech mushrooms. It reminds me of a pissaladi\u00e8re in which the anchovies have been replaced by mushrooms. Al Forno makes a duxelles pizza, too, but tops it with unpickled white mushrooms, and doesn't use tahini. And, of course, both places do a variation on a Neapolitan margherita, called the margarita in Providence and the Classic in the East Village. The difference between their dough recipes doesn't quite put to rest the suspicion that Violet should be more conscientious about avoiding overlap even though Al Forno is 180 miles away. Most diners, of course, will just be happy to have a new style of pizza in town. Any of Violet's pies, eaten before or after the iceberg-wedge salad with blue cheese and a jolt of ranch dressing, or the fris\u00e9e salad tossed with fried artichokes, would make an ideal fast dinner. Beyond that, the going can get tricky. All the pastas I tried seemed like rough drafts, from the radiatore baked in a very salty vodka sauce to the spaghetti con vongole con dashi, a Japanese-Italian blind date that doesn't have the right chemistry. The two desserts I had were even stranger. Describing one of them, a cheesecake with banana pudding on it, the server said, \"I'm just going to tell you what it is and if you guys want it, you can order it.\" If the warning had been any stronger it would have come with liability waivers. If you did want to build a longer meal, some of the seafood appetizers can help. Not the \"stuffies,\" baked stuffed littlenecks or cherrystones that could use more clam. The smoked mackerel, though, is excellent and comes with some unusually good fresh-fried potato chips. There are also shrimp that have been grilled with their heads and shells on, placed over johnnycakes and splashed with spiced piri-piri sauce. Johnnycakes, which are made of fried cornmeal mush and taste like it, are probably more strongly identified with Rhode Island than any other food. I have never been sure why, because johnnycakes can be found, if you really want to look for them, all along the Atlantic Coast. The only time I've seen Rhode Islanders eating them was on a Boy Scout camping trip, and boy scouts will eat anything if you leave them in the woods for a few days. In any case, the johnnycakes that Violet places under the shrimp and the piri-piri sauce are kind of wonderful. The cornmeal has a lush, right-off-the-cob flavor. I'd have them for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Is it possible that the joke has been on me all along? Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

At two points during the March menu, a person who is not Mr. Odo faces you across the thick plank of Lebanon cedar that forms the dining counter and makes something for you. The first time is about halfway through the meal, when Seong Cheol Byun shows up, shapes half a dozen pieces of sushi and lays them down, one by one, in front of you. Some of his ingredients, kept on wooden trays that he carries from place to place, are typical, like the warm short-grain rice and the dark nikiri that he will brush over certain fish. Others are less typical. The ginger he mounds on your plate is pickled together with sliced lotus root and daikon. On March 1, looking forward to spring, he added cherry leaves to the mix. Mr. Byun, a Korean-American, ferments daikon, cabbage and sesame seeds to make white kimchi, which he wraps inside nori for a tuna roll. You eat it like an ice cream cone, but faster. When Mr. Byun worked at Sushi Nakazawa, much of the seafood he used was flown in from Japan. At Odo, almost all the fish have been caught off the East Coast of North America: Long Island black sea bass, Florida mackerel and North Carolina bluefin tuna, which may be several weeks old before Mr. Byun is ready to serve it. This sushi reflects the American region where it is made, incorporates the Korean background of the chef making it and still has an unmistakably Japanese spirit. This one course, if tripled in length, could be spun off into a separate establishment that would probably be among the top two dozen sushi restaurants in the city. The second time an Odo course is prepared while you watch, it is made in a cocktail shaker and served in a cocktail glass. It is, as you may have guessed, a cocktail, though it is also the first of two desserts, sweetish and not especially boozy. Frank Cisneros, the sommelier, subordinates the alcohol to fresh fruit, in the style of the revered Tokyo bar Gen Yamamoto . Barrel-aged shochu is muddled with one or two sprightly segments of mikan orange, subjected to a calisthenic shake and strained into a delicately etched glass before a shimmer of sparkling wine is laid down on top. Orange juice in cocktails usually tastes diluted and weak; in this drink, it was radiant. I would say that the drinkable dessert course could be expanded into a separate cocktail bar, except that Odo already has one of those. Odo, which opened in December a few minutes' walk from the Flatiron Building, is entered through a door hidden in the back of a compact den -- cafe by day and bar by night -- called Hall. This arrangement seems to remind people of a speakeasy, although it would take an especially clueless bootlegger to open a speakeasy inside a bar. So far, Hall has not been fully discovered, but it still gets busy enough at dinner time that you can be stranded by the front door for a few minutes before anyone on staff notices. Some diners on their way to Odo will find this an awkward start to a meal that costs $200 before tax, tip and drinks. But they may also discern that Hall, lined with carved oak panels salvaged from what appears to have been a library or church vestry from around 1900, is one of the neighborhood's most entrancing rooms; that the corridor, which seems too narrow and definitely climbs on its way toward a too-short brass door with no handle, is perspective-altering in a way a Surrealist would enjoy; and that Odo, a shadowy and windowless space on the far side of that door is an unusually tranquil shelter from crowds, noise and anything else you might want to get away from for a couple of hours. The 14 counter seats face the kitchen and, in the middle of it, a charcoal-gray island. This is where Mr. Odo and his cooks assemble the other courses I promised to tell you about. Duck breast has been grilled over charcoal and positioned between two sauces. One is a black spill of concentrated soy spiced with sansho pepper; the other is an ivory pool of pur\u00e9ed apples and cream. These sauces contrast in every way you can think of, including East versus West, and they come together like opposing poles of a magnet. A springy chunk of truffle-flavored mochi is crisped on the grill and engulfed in a white-miso soup that has grated white truffles floating on the surface. You smell truffles in the air first, get them on the tip of your tongue next and finally taste them everywhere when they're released from the mochi. A croquette tastes something like an Italian rice ball made from New England clam chowder that has young bamboo shoots in it. This golden, breaded arancino is finished with dots of grated goat cheese. Shaved lamb shoulder, baby harukei turnip and two asparagus stalks as thin as licorice whip are served, still cooking, in a hot broth, a kaiseki version of shabu shabu. Odo -- incidentally, the name is pronounced as a set of initials, O.D.O. -- pursues local ingredients not just for its sushi course but throughout its menu. The simmered lamb used to gambol in the Hudson Valley, the croquetted topneck clams were raked in off Long Island and so on. Kaiseki's near-liturgical focus on timeliness almost seems to demand local ingredients, and they have been central to Niki Nakayama's strategy at n/naka in Los Angeles, but less so for New York's few kaiseki chefs. Chikara Sono at Kyo Ya , for instance, takes pains to import traditional ingredients from Japan the minute they're available. Mr. Odo came to New York as the chef of Kajitsu , the extraordinary restaurant on East 39th Street that follows the vegetarian cooking tradition known as shojin ryori, born centuries ago in Zen Buddhist temples. One contribution he made in his five years there was to freshen up the menus with more food grown nearby. In the first and last tastes of his February and March menus, he anchors Odo firmly in the New York region. When you sit down, you are immediately poured a cup of cold sake. It is brewed in Brooklyn, and it is very good, swirling with fresh-fruit aromatics. Then at the end, after the fresh fruit, Mr. Odo serves ice cream made with kasu, the creamy solids left over at the end of sake distillation. The ice cream looks like vanilla and tastes, not surprisingly, like fermented rice. This particular kasu is supplied by the same brewery in Brooklyn that makes the sake. Expanding his range to meat and fish at Odo, he has kept the resourcefulness that limitations encourage. Somewhere along the way Mr. Odo also picked up technical skills in traditions far outside kaiseki. Each night, in the gohan course, Odo offers a choice of three starchy dishes. This is where I encountered a very fine seafood curry over rice; an elegant bowl of short ramen noodles in king crab broth; and fresh soba served with little pieces of pickled vegetables and wasabi blossoms, looking a bit like broccoli florets but tasting like mustard. As with the cocktail and the sushi, each of these dishes could, if Mr. Odo wanted, be leveraged into separate specialized restaurants, or food-hall stands. You could tell yourself that $200 is a large amount of money for a single meal or you could say that for the chance to visit all these different establishments without leaving your seat, it's a pretty good deal.

Arrive before the fish shops along this famous, not-quite-faded Italian strip in the Bronx take in the iced clams and octopus for the night. Across from Dominick's, turn into the indoor market that Fiorello La Guardia ordered up. Move on past the hand-rolled cigars and the T-shirts reflecting various tenets of Bronx philosophy. Keep going beyond the scamorza, the soppressata and the ready-to-go heroes, and walk out the door on to Hughes Avenue. Just to the right is a spinning wheel that looks old enough to have been Rumpelstiltskin's and next to it, another door. Open it, walk inside. The short trip seems to have taken you back in time. The spinning wheel turns out to be just one piece in Cka Ka Qellu's collection of antique tools, stringed instruments, yokes, brass coffee mills, manual typewriters, dishes of hammered metal and embroidered costumes that the owner, Ramiz Kukaj, brought over from the old country. Some, he says, go back to the 18th century. The floors and walls seem to have been airlifted from an Albanian farmhouse, and the speakers play wistful folk tunes on traditional instruments, not the modern, globally aware wake-up calls of the brass band Fanfara Tirana . The restaurant is soaked in nostalgia. The other reason for the walk from Arthur Avenue is that it recapitulates a pattern that's repeated throughout this neighborhood, where the signs and menus facing the street are still written in Italian but many of the people in the back rooms, seasoning the sausages and frying the veal cutlets, are Albanian. Here and there, those Albanians have brought a little of their cuisine into those Italian businesses. Cumin-laden suxhuk sausages hang to dry in the salumerias. In some pizzerias, the burek challenges the Jamaican beef patty for outsider meat-pie supremacy. One such place, also owned by Mr. Kukaj, is in the Norwood neighborhood and is called Tradita. ( Ligaya Mishan reviewed it in 2017.) But if you want a deep-end Albanian experience, Cka Ka Qellu, pronounced SHA ka chell-OO, is the place to go. The kitchen does not focus on the seafood of Albania's Adriatic coast, or the more intensely Greek- and Turkish-leaning cuisine of its southern reaches. Instead, it heavily favors the north, which shares many dishes with the former components of Yugoslavia that are its neighbors. In particular there is a strong overlap with Kosovo, home to many ethnic Albanians including, at one time, Mr. Kukaj and his chef, Afrim Kaliqani. In their kitchen, yogurt and cream are everywhere, along with curds of soft fresh cheese and triangles of creamy, unsqueaky feta. A good portion of the menu could be described as things in a creamy white sauce. Another, entirely different portion could be described as creamy white sauce with things in it. Included in the second group are some of the dips that are almost obligatory at the start of your Cka Ka Qellu experience: tarator, tart yogurt with minced cucumbers, garlic and parsley, similar to tzatziki, but nearly as fluffy as whipped cream; cream stirred with bits of suxhuk to give it a pinkish tint and a suggestion of spice; and kajmak , which our server described as \"like butter for bread\" and I would say was like cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche blended with cream cheese and butter. (In parts of Albania, it would be made by boiling unpasteurized milk from water buffalo.) I found myself dipping sausages, vegetables and just about everything else into the kajmak, but it is exceptionally good with a warm slice of the bread that Cka Ka Qellu bakes in the pizza oven that is the first thing you see when you walk in. When the menu defines kacamak as \"cream with polenta,\" the cream in question is kajmak, stirred into a fine-grained, nearly white mass of cornmeal that takes on the lightly fluffed quality of really well-made mashed potatoes. Sometimes there is a creamy sauce where you don't expect one. Each slice of lecenik, a cornbread with spinach and cottage cheese that is so rich it is only a few rungs in the ladder from cheesecake, comes to the table under a spoonful of kajmak. Sometimes there is no creamy sauce where one would do some good. The restaurant's version of fli, the slow-baked, many-layered pancake, is served as a long, narrow wedge with no accompaniment, although it is somewhat less than fully tender and moist. Luckily it responds immediately to any spare yogurt you can forage from elsewhere on the table. The mantia, baked dumplings filled with ground veal and onions, will seem tough and dry, too, if you order them alone. The same mantia cooked with yogurt in a clay dish will seem perfect. Is there another restaurant in New York that makes as much use of veal, and as little of any other meat, as Cka Ka Qellu? It is the main ingredient in the restaurant's qofte, ground and mixed with onions and red pepper; and in its qebapa, mild skinless sausages cooked on the grill. (The sausages would be called cevapi in other corners of the Balkans, where they are likely to be made from lamb or beef.) Veal works its way into many of the clay-dish stews, including the veal tava, something like a Mediterranean ratatouille that got itself entangled with a meat-and-potato stew from another part of Europe. Rolled up with cheeses and smoked meat, breaded and fried, veal also serves as the filling for the alluring Skanderbeg. Named after a great patriotic hero of the 15th century, Skanderbeg is generally called Albania's national dish, although its resemblance to a kayak made from chicken cordon bleu renders it something of an outlier in the cuisine. Ladled along its crunchy, golden length is -- please rise and face Hughes Avenue -- a creamy white sauce. Eating all of this without a salad is unimaginable and probably unadvisable. Each of Cka Ka Qellu's several salads seems to consist of cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions and cheese in slightly different arrangements. If the vegetables were any fresher, you'd be embarrassed to eat them in public. Surprise appearances by olives and their ilk provide extra variety. Like the breads, the desserts are baked on site: syrup-soaked baklava, a nut cake called haxhimak, a sugar cookie with nuts pressed into the top whose Albanian name is sheqerpare. I like them best with coffee boiled on the stove in a long-handled brass pitcher and served on a matching tray, both of them engraved with ancient, geometric designs that repeat and repeat.

This is a familiar concept in Vietnam, where it is known as bo bay mon, as well as in San Jose, Calif., Houston and other areas with robust Vietnamese populations. In New York, where the Vietnamese restaurant scene is more anemic, bo bay mon is still a rarity. The rough outlines of the setup at Madame Vo, though, will be familiar to any New Yorker who has gone out for Korean barbecue. New York City bureaucracy is unwelcoming to the tabletop charcoal grills seen in Hanoi, so an electric grill under a metal screen is embedded in each table. Once the grill is switched on and the metal rods down at kneecap level begin to warm up, an array of sauces, condiments and vegetables will arrive. When the rods are red, a server with a pair of tongs will lay some meat down on the screen, return periodically to fiddle with it and eventually decide when it is ready to be eaten. The similarities with, say, Han Joo Chik Naeng Myun & BBQ in Queens end, of course, with the actual food. Yes, both offer lettuce for wrapping, but at Madame Vo BBQ it is part of a Vietnamese table salad, along with fresh herbs; raw cucumbers, pineapple and apple; and pickled carrots and daikon. The restaurant also sets out a nifty caddy that holds circles of rice paper and warm water, in a miniature bathtub, for wetting the paper until it is soft enough to fashion into rolls. Rather than gochujang and sesame oil, there is a classic Vietnamese nuoc cham, an intoxicatingly good version of the pineapple-and-fermented anchovy sauce known as mam nem, and lastly a tamarind sauce, which suggests Madame Vo BBQ can follow or leap over Vietnamese tradition at will. This is about what you'd expect if you've eaten at another restaurant, a few blocks north, simply called Madame Vo . Jimmy Ly is the chef in both places; he and his wife, Yen Vo, are the proprietors. Each was raised in the United States by immigrants from Vietnam, and like many children of immigrants they seem to be fluent not just in two languages but in two cultures, enabling them to serve dishes their families might recognize in a setting that outsiders might embrace. The wings at Madame Vo, sticky with caramel and fried garlic, are drive-straight-from-the-airport good. The restaurant produces some of the only pho in Manhattan worth talking about. One of them, in a porcelain bowl the size of a baptismal font, is filled with a potent beef broth, a short rib on the bone and enough other cuts to make a butcher smile. At least one dish at the couple's new restaurant can stand alongside the wings and the pho at their first: the oxtail congee. Congee, or chao thit bo, is customarily the last course in bo bay mon. It frequently takes the form of a cloudy beef-and-rice soup. Mr. Ly cooks his congee with some chicken stock until it has the consistency of polenta, then spoons over it some sweet and savory braised oxtails in honey, fish sauce and brown butter. Everything about it is wonderful, even the scallion greens on top. The first of the seven beefs is typically boi tai chanh, a raw beef salad, and this is a high point, too. Lean eye of round cut into thin pink sheets is the canvas for an action-painting whirl of fried shallots, raw red onions, chopped peanuts and slivers of fresh mint. Pretty standard stuff so far, but then Mr. Ly bathes the salad in tangerine-lime vinaigrette, which has a positively buoyant effect, and splashes it with a bright-green, lemony pulp of fresh rau ram pur\u00e9ed in oil. In the middle of this $59 menu come the grilled meats, the courses for which the table salad and rice paper wrappers have been waiting. The finest of these might be the relatively straightforward five-spice tongue, although the betel-leaf-wrapped bundles of seasoned ground beef -- bo la lot -- are soothing and stimulating at once, and the New York strip with marrow butter is a clever way to acknowledge Manhattan's own beef-eating rituals, even if it would draw blank stares on the streets of Saigon. If you, like me, are naturally skeptical when servers persistently push a big-ticket item, you might be tempted to blaze your own path through Madame Vo BBQ's menu. But once you've tried the bo bay mon you have, by and large, seen the kitchen at its best. Yes, you could get the whole catfish, and if you are not into beef perhaps you should. Despite what the menu says, the catfish is not grilled, but fried and then baked. It was perfectly done the night I had it, and was filleted at the table by a server who knew his way around a fish skeleton. By that time, all that was left to do was to wrap a chunk of fish in lettuce and rice paper with a squeeze of grilled lemon and some of the saut\u00e9ed shallots, lemongrass and bird chiles that the kitchen had ladled along the snaking curve of the spine. If you are thinking about a vegetable, the skewered and grilled okra pods in soy are crunchy and unslimy. The other appetizers, though, can be tricky. One night, the grilled scallop brushed with duck fat was transporting; on another, it tasted too much like the grill. Spring rolls filled with short rib and bone marrow seemed pointlessly indulgent, and so did their truffle hoisin dipping sauce in which I couldn't taste the truffles. A few dishes might have been improved if they'd arrived while hot, like the extra-large grilled oysters under caramelized sea urchin mayonnaise or the charred sea urchin, basted in its shell with butter, sake and fish sauce. Grilled prawns brushed with a lovely orange butter were slightly more mushy than two prawns sold for $38 should be. And while the 44-ounce tomahawk steak was more than a fair deal at $90, it would have been helped by a more aggressive sear and more salt. On certain nights, the whole operation had a slack, inattentive feeling that's rare in new restaurants. The catfish sat on the table, getting cold, while we waited for the table salad to show up. The thick stems of stir-fried morning glory would have been better cut into shorter lengths. Madame Vo BBQ may eventually run as smoothly as its older sibling. While it works out the mechanics, the surest route to happiness is to eat the bo bay mon while sipping cold coconut water through a metal straw out of a whole green coconut that you hold in one hand, like a cup of coffee.

The dish is Hong Kong-style won-ton noodle soup, though, which requires Maxi Lau, the chef and proprietor, to keep a large number of items on hand to be added to or subtracted from the soup at the customer's whim: the broth of pork bones boiled with dried shrimp; the skinny yellow noodles with their firm, elastic snap; the stewed beef cooked with a sizable pinch of five-spice powder; the dense fish balls streaked with scallions; the weightless, grease-free chips of fried fish skin; and so on. But the one item that is absolutely essential is the won ton. Make that plural -- won tons, as many as Ms. Lau will put into your bowl ($8). This turns out to be four if you also want noodles, and six if you don't. Years ago Ms. Lau's mother dreamed of opening a won-ton shop, and had gone to Toronto to learn the art of won-ton wrapping from a family friend. Those plans changed when she learned she had cancer. After she died, two years ago, Maxi Lau decided to rebuild her own life. Leaving her job in corporate management, she retraced her mother's steps, learning to make won tons with the same family friend. Three months ago, she started Maxi's as a pop-up every evening but Thursdays, taking over a Hong Kong-style breakfast and lunch cafe owned by an aunt in Flushing, Queens. Ms. Lau plans to set up a noodle soup shop of her own in another part of Flushing later this year. Until then, she is making more won tons than she expected, because customers keep coming back to buy them by the dozen, frozen. Ms. Lau's won tons are filled with a mixture of shrimp and pork, with the emphasis very much on the shrimp. Each bite -- it takes at least two to finish off a Maxi's Noodle won ton -- confirms that the shrimp are of very high quality and are cooked in a way that keeps them unusually crisp and juicy. You can see their bodies glowing pink through the thin skins of the wrappers, whose loose ends trail behind the plump, round won tons like comets' tails.

Another part is the sense of being in on a secret, eating at some place that doesn't have a Yelp entry and may not even have a name, while your friends are waiting in line at Roberta's . The mismatch between the borrowed space and the borrowers can send off sparks, too. Three years ago, when the Danish chef Bo Bech staged a one-night pop-up in the kitchen at Cosme in Manhattan, using ingredients he'd bought from farmers and shellfishers in Virginia the day before, his Mid-Atlantic-Nordic cooking stood out against the aromas of griddled masa and roasted chiles. When a pop-up settles down into a space of its own, it loses those things. In their place, it takes on the extra weight of proprietorship. The owners have to make decisions that were previously made for them, and those decisions will start to define them. It's their paint color on the wall, their scented candles in the bathroom, their name on the door. This is the position in which we find the former pop-up Oxalis and its chef, Nico Russell, a veteran of Daniel , in New York, and Mirazur , on the French Riviera. Beginning in 2016, Mr. Russell slalomed through a series of restaurants that would hand him the keys on off nights so he could cook tasting menus of 10 courses or so. First he inhabited Fitzcarraldo , an Italian restaurant whose combination of industrial, nautical, cinematic and Mediterranean elements has made it a frequent wedding site. Later he moved on to Egg , an austerely contemporary temple to breakfast which had begun its own life, more than a decade earlier, as a pop-up. He sold tickets to his Oxalis dinners, enough of them to get a few investors interested. With enough funding to take on a lease in Crown Heights, Oxalis opened in November in a former wine bar within sight of the Brooklyn Museum. Mr. Russell's vision for Oxalis is the one behind the bistronomie movement in France and its disciples abroad: carefully considered food served without the hoopla that drives up tabs. He slings a lot of vegetables in Oxalis's four- to six-course set menus, and it's one sign of his skill that this doesn't come across as a cost-cutting measure even though it must be, at least in part -- dinner is an extremely reasonable $60. Both the price and the understated cooking style reminded me of Contra , which opened with a five-course, $55 menu. The last time I went I ate a dish built around spaghetti-like strands of rutabaga under a warm snowdrift of whipped Alpine fontina. These two mild-tasting ingredients were set in motion by the force of a third, a dark and focused coffee-and-chicory cream sauce. This was a rutabaga that made me smile. Granted, I probably like rutabaga more than the average person, but I suspect that exposure to the rutabaga at Oxalis would make the average person realize that I'm right. Meals begin with a couple of bite-size snacks, one of which tends to be a crisp potato cake dusted with bay-leaf powder and topped with a chip of nori. It looks harmless enough, but can produce powerful emotions, which are easier to understand once you know that the potatoes are stewed in duck fat and then deep-fried. The other snack might be some lightly dehydrated beets brushed with marjoram-infused cream, or tiny grilled carrots that you dip in chamomile sabayon. (This is one of the dishes that suggests the long shadow of Noma , which in its early days famously matched aged carrots with chamomile.) The price seems meant to encourage frequent visits, but if you return often you may experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. At meals in December, January and February, I was always served some variation on raw sea scallops with daikon and apple and some version of duck breast, sweet potato and yogurt. The portions in both cases were restrained but the flavors were outsize. The scallops were cured in miso and refrigerated for a few days and came out of it with something like the concentration of flavor that beef gets from dry-aging, but none of the funk. The duck's flavor was less surprising, but there was some energy in its collision with sweet potato pur\u00e9e and fig-leaf yogurt tart enough to cause double-takes. Like the rest of the menu, desserts are unshowy but can be highly impressive. One worked goat milk up into a thing of beauty: Some of it was made into a simple frozen custard, the rest cooked down into cajeta. The cooking makes it clear why people chased Oxalis around Brooklyn in its various borrowed spaces, but other aspects of the restaurant suggest that it hasn't quite figured out how to live in a space of its own. A meal there can be a somewhat solemn experience, which doesn't seem to be what Mr. Russell and his partners are aiming for. The layout seems to work against it. The kitchen is right up front, and the bar is all the way in the back, separated from the dining room by a glass door in a glass wall. I can't imagine what the wall is for, unless Oxalis is planning to bring back the smoking section. Instead of serving as a street-side welcome and a source of energy for the dining room, the bar feels like a waiting room. And while it takes reservations, the tasting menu isn't served there. The bar menu is \u00e0 la carte. The dining room could use a little lift. It's as plain as a Shaker church, with clamshell-colored wainscoting below white walls unbroken by pictures or anything else. (All the art is in the restroom.) The way the servers have been coached on their lines so far underlines the decorative stiffness. They say stuff like \"Moving now into more sweet things \u2026\" rather than \"Here's your dessert,\" and my neighbor one night was instructed to \"sit back and relax,\" something that tends to go without saying in most restaurants. Things have loosened up since the liquor license came through. In the first few weeks, the servers were always trying to push a nonalcoholic beverage pairing for $20, and while the bar was mixing sodas that were more interesting than many cocktails around town, I'm not sure they were different enough from one another to justify drinking the whole slate. Now there are also wine pairings, starting at $35. Sometimes I wondered whether it would get the air circulating if the bar popped up in the dining room, or vice versa. There's probably some simple fix, or a series of them, that would give Oxalis some of its old sense of adventure. You can sense it lying there, waiting, when you taste that cajeta, those scallops, the fantastic little potato cakes.

At the same time, another style of French restaurant was dying off, but generally without benefit of a full obituary. This was the small, discreet bistro with forehead-height curtains in the windows, Piaf on the speakers, snails on the menu, chips on the china. They could be found uptown or downtown, almost always on a side street. Unlike Le Pavillon, La C\u00f4te Basque and their ilk, and unlike Keith McNally's immersive brasserie sets , which came later, these bistros were rarely fashionable. They were filled with professors and psychotherapists, Paris Review readers and Film Society of Lincoln Center members. Occasionally a passer-by out walking the dog would stand on tiptoe to peer over the curtain, but paparazzi did not stake out the doors of these establishments. Individually, few were landmarks. Collectively, their quiet continental self-assurance, their indifference to the passage of time, not to mention their cr\u00e8mes br\u00fbl\u00e9es and blood sausages and Fleuries, helped form the backdrop of the city. You always thought you'd have one within walking distance. Then, one day, you didn't. Bistro Pierre Lapin , which the chef and restaurateur Harold Moore opened last May in the West Village, is either a very late entry into the genre, or else a homage of impressive intensity. The dining room has the forehead-height curtains -- green gingham. It has Piaf on the playlist, and also Pink Martini's \"Sympathique,\" which has become the \"Vie en Rose\" of the Spotify era, for better or worse. Pierre Lapin also throws in some frills that go beyond the basic formula. White tapers burn on every table, wall sconces throw off Cognac-colored light from behind lampshades the size of teacups, a collection of thin flowery china dishes supplements the chunky white bistro ware. Most of all, Pierre Lapin has that rich, creamy, antique cooking -- all the stuff nouvelle cuisine tried to kill. As soon as you order, you get a preview of what you're in for: A length of chewy, substantial baguette arrives with a small mound of cultured butter, a pile of truffled cheese spread and a pink hunk of rustic pork p\u00e2t\u00e9. On a quiet night at home, this could serve as a light dinner. At Pierre Lapin, it is a little snack to stave off hunger before the appetizers. Going back at least as far as his days at Commerce , Mr. Moore has seemed at home with profuse helpings and sauces that settled over them like a goose-down duvet over a sleeping Saint Bernard. After closing that restaurant, he opened an ode to Southern immoderation called Harold's Meat & Three, now just Harold's ; the most memorable thing I've eaten there was a Kentucky hot brown sandwich on which the Mornay sauce flowed freely. He also briefly ran a less focused study of Americana called the Greenwich Grille, where I ate a chicken potpie that I thought had potential. About a week later, I learned that the place had closed. None of Mr. Moore's previous kitchens went for the gut quite as gleefully as Pierre Lapin's. Your first course there could well be, and almost certainly will be if you leave the choice to me, an avalanche of mushrooms in cream cascading over the edge of a tall slab of buttered and griddled pain de mie. But it would be a mistake to overlook the Brie au four, roughly half a pound of baked Brie melting among dried figs and walnuts, all served with toasted baguette. I ended up ordering the Brie for the table, which freed somebody else to get the very meaty frogs' legs in a small lake of parsley, garlic, butter and lemon juice, while another guest tried the \"balle de matzo en consomm\u00e9.\" In English, that means a nice bowl of chicken soup with a single matzo ball so densely packed that if you tossed it out of a second-story window it would probably put a dent in a car hood. This is not a bad trait in a matzo ball unless you happen to own the car. The lusty tune begun by the appetizers is picked up by the main courses. There is a fairly classic coq au vin, not too winy-tasting; some hefty sea scallops under toasted almonds, sensibly outfitted with endive and citrus sections; and a grouping of gnocchi, foie gras, saut\u00e9ed sweetbreads and mushrooms, black truffle shavings and puffy chicken dumplings, all milling around in a Cognac-flamed cream sauce. It sounds insanely overcrowded, but is very rewarding to unpack. We have only scratched the surface of the menu. It goes on, perhaps longer than it should, because some dishes are more appealing than others. A black sea bass \"bonne femme\" was simply dull instead of simple. The soupy, thin cassoulet could have used more meat and a thicker crust of bread crumbs. The garlic sauce Mr. Moore made for snails tasted less garlicky than run-of-the-mill snail butter; the snails and I never figured out what we were supposed to do with the sunny-side-up egg planted in the middle of the plate. The menu could be trimmed by about a third. The same is most likely true for a few individual dishes, although Mr. Moore's shambolic, celebratory cooking style is one of the reasons Pierre Lapin works as well as it does. If he tidied everything up he'd be going head-to-head with Le Coucou , a contest that would not play to his strengths. The excess, the untucked shirttails on the dishes, the incomplete thoughts on the menu are part of the restaurant's charm. That charm does not quite extend to the wine list, which looks like one from four decades ago. It's almost entirely drawn from Bordeaux, Burgundy and the Rhone, with very few bottles under $75. This seems to be taking the joke a little too far -- in 1971, you could still get cheap Bordeaux. I drank well, but I always spent more on it than I meant to, which is the kind of thing that can keep diners from coming back. For dessert there is a coconut cake that has little to do with France. Dense and rich in a homespun American style that some people will love and others will find too leaden, it followed Mr. Moore here from Commerce, where it was a big hit. Other members of the lineup you already know. The chocolate mousse is deliciously dark, though not as airy as it could be. The sugar crust on the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is burned to order. Both are overshadowed, though, by a peculiarly likable Pavlova. It is conceived as a tart, with a meringue crust and a whipped-cream topping; once it is sliced into a white wedge, bright yellow passion-fruit curd runs down its sides. Anna Pavlova would not recognize it, but she would have liked its sense of theater. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

The area is marked by a cluster of restaurants. Some have a washed-up feeling, as if they'd all been drifting along in Bedford's currents and had been stranded there. A few stand out in the landscape. In the fall, Cherry Point took a decisive turn into the second category when a new chef took over, but not everyone in the neighborhood seems to realize it yet. People still tumble in for happy hour, when servers whose hairstyles take a minute to adjust to will pour three-gulp martinis, manhattans and Rob Roys (due for a revival) in little Nick & Nora glasses for $8 each, and then after happy hour ends at 7 p.m. most of the crowd generally drifts out to find somewhere else for dinner. The space, with its old-timey wainscoting and its central bar, is easy to mistake for a tavern. Let's say you were among those who stayed put. Contemporaneously with your cocktail, you worked on a few smoked olives, green and warm; swirled a few of the golden, bite-size pig's head croquettes in a pale-pinkish ketchup made from pears; and became curious about what else this kitchen was up to. At one point you noticed that the dining room suddenly smelled like an herb garden in August, and a minute later Belon oysters on a nest of smoking rosemary branches sailed out of the kitchen opening that lights up the back of the restaurant. You ordered a plate of your own because you wanted to know how the warm oysters would taste under their yellow blankets of smoked rosemary hollandaise. From a short list of charcuterie you chose the squab and pork terrine, with a few prunes embedded into the pink and pleasingly coarse-grained slab. You spread this on toast with creamy whole-grain mustard, apricot-ginger mostarda or some of the pear ketchup, all of them made on the premises, like the pearl onions pickled in beer and the terrine itself. And you might have thought: If these are just the snacks, what is the food going to be like when this kitchen gets down to business? Whatever happens, odds are there will be meat on the table. Cherry Point opened in 2016, taking over what had been a Polish restaurant called Cinamoon. The charcuterie was made on site from the start, but the menu swerved in a more meat-focused and English-leaning direction last fall when Ed Szymanski was hired as the chef. This might have been predicted, if not from Mr. Szymanski's English upbringing and British citizenship, then from his work history. He has cooked at the Beatrice Inn , where various beasts of air and land are posed on silver platters for their roles in a fall-of-Rome spectacle; the Spotted Pig , in the days when it was still known for burgers basted in Roquefort and toasts buried under chopped chicken livers; and Pitt Cue , a London outpost of the modern, urbanized barbecue genre. For a panoramic tour of Mr. Szymanski's accumulated meat wisdom, you could call two days ahead and reserve a game-and-beef dinner, $65 for at least four courses along the lines of grilled tongue on watercress. The everyday menu, though, is not exactly made up of grain bowls. On any given night, you can drop in and marvel at the fried lamb ribs, their apple glaze augmented by broken coriander and fennel seeds and raw curls of shallot. The quail will be butterflied, grilled over charcoal and served on toast, with pickled prunes above it and a reduction swirled with port below. The duck breast will be seared down until the skin is a thin brown sheet next to pink and juicy meat. This is served with roasted, pur\u00e9ed celery root and br\u00fbl\u00e9ed pears. The plates are marked by a refinement and moderation that is not always achieved by other chefs in the guts-and-fat school of cookery. A creamy pheasant, leek and bacon pie is sealed inside a cast-iron pot by a beauty of a suet crust -- lacquered, scored in a starburst and very tender. Care is even lavished on the grilled rib-eye for two, which comes to the table with neatly sawed lengths of bone marrow under a tidy crust of parsley, chives, pickle shallots and buttered bread crumbs. Mr. Szymanski does not gesture toward fish and vegetables very often, but when he does he generally musters some conviction. True, the roasted pumpkin mash with toasted hazelnuts and fresh cheese has an obligatory air, as does the grilled bread with labneh and honey. But the smoked whitefish salad, with caramelized shallots and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and a side of saltines, is more energetic than you might guess. Grilled flatbread looks out of place on this menu, but it is a fine canvas for roasted hens-of-the-woods and other wild mushrooms that are fleshy and flavorful enough to get noticed on their own. Skate, a main course, comes with smoked German butterball potatoes and a soaring, fino sherry-laced beurre blanc. The salad of radicchio and other bitter lettuces is as crisp and refreshing as any plate of leaves can be in February. It is also a very good thing to eat with steak, as it happens. Anyone who has not caught on to the English theme so far will get a last chance with the dessert menu, which offers treacle tart, sticky toffee pudding, a posset and three cheeses, all from England. The treacle tart was dry when I had it. The sticky toffee pudding was surprisingly but not unpleasantly cakelike. The posset, though, is a small miracle, an eggless custard of sugar, lemon juice and cream scented with Earl Grey tea, dressed up with Cara Cara orange wedges and a few Earl Grey meringues. There should be more possets around town. There should be possets galore. And by the way, there should be more wine lists like Cherry Point's. Assembled by Garret Smith, who owns the restaurant with Vincent Mazeau, it consistently favors obscure and surprising over familiar and dull. By the bottle, there are oddities such as apple wine and mead, but also a few things you might have heard of: a cremant d'Alsace from Dirler Cad\u00e9, a Sybille Kuntz riesling, an Olga Raffault chinon and a lean, exact pinot noir from Enderle & Moll. Only two bottles, both sparkling wines, are over $100, and most of the others are closer to $50. At these prices, you could just close your eyes and pick something, which is lucky because the servers, though charming and truly unpretentious, haven't fully internalized the list's ins and outs. It's one of the ways in which Cherry Point seems not to have caught up yet with how good it has become. If you treat it like a bar, you might not notice. But if you eat the way I did, ordering half the menu at a time, you could be putting more stress on the infrastructure than it can handle. You might be in for a very slow meal. But it will also be a very good meal. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

To be fair, this was not the original plan at Shelsky's Brooklyn Bagels , either. The idea was to serve pork roll, egg and cheese sandwiches on a kaiser roll or one of the bakery's palm-size, hand-rolled bagels. Peter Shelsky, the bakery's owner, grew up in Manhattan, but he knew that some good things come from New Jersey, particularly pork roll, which he wanted to sell in the mornings. Also known as Taylor ham, pork roll is a cured, smoked and cooked meat product that has the tightly pebbled appearance of engineered stone, like a Corian countertop made of flesh. Pressing sliced pork roll on a hot griddle intensifies its saltiness while giving it a hint of a crust that contrasts attractively with the slightly spongy interior. Griddled pork roll, combined with a cooked egg and a slice of American cheese, is eaten across New Jersey as a breakfast sandwich. Usually it is found on a kaiser roll. Sometimes it is seen on a bagel. But some Shelsky's customers requested it on a freshly baked bialy, and others followed, and now pork roll sandwiches made on bialys are nearly as popular as the ones made on rolls, with bagels a distant third. The bialy might have been custom-made for the job, particularly the ones at Shelsky's, which are baked to a darker brown, their thumbprint divots filled with a more robustly caramelized onion confit, than garden-variety bialys. Both traits are intensified if you have the bialy thoroughly toasted, as the person behind the counter will almost certainly recommend.

They're easy to find these days, as consumers from around the globe fire off countless raves and pans about every known restaurant, cafe, chili counter, falafel cart and cr\u00eaperie, not to mention post offices and jails. These mash notes and spitballs rain down endlessly not just from traditional review sites like TripAdvisor and Yelp (171 million reviews at last count) and retailers like Amazon, but also from Facebook and Google, those all-purpose giants. Everybody's a critic, right? I happen to get paid for criticism, and I would like to criticize that old platitude right out the window: No, everybody is not a critic. What most of you are doing out there, online and in three dimensions, is complaining. When we complain, we experience something that we don't like and we say something about it. A critic doesn't write about his own dissatisfaction, or doesn't just do that. A critic has to poke his head out of his turtle shell, look around and gesture, with stubby legs, toward the sources of dissatisfaction. Done perceptively, with analytic thinking and an effort to connect the dots between this experience and others, this can be the beginning of a value system that readers might share, or reject, or at least attempt to understand. Complaining is as easy as breathing. Writing criticism is a real pain. That was a complaint, by the way. But criticism and complaint are closely related enough for me to know that there's a lot of complaining going on, and that most of the complaints aren't having any effect at all. This may not be the point. People who study complaints divide them into two categories, instrumental and expressive. An instrumental complaint is \"directed toward a specific target and intended to bring about a specific outcome,\" according to Robin Kowalski, a professor of psychology at Clemson University who has studied the social functions of complaining. Calling a restaurant's owner the next day to say that you waited an hour for dessert and don't intend to come back is an instrumental complaint. Texting a friend to say the polar vortex is making your skin peel off is an expressive complaint. We call expressive complaints venting, kvetching, griping or a number of other names. It's important to know which of the two types of complaint is right for you before opening the first can of invective. Venting has its uses. In one study, Dr. Kowalski and some colleagues showed that when we are asked to put our feelings of dissatisfaction with somebody into writing, our \"positive affect\" -- good feelings, basically -- will rise about 15 minutes later, after an initial downswing. In the same way, if a meal lets you down, taking a pair of pliers and a blowtorch to the restaurant on Yelp might give you a brief lift. But once the rush of having gotten it off your chest is gone, you'd realize nothing has changed. You're still out the price of dinner, and you won't find out whether your grievance has reached the right ears unless somebody at the restaurant responds. Some owners make a point of scouring review sites so they can do just that. Others use the review's date and details to identify and get in touch with the kvetcher. But there are more direct ways to get your gripe acknowledged than scrawling it on the walls of the internet. \"If there's something that's really bothering you, the ultimate benefits are going to come from targeted complaining ,\" Dr. Kowalski said. \"Telling the person or restaurant.\" I know, I know. This is the part I avoid, too, by saving all my criticisms for my reviews. I hate confrontations, I run from them, I'd rather pay the check, even with my own money, and walk out never to return. But let's say you want something out of your complaint. Maybe you just want a rib-eye that's still rare instead of the overdone paving stone you were served. Or you have a reason for wanting an item taken off your bill. Or (and I think this is what most people are looking for when they complain) you just want somebody to look you in the eye and say: \"So sorry about that. Is there anything we can do to make it right?\" Whatever you want, you're more likely to get it if you have a word with a manager either before you leave or later on. As a side benefit, you'll be helping the restaurant, too; when somebody is un happy at the end of a meal, almost any manager or restaurateur wants to know. \"We actually really welcome complaints,\" said Melinda Shopsin, a film producer who cooks and waits tables at Shopsin's, her family's restaurant on the Lower East Side. This may come as a surprise to anyone who has heard the numerous accounts of customers' being tossed out of Shopsin's for any number of arcane infractions. And yet, Ms. Shopsin says that when her mother was still alive, she would ask what was wrong when she saw an unfinished plate, and then take a bite to see for herself. At other restaurants, this exploratory bite may happen backstage, in the kitchen. If you're going to make an instrumental complaint, though, you still need to figure out whether the reasons you're unhappy are subjective or objective. Did Medieval Times undercook the chicken, or do you just not like eating with your hands? Even if you're pretty sure the problem is objective, it can be useful to pretend it's subjective, for the sake of diplomacy. The chef John Tesar recalls a night, soon after he'd opened his Knife steakhouse in Dallas, when he got into an argument with a customer about the weight of a steak -- an objective complaint if ever there was one. \"We had a 33-ounce rib-eye for two,\" Mr. Tesar said. One customer who ordered it wasn't convinced and began \"screaming,\" according to Mr. Tesar: \"\u2018This steak is too small! This isn't enough to feed all of us!'\" He went to the table, and the hostilities quickly escalated, he said, until \"I went into the kitchen, got a scale, grabbed the steak, weighed it in front of her, and said, \u2018It's 36 ounces!'\" The story ends happily, with the two combatants meeting again at a dinner party some time later and getting along swimmingly. \"We both realized how absurd and insecure we were being,\" he said. All this might have been avoided if the complaint had been cast subjectively: \"That steak looks smaller than we expected. Are you sure it's the one we ordered?\" Subjective complaints are still important data for restaurants. If one person doesn't like the new hot-dog lasagna, it's an aberration. If 15 people don't like it, the recipe probably needs to go back to the workshop. The chef or owner needs to know this, but also needs to hear it in terms that won't lead to a screaming match in the dining room . Perhaps you have seen Gordon Ramsay critique another chef's cooking on television? Don't do it like that. In general, the more specific your complaint, the more likely it is to be understood. The worst, most useless and potentially dangerous complaints are broad, sweeping condemnations. \"There is complaining that makes you think about what you're doing, and there is complaining where everybody thinks they're entitled to say anything,\" said Rita Sodi, the chef and owner of the Tuscan restaurant I Sodi in Manhattan. \"Saying, \u2018This is terrible' is not complaining. That is being rude. It's like, \u2018You're ugly.' It's telling me that I'm ugly. It's personal. It's my food.\" Even when the person you're grousing to did not cook your pasta personally, you should proceed gently, in nonconfrontational terms. It may be helpful to imagine that you are speaking with an air traffic controller trying to land 20 jets during a snowstorm; you would try very hard not to add to the overall stress level in the tower, even if your child was on one of those jets. \"If you can be patient, open and polite, that's really helpful,\" Ms. Shopsin said. \"The more collaborative and open you can be -- \u2018Excuse me, I'm sorry' -- even though it's not your fault that it got messed up. People have to understand that sometimes to fix a mistake is not easy.\" And sometimes, a restaurant can make customers happy by changing something that isn't a mistake at all. Occasionally, diners at Shopsin's who had ordered migas complained about finding cilantro in the dish. Initially, the response would be that migas are supposed to have cilantro. Which may be true, but perhaps wasn't the point. Now, Ms. Shopsin asks customers whether they like cilantro. If the answer is no, there won't be any in their food, even if, strictly speaking, it belongs there. \"Complaints do help change things,\" she said.

A chocolate-colored, bittersweet agglomeration of two dozen or so ingredients, it comes, like most of the city's Mexican immigrants, from the state of Puebla. Typically simmered with chicken, mole poblano was a staple of takeout joints and lunch counters and restaurants before anyone took Mexican food in New York seriously. All the other moles -- Oaxaca's mole verde, say, which gets its green color from pumpkin seeds, tomatillos and fresh herbs -- were about as rare as a mandarin duck in Central Park. In recent years, as these once-exotic species have become regular features of the menus at Cosme , Empell\u00f3n , Claro and other restaurants, mole poblano has become something like the pigeon of Mexican sauces, too common and familiar to be worth noticing. If you share this low view of mole poblano, you owe it to yourself to have the one at Casa Enrique . The chef, Cosme Aguilar, calls it mole de Piaxtla, after the Pueblan town where his father grew up, and as a reminder that there is not just one mole poblano but many. Some have apple in addition to raisins. Some are thickened with animal crackers. Mr. Aguilar remembers that in his childhood home, plantains were allowed to hang until they were black before they could be pounded into mole. Maybe this explains the particular sweetness of Casa Enrique's version, which is not the candy-bar sweetness of some. It's deep and complicated. The character of this mole de Piaxtla unfurls as you eat, whether the sauce has been soaked into enchiladas filled with chicken or simply pooled on a plate over and under a quartered chicken and yellow rice cooked with peas. Mr. Aguilar has been frying, blending and stirring mole de Piaxtla since Casa Enrique opened in 2012, just off Vernon Boulevard, in Long Island City, Queens. In fact, he has barely changed his menu since our Hungry City critic, Ligaya Mishan, reviewed it the next year. Mr. Aguilar says he is emulating the restaurants he likes best in Mexico, ones whose kitchens make the same dishes year in and year out. Whether despite this or because of it, the restaurant seems to have improved in subtle ways. Acoustic panels tacked to the ceiling make conversation easier. Servers, always welcoming, have become experts at anticipating the meal's ebb and flow. They'll step in just when you're ready for a fresh drink, maybe a margarita with some tamarind this time to offset the raw-sugar syrup. They'll gauge the precise moment when you're ready to have dinner plates cleared to make room for dessert. Or they'll break away from your table just long enough to join in a full-throated singing of \"Happy Birthday\" around a slice of tres leches cake with a candle stuck in it on the other side of the room. This may happen three or four times a night, probably not because Casa Enrique looks particularly festive -- from floor to ceiling, it's done almost entirely in white -- but, I'd guess, because regulars know it regularly outperforms any number of other restaurants that might seem to be more special on the surface but aren't, really. Also, the tres leches cake, if not as soggy with condensed milk as it could be, is still pretty good, though I think the flan is almost mandatory, and it, too, is a perfectly credible birthday-candle holder. Although the guacamole is freshly mashed and pleasingly minimalist, I tend to skip it as long as the people I'm with don't mind. Instead I'll head straight for the two-bite sopecitos topped with refried beans and loose chorizo, or the albondigas in cumin-laced chipotle sauce, each of the three meatballs stuffed with hard-cooked eggs. The best Mexican seafood dishes often come from restaurants that specialize in them. Mr. Aguilar, though, seems equally at home with fish and meat. The market fish offered as a main course -- lately a black sea bass -- has always been seared to a crisp on the skin side. Still, in all these years I've never been convinced that the corn under it compares to the best street-corner esquites, or that it and the fish really add up to a whole dish. The seafood appetizers, on the other hand, are some of my favorite things at Casa Enrique: the delicately fried oysters sitting in a mayonnaise that gets its tangerine color from ground chiles; the ceviche, freshly tossed with lime and herbs; the crab tostadas, loaded with a thin slice or two of Serrano chile, chopped tomato, leaves of cilantro, smooth avocado salsa and a spoonful of crab meat, pure and clean; and the shrimp cocktail, which gets its roundness and slight richness, I think, from orange soda, just the way you'd hope. Mr. Aguilar is not one of those chefs who set up masa factories in their basements. Casa Enrique's corn tortillas do not have the pretty floral aromas of Cosme's, or the sweet, focused corn flavor you taste in Claro's. But they are better than you'd find almost anywhere else in New York. They give a boost to the tacos, made with braised tongue or brisket; crumbled chorizo; or fried, battered fish, and they are especially delicious soaked in salsa verde and wrapped around roasted poblanos in cream to make enchiladas Do\u00f1a Blanca. And while Cosme's more modern approach has soaked up more media attention, I've encountered more bloops and wobbles eating there than I have exploring the far more traditional menu at Casa Enrique. It isn't necessarily the more interesting restaurant, but it's the one where I'm more confident that if I went there tonight, everything would taste exactly the way it was supposed to. The pozole will be dark and intense, though not especially spicy, with tender strands of pork in the broth and all the usual mix-ins waiting on the side. The pork ribs will be slowly braised, in the style of Chiapas, in a thick cooked salsa built on a foundation of guajillo chiles. These ribs are not to be confused with the baby back ribs, cooked in an even thicker, creamier pipian rojo, that sometimes turn up as a daily special. Best of all, perhaps, will be the chamorro de borrego, or lamb shank stewed with chickpeas; it will be very tender and very flavorful in its rough sauce of pulla chiles with crushed guaje seeds. The name of that sauce is huaxmole, or sometimes guaxmole, or even mole de guaje. Yes, it's a mole, and one that rarely flies as far north as New York City. At Casa Enrique, it has found a permanent perch. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

I could see this because the car and I were sharing a room on West 14th Street. The car was in the back and I was in the middle, sitting at one of the cafe tables near the stairs to the second floor, where there is a bar shaped like a wheel and a restaurant with a menu devised by Gregory Marchand, the chef of the Frenchie restaurants in Paris and London. The employees in all of these rooms work for the Union Square Hospitality Group , which I suppose means that Danny Meyer, the group's founder and one of the world's best-known restaurateurs, is now also in the business of polishing automobiles. The whole operation is called Intersect by Lexus , which gives you a good idea who made the car and was paying to keep it shiny and free of dust. Intersect by Lexus is one of those modern places where brands, instead of asking you to buy one of their products then and there, instead try to make you feel the kinds of emotions about the brand that may lead to a sale later on. This is a job formerly performed by advertisements. In fact, Lexus used to publish a print magazine and mail it to its customers, back when that seemed like a good way to persuade people to have emotions about a car. Now we live in the age of the \"branded experience.\" A toilet-paper manufacturer will send you a wheeled toilet on demand . A mattress company will encourage you to sleep inside a roaming \"napmobile.\" Makers of a crunchy orange snack open restaurants, lasting just a few days , where chefs put the crunchy orange snack into meatballs, tacos, cheesecakes and everything else. You cannot get Anne Burrell to sprinkle a Lexus over the top of your mac and cheese, however, and not just because the cheapest one costs $33,000 more than a bag of crunchy orange snacks. Intersect by Lexus takes a different approach, closer to that of A/D/O , a \"creative hub\" in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, owned by the car brand Mini. A/D/O offers temporary exhibitions, talks, performances, work spaces for designers and a sun-filled, roomy Scandinavian cafe whose kitchen was, for a time, overseen by the chef Fredrik Berselius and the restaurateur Claus Meyer . (Mr. Berselius is no longer involved.) When I ate at the cafe, shortly after A/D/O opened, the food barely dented my consciousness, although I remember thinking that if I worked nearby I probably would drop in for lunch or a cortado. In the same way, if I find myself in the meatpacking district by day, I might join the Wi-Fi philosophers who occupy the spindle-backed chairs downstairs at Intersect, just so I could get a maple-bacon scone, a recipe imported from Frenchie to Go on the Rue du Nil in Paris. On the other hand, I'd go well out of my way to eat upstairs at Intersect again. It's not a restaurant in three dimensions -- the service, while skilled, is a bit anonymous, and the interior is a hodgepodge of expensive, subtle design and bric-a-brac that might have been ordered from a catalog. But the food is some of the most engaging I've come across in the past few months, and it will go away after the end of March, when Mr. Marchand's menu will be replaced by one devised by another chef from somewhere else in the world, chosen by representatives from Union Square Hospitality Group and Lexus. (A formal review, with stars, would be obsolete almost as soon as it was published.) I've never made it to Frenchie or its branch in London. Many New York chefs have, however, and working my way through Mr. Marchand's dishes at Intersect helped me understand what other restaurants around town have been trying to imitate: the charred leaves, the cooked grains, the gently swirling patterns that suggest the chef has been plating food on a turntable. Grilled baby leek greens angled out around a pile of barley topped with what looked like a deviled egg. It was, in fact, a smoked and lemon-spiked yolk plopped in the center of some \"whites\" made of Parmesan sabayon. Spice and crunch came from puffed barley dusted with piment d'Espelette. It was just tricky enough, this dish. And I loved the way a caraway brioche, pickled mustard seeds and cucumbers completed the deli allusions begun by a foie gras terrine with layers of soft, smoky pastrami. There was a very welcome spin on skate grenobloise in which the fish was replaced by creamy white halibut under a golden bread-crumb crust; sea beans extended the briny flavor of capers in the brown butter sauce. And if this all sounds a bit cerebral, the big, pillowy, pan-seared gnocchi with fried sweetbreads and veal-glazed mushrooms proved that Mr. Marchand knows the appeal of animal instincts. What to make of those few dishes that did not come together -- the pebbles of cauliflower under a layer of seeds and nuts that looked as if it had spilled from a bird feeder, or the lukewarm chocolate mousse at the bottom of a deep bowl? Was the problem Mr. Marchand's recipes? The way the Union Square Hospitality kitchen crew, led by Nickolas Martinez, had carried them out? The local terroir? Mr. Martinez and Dylan Shipsey, the general manager, say they want customers to feel as if they are walking into Frenchie in Paris. Intersect does not have the premodern limestone wall and ceiling timbers of the Rue du Nil, but Mr. Marchand tried to sprinkle some Right Bank pixie dust on West 14th Street by choosing the plates and bowls, consulting on flower arrangements and sharing his Spotify playlists. Maybe those things help. But the dining room, by the design firm Wonderwall , mostly looks like money to me, apart from the shelves half-filled with coffee-table books, black crow figurines and other eerily generic knickknacks. At least somebody had the good sense to keep the car downstairs, by the restrooms, before it was rolled out last weekend to make room for another temporary exhibition. In what may not be a good sign for Lexus, nobody paid much attention to it when I was there, but somebody was always marveling about the toilets, the Japanese kind that seem to know exactly what you are going to do before you do. The chef-in-residence conceit is not unique to Intersect. On Mulberry Street, Chefs Club also turns its permanent kitchen crew over to somebody else's menu; a new restaurant in Houston, the Decatur Bar & Popup Factory , gives its entire space to prospective restaurateurs for three months at a time so they can test-drive their ideas before going out on their own. The chefs of Contra , in Manhattan, and other restaurants sometimes turn over the menu to friends of theirs for a night or two. The most ambitious experiment in this vein may be In Situ , the restaurant inside the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art that on any given day faithfully reproduces a dozen or so dishes that are strongly identified with other restaurants around the world. To understand the appeal for chefs of these pop-ups and residencies, think about the Instagram posts, the email-address caches, the preview news items, even the occasional reviews they generate. For a few months' or even a few nights' work, a restaurant can refresh its aura of newness and relevance. In an era that feeds on novelty, chefs who just keep plugging along can seem older than they really are. The events make the host restaurant look cooler, too. (It's been a while since Union Square Hospitality Group hired a chef who got menu analysts chattering the way Mr. Marchand does.) And of course, people who go to these dinners can boast about them on social media. It's a big, beautiful marketing ecosystem in which everybody from predators to bottom feeders gets to believe they're at the top of the food chain.

It's as if the past 15 years in food never happened. The menu seems to be stuck in some time between 1994, when Thomas Keller bought the French Laundry, and 2004, when he opened Per Se with a young Jonathan Benno leading the kitchen. The restaurant will probably be a tough sell to those diners who expect all restaurants to fall on a continuum between Noma and the Salt Bae place . But I prefer it to any number of newer, self-consciously modern restaurants, some of which are so determined to be of the moment that they might as well have a time stamp. Benno is not trying to be contemporary. It's trying to be delicious. And it is, from start to finish, almost without exception. Benno is the third of three dining operations that Mr. Benno opened last year in the Evelyn Hotel , on East 27th Street. It is the one where the prices, and presumably the stakes, are highest. We know it is a statement restaurant because Mr. Benno has put his name on it, for the first time in his career. Whatever the statement is, it is not forward-looking. Most of the statement is in French (barigoule, mousseline, t\u00eate de veau, b\u00e9arnaise), a significant part is in Italian (carnaroli risotto, garganelli verde, pecorino ginepro) and not one word is in Danish or Mandarin. The statement has a lot to say on the topics of stocks and pur\u00e9es and accurate chopping and patient skimming; it is entirely silent on the subjects of fermented vegetables, or foraging, or immigration, or food deserts, or hashtags. The statement is delivered in a windowless hotel dining room to people sitting comfortably on black-leather chairs or velvet banquettes the color of a pinot noir from the Loire Valley. It takes the form of a fixed number of courses, three or four or five, your choice. One will be dessert and one a main course. None of them is a small plate meant for sharing. None is a large-format plate either, unless you count the veal sirloin chop that arrives on a silver platter in slices that are as pink and delicately shaded as the cheek on any blushing young aristocrat Fragonard ever painted. The presentations are not overly dramatic. They can be disarmingly modest, like the cold slice of fish terrine that appeared before the appetizers one night looking pale and somewhat lost. I barely noticed it. Then I tasted fennel and other bouillabaisse flavors and -- excuse me, what was your name again? -- I started to pay attention. It is not news that the liquid yolk of an egg tastes good trickled over baby leeks, fingerlings, black-truffle froth and pioppini mushrooms the size of shirt buttons. But just how good it is makes an interesting item. Lamb saddle, with grill marks that could come from a steakhouse, is served with fairytale eggplant and Thumbelina carrots. Each vegetable in this miniature garden is planted in a pur\u00e9e or a reduced essence of itself. Each is very good, and the carrots are fantastic. Alongside them sits lamb breast that has been pressed into a rich little brick coated in bread crumbs. One corner of this brick sits in a dark-green spread that tastes like gremolata. Not one combination of flavors on this plate is original, and it doesn't matter at all. The Italian food that Mr. Benno made at his last restaurant, Lincoln Ristorante , could be impressive, but I sometimes had the sense that he was cooking from the outside in, trying to unlock the flavors of Italy through process and method. The results didn't always match the evident effort. I still got a bit of that feeling from his food at Leonelli Taberna , in the back of the Evelyn lobby. It's supposed to be the hotel's casual Italian restaurant, and it would be if you didn't sometimes catch the food trying to relax. Only a lasagna with green noodles below a dark field of browned b\u00e9chamel seemed completely comfortable with itself. (On the streetside end of the hotel is a pastry shop and bakery selling two-foot-long flatbreads called focaccia that have more in common with Roman pizza al taglio.) The cooking at Benno, overseen by Justin Skribner, the chef de cuisine, doesn't appear to be plagued by a similar anxiety. The French ideas, like a drum of pig's trotter under a fried quail egg with flageolets and other beans, or the darkly seared duck breast with melting foie gras and a savory triangle of duck leg, dates and pistachios in brik pastry, have an easy inevitability. Pasta is unlikely to become the thing Benno is known for. Still, when the kitchen stretches to Italy, nice things happen. Lobster fra diavolo, with the bent shells called lumache, is a tribute to an American pop hit made over, in the Thomas Keller tradition, with maximum clarity and precision. Spaghetti made with grano arso, or burned-wheat flour, tasted pleasantly toasted rather than incinerated as it soaked up the liquor of tiny hard-shell clams and a soft mass of very fresh sea urchin roe. Technique never overplayed its hand in these dishes. The only time it came up short was when a drum of steelhead salmon poached in olive oil arrived slightly mushy and underdone. A week later, the fish was cooked more successfully. The scope of the Evelyn's dining operation is big enough to support a full-time baker (Lisa Kalemkiarian, responsible for Benno's needle-tipped mini-baguettes, among other items) and pastry chef (Lindsey Bittner, whose desserts include a rosemary flan with candied cranberries that I ordered every time I went, so I could watch other people try it for the first time). You couldn't call the wine list dated, with its unwashed, uncombed natural types among other groomed, sedate numbers, and some fine values between $50 and $75 tiptoeing among the super-Tuscans and 2005 Bordeaux. All this should persuade some skeptics to give Benno a try. The restaurant's greatest challenge is that the food seems to come from an era that's too old to seem fresh but too recent to feel nostalgic about. When pop music is that age, we cringe. When buildings are that age, we knock them down before they can be landmarked. But sometimes one chef cooking what he believes is better than 10 chefs cooking what somebody else believes.

Its opening, in 2003, may have marked Manhattan's capitulation to a retail landscape ruled by chains rather than independent, homegrown businesses. For diners, the mall is best known for its eating-and-drinking zone named, with matchless pretentiousness, the Restaurant Collection. This brought us Per Se and Masa , which overnight made the city's other high-end restaurants seem as affordable as Veselka . It was the start of a new class of restaurants where dinner would be priced like a luxury good, with entry-level meals that today cost $300 or more. Much more, in Masa's case. The purpose of this exclusivity was to signal to people with money to spend that they would be comfortable spending it in the Shops at Columbus Circle. For the same reason, businesses that were too far down-market were not welcome as tenants. This is why there's a Whole Foods Market but not a Family Dollar. So those of us who follow David Chang's mind along its switchbacks and cul-de-sacs have to wonder if he was being subversive when he decided to install Bang Bar , which is essentially a shawarma stand, on the mall's third floor. Mr. Chang is a close observer of the ways society assigns high status to the food of some cultures and devalues the cooking of others. One of his greatest hits is a riff about New Yorkers who complain about $17 bowls of ramen while paying $30 for spaghetti. If he has a routine about vertical rotisseries I've never heard it, but surely he is alive to the associations they conjure, from Greek diners to taco trucks to the Halal Guys carts parked near Columbus Circle. If anybody grasps the cultural implications of bringing $6 street-meat sandwiches indoors where they can perfume the air breathed by consumers of Pink shirts and Floga furs, it is Mr. Chang. Bang Bar might make more sense as a provocation than a business concern. It begins serving at 8:30 a.m. and closes when the food is gone, usually by 1 or 2 p.m. In the weeks after its opening, on Halloween, the lines were worthy of the Department of Motor Vehicles. Employees tried to appease the horde by handing out off-the-menu snacks, like rice porridge with fermented shiitakes, and asking whimsical survey questions. (\"Do you keep peanut butter in the fridge?\") After Mr. Chang opened a Momofuku Noodle Bar in the space next door, Bang Bar's crowds grew somewhat more manageable, and when I showed up for breakfast at the end of December, there was no line at all. Maybe Deutsche Bank employees will keep Bang Bar's early shift afloat, but right now its success seems to hinge on the lunch rush. There are two rotisseries. After 11 a.m., one spit is buried deep inside a missile of dark chicken marinated with a yakitori-style glaze. The other is at the center of a red, dripping, gochujang-rubbed tower of pork. Ideally, whichever meat you choose will have built up a dark outer bark that can be lopped off with a few knife strokes and stacked on to a disc of griddled flatbread. The bread, thicker than a tortilla and less oily than a roti, will be rolled tight, like a cigarette, then bent in half, with both open ends at the top. This is called, in Bang Bar parlance, a U. The chicken or pork can also be piled over a bowl of rice, but the bread is really very good. A close relative of the flatbread Mr. Chang's crew originated at Majordomo in Los Angeles, it is perceptibly tangy and salted, without being salty. A couple of condiments -- including habanero salsa and the brick-red Ssam Sauce used, in various iterations, to italicize Noodle Bar's pork buns and a hundred other creations in Mr. Chang's Momofuku restaurant group -- are kept out on a counter alongside the moist towelettes. But they're hard to apply once a U has been rolled. What I did want was a spoonful or two of raw white onions, some chopped cucumber, maybe parsley or cilantro -- the kind of simple salad that is almost always lobbed into a shawarma or a doner kebab. Both the chicken and pork are slightly sweet, and could use a lift. The lunch menu also has two dips -- a darkly fascinating, spicy eggplant spread, or whipped chickpeas whose sharp, pecorino-like flavor betrays the presence of Hozon, the fermented chickpea paste invented in a Momofuku laboratory. They are alluring enough, but the real reason to order them is the bread, puffier and softer than the one that wraps the U. A smaller version of this, maybe five inches across, is folded in half like a taco to make a \"mini,\" which replaces the U at breakfast. It is no great shock that this bread works nicely with smoked salmon and scallion cream cheese blended with just enough soy sauce to make it arguably Asian. It is more flavorful than a bagel and better at holding everything together. But it is somewhat surprising how delicious a freshly griddled mini is with caper-scallion cream cheese, salted cucumber, tomato and fresh dill inside. The whole thing tastes alive in a way that a bagel with a schmear of veggie cream cheese never will. I've saved the breakfast mini with mortadella for last, although it's been the subject of the most rapt online attention. Building logs of mortadella layered with lardo and roasting them on spits is exactly the sort of thing the Momofuku group was put on this earth to do. I am glad this revolving meat torpedo exists. I respect Bang Bar's cooks -- this collaborative effort has no chef, Mr. Chang said in a phone interview -- for realizing that the proper garnish for caramelized mortadella shavings is a slice of yellow American cheese and hot mustard. I appreciate the respect the sandwich pays to both fried baloney and Taylor Ham. And if I were in the habit of turning up at Columbus Circle with a hangover in the mornings, I would probably become a regular consumer of mortadella minis with Ssam Sauce. With a clear head and stomach, though, the saltiness can be a little too bracing. At either meal, Bang Bar offers a cinnamon roll modeled on the kkwabaegi, the twisted Korean doughnut stick. It is baked rather than fried, making it a rare example of a Momofuku dish that contains less fat than its inspiration. It is a fine pastry to have with Bang Bar's Vietnamese coffee, even after you learn that the cream cheese icing contains fermented chickpeas. By the way, bang, or bbang or ppang, depending on how you like your Korean words transliterated, means bread. So this shawarma joint inside a mall is officially a bread bar, which makes sense given how pleasant the bread is. Still, I can't help wondering how the people in charge of the Restaurant Collection felt about welcoming a place called Bang Bar.

Bulgogi folded into tortillas has been handed out through the window of a roving truck . Smoked kimchi has been draped over pulled pork between halves of a cheese-glazed doughnut to make an outdoor food-stall sandwich called the Chonut . Hwe, raw fish eaten with condiments that typically spread across an entire table, has been streamlined to one or two bites in a tasting menu administered by servers in sci-fi tunics. The pork belly dish bo ssam has been reimagined as a whole roasted pork shoulder that a gang of hungry people could use in a bonding ritual involving heads of lettuce, a platter of oysters and a pair of tongs. More often than not, the audience for these items is young. Youth, in fact, has been a key part of the story of how kimchi and other dishes spread from immigrants' kitchens to the Instagram feeds of diners without a single Korean ancestor. You might get a Chonut at Smorgasburg with your roommate, take down a bo ssam at Momofuku Ssam Bar with your friends from college and sit at Atomix's U-shaped counter to celebrate your first anniversary. Hwaban , which opened in Chelsea in August, is something different. It's the modern Korean restaurant where you'd take your mother. The dining room is spare, sleek and uncontroversial. The brick walls have a recent coat of white paint, and there is plenty of light by which to read the menus. The banquettes and benches have gentle curves and soothing neutral colors. The only vaguely menacing items in sight are the canteloupe-size eyeballs hanging on the walls, but they turn out to be high-tech speakers, and the cocktail jazz they play never rises above a murmur. Just inside the front door is a lattice of shelves holding simple, geometric bowls and teaware. These give Hwaban the look of a cloistered Parisian salon de th\u00e9, which it resembles in other ways as well. Exceptional green tea from South Korea is brewed along with tisanes -- made from mulberry leaves, mistletoe stems or dried wild pears -- that Korean mothers brew in winter for sneezing and sniffling children. And while some restaurants are saving money by doing without pastry chefs, Hwaban needs two of them to keep up with its obsession with Western-style sweets. One, Ahram Song, is a buttercream specialist who tints and shapes frosting into botanically detailed flower arrangements decorating chocolate or honey-pecan cakes. Another, Lauren Kim, makes the fleecy cheesecake that is carved into slivers the length of a dinner plate; pretty, well-tailored French numbers like a passion-fruit Pavlova or a drum of white cake filled with fresh strawberries and frosted with whipped cream; and the cookies and toffees that are sold by the box, for takeout. The illusion that you've wandered into a tearoom somewhere on the Right Bank is extended by the drinks list, which has only two Korean sojus and a handful of Japanese sakes but several pages of wines from France. The rest of the menu is unmistakably Korean, and very often it is based on Korean family cooking. \"This is my mother's recipe,\" Mihyun Han, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Key Kim, will say on one of her frequent circuits around the tables. She said it one night about the shaggy white meatball of chicken, tofu and mushrooms -- the menu calls it a dumpling -- sitting in a warm and transfixing soy-milk broth. Another time, she was talking about what she calls \"snowy bibimbap,\" a gentle, agreeable wintertime variation on the classic rice dish made with strands of mung bean jelly and shaved burdock, bellflower root, and other vegetables in shades of ivory, cream and bone. The chef, Woong Jang, does very fine work in white. One of Hwaban's most luxurious dishes is a length of king crab leg with spinach and a poached egg, all surrounded in a rich pine-nut sauce the color of hotel sheets. Like the Manhattan restaurants Atomix and Jungsik , Hwaban de-emphasizes the sweeter and spicier side of the Korean palate so other flavors can come through. Coins of poached pollock roe are sliced over a block of soft tofu in a clear, subtle dried-seafood broth. Soy-braised abalone is served in an anchovy broth that is, if not exactly subtle, at least soft-spoken. One of two pork belly dishes on the menu involves ssamjang, the potent soy-chile paste now sold in supermarkets throughout the land, but the other does not. In that one, you eat a slice of simmered pork belly together with a pickled mushroom and a square of cabbage kimchi. There is, of course, a sharp little kick to the spicy fish stew known as maeun-tang, and a fair amount of chile paste in the daktori-tang , a spin on the classic braised chicken and vegetable dish, both of which Mr. Jang makes very well. But there is also the surprise of tasting ginger and carrots along with the chiles in a bright orange sauce for seared salmon. Ms. Han and Mr. Kim also own Kosaka , a chiaroscuro lair for omakase sushi on West 13th Street. I was a little put off by how active the servers were there; just as I was focusing on the piece of fish in front of me, somebody would dart in at one elbow or the other to ask how I was enjoying it all. The service style is similar at Hwaban, but it plays better there. A meal at Hwaban is also about three times less expensive, at $55 for an appetizer and two main courses. The mains are served at the same time, which Ms. Han says is her attempt to reproduce the abundance of Korean family tables like her mother's. Her mother also gets credit for the two-sided fritters of minced shrimp pressed against zucchini coins on the short \u00e0 la carte menu. They're served with a crisp pair of fried shrimp and little cubes of jelly that melt into dipping sauce on contact with the warm fritters. The same soy jelly accompanies a kimchi-jeon that's topped with browned mozzarella -- in other words, a kimchi pizza. It would fit right in at Smorgasburg.

Maybe the people in charge have been taking management cues from Prime Minister Theresa May's government, which has approached its Brexit plan like a class of first graders trying to build a working jet airplane out of Lego pieces and a flying-squirrel sock puppet. Or maybe the mess back home has just sapped the restaurant's spirit. Whatever the cause, what was meant to be a cheerful gift from London has turned into the Bluebird of Unhappiness. Sir Terence Conran opened the original Bluebird in 1997 inside an Art Deco garage built on King's Road in Chelsea for the Bluebird Motor Company. It was one of his \"gastrodomes,\" those soaring complexes like Quaglino's and Bibendum that embedded restaurants within a busy hive of shops, cafes and bars. The gastrodomes' designs were talked about more often and more enthusiastically than their menus, which aimed for unthreatening familiarity. The current owners, D & D London , have managed to keep the London Bluebird in circulation by changing upholstery and chefs, but it is not at all clear why they or the Time Warner Center believed that a Bluebird clone would play in Manhattan in 2018. True, the retail shop has been dropped. But up front, next to the desk where the hosts have mastered the art of checking reservations without making eye contact, is a cafe-slash-wine bar. A glass case there serves as a temporary prison for aging pastries and tragic snacks. Beyond is a lounge followed by a bar, the centerpiece of which is an enormous plexiglass sculpture of a ponytailed woman's head that doubles as a shelf for weird liqueurs. Just before the ramp that descends to the main dining room is a console with two turntables which, a note on the website says menacingly, are operated on weekends by \"live DJs.\" At other times, the restaurant stages such events as a workshop in the art of making \"a seriously chic wreath.\" The poster-size menus drawn up by Nicolas Houlbert, the chef, cram so much copy onto a single page, and are organized so randomly, that they are best approached as if you were doing a word search, by unfocusing the eyes and waiting until the letters organize themselves into recognizable patterns. Look, here's butternut squash soup. This must be fluke -- no, fluke crudo. Long Island. Burrata. Long Island burrata? When you have finished the puzzle, please savor the warm feeling of accomplishment for a moment, because it goes away once the food arrives. The \"crispy shrimp\" have the limp, expired quality of tempura that's been doing laps all night at a conveyor-belt sushi place. Yellowfin tuna poke has been tossed onto a big, damp heap of unseasoned quinoa, which must be there to soak up any seasoning that accidentally attaches itself to the fish. At lunch there is a lobster Cobb salad with lettuce and round, red objects that are probably supposed to be tomatoes. Because you are in an English restaurant, you will be curious about the English food. Because you are in Bluebird London, you will regret this. A prawn and monkfish curry is presented on a thali with mango chutney, basmati rice and paratha, which run the gamut from unnecessarily sweet to ridiculously sweet. The fish half of fish and chips is golden and crisp on the ends but pale and soggy in the middle. At least the minted peas that come with it are crunchy. This is more than can be said for the potato chips that come with an order of beef tartare. They are pale, cobweb-colored, not fresh, and undercooked so they sag and fall apart beneath any amount of beef. The tartare, by the way, is seasoned with ketchup, which is not as wrong as you might think. If something comes with a pastry crust, exercise caution. On top of an allegedly Cornish chicken pie, sealing in dry chicken and mushrooms coated in grease that is trying its best to be mistaken for sauce, is a dome of puff pastry; it doesn't taste like butter or salt, but it is cooked. The thicker crust around a farmhouse pork terrine, served with a chill that brought out its Spammy qualities, is on its way to being cooked. The very, very thick football of crust encasing beef Wellington is cooked only on the surface; deep inside, where it meets the tenderloin, is a mass of wet, gluey dough. This costs $95 and will serve two people, both of whom had better like the taste of raw flour. All is not doom and gloom in the pastry department, though. The pull-apart cheese straws are thick, puffy and warm, bronzed on top with baked Montgomery's Cheddar. Most of the sweets are likable, particularly the cube of sticky toffee pudding and the wedge of Bakewell tart with a layer of orange marmalade between the frangipane and the pastry shell. The only real hazard on the dessert menu is the barely congealed Pimm's jelly at which somebody has hurled fistfuls of chopped cucumbers and strawberries. It's like a stray plate of salad that you might pick up at a party before you realized that somebody had dumped the warm dregs of a drink into it. The servers seemed eager to oblige, but gave the impression of struggling in the face of unseen enemies. One night, asked \"Still or sparkling?,\" I chose the sparkling water. My server began to walk away, then turned on his heel and said, \"I'm sorry, we're all out of sparkling.\" \"That's fine,\" I said. \"I'll just have the BrewDog I.P.A. instead.\" \"I apologize,\" he said. \"We don't have any draft beer.\" After the main course was cleared, I asked him for the Chocolate Bluebird. \"That is our signature dessert,\" he said. I nodded. I had read that this was a chocolate mousse inside a blue-chocolate shell in the shape of a vintage racecar once made by the Bluebird Motor Company. \"Unfortunately, we do not have it tonight,\" he said. His courtesy went a long way. Ultimately, though, I preferred the blunt approach that one of the bartenders took with one of my guests. Looking over the long list of old and new cocktails, she asked the bartender which he would recommend. \"If you want to drink something that tastes good,\" he said, \"I wouldn't order anything off our menu.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

Mr. Niccolini has operated the restaurant with Alex von Bidder since the mid-1990s, first at its original home in the Seagram Building and now, after a two-year hiatus, in a smaller berth on the other side of Park Avenue. Over that time, he has frequently been celebrated for his charm. Less frequently, he has been a defendant in civil and criminal actions arising from things he was accused of having done to women inside the restaurant. In 1991, one of his waitresses sued Mr. Niccolini and the Four Seasons , citing sexual harassment. She claimed that for more than three years he had repeatedly rubbed up against her, told her in vulgar terms about his sexual urges and called her \"slut,\" \"lesbian\" and other things. Mr. Niccolini denied the charges. In 2014, a former assistant manager filed suit against Mr. Niccolini , Mr. von Bidder and the Four Seasons, alleging discrimination. The ex-manager said that after she returned from a maternity leave, the restaurant made it difficult for her to pump breast milk during work hours and, about three months later, fired her and replaced her with a man. In a response filed with the court, the defendants denied the allegations. Both suits were settled under terms that have not been divulged. In 2015, Mr. Niccolini was arrested on a felony charge of sexual abuse. According to a prosecutor, he had attacked a woman at the Four Seasons bar \"with such force that he ripped her bra open and caused significant scratch marks on her back and bruising on her hip.\" After pleading guilty the following year to a reduced charge of misdemeanor assault, Mr. Niccolini was given a \"conditional discharge,\" avoiding jail. I know people who will never eat at the Four Seasons because they don't want to give Mr. Niccolini their money. I understand this. I also know people in the food media who think the Four Seasons should not get any coverage as long as Mr. Niccolini owns a piece of it. I understand this, too, but it's not my view. [Julian Niccolini has since been forced to resign from the restaurant.] Their stance rests, I think, on the idea that writing about powerful men who have been accused of abusing women amounts to condoning the abuse and helping the abusers stay in power. While it's true that media attention is often like oxygen to restaurants, critics have the power to tell a story other than the one the restaurant is pushing. Even when we're not writing a pan, a fair assessment often requires weaving shining threads with ugly ones. The ugliest threads at the Four Seasons happen to be ugly enough to make many people stay away. But there is beauty in the fabric, too. The Four Seasons has been a significant force in dining: a pioneer in championing American ingredients and wine; an innovator in bringing contemporary design into the restaurant world; a cultivator of an eclectic scene that treated political power, financial success and creative talent as coequal branches of a high society that was peculiar to New York. Most of this happened some time ago. In its last years in the Seagram Building, the Four Seasons had become a shabby but lovely museum of midcentury architecture and design, with martinis that I didn't mind overpaying for and food that I did. I was curious about its new incarnation, which opened in August, and curiosity is as good a reason as any for a critic to swing into action. If I were writing the next chapter in a long history, I'd mention how gracefully Diego Garcia has grown into his new job as the restaurant's chef. I enjoyed Mr. Garcia's fish cookery at his last restaurant, a small, bare-bones place in Hell's Kitchen called Gloria , but he seemed limited by the kitchen's size. He works on a grander scale now, with more expensive ingredients and more delicate treatments that still betray his creative streak. He roasts duck because the Four Seasons is famous for it, and makes fresh pasta and risotto because the captains in their black jackets need some place to shave all those white truffles. For all intents and purposes, though, he has turned the Four Seasons into a seafood restaurant, and a very good one. It's not hard to believe he was once a sous-chef at Le Bernardin when you taste, say, the raw scallop slivers in citrus juices, elegantly equipped with tart apple and caviar, or the intensely smooth chowder of tiny, just-cooked clams in a New England-style cream broth that's pale yellow with butterfat. He knows when to show restraint and when to go all in, taking sea-urchin ravioli that are already head-spinningly rich and draping lobes of sea urchin over them. Some of the cooking is boring in the right way. I don't want surprises in Dover sole \u00e0 la meuni\u00e8re, and I didn't get any. It was flawless. The duck will surprise only people who don't know that duck meat cooked to well-done bastes in its own fat until it is almost a warm confit. Other dishes were boring in the usual sense. The mustard sauce poured around the golden crab cake tasted like cream that was shown a picture of a mustard jar. The chapter would also depict the return of Bill Yosses. Anybody who ate his desserts before he disappeared into the White House won't be surprised by how good they are here. They do have a slight Rip Van Winkle quality, suggesting that Mr. Yosses allowed several new waves in pastry to pass him by, but that's no criticism. He makes a better baba au rhum than almost anyone in town, his chocolate tart with a salted stripe of caramel is both powerful and precise, and his hazelnut financier balanced over roasted pears is more delicious than almost any almond financier you can find. He has even improved the restaurant's signature, the Kate Pierson beehive of cotton candy that sails out to the tables of valued guests. (Apparently I've joined that club.) This being the Four Seasons, the history would have to mention the new restaurant's interior. It reminded me of the old Philip Johnson dining rooms without making me sad to be here instead of there, a trick I had thought was impossible. The bronze bead curtains have transformed into strings of gilded glass baubles; the flatware and glasses pay homage to the vintage designs used at the original restaurant; and the bar is once again a four-sided island in the middle of a lounge. For the first time you can eat a real meal there, while you watch the Grand Central-bound commuters outside and the cotton candy-bound regulars inside, generally a mature group in tightly knotted ties or heels that echo down the corridor to the dining room like the ticking of a grandfather clock. All of this and a generous budget (the prices are as exclusionary as ever) could make for a few hours of celebratory sightseeing of a kind that is quickly disappearing from the city. The Four Seasons offers an escape from the outside world. Escaping from what's inside, however, takes a mental effort that is beyond me and will probably be beyond many others as well, whether Mr. Niccolini is in sight or not. During my three meals, I never saw him. Restaurants, even grand ones like the Four Seasons, are intimate places; eating is an act that requires trust and a sense of safety. We want to get up from the table feeling restored on all fronts except the financial one. Mr. Niccolini's actions have done serious damage to his power to provide that feeling, even as he and Mr. von Bidder have made the restaurant better than it has been in years.

They went on to get married and, as joint chefs and owners, opened a string of compact, intimate, slinky modern-Spanish restaurants that are still in business. Their one misfire was a small, intimate non-Spanish coffee shop in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. After dusting themselves off, they replaced the cafe tables with taller and longer ones, traded the pastry cases for a bar, installed a stripe of backlighted glass blocks that cast a subaqueous glow on the room, and in September reopened as Saint Julivert Fisherie . And what is a fisherie, you ask, having quickly consulted your French, Spanish and English dictionaries and found no such word? Saint Julivert is my first, but if it is anything to go by, then a fisherie is a seafood establishment that aspires to be more than a raw bar but does not want to be mistaken for a full-bore restaurant. Wines come mostly from coastal regions (and are organized by the nearest body of salt water). Small plates abound. And if you guessed that they are something like the tapas that Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero explore at El Quinto Pino , Txikito and La Vara , but without the running Spanish theme, you are not far off. Not that the menu is entirely un-Spanish. The octopus carpaccio from Txikito makes a special guest appearance at Saint Julivert Fisherie, the way the Fresh Prince once turned up on an episode of \"Blossom.\" Under marjoram leaves and pinprick grains of Espelette pepper, the carpaccio is as good as you remember; the warm plate halfway melts the fattier bits of octopus into delicious goo. There is another cameo: El Quinto Pino's very fine combination of pink-fleshed anchovies with cold vanilla butter. The butter soothes the anchovies the way the vermouth in a martini helps the gin settle down. (On a related topic, the short cocktail list includes a deceptively soft-spoken number called the Kanpai Martini. It's a variation on the Vesper, which itself is the amended martini that Ian Fleming had James Bond order in \"Casino Royale.\") At times Saint Julivert reminds me of Cal Pep , in Barcelona, Spain, whose plain, cramped counter looks like the last place in the world where you are going to have an epiphany of the taste buds, right up until the moment the txipirones and thumbtack-size clams knock you off your barstool. Like Cal Pep, and unlike nearly every other New York restaurant, Saint Julivert serves gooseneck barnacles when they're available, boiling them with bay leaves and salt and mounding them on a cloth napkin before they cool so that when you twist the wrinkled sheath of skin away from the sweet, edible meat inside there is a good chance somebody in the vicinity will get hit with a squirt of hot barnacle juice. Mostly, though, any Spanish-ness in Saint Julivert has more to do with its spirit than its recipes, which come from all over: the deep-fried Puerto Rican cylinders of cornmeal known as sorrullitos; a kanpachi collar whose juicy meat is shockingly white under a black rub of jerk spices; tender slices of warm beef tenderloin on a fist-size roll, known in Portugal as a prego sandwich. There is also the crispy tuna bake, a peculiarly satisfying hybrid that crosses a tuna noodle casserole by way of India with fideu\u00e0, the Spanish dish that treats pasta like the rice in paella. The noodles, short ridged tubes, are toasted and cooked with oil-cured tuna in a tomato sauce that is seasoned with turmeric and curry leaves. It is one of the most fearless, not to mention filling, dishes on a menu that could use a little more of both qualities. Although Saint Julivert works with exceptional seafood, and treats it with the care that fans of Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero have come to expect, the menu plays it safe more often than it should. Like all of the couple's restaurants, Saint Julivert toggles between innovation and tradition. But the other places explore Spanish cuisine, so when they toss off a straight-ahead classic like patatas bravas, there's a reason. When Saint Julivert serves fluke ceviche or a crab and avocado salad dressed with yuzu juice and trout roe, it can seem to be grasping at ideas that other restaurants are already doing -- even when Saint Julivert does them better. The saut\u00e9ed skate splashed with Manzanilla could not be fresher or more skillfully browned, but do the garlic chips and sliced dried chiles on top make this version of a well-known standard one I'll remember a month from now? Maybe not, although at the time I was very happy to have it, not least because it was one of the few things on the menu the size of a standard main course. Even if you're an old hand at navigating the shallow waters of small plates, it can be unnervingly easy to spend more than $100 on food and drinks at Saint Julivert and still wonder whether you've actually had dinner. Seafood this good is expensive, but the menu doesn't stray very far above $20; the result is that portions can seem somewhat airy. When there's an inexpensive opportunity to pad out a dish, Saint Julivert doesn't always take it. I understand why I can't have more than three excellent wild shrimp in a $21 bowl of red pozole, but couldn't there be more than a spoonful of hominy kernels? Saltines fried in canola oil are served with the ceviche and with a cold and highly appealing bowl of pickled shrimp under pink pickled onions; grilled bread slices accompany the mackerel whipped into a hummus-like orange spread with piri-piri oil. Still, each time I went, somebody at my table asked for more bread. None of Saint Julivert's issues are insoluble. The lighting could be warmed up so the room looks less like an aquarium. A few more dishes you won't see anywhere else, like the tuna bake, would make it harder to resist. Another two or three large plates would make it a place you think of when you're hungry. The excellent $19 prego sandwich is more snack than dinner, until you pay another $7 to have fried oysters tucked into the roll beside the beef, making it into a kind of crunchy carpetbagger. On the other hand, that's worth doing even if you're not hungry. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

Modernization is the theme unifying many of the Indian restaurants that have taken root around the city over the past few years. At the rarefied end of the spectrum, we have Indian Accent bringing the cuisine into line with the intricate techniques and plating that can land restaurants on the itineraries of list-clutching gastrotourists. At the populist end, we've seen Indian cooking gastro-pubbed by Babu Ji and other new places that try to make non-desis feel at home with house-party vibes, beer in a self-service fridge, and dishes like naan pizzas and samosa burgers. New York hasn't seen nearly as many recently opened restaurants devoted to the pure, original stuff that is getting modernized. The snacks pitched together in a blur by hawkers at folding tables and rolling carts by the side of the road; the gravy-soaked stews and sauceless dry curries patiently made from 25 or so vegetables and seasonings, all of them chopped, ground, fried and simmered at home by those keepers of the culinary flame known collectively as the aunties -- we've seen interpretations of this food, squeezed from eyedroppers and prepared for their photo shoots with edible flowers. But new places cooking the genuine article have been scarce. There is a problem of missing context here; twists on tradition don't really resonate when tradition is hard to find in its untwisted form. And for anyone who truly loves Indian cooking, there is a more pressing problem of missing flavor. Five dots of tandoori-spice oil just won't land on the taste buds with the impact of a full plate of charred and steaming tandoori chicken, no matter how evenly spaced those dots are. I hadn't given much thought to either problem, to tell the truth, until I made it to the out-of-the-way patch of Long Island City where Adda Indian Canteen operates. This is not the part of that neighborhood where high-rise apartments grow overnight and Amazon will soon tiptoe in with 25,000 employees. Adda is east of all that, under a National Guard recruiting office, surrounded by a thicket of railroad tracks and highway overpasses. Unless you are looking for it, you are not likely to end up in the small dining room, in which Indian tabloids have been upcycled as wallpaper. Once I'd found it, one of the first things I ate was the kaleji masala, chicken livers in a dark gravy seasoned with fresh ginger and garam masala. Right away I realized that this was the kind of Indian food the city has been hungry for, or at least the kind that I'd been hungry for: made with care but no pretense; seasoned for people who love the interplay of spices; presented without apology in all its brown, lumpy glory; and complex in ways that demand full attention. Adda (ah DAH) Indian Canteen was opened in September by Roni Mazumdar, who owns it, and Chintan Pandya, who is the chef. The two men already run Rahi , in Greenwich Village, perhaps the best of the casual, modernizing Indian restaurants, where Mr. Pandya serves original notions like tandoori skate and sends almost everything out of the kitchen decorated with edible flowers. They've taken another angle at Adda, mining family recipes and the lessons Mr. Pandya absorbed from civilian cooks around India. The menu travels beyond the standard north Indian dishes most New Yorkers already know, but even those dishes, when they appear, are prepared so emphatically that they don't resemble anything else in town. Adda is a lusty, full-throated defense of traditional cooking. Saag paneer, the grayest of old gray mares in many Indian restaurants, is coltishly energetic at Adda. The cheese is made in the kitchen, and it's gorgeously soft, while the saag is a tart and peppery mix of wilted arugula, sorrel, spinach and mustard greens. Mr. Pandya does very well by the class of sidewalk treats called chaat. Each delivers the messy riot you'd hope for, busy with crunchy hieroglyphs of fried noodles and splattered with yogurt and tamarind sauce. One chaat is anchored by a big kale fritter, another by several smaller chips of battered, spiced lentil cakes, and a third by fried smashed potatoes and chickpeas. But discerning chaat lovers should probably go directly to the dahi batata puri, soft potato packed into hollow globes of fried dough that you can pick up and eat with your fingers, like chocolates. Anything that passes through Adda's tandoor is worth investigating. Seekh kebabs, made with lamb that's coarsely ground by hand, come out of the tandoor juicier and pinker than the usual; Mumbai-style tandoori macchi, a skewered pompano rubbed with ground mustard seeds and cilantro, is lightly charred and smoky after roasting, but still moist; bhatti da murgh, a double-marinated chicken thigh and drumstick, is so thickly crusted with coriander and cumin that it crunches when you bite it. My server expressed an enthusiasm about the poussin -- plunged into the tandoor in one piece after marinating in vinegar, yogurt, fresh red chiles and kala namak, the sulfurous black salt of India -- that you typically find in new converts to a cult. After tasting it, I was ready to join. He was enthusiastic about almost everything, as it turned out; the service at Adda is nothing if not eager to talk up the food. (Getting your water glass refilled is another story.) Placing a dish of yogurt and pomegranate seeds next to the goat biryani that is steamed under a lid of dough, he said, \"This is going to be your best friend when the spice in the biryani starts to hit you.\" It was, in fact, one of the fiercest biryanis I've ever met, and the yogurt tamed it so that I could taste the tender goat meat and crisp, bittersweet fried onions. Few things on the menu are quite as chile-drenched as the biryani, but Mr. Pandya definitely favors India's more intense flavors. Adda is not big on soft-spoken cream sauces; the coconut milk in the Malvani prawn curry from the South Konkan coast, for instance, has a pronounced kick. (It's very good if you get it on a night when the prawns are firm and not spongy.) And while Adda does serve some vegetables, it would not make my list of the 20 best local Indian restaurants for vegetarians. It would, however, be the place I'd send you if you want to know how good Delhi butter chicken can be. Or if you don't yet believe that rara gosht, chunks of lamb stewed on the bone with spiced minced lamb, is not redundant but luxurious. And Adda is the first restaurant I'd tell you about if you woke up one morning hungry for bheja fry, goat brains cooked with onions, ginger and a considerable number of fresh green chiles. \"Like soft scrambled eggs,\" our server said, accurately. I might point out that a typical Indian bheja fry is drier, with a higher ratio of brains to sauce. But I would not necessarily mean that as a complaint.

That's not quite right. Yes, Ms. Robbins has given half of her menu over to long noodles and short ones; strands of linguine with chopped garlic and a double dose of fish in the form of chopped anchovies and drizzled colatura; circles filled with ricotta whipped until it is as soft as cream; pinched rings of tortelli stuffed with mascarpone and spinach; the deeply ridged Sardinian shells known as malloreddus; and other Italian marvels of starch formation. True, anybody who has been to Ms. Robbins's other restaurant, Lilia , also located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, knows that the pasta there reliably steals the show from everything else on the table. When those people show up at Misi, odds are good that they will not have chosen that day to start a keto diet. Moreover, Misi has a greater variety of pasta than Lilia, so many that the architecture makes space for them. Misi is across the street from the old Domino refinery on the East River, where the cranes used to unload sugar from barges in the open air so that on days when the wind was right you could taste it on your tongue a mile away. Next to the dining room, facing the factory's remains, is a separate, glassed-in workshop where the temperature and humidity are kept at consistent dough-friendly levels. There, the long noodles, etc., are rolled out and cut long before 5:30 each night, when Misi's front door is unlocked and the crowd waiting in line for walk-in seats begins to snake eagerly forward. And to be sure, if you watch Ms. Robbins and her kitchen crew at the end of one of two long dining counters, you'll see the same quick motion over and over: an almost surreptitiously quick trip of hand to mouth, a sharp bite and an appraising chew to decide if that batch of pasta is ready to be pulled from the water. Some chefs show their mastery over pasta by pressing it thinner than a screen protector for an iPhone. Ms. Robbins likes hers to have body and heft, and the chew test is the most reliable way to tell when thick pasta like that is ready. You are very unlikely to get a piece that is undercooked at its core, or one that doesn't fight back enough to let you know it is still alive. You get this just-in-between texture in the stubs of mezze rigatoni with a simple, glossy, ripe tomato sauce that's been stewed with whole garlic cloves -- 30 to a batch, according to the menu. You get it again in the corzetti, discs about the diameter of a Red Bull can that are pressed with a wooden stamp to give them a target pattern. In October, Misi served these ridged coins with another tomato sauce, this one barely cooked, just some Sungold tomatoes warmed until they broke open and their yellow pulp spilled out. Fresh basil, thyme and chervil were scattered over the top, as good an illustration as any of how Ms. Robbins makes her food stand out without deviating from an Italian reliance on simple, unmanipulated ingredients. But to call Misi a pasta restaurant would be to overlook its highly impressive work with vegetables. They are the subject of the menu's other half, sneakily headlined \"antipasti.\" This is where you will find a globe eggplant roasted until it is as soft and easy to spread as cream cheese; the cut surfaces are dressed with Calabrian chiles, and the taste of lemon juice seems to have found its way to the center of the eggplant. There are fleshy and firm chanterelles, too, lightly pickled and preserved in olive oil until they're brought to the table crisscrossed with rosemary needles. Grilled runner beans with garlic and chiles have been around lately, too, in a big heap that I would have enjoyed more if a few stringy, leathery beans had not gotten past the inspectors in the kitchen. Like the pastas, Misi's vegetables tend to bring together only a few ingredients, often applied in ways you don't quite expect. I don't know where else you will taste pistachios and anchovies combined with skinny, leaf-bud-green leeks marinated in vinegar, or a kind of panzanella made with grilled bread, capers, fresh oregano and chunks of zucchini that are still tender after a quick poaching in olive oil. And though the gently roasted tomatoes won't come back to the menu until next summer, you can try imagining how their dusting of fennel seeds and cracked coriander seeds responds to a last-minute squirt of spicy honey. There are enough of these vegetables, and enough meatless pastas, that a vegetarian could eat extremely well at Misi just by watching out for things like bottarga and staying away entirely from the creamy pork sugo tossed with strangozzi. (Meat eaters, on the other hand, may find the sugo helps restore chafed nerves.) Although Misi doesn't let its kitchen range as widely as Lilia's, it is a more successful restaurant in several ways. The menu has been distilled down to essentials, and the whole enterprise seems more carefully thought through. The restaurant is on the ground floor of a new apartment building by SHoP Architects , who chose to leave a hole in the middle that you could fly a helicopter through. The developer, Two Trees , recruited Ms. Robbins and her business partner, Sean Feeney, and gave them a chance to build the virgin space to their needs. The acoustics are better than at Lilia, and traffic between tables flows more smoothly. The interior is unusually good, with narrow horizontal wall tiles in white and nooks for stacked plates that make them part of the d\u00e9cor. As at Lilia, the wine list practically begs you to take something new for a whirl: a catarratto from Sicily, a Corsican niellucciu, or a croatina-ughetta blend from Lombardy softened with some uva rara. Of course, you could stick to a $45 Lambrusco, or get a $250 Champagne from David L\u00e9clapart, after which you can try flying through the hole in the building yourself. If we are striving for total accuracy, though, we need to call Misi a pasta-vegetables-and-gelato restaurant. Its gelato is made in house; there are about six kinds at any given moment. The flavors open up right away, in part because Misi serves them just below the melting point and in part because the ingredients are used prodigally. There are a lot of almonds in the almond, and the espresso could keep you up an extra hour. But even the unflavored fior di latte, made with milk, cream and sugar, comes at you in a rush. There are no desserts other than gelato. The only decision to make at the end of the night is which one you're going to have.

Yes, pizza in the city has been accessorized with toppings from crayfish (not bad) to Buffalo chicken (hmm) to Caesar salad (no, no, no, no, no). But the foldable, portable triangles of cheese, sauce and dough themselves were generally held to be a natural resource that was perfect as is, much like the soft, unfiltered city tap water claimed to be the source of their excellence. Some pizzerias try to make a better slice. Very few try to make a different slice. Mama's Too makes a different slice. It combines some of the most appealing elements of a Neapolitan pie with the most satisfying aspects of the archetypal product sold on paper plates from sidewalk windows. It is as if Frank Tuttolomondo, the owner and pie architect of this informal but very serious pizzeria on the Upper West Side, has learned how to genetically modify pizza. The bulge of crust at the edge of what Mama's Too calls the \"house slice\" is brown, more rough than smooth and baked to a ferocious crackle. You could tear it off and enjoy it on its own, or maybe with butter or olive oil, just as you can with the best Neapolitans. Yet the flat layer of crust on the bottom is firm, without the soupy center of the Neapolitan style. True to New York form, you can hold it in the air by the curved rim and it will stay flat and parallel to the floor. As they do at Totonno's and some other brick-oven pizzerias, Mr. Tuttolomondo lays the cheese down before the sauce. Rather than drippy, milky discs of fresh mozzarella, though, he covers the raw dough (after priming it with olive oil) in shreds of a slice-friendly variety that is known in the trade as low-moisture mozzarella and that the rest of us call pizza cheese. Over this, he ladles a few blots of tomato pulp. This helps the crust to bake through without getting soggy, keeps the cheese from sliding off the crust, and most of all lets you taste the tomatoes, which are very good. You could, I suppose, think of the house slice as a white pizza with tomato-sauce topping. After the pie comes out of the oven, Mr. Tuttolomondo sprinkles it with grated two-year-old Parmigiano-Reggiano. Basil leaves are the last to go on. At this point, you can pay, walk out the door and amble toward Broadway and 106th Street cradling your slice in a paper plate and taking bites as you go. In other words, you can have the traditional sidewalk pizza experience, but you will be tasting flavors you normally find only in high-minded sit-down pizzerias like Sorbillo , Ops or Una Pizza Napoletana . Those bloodhounds who follow the city's melted-mozzarella trail will recognize that Mama's Too is part of a great reawakening of slice culture. Unlike brick-oven pizza, which came from Europe and relied on preindustrial technology, the New York slice is a lowly American hybrid. It is baked in gas ovens, and the sheer number of places selling it suggests that it requires no special skill. When it is praised, we don't talk about its artisanal roots; we call it the humble slice, the street-corner slice, the slice of the common man and woman. The ordinary slice and its heftier cousin, the Sicilian-style square, were probably first rehabilitated with superior ingredients and a sophisticated understanding of baking by Best Pizza in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 2010. Today, serious pizza hobbyists talk about their favorite slices by reeling off the dough's rising time and hydration levels. North Brooklyn is still the center of the neoclassical slice movement, with L'Industrie and Williamsburg Pizza and, most recently, Paulie Gee's Slice Shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, but the forward-thinking slice is found in Manhattan, too, at Scarr's on the Lower East Side and Corner Slice in the Gotham West Market. The goal of the neoclassicists is, essentially, to return to the golden age of New York takeout pizza, which survives at places like Di Fara in Midwood, Brooklyn, one of the holy sites of the neoclassical church. Paulie Gee's Slice Shop, Scarr's and other neoclassicist joints cultivate a self-consciously vintage atmosphere, styling their logos and signs and interiors so they look like a place where Johnny Boy and Charlie in \"Mean Streets\" might have gone for a pepperoni slice and a Coke. Mr. Tuttolomondo does not fetishize the past. Perhaps this is because he lived it. For almost 60 years his family has owned a series of old-school slice joints in the neighborhood. The current incarnation is literally on a street corner, at the intersection of 106th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. It is called Mama's Pizza . He didn't open Mama's Too a block away to outdo his parents; he's bringing their product into a new era. If the neoclassicists are like the folk revivalists who collected old acoustic 78s, he is Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. When Mama's Too opened in December, it also served housemade pasta. It's still on the menu board that hangs on one wall, but Mr. Tuttolomondo has stopped serving it to concentrate on pizza. Besides the house slice, he also makes squares that he sees as a marriage of rectangular Sicilian pizza with Roman pizza al taglio. The crust is much taller than the Roman style, and taller than some Sicilians, too, but it is airy and chewy. On the bottom it has the bronze color, the cratered surface and the pan-fried crunch of the bread on a grilled cheese sandwich. The edges, where the dough meets the pan, have a gold fringe of browned cheese, known among students of pizza styles as a \"frico crust.\" This fringe is, of course, crunchy and delicious. The most impressive square is, I think, the pepperoni. Unlike most of the others, it incorporates tomato sauce. The mozzarella is baked until it begins to brown. The pepperoni slices are small and concave, like contact lenses made of meat. Crunchy around the rims, these little cups are half-filled with spicy red oil. It may sound as if I approached this slice with cool, analytical detachment. The truth is I ripped into it like a pack of hyenas. The other squares tend to be white pies with toppings. Again, tomato sauce is one of the toppings. In one case it's a thick and creamy layer of vodka sauce, one of the ideas that separates Mama's Too from the neoclassicists. Mr. Tuttolomondo also makes a cacio e pepe Sicilian pie, essentially a four-cheese pizza in which one of the cheeses is pecorino; the whole slice hums with black pepper. The square topped with Gorgonzola dolce and pears works in a way that combination often doesn't, although half a slice was enough for me. The shop is small, and if you sit at one of the handful of red counter stools you will share the small tiled floor up front with neighbors waiting for takeout and delivery guys. There are no vintage soda refrigerators or letterboard signs, but there is a small photograph of Robert De Niro eating pizza and a much bigger one of John Travolta in \"Saturday Night Fever,\" biting into his double-decker slice. The picture is in black and white except for the pizza. Tinted orange and red, it glows like a beacon.

You wouldn't know it to look around the place on any recent night at 8, when a seamless playlist of hip-hop and R&B unspools as servers carry stacked beef ribs to what seems like every third table. What changed? In August, the chef Joseph Johnson , better known as JJ, was made a partner and assumed control of the kitchen. What he has done is less a makeover than a takeover; his imprint radiates out from his Afrocentric menu to animate the whole enterprise. The playlist, which can run from noon until 8 the next morning without repeating a track, is his. Mr. Johnson's initials now hang in the front window, flooding the nearby tables with pink neon. The initials have migrated to the restaurant's website as well, where its name is now given as Henry at Life Hotel by JJ . These are not subtle gestures, but subtlety has rarely saved a restaurant on the brink of failure. Mr. Johnson has been busy hiring new employees for the front and back of the house, and the racial mix he has already achieved is as impressive as it is rare. Diversifying a restaurant's service staff is one of the surest ways to diversify the audience, and on many nights brown faces and white faces, topknots and braids, headscarves and headbands, sit side by side, giving Henry more the appearance of a restaurant in Harlem than of one just off Herald Square. It was in Harlem, as chef de cuisine at a slinky neighborhood hangout called the Cecil and the history-drenched jazz supper club Minton's , that Mr. Johnson made his name. Fleshing out a notion suggested by Alexander Smalls, the consulting chef in both places, Mr. Johnson explored the African diaspora, the imprint that Africans have put on cooking around the world. He does something similar at Henry, although his view has grown to embrace flavors from, say, India and Southeast Asia that turn up in Africa and in diasporic countries like Jamaica and Barbados. He calls the menu at Henry \"Pan-African.\" [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] This is a big story -- too big to be told in full by one restaurant, or two for that matter. But it's an important story, and it certainly beats Henry's original idea of tying the restaurant to the history of Life magazine, which was once published in the same building, and to Henry Luce , who bought it in 1936, then radically remade it and moved it to other quarters. This concept was so wispy that Henry's first chef, Michael Vignola, resorted to an all-things-to-all-people menu of foie gras sliders and meatball pizza. Just how vast Mr. Johnson's scope has become will be clear by the end of the appetizer course. (Here I am assuming that you have chosen a traditional two- or three-course meal rather than eating all 15 items on the menu, in full and in order; this route costs $390 and is called \"It Was All a Dream,\" after a Notorious B.I.G. lyric.) There are littleneck clams, battered with rice flour and crunchy with shaved fennel and Asian pear. All of this is dotted with a tangerine-colored fluff of piri-piri sauce that is less ferociously spicy than the scalding piri-piris of Angola, Mozambique or South Africa. You are welcome to get a half-dozen, but at my table a full dozen went quickly. Benne seeds, the heirloom variety of sesame brought to North America on slave ships, add a flavor that is something like toasted almonds mixed with coffee beans to tuna tartare. The tuna is topped with a chip of curried peanut brittle and spooned over shiso leaves; you pinch the leaf and pop it in your mouth, where good things start to happen. And as you're adjusting to this cross-pollination of Africa and Japan, Indo-Caribbean cuisine appears on the horizon: a plate of folded roti with dips. The spinach chutney is a little joyless, but the inky pur\u00e9e of eggplant sweetened with dates is a terrific idea. Why Mr. Johnson puts a fried egg on the roti is unclear. When your meal at Henry is over, you may wish you had been sent home with a world map showing the history of forced African migration and spice-trade routes. While it's going on, though, you generally flow with the inner logic the way you can get into a hip-hop track without being able to name every last sample. Generally, but not always. I believe I understood some of the reasoning behind chopped collard greens and cashews tossed with a coconut dressing, but I still find raw collards somewhat rough going after the first few mouthfuls. Is the seared salmon with rice noodles, edamame and bok choy a reference to the Vietnamese community in Senegal? To me it tasted, not unpleasantly, like something one of the better Asian fusion restaurants in Manhattan would have served 20 years ago. Henry's shrimp and pork dumplings, on the other hand, are nondescript little blobs; they sit in an aromatic \"Harlem curry,\" informed by Bengali cooking, that deserves a better dance partner. You could say the same about the intensely herb-scented seafood broth in a seafood boil that Mr. Johnson calls the Afropot; the clams and king crab legs were very good, but the prawns were unappealingly soft and the mussels not quite fleshy enough. The cooking, though, has been getting tighter over the past month, picking up from a first and somewhat droopy meal on a night when Mr. Johnson was not in the kitchen. Tamarind jerk chicken had no spice to speak of. A parcel of rice supposedly inspired by Dominican conc\u00f3n had as much crunch as if it had been left out on the counter overnight, and the eggplant curry ladled over it tasted more like a halfheartedly seasoned tomato sauce. The second time I tried it, the rice had a golden crackle and the curry was worth paying attention to. Apart from the seared scallops in a remarkably good hominy broth with cilantro pistou, those bone-in ribs are the most rewarding main course. The rewards are not so much the short ribs themselves, though they are flavorful and tender; the thrill of the dish is in the battery of little sides like stir-fried millet, spiced black beans and a hoisin sauce I wanted to take home to keep on hand for Chinese-food emergencies. I also thought about pocketing a Foie Crispy Treat, and I would have gotten away with it because everybody else at the table thought they were too weird. Weird they are, but interesting, too. Maybe you'd be happier with the sweet potato pie in a crisp butter crust, very old school apart from the purple yam in the filling. True, at some point in your meal a hotel guest may decide to march through the dining room with a full set of luggage. But under Mr. Johnson, Henry is under no risk of being capsized by that kind of distraction. He has pulled the restaurant back from the edge of failure, and that's a rare trick.

Chongqing chicken and mung-bean jelly proliferated as skilled chefs flocked to the city. But while the miles of dan dan noodles and mountains of Sichuan peppercorns have been exhilarating, they have tended to overshadow the cuisine of another great chile-haunted region, Hunan. Part of the problem is nomenclature. The word Hunan on a restaurant's front window tends to say as much about the actual cooking inside as pandas and bamboo on the sign. At first glance it can be hard to distinguish Hunan Garden, say, from Hunan House until you see the menus and learn that the former name signifies egg rolls while the latter promises the red-braised pork that Mao used to dote on. Fake Hunans outnumber real ones, which is one reason to celebrate the appearance of Hunan Slurp . Operating in the East Village since May, Hunan Slurp lives up to both halves of its name. When people in Hunan get hungry for a bowl of noodles, what they have in mind are mifen: long, white strands made from pounded rice, so smooth they may slither right out of the chopsticks of inexperienced slurpers. Chances for New Yorkers to practice their antiskid chopstick techniques have been limited, generally speaking, to the rice noodles of other parts of Asia. When you could find Hunanese noodles around town, they tended to be tucked away on larger menus with so many other Hunanese opportunities that they were rarely given a chance to slither. Hunan Slurp offers some of those opportunities, too. The chef and proprietor, Chao Wang, comes from Hunan's second-largest city, Hengyang, and fills the menu with both traditional Hunanese dishes and his own innovations. But noodles are the heart of the restaurant. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] They peek out from underneath slices of beef, tofu and barbecued pork, all fanned out like a hand of poker, in a soup-less wonder called Hometown Lu Fen. The sauce is in the bottom of the bowl, and should absolutely be augmented with some of the chopped pickled red chiles in oil served in a small dish on the side. In the string bean mifen, the noodles weave around a fried egg and a scattering of ground Berkshire pork, stir-fried to a crackle with little rounds of sliced, pickled green beans. There is no slick of chile oil on top, and the pale broth looks harmless enough, but once the soup is stirred together it will take the crease out of a pair of newly pressed trousers. A little red sheaf of dried chile threads bobbing in the wild pepper and beef soup gives you an idea what you are in for, if the name hasn't already given away the game. But with Hunan Slurp's noodles, as with Hunanese food generally, heat is part of the message; it's never the medium. Stock is to the cook what pitch is to the opera singer, goes a Chinese proverb. Hunan Slurp's soup stocks are rounded and cloudy from long-boiled bones and meat, and they tend to get better the longer they linger with their toppings. (So do the noodles.) A master class in the art of broth subtlety is provided by the two-part soup that goes by the under-promising name fish fillet mifen. Part One is an oversize ceramic bowl of milky white pork-and-fish stock strewn with flower petals, pea shoots, purple basil and other fresh herbs. It arrives on a wooden tray next to Part Two, the noodles, which get their own bowl. The broth's flavor was elusive at first, more a texture than a taste. Within minutes the steamed fish in the broth, together with the herbs, had transformed it into something splendid. Like many of the new Chinese restaurants that have sprouted in the East Village, Hunan Slurp pays attention to appearances. Under a backlighted logo that spells out SLURP in elongated, noodly letters, a sheet of glass on First Avenue frames the long, tunneled dining room, designed by New Practice Studio . The interior is sheathed in wooden slats that run up one wall, arch their way across the ceiling and fall down the opposite wall. Depending on your frame of mind, eating at Hunan Slurp can feel like sitting under a rack of drying noodles or finding yourself inside the belly of a particularly tidy whale. A glassed-in kitchen lies in the back, its shelves stacked with colorfully glazed modern Chinese plates and bowls that you won't find in the restaurant-supply shops on the Bowery. Once you leave the noodle section of the menu behind, it is possible to find cooking that doesn't necessarily live up to the standard set by the crockery. I'm told that the bands of cumin-seasoned beef speared with toothpicks can be crisp and well-browned, but the ones I got were gray and floppy. And the sweet-and-sour spareribs, an appetizer, were far more sweet than sour, and tough, too. On the best available evidence, Mr. Wang's palate skews a bit sweet. This is unusual in a Hunanese kitchen, but only those spareribs were off-puttingly sugary. A multicolored salad of chilled cherry tomatoes was bright and refreshing despite a fruity marination in plum juice. (A similar dish sometimes turns up at Hao Noodle and Tea by Madam Zhu's Kitchen , where it is sweeter, and still very enjoyable.) And the hint of sugar in stir-fried chicken did not soften the toothy bite of young ginger, or hide the ginger's natural sweetness, either. You may not notice the bias toward sweetness anyway, given the kitchen's open embrace of chiles. An electrical current of heat crackles through the dim-sum-style chicken feet, cooked until they are falling-off-the-toe tender. Bright green chiles animate a stir-fry of julienne potatoes, cooked so fast they're still stiff. They also bring not just spice but crunch to a classic Hunanese saut\u00e9 of pork and garlic topped with an egg fried to a ruffled, golden crisp. The chiles knocked around in a very hot wok with sweet, juicy cabbage are small, red, sun-dried and noticeably fruity under their mouth-zapping heat. The spice level is more subdued in the excellent stir-fry of pork and smoked tofu, and it's almost undetectable in a very likable preparation of skinny eggplant sections topped with discs of bell pepper; the skins are left on the eggplants, which gives the appetizer something of the appearance of tuna maki wrapped with purple seaweed. Meals tend to move quickly. For this you may be thankful on busy nights when those wood slats go from attractive design elements to unnervingly effective sounding boards. As in other Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood, the crowd tends to be young, bright, quick and eager to get on with the rest of the evening. As the dinner rush ends, the howl subsides. Maybe ice cream is on the agenda, or a classic dessert soup of mung beans and barley in syrup. Or maybe a pot of tea, loose-leaf, brewed at the table while you think about chiles and rice and pork and wonder how many more Hunanese chefs can be persuaded to settle down in New York.

One after another, each of the 10 courses in the $175 meal opens up new ideas about Korean cuisine and culture. In the Atomix pedagogical method, instruction is followed closely by reward. (While we are working on vocabulary: The restaurant's name is pronounced, somewhat counterintuitively, a-toe-mix.) [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] Many of the rewards are the kind you eat, of course. Guk-which-means-soup is a shimmering broth that Mr. Park, the chef, makes from fermented tomatoes and kelp; chilled and poured over scallop slices layered between slivers of green tomato that have been marinated in Korean fig vinegar, the broth has an electrifying sweet-sour balance. The dish may not scream \"Korean cuisine,\" but the next one does. This is hwe -- Korean for raw, you'll recall, and also the term for Korean-style sashimi. The fish is striped jack, brushed with plum vinegar sauce. Slices of it are folded around a mild fermented chile, a few drops of sesame oil and bits of kimchi made from cabbage and ramps. Sitting over each slice of jack is a crisp square of gim, which the Japanese call nori. Pinch some fish inside the gim and eat it, and the flavors that unspool are some of those that are brought to the table with Korean sashimi, but they're put together with a harmony that's hard to achieve when you swab them yourself under the influence of a few glasses of soju. Inspired by a poem from the Choson era, Mr. Park summoned an entirely different set of flavors for the hwe on Atomix's opening menu, which ran from late May to early September. Then, the fish was sea bream, firm and chewy, marinated overnight with ginger in a magnificently good tangerine vinegar from the island of Jeju. Eaten with sea urchin, plain spinach, sparkling shards of jelly made from pale young soy sauce, and Chinese-mustard leaves fermented in some wonderful way, it was so deeply harmonic I wouldn't have minded if Mr. Park had served it over and over for the rest of the meal. Centuries before it became the fashion among American chefs, fermentation was a pillar of Korean cuisine. Atomix exploits it in all kinds of ways. Fermentation bends a mix of juices from Korean pears, green apples and pineapple toward a cidery direction that makes it a thrilling marinade, braising liquid and sauce for exquisitely rich Wagyu strip loin. It's the foundation for an array of vinegars you won't find on the average table in Koreatown: cherry blossom, persimmon, mugwort, birch. And, of course, fermentation is behind the restaurant's arsenal of pickled vegetables, the most interesting of which may be the tart brussels sprouts that Mr. Park serves in banchan format alongside roast duck with a mole sauce that could pass muster in Mexico if Mr. Park did not up the funk level with gochujang. Some of these ingredients were fermented or otherwise preserved in South Korea. Many more were put up for storage at Atoboy , the Parks' other restaurant, over the past year or more as the Parks prepared to open Atomix. Atoboy's food is woven around traditional banchan dishes, and while Mr. Park gives himself room to play, the cooking there stays true to the fairly simple origins of banchan. His tasting menus at Atomix make a quantum leap in complexity. It's like seeing the guy who strums the 12-string guitar on the L platform pick up a conductor's baton and lead an orchestra through a Mahler symphony. On the back of Atomix's flashcards he lists the components of each dish, and each of their ingredients -- around 20 on average, very few of them ordinary and none of them out of place. Nothing at Atomix tastes confused or overburdened. The dishes are even more elaborate than those at Jungsik , the rarefied Korean-inspired restaurant downtown where Mr. Park was the chef de cuisine before he and his wife struck out on their own. And while Jungsik seems determined to stuff Korean flavors into an outdated French formality, Atomix is warm, contemporary and Korean at just about every turn. The Parks, who were raised in South Korea, hired a Seoul architecture firm, Studio Writers, to remake two floors of a secretive-looking townhouse on East 30th Street. Upstairs is a small bar where you can slither into a pale-leather booth to idle over smartly conceived snacks like soy-marinated scallop jerky; beef tartare, mixed with red and black pepper, and under a snowfall of pecorino; or fried wings stuffed with fried rice and dusted with ground Sichuan peppercorns. Stairs descend to a bright, skylit lounge of upholstered benches where the tasting menu kicks off with a couple of hors d'oeuvres and drinks. The idea must be for you to leave the shuffle of Manhattan behind in stages, but I always spent my few minutes in this way station eyeing the comfortable, dark, wood-clad den a few steps away where the rest of the meal is served at a 14-seat counter. The natural materials and simple lines in the tasting room seem to bow toward Korea's long Zen tradition, and a kind of purposeful calm reigns there. Servers and cooks all wear flowing, boat-neck shirts in a shimmering pewter color that gives them a slight science-fiction look; they are the work of a Korean-born New York designer, Sungho Ahn. Ms. Park, who goes by Ellia, glides behind the counter, smiling and holding out a cloth case to offer a pair of the Korean-made chopsticks she collects. They're beautiful objects, and so are the handmade plates and bowls that begin to file out of the kitchen, each made by a potter or glass worker or wood carver in South Korea. These artisans are identified on the menu cards, whose abstract designs are the work of a South Korean artist. Tasting menus can be arid and sterile when a chef doesn't have much to say. The format comes to life when a restaurant is overflowing with ideas, like Atomix. The way the Parks put Korean culture in the foreground recalls the early days of the Four Seasons, which moved beyond European models of formal dining by hiring an American architect and American industrial designers to go along with the American ingredients and even American wines. The Four Seasons had a Swiss chef, though. Atomix is more thorough: It has the Parks. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

The Rainbow Room had Art Deco razzmatazz and its revolving dance floor; Windows on the World, before terrorists destroyed it, served cocktails in a room named the Greatest Bar on Earth. Manhatta , which recently opened on the 60th floor of an International Style tower downtown, doesn't follow their lead. It is the least show-offy skyscraper restaurant you've ever seen. The whole operation is very orderly and well behaved, apart from its refusal to spell its own name correctly. (The reference is to the Lenni Lenape name Manahatta, or Mannahatta, meaning \"island of many hills,\" but without the second \"a\" the name just looks incomplete. It's like a child named Henr.) A dedicated door around the corner from the building's main entrance brings you into a foyer that, with its sleek chairs and coffee tables, looks like the lobby of one of those 1960s white-brick apartment buildings in the East 40s and 50s. When you get out of the elevator -- it goes to just one floor, the top -- a short walk leads to another sparsely furnished sitting area, this one looking out the windows toward the harbor and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. When the lounge hasn't been rented out for parties and sealed off, it's busier than the foyer downstairs, but it still appears to have been designed for people who are waiting for their dates to get back from the restroom. In the other direction are Manhatta's bar, a longish counter whose seats face uptown, and its dining room, which looks both north and east toward Brooklyn. The color scheme, navy-blue leather and dark wood, might strike the Knickerbocker Club 's board as a little too conservative. An open kitchen has been dropped down into the middle of all this, but the overall design strategy is to sit back and let the windows do the work. Danny Meyer, whose Union Square Hospitality Group runs Manhatta through a management contract with the building's owner, told The New York Times last year that Manhatta would not be as flamboyant as a typical top-floor restaurant. \"Those kinds of places often do not live up to expectations; they try too hard to live up to the view,\" he said. \"I expect to conceive of it like a ground-floor restaurant, as a place people might want to visit regularly.\" You can't blame Mr. Meyer for not wanting to open a mediocre splashy restaurant, but Manhatta flirts dangerously with being a mediocre unsplashy restaurant. The chef, Jason Pfeifer, doesn't quite let that happen. His French menu, grounded in seasonal flavors, is fairly priced at $78, including tip, for a three-course prix fixe. A good amount of it is very likable, but there are more spongy patches than there probably should be. At their best, Manhatta's better appetizers and main courses are fleshed out with fruits and vegetables so ripe and pristine they seem to come from a Greenmarket stall that only Mr. Pfeifer can see. A melon and cucumber salad with fluffy curds of feta was an exploration of melonic potential; each section of fruit was a bit different, some infused with citrus, others dripping with unfiltered garden-patch sweetness, all of them tangy with white balsamic vinegar. An admirably cooked brick of halibut was paired with bittersweet fennel bulbs and a mustard sauce with a gentle but effective bite. Raw nectarine crescents, braised lettuces and tender thin wheels of immature corn on the cob augmenting a main course of chicken were their charming selves, and all the better for their slinky dressing of chicken jus. Sweet black figs stood in for apples in a memorable little tarte Tatin garnished with raw pale-green figs. (Jennifer Bretania and Vanesa Beltran share the pastry duties.) Gently marinated hen-of-the-woods mushrooms made an exquisitely woodsy counterpoint to ruffles of shaved La Marotte sheep cheese. But generous applications of produce don't always save the food from seeming a bit safe, conservative and slightly dated. Mr. Pfeifer, who spent eight years in the kitchen at Maialino , Mr. Meyer's Roman-inspired restaurant, is now cooking French food in the post-nouvelle mode that Daniel Boulud has been artfully fomenting for years. Mr. Boulud has earned the right to keep working in that groove as long as he likes, but it's strange to find a young chef at a new, high-profile destination doing it when others around the city are pushing ahead with contemporary interpretations of French cuisine. And when Manhatta turns to the classics, its use of French idioms seems skin-deep compared with Laetitia Rouabah's light touch and sophisticated technique at Benoit , or Marie-Aude Rose's painstaking elevations of cafe cooking at La Mercerie , or Daniel Rose's intelligent, neoclassical excavations of silver-cloche cuisine at Le Coucou . Where Le Coucou brought back quenelles as helium-light pike dumplings in dizzyingly rich lobster-brandy sauce, Manhatta turns them into quivering balls of pudding distantly scented with seafood. Of all the ways a modern chef might grapple with cassoulet, the sublimely burly Languedocian assault on the digestive system, upending it over a crisp and golden chicken paillard has to be one of the strangest. Manhatta isn't the first restaurant to update veal blanquette with meat that's roasted rather than stewed, but the sauce is so blandly milky that it's hardly there. And while modern desserts can stray into savory territory more than they did in Escoffier's day, a vanilla souffl\u00e9 with butterscotch sauce probably shouldn't taste salty. Some of this was dispiriting, but I never got up from the table in a bad mood. There are grace notes throughout the restaurant, like the dark, shiny little canel\u00e9s that show up with dessert. This being a Union Square Hospitality production, the servers seem to be trained mind readers. A pair of the mismatched binoculars scattered around the restaurant materialized just when I was trying to locate the clock tower in the Consolidated Edison Building; before I'd had a chance to point out a fruit fly in my wine (did it ride up with me in the elevator?) a sommelier spirited the glass away and brought a fresh one. Mr. Meyer was probably right to take a dialed-down approach to the top-floor restaurant genre. It dates from a more innocent age, when people could look at the financial district's unblinking grids of lighted windows as the bland face of high-stakes cheating that we've come to recognize from \"Margin Call\" and \"Billions.\" At the time of the financial crisis, Manhatta's building was the headquarters of JPMorgan Chase -- a relatively minor player in the three-card-monte game of mortgage-backed securities, but a player nonetheless. Ten years have gone by, but it's still too soon for revolving dance floors. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

At best I might have spotted the tiny parking lot in Midwood, with tattered red, blue and silver streamers flapping over its 10 or so spaces, giving it the appearance of the world's smallest used-car dealership. In the back is a wide, single-story structure that looks like the trailer office where you would sit down to discuss loan options with Marty from financing. But that building is an Azerbaijani restaurant that stands out among the dining outposts of former Soviet republics that stretch north from Brighton Beach, and each time I've gone inside I was given not a credit check, but a test of my appetite's limits. This is not just because almost every platter of food that leaves the kitchen at Village Cafe seems intended to feed an actual village. I run into trouble because there are so many things I want to order and so few things I am willing to leave on the table as the meal winds down. There will never be a time when I go to Village Cafe and decide not to have at least one qutab, if not all three. The menu gives the name of this delicate Azerbaijani flatbread, the diameter of a pita but thinner, as kutaby. Either way, it is very good when stuffed with minced, quietly spiced chicken or lamb. It is exceptional when filled with greens: spinach, scallions, and dill and cilantro, two fresh herbs that turn up again and again in Azerbaijani cooking. I will always want the crimped dumplings, the size and shape of chicken drumettes, that the English menu calls ravioli and the servers call pelmeni. Filled with chicken or lamb, these dumplings can be boiled, but the urge to ask for them fried is overwhelming, and the fried ones are better dunked in the tomato-pepper sauce that I would call salsa if I were not in an Azerbaijani restaurant. There will be liver on my table, too. Maybe it will be Turkish style, little fried cubes under a tart purple dusting of ground sumac. Or the liver may be added to bits of lamb hearts, kidney and testicles, and cooked with onions and potato cubes in a fantastically oily hash called djiz biz. Whether I will eat guru hingal will depend on how far in advance I've planned my meal, because it generally has to be ordered a day ahead. It is a noodle dish: very thin, wide sheets of pasta under a sauce of onions and ground lamb fried in its own fat until it is magnificently crunchy. If you poured chile oil over guru hingal, it would taste Sichuanese; stew the lamb with tomatoes and you could mistake the sauce for Bolognese. But it's from Azerbaijan, and it's good with yogurt. And I will have soup, even if nobody else does, because Village Cafe's kitchen understands how to make it. The kufta-bozbash is a strong, well-skimmed lamb broth with chickpeas and a single, tender lamb-rice meatball, as big as an apple. The broth for dushbara soup is similar, but the ballast is provided by miniature lamb dumplings about the size of M&Ms. Cilantro and dried mint are added to both soups at the last minute, and the mint is especially helpful. Village Cafe's hot borscht, strong and decidedly unvegetarian, outperforms some I've had in Brighton Beach. Instead of sour cream, it comes with a spoonful of yogurt. The cuisine of Azerbaijan often echoes those of its neighbors Georgia, Armenia and Iran, but other dishes, like borscht, were hauled down from Eastern Europe in the strong arms of Mother Russia. We can also thank Russia for the insane music videos that play on Village Cafe's two televisions, typically with the volume off while American pop of the '80s plays on the sound system. You sit at what appear to be varnished picnic tables with chairs instead of benches. The rest of the d\u00e9cor looks like a Brighton Beach yard sale: a mushroom cookie jar, an embroidered peasant smock, a camouflage cap, a samovar or two, a collection of beaded handbags, several ceramic cows, three statues of fat chefs with toques and mustaches, and two giant forks mounted on the wall. For atmosphere, Village Cafe is roundly beaten by my second-favorite Azerbaijani restaurant in Brooklyn, Old Baku in Kensington. Walk past the awning that says \"private club,\" past the curtained booths in the front dining room, past the open kitchen where chefs scoop burning coals to keep the fire under the kebabs going strong, and you enter a courtyard from another country. Almost everybody at Old Baku is smoking under the arbor of grape vines that weave around strings of white lights. If you go in the fall, you might be brought a plate of purple grapes, newly picked a few feet away. But Village Cafe gains its edge on Old Baku in the kitchen. The stewed fruit ladled over saffron rice in its plov, for instance, is a richer and more varied compilation of dried plums, apricots, chestnuts and deeply browned lamb. The salads are brighter, too, if you can get over some of the names. The menu was evidently written by someone with a weakness for poetry, so the salads are called things like \"Journey to Baku,\" \"Winter Fun\" and \"Unexpected Guests.\" The Journey to Baku is worth taking; it's a sharply seasoned, smoky eggplant mash with peppers and tomatoes. The kidney beans in a traditional lobio salad are creamy, salty and well-oiled under their topping of chopped walnuts and cilantro. Main course names incline toward the allusive as well, with one chicken cutlet called \"Miracle of Village\" and another -- buried under a white pillow of cheese and cream sauce -- that goes by \"Mother In Laws Chicken.\" But really, the best place to go once all the amenities have been polished off is the kebabs. The quail may be a bit wizened. The grilled testicles with a hint of lemon in their lightly browned surfaces will always be a niche proposition. But the lamb ribs, the marinated lamb chops known as chalahac and the flatbread-wrapped Azerbaijani version of kofte called lulya kebabs (made from chicken or lamb) are extremely good. The vegetable skewer choices begin and end with blistered tomatoes and softly collapsing eggplant. Both are worthwhile. So is the side dish called \"homemade potatoes,\" if there is any room left on the table. Sliced and fried with onions, they narrowly beat out the pretty good fries. A cup or two of strong dark tea will speed your recovery from this onslaught. Dessert may not. Still, there is something to be said for trying a Napoleon made like baklava and a baklava made like a Napoleon. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

Starbucks, the company he joined after that trip and would eventually lead , might teach its employees the fine arts of Malaysian kopi, brewed by pouring hot water over grounds in the bottom of a sock, rather than show them how to operate an espresso machine. Instead of white-chocolate mocha lattes, we would drink bek-kopi, white coffee, brewed from beans that are lightly roasted in palm oil margarine. Venti would just be Italian for a number, while kopi-C kosong, or strong black coffee with unsweetened condensed milk, would have entered the American lexicon, along with kopi tarik, the same drink made with sweetened condensed milk. There would be no competitions where baristas drew swans and elephants in milk froth, and in their place we would have exhibitions of coffee and tea pulling , the art of cooling the beverage while coaxing the milk in it to form a foamy head by pouring it from one pot to another in long, swooping, steamy cataracts. In other words, the places where we get our caffeine fix might look a lot like Kopitiam , on East Broadway in Chinatown. Kyo Pang founded Kopitiam three years ago as a homage to the coffee and tea parlors of Malaysia, where she grew up. A typical Malaysian kopitiam is a ramshackle hangout where people drop in to read the morning paper, grab breakfast, catch up on neighborhood gossip and do all the other things that classically accompany a cup of tea or coffee. Something of that spirit pervades Kopitiam, too. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] The original Kopitiam, reviewed by Ligaya Mishan in a 2015 Hungry City column, was situated around the corner on Canal Street and had just four seats at a single counter. In June, Ms. Pang and her new business partner, Moonlynn Tsai, relocated to a larger, if still fairly intimate, space a few steps above the sidewalk. You order at the counter and receive a number on a metal stand, a kind of promissory note for the food and beverages. If you show up on a weekday in the morning or afternoon, when seats are not hard to come by and the room has a languid, unhurried air, you could get just a cup of bek-kopi and linger over it with a newspaper. You will probably want more than that, though. From 9 a.m., when the doors open, until 10 p.m., when they close, you can get nasi lemak, Malaysia's national dish and a particular favorite at breakfast. I don't know another kitchen in the city where the fragrances of coconut and pandan leaf infuse the rice as elegantly, or where the tiny dried fish, which Kopitiam fries with peanuts, form a caramelized crust that erases the distinction between sweet and savory. Or your breakfast could be a bowl of two eggs boiled just long enough to turn the whites opaque while leaving the yolks free to billow into mushroom-soy broth underneath. Or it might be fish ball soup, grape-size globes of ground fish in a cloudy white broth; if the grains of white pepper on the surface aren't intense enough for you, you can stir in a little fish sauce spiced with bird's eye chiles. Rice vermicelli can be added, too, but the soup is easier to appreciate in pure liquid form. For mornings when nothing but a cannonball dive into sugar will do, Kopitiam is ready with a sculptural pile of thick-cut French toast battered with Milo malt-chocolate powder, a Malaysian passion, with streams of sweetened condensed milk playing the part that in this country is normally taken by maple syrup. Eat the whole stack and you will know the answer to the musical question posed by the Cramps: How far can too far go? At 10:30 a.m. Ms. Pang, the chef, adds a gang of new dishes to the breakfast crew, and all of them stick around until closing time. There are fresh little oysters embedded in a thin browned omelet, rice noodles in a chilled sesame-oil broth with a growl of chile heat and spicy skate steamed in banana leaves, the classic acoustic version of the dish that Max Ng plays with amplifiers and wah-wah pedals at Momofuku Ssam Bar . Any of these could make a small meal. But one of the most inviting aspects of Kopitiam is Ms. Pang's fidelity to the Malaysian love of snacks. Pandan leaves wrapped around a kind of chicken sausage; ground five-spice pork rolled inside bean-curd skins and fried; fried strips of mackerel sausage with a curry-leaf sauce -- any of them makes a fine appetizer, but each could just as easily be the entire goal of a between-meals stop at Kopitiam. For that matter, so could the small sweets like pulut: triangular, pandan-wrapped bundles of sticky rice tinted with blue morning glory flowers and spread with toasted coconut sugar or house-made coconut jam. Ms. Pang is devoted to cakes as well. You get the sense that if it were physically possible, she'd bake every cake she knows every day, but she settles for one or two in an unpredictable rotation. You may find the caramel-brown honeycomb cake, with its intriguing structure of hollow vertical columns at the bottom, or you may find her coconut cake, or there may be some fresh surprise. Snacks and sweets tend to get edged out of the spotlight in New York restaurants, where there's always pressure to order something big. This is, after all, a city that turned the casual tapas bar into the peculiar genre known as the tapas restaurant. There is no such pressure inside Kopitiam, at least on weekdays. Weekend brunch is another story, as it often is. The menu is the same, but the crowds thicken. A sign-in sheet is kept outside the door, next to the pink pay phone (25 cents; it works), and hopeful customers sit on ceramic garden stools at the top of the stoop listening for their names. When you're finally called, you may feel silly getting nothing more than tannic milky tea and a bundle of blue sticky rice. And when demand peaks, chaos can creep in, suggesting that Kopitiam is still figuring out the mechanics of its larger space. Servers may pop by anxiously to ask, \"Did you get all your food?\" and the answer may be no. Drink orders may stack up. Once the white coffee was off the menu; another time, no coffee at all was being poured; and for a short time one day, both coffee and tea were unavailable, an awkward state of affairs for a coffee and tea parlor. Even with a backlog of tickets, though, the food trickling out of the kitchen is almost unfailingly terrific. Maybe the stir-fried duck tongues I ate last time could have slid from their cartilaginous framework more easily. Then again, maybe I wasn't in the right mood for duck tongues.

The restaurant was empty, too. I sat alone on one side of the counter, and on the other stood Mr. Wilcox, alone, as he usually is even when customers occupy all 12 chairs. Although assistants work in the wings, the restaurant is essentially a one-man show. In the broad view, having the place to myself was unjust. In the year since Mr. Wilcox took over the restaurant -- at first his work there was termed a residency or pop-up, but in June the owner, Idan Elkon, announced that he'd put a ring on it and made the arrangement permanent -- he has firmly placed it in the top tier of the city's Japanese restaurants. On the basis of sushi alone, Shoji has few plausible rivals, and for sushi embedded within a longer, kaiseki-derived menu, it has no parallel. There should be no empty seats, no matter how many New Yorkers are off lolling at the beach. Taking a selfish view, though, I wasn't particularly unhappy to be the only customer. Mr. Wilcox, who grew up in Virginia, cooked at a kaiseki restaurant in Kyoto called Kikunoi for seven years and then spent three more at a traditionalist sushi parlor in the Ginza district of Tokyo. You might think of this as the equivalent of earning a master's degree followed by a Ph.D. in Japanese cuisine, and one side benefit of a meal across the counter from Mr. Wilcox is the chance to hear what he learned studying abroad. Show some curiosity and you could get a short education in the mineral-rich clay used by potters in the town of Shigaraki, or the various aliases and false names under which a particularly delicious, pink-fleshed fish known as akamutsu in Japan travels under when it is away from home. On this August night, I was about to get a two-hour schooling on the pleasures of summer sushi. Mr. Wilcox's opening move was a squiggle of what looked like short, thick noodles and turned out to be lengths of chilled eggplant; Mr. Wilcox had given them a cool bath in the light sauce in which icy coils of somen noodles are dipped in summer. Laid over the top were two tongues of bafun sea urchin, a species with the color of a nearly ripe persimmon. With one dish, he had shooed away the heat outside, shown off the uncanny harmony of urchin and eggplant, and introduced a minor theme of the night, the summer urchin harvest in Japan. This overture out of the way, Mr. Wilcox lifted what appeared to be a machete. This was a hamo knife, a heavy swath of sharp steel that can reduce the daggertooth pike conger's dozens of tiny bones to edible smithereens; before the first one was forged in the 19th century, he explained, the eel had to be fully cooked and separated from its skeleton. This hamo would be quickly scorched on one side and served with a lick of wasabi and pur\u00e9ed salt-cured plums thinned with dashi. Sashimi came next in the form of shioko, or kanpachi caught when it is young and its flavor is leaner and softer than it will get later in the year. This was followed by a local fish that in the spring Mr. Wilcox had told me he didn't like, striped bass. He had been working with it, though, salting it overnight and then grilling it until the skin crackled. Now I don't want striped bass cooked any other way. After this was Mr. Wilcox's nod to the kaiseki tradition known as takiawase, a plate of simmered vegetables and, in this case, seafood: a small potato, some Japanese eggplant, a crisp pink ginger shoot and the most flavorful piece of octopus I have ever put in my mouth. After my first meal at Shoji I learned to hope that chawan mushi, a bowl of steaming-hot tofu custard, was on the menu. In spring Mr. Wilcox made it with spot prawns, but tonight, in homage to clambake season, he was serving lobster chawan mushi. To this point, the menu had faithfully followed kaiseki's ritualized sequence of courses and its stopwatch-precise attention to seasonality. It was about to veer in a different direction, but it was enough to suggest that Mr. Wilcox could open a kaiseki restaurant that would set a new standard in the city. I'm not sure the city would support it, but it would be spectacular while it lasted. The different direction, of course, was sushi. Accounting for just about half the Shoji menu, the sushi portion is briefer and offers less variety than the full monty at, say, Sushi Amane or Ginza Sushi Onodera . But I'm not sure any competitor outflanks Shoji on the quality of the seafood it does serve, or in the timeliness with which it serves up exactly the specimens most worth tracking down at any given moment. In spring, when bioluminescent firefly squid are spawning in Japanese bays, Mr. Wilcox gets them. In August, when cuttlefish are thumbnail size, unbelievably smooth and as meltingly soft as the thinnest sheet of nova at Russ & Daughters , he will lay three of those over a single finger of rice. He tracks bluefin that has been caught from healthy stocks, like the o-toro from Ireland that he served last spring and that was so seductive it could have been captioned \"the guy she told you not to worry about.\" While in Japan, Mr. Wilcox learned to make fresh ikura from sacs of salmon roe, a slow process that requires massaging the eggs apart by hand in many changes of water. Normally the roe is then heavily cured with sugar and salt, but the roe he was serving last month was very lightly seasoned before being spooned into a shot glass and served as is -- sticky, fatty, sweet and fresh. After the last piece of fish, the kaiseki format kicks in again with a soup, which may be as simple as a classic bowl of miso or may break with tradition, like the extraordinary corn soup I ate in August. There will be something cold and refreshing, maybe a granita made from ginger or matcha, and finally a more substantial dessert. Sometimes this is a sort of tart with seasonal fruit -- candied kumquats, maybe, or white peaches and blueberries -- arranged in a mochi wafer called monaka. For all this the charge is $252, service included. A shorter menu is available at $190, or a longer one at $295, again with service included. That service is somewhat minimal; lately it has meant a single employee assiduously refilling water glasses and taking orders from a drinks list whose cheapest item is a $12 bottle of beer. Could my server have been more adept at deciphering the wines, sakes, shochus and Haitian rums Mr. Elkon and Mr. Wilcox have put together? Perhaps, but I wouldn't necessarily want the scene cluttered by a sommelier in full pocket-square-and-cuff-links regalia. More employees hovering at the counter might take away from the bond Mr. Wilcox builds with the people he feeds. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

Unfair to the cuisine and unfair to would-be eaters. If you want a symbol for the state of the cuisine in New York City, Taste of Persia NYC will fit the bill. Until recently I might have called it the city's most promising Iranian kitchen, if the word kitchen weren't such a stretch. Taste of Persia is a takeout operation squeezed into the front window of a Chelsea pizzeria, except during the two months when fire damage forced it to take up temporary residence in a holiday market. It does show off some of the pleasures of the Iranian table, but not the table itself. So a new Brooklyn restaurant called Sofreh , which joined the Iranian ranks in June, would have caused a stir even if the cooking weren't quite as good as it is. The dining room is spare and modern, with exposed rafters, molded plywood chairs and shades of soft white. You have to look carefully to see the breaks with garden-variety minimalism, like the echoes of medieval arches behind the bar and the Persian calligraphy carved into the plaster in the back, where a small deck hangs above a garden. Minimalism surrenders entirely in the bathroom, papered in a pulpy collage of posters from pre-revolutionary Iranian cinema. All summer, Iranian expats and hopeful fans of Iranian cuisine have been filing in, armed with questions: Does the saffron rice stand high in voluminous heaps of discrete grains? Are nigella seeds embedded in the dimpled, golden crusts of the oval loaves of barbari? Do the cold shards of sorbet frozen around threads of noodles in Sofreh's faloodeh contain just enough rose water to soften the bite of lime syrup? Check, check and check. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] The main dining room is on the street level of a Prospect Heights brownstone just off Flatbush Avenue, and the food is largely in a domestic mode. Nasim Alikhani , who owns the restaurant with her husband, Theodore Petroulas, is responsible for the menu. Ms. Alikhani has never worked in a restaurant before. Rather than following the plating fashions of more trend-conscious chefs, she models the cooking after the things she might make when company comes over. Platoons of kebabs dominate the menus of other Iranian restaurants around town, but home kitchens are rarely built with vast indoor grills; Sofreh's cooking, entrusted to two chefs named Ali Saboor and Soroosh Golbabae, revolves around the oven and stovetop. A loaf of barbari, its crust baked to a Roman-pizza crackle in a revolving oven, is served with many of the appetizers, and it is always gone so soon that I end up ordering one or two more. This flatbread is of course ideal for tearing and swishing into the thick yogurt dips, one mixed with golden raisins and shredded cucumber, another with minced shallots and chives. It is indispensable with the eggplant mash enriched with walnuts, strained yogurt and sweet fried onions. A loaf of barbari is also spread with herbs and feta that is more creamy than briny. Earlier in the summer Sofreh offered an appetizer of dry, underseasoned beef meatballs with sour cherries. One of the only things on the menu that was hard to warm up to, it has been replaced lately by beef kofte, made light and tender by rice and stewed split peas. The kofte sit in a gentle saffron-tomato sauce that is another natural partner for Sofreh's bread. Ms. Alikhani, 59, grew up in the sprawling desert city Isfahan, and moved to the United States in her early 20s. For years she cooked Iranian dishes from memory, and it would be decades before she traveled back to Iran to learn more about its food in preparation for opening Sofreh. Her version of ash, the herb and whole-wheat noodle stew, stands out on the menu because it stays so close to tradition. Other dishes show the acclimatizing effect of New York. It's an article of faith for chefs in the city that any dish can be improved by putting a poached egg on it. I'm not so sure that Sofreh's smoked eggplant halves with their sweet, garlic-drenched tomato sauce need one, though. Is the watermelon feta salad familiar from restaurants that have nothing to do with Iran? Maybe just a bit, but Sofreh's version stands out for its intriguing sauce of nigella seeds crushed into mint oil. And while the Shiraz salad isn't chopped to fine bits in the traditional way that makes it something like Iran's answer to pico de gallo, its sour purple flecks of sumac distinguish it from the herd of tomato-cucumber assemblages. The menu is fairly concise, and occasionally I wished that it plunged into tradition with less restraint. For a dish called \"catch of the day,\" Ms. Alikhani has adapted ghalieh mahi, a tamarind-soured stew of fish and fresh herbs from southern Iran. In her version, a pan-seared hunk of whitefish -- halibut and cod have taken turns in the role -- is set over a long-cooked sauce. Dark with caramelized onions and fried cilantro and fresh fenugreek leaves, the sauce is hypnotically complex. Still, a sauce sitting under fish is not the same as one that has been cooked with fish so the flavors can get acquainted. A simple flattened and griddled half chicken, though, is a wonderful foil for a topping of tart barberries and a captivating sauce of dried Persian plums and saffron. And there's lovely simplicity to the braised lamb shank with roasted garlic and sizzled onions; the turmeric- and cinnamon-scented sauce might have been put on this earth to be spooned over fluffy rice. There is no shame in ending the meal with a goblet of thick yogurt parfait with jam and pistachios. But there are harder-to-find sweets, too, like the rose-water custard, grainy with rice flour, transformed into a sort of tart by a crust of chopped nuts. Saffron and rose-water ice cream is luxuriously rich despite a few stray ice crystals. And the faloodeh, one of the world's oldest frozen desserts, will put to rest all doubts about the wisdom of embedding sorbet in a nest of vermicelli, if there were any doubts to begin with.

When it opened in 1994, it was the first restaurant outside Los Angeles to offer Nobuyuki Matsuhisa 's startling new liaison of sushi and other Japanese food with Peruvian flavors. The herds of imitators were still to come. If you wanted to try raw yellowtail in ponzu under a green jalape\u00f1o wheel, or fried rock shrimp shimmering with spiced mayonnaise, or broiled black cod in miso so sweet it might have been maple syrup -- and for a few years it seemed as if that was all anybody wanted -- you either went to Matsuhisa in Beverly Hills, Calif., or you went to Hudson Street. Now you can eat Nobu ceviche in Dubai, Budapest and Cape Town. If you want Nobu sashimi salad for dinner followed by a night in a Nobu hotel, you can do that in Marbella, Manila, Miami or Palo Alto. When the United States Space Force establishes its first lunar base, the generals and majors will no doubt find a Nobu there, with tuna tataki on the menu and a line three-deep at the bar. This is because after the success of Nobu in TriBeCa, Mr. Matsuhisa and his partners made a strategic decision. The food would stay roughly the same -- more on this in a minute -- but the surroundings would grow bigger, boozier, louder, more theatrical. If Nobu did not exactly invent the Asian Party Temple restaurant genre, it certainly drew the blueprints. At these new Nobus, Mr. Matsuhisa's food was still a major event, but not necessarily the main event. And the question was not just whether you felt like eating at Nobu but whether you felt like being at Nobu. The Malibu location in particular has a reputation for intense good-time vibes that can drive away customers who merely want to eat. All this was encapsulated for me in two brief scenes from my recent meals at Nobu Downtown and Nobu Fifty Seven . The first episode took place while I was sitting at the sushi bar of Nobu Downtown. This location, inside the old AT&T tower on Lower Broadway, is theoretically the successor to the first Nobu; it opened last year a few weeks after the original closed. The sushi bar was the heart of the TriBeCa restaurant. The chefs behind it prepared or touched at least half the food, and seats there were so coveted that during the 1990s, when even celebrities complained about how hard it was to get in, a mostly sushi restaurant called Next Door Nobu was opened simply to contain the overflow. (It closed last year, too, and won't be replaced.) At Nobu Downtown, the upstairs sushi counter is on the far side of the cocktail bar that the design firm Rockwell Group slipped in among the enormous fluted limestone columns that fill the building's ground floor like a petrified forest. I had just eaten a piece of Japanese scallop sushi with a dangerous streak of wasabi when an animated group of four new arrivals appeared next to me. The sushi chefs eyed them warily, because they appeared to intend to cluster around a single stool, the way people do at a bar. Soon it became apparent that they thought they were at the bar. But the people they mistook for bartenders were all busy slicing raw fish, so eventually the group moved on to look for somebody to make them a drink. Moments like this didn't tend to happen at the original Nobu, but they do bring Nobu Downtown in line with Nobu Fifty Seven. In business on 57th Street since 2005, Nobu Fifty Seven is another two-story proposition. Between 5 and 7 p.m. its ground-floor lounge acts on young Midtown professionals like the fishing nets evoked by Rockwell Group's design. At the time the second scene took place, the bartenders looked as if they were struggling not to get caught. My cocktail, a Negroni-esque thing with sake in it that was ferried to my upstairs table from the downstairs bar, was neither shaken nor stirred; it was, in fact, almost hot. While I was waiting for the cocktail to be cooled by its single ice cube, a server was struggling to open a bottle of Champagne for a table of at least 10 men next to me. When the cork came out, he managed to spray the room in a manner usually seen in the Super Bowl champions' locker room. Everybody nearby got a little wet, including me and my guests, but nobody seemed to notice. Servers at both addresses have the brisk, well-drilled, impersonal and slightly numbed quality that comes of waiting on hundreds of people a day. At Nobu Fifty-Seven, one told me, \"Our menu is kaiseki style, so it's like tapas. Everything is meant for sharing.\" I must have looked confused because he added, \"Some dishes are going to be bigger than others.\" Nobu Fifty-Seven was given three stars in its last New York Times review , by Frank Bruni in 2005. That's what Ruth Reichl gave the original in 1995. After three recent visits to each location, I decided that, apart from minor menu variations, any qualitative difference in the food between the two branches is too subtle for me to make out. The chefs uptown are Taku Sato and Matt Hoyle. Downtown was led by Ricky Estrellado and Ryo Hasegawa until June, when Mr. Estrellado died suddenly. His successor has not been named. Both kitchens are models of superior ingredient shopping and consistent performance. When those classic Nobu dishes appear, they will be exactly like the last time you had them. In the case of the mayo-bathed fried shrimp, that may not be an entirely good thing. And I still think the flavor of the caviar that crowns tuna, or salmon, or yellowtail tartare gets elbowed out of the way by the wasabi-soy sauce. But the tiradito, slices of yellowtail squirted with lemon and yuzu juice, then dotted with pur\u00e9ed rocoto pepper, is always wonderfully bracing. The candylike black cod is as hard to deny as ever, even if the extra sweetening Mr. Matsuhisa gives this traditional Japanese dish strikes me as somewhat shameless. The sashimi salad and the lobster shiitake salads are both better than any salad from a global chain has the right to be. I don't know who orders the dishes marked Nobu Now, but I tried a few. Umami Chilean sea bass: not worth it, even for the slightly exotic return of a fish that hasn't been seen much since the '90s. Kumamoto shooters: a thrilling series of flavors that will recall the way you felt the first time you ate at Nobu. Michele Goldsmith's desserts, served both uptown and downtown, are modern and playful and don't try too hard to follow the theme, whatever that is. Over the years, the Hudson Street Nobu became something unusual, a restaurant that could serve tourists and families from around the corner with equal aplomb. But a meal at Nobu is still among the best, although not the cheapest, ways to introduce children to raw fish. And sitting at the sushi bar can still provide the intimacy that the rest of the place lacks. The chefs behind the counter may not draw the kinmedai cultists who flock to Sushi Zo or Sushi Ginza Onodera , but they know what they're doing, and they light up when they get a customer who can tell.

With its shelves of records, tapes, books, newspapers, dyed Easter eggs, the beeswax styluses used to give those eggs their symmetrical patterns, white smocks and blouses with red and black embroidery, and local honey, Surma Book & Music Company had operated on East Seventh Street since 1943. At other addresses, it went back to 1918. Two summers ago, it closed , going the way of Ukrainian butcher shops selling wrinkled sticks of hunter's sausage, Ukrainian restaurants offering starchy knobs of halusky, and Ukrainian bars where the customers were downing shots of vodka before that was cool, and kept going after it wasn't. The East Village is a less interesting place without Surma. But the chain-store monoculture that might have seemed inevitable as the Ukrainian community fell away hasn't been the neighborhood's fate. Not yet. New Chinese restaurants have sprung up in the area over the past few years faster than the old Eastern European business have died off. In January, one of them moved into Surma's old address. It's called Le Sia, and it's thriving. Walk in any weekend night between 6 and 9, and a small throng will be waiting for seats by the entrance, below the kayaks that are stowed up by the ceiling as if this were the garage of somebody's summer house. During the week, Le Sia takes reservations, but that doesn't ease the demand by much. On some nights, the crowd is almost exclusively Chinese people of college age or slightly older, many of them lured out of their nearby New York University dorm rooms for steaming pans of shellfish, especially Le Sia's specialty, crayfish. Although a server there described the restaurant to me as \"Cajun seafood,\" Le Sia is not serving Acadiana-style crayfish. Nor is it seasoning crayfish with the magical, butter-drenched combinations of Southeast Asian and Louisiana flavors like Thai basil-tamarind and lemongrass-ginger that were spawned in Vietnamese kitchens along Bellaire Boulevard in Houston. Yang Liu and Tianye Chen, who own the restaurant along with its chef, Zac Zhang, are following a separate, unbuttered Chinese tradition that they enjoyed before moving to the United States. It's a fairly young one, as Chinese food traditions go. Crayfish, or xiaolongxia, arrived in China sometime in the middle of the 20th century. After regarding the novel ingredient warily for a few decades, cooks built a cuisine around it. Eaters took to it so enthusiastically that by 2016 the Chinese crayfish industry employed five million people and was worth $27 billion. One major farming center is Hubei province, which recently unveiled a 59-foot-long crayfish sculpture that is said to be the world's largest. Its bright-red pincers are raised victoriously . Le Sia cooks crayfish and other shellfish -- lobster, shrimp, and Dungeness and snow crabs -- by boiling them first and then clacking them around in a hot wok with one of seven sauces. Each sauce can be further customized to one of four chile-heat levels, from mild to \"fire.\" Whatever combination of sea animal and seasoning you ask for, it will arrive at the table almost before the words have left your mouth. For many customers the go-to order seems to be \"crayfish hot and spicy, spicy.\" Hot and spicy sauce, as far as I can make out, is based on soy, miso and garlic; the firepower comes from sliced pickled chiles, but the soy and miso give it a muscular heft. It may be my favorite Le Sia sauce, although it's a close call between that and its near relative, \"numbing and spicy,\" which is propelled into tingling ma la territory by Sichuan peppercorns. I'm fascinated by the kimchi-lime sauce, which conforms to no seafood-boil tradition I know of; its flavor is angular, hybridized, invigorating and not as fiery as you might expect. The garlic sauce hits just one note, and there will be no prizes for guessing which one. There is also a sauce called \"thirteen special-flavor herbal spices.\" I tried it twice, with wildly divergent outcomes. The first time it was a wonderful, nuanced aromatic blend of expected and unexpected Chinese spices. On a second try, it tasted like spiced seawater. The star ingredient can vary, too. Honesty compels me to note that the California crayfish Le Sia has been serving lately have a sweeter, finer flavor than the ones it was getting from Louisiana in the late spring. This will no doubt cost me some friends in New Orleans. On the other hand, those friendships are already on the rocks over my newspaper's insistence on calling the crustacean in question crayfish, rather than crawfish. Le Sia's shrimp, in my encounters with it, was bland and powdery. Dungeness crab arrived overcooked, the meat desperately stuck to the shell. Snow crab was much better: sweet and flaky in the legs, although the white bits at the joints were slightly broken down. But every time I ordered lobster it was juicy and sweet. It may be the safest choice, although I haven't completely given up on the crayfish entirely. At $15 for what looks like a very generous pound, it's worth taking a chance. As for the risks of eating without a pair of plastic gloves, kept in plentiful supply in sealed pouches on the table, or one of the synthetic-fabric black bibs with their swirling red claw-and-antenna designs, that is up to you. A vast stretch of the menu is taken up by northern-Chinese skewers of vegetables and animal parts of many kinds. These tend to arrive even faster than the other dishes, if that's possible. They are not bad as quick, casual snacks, particularly the \"King of Kings\" hot dog, carved into pink lobes that stick out like cat tongues. But other skewers suggest an assembly-line approach that you don't find among the better street-corner grills in Flushing, Queens. The application of the cumin and red pepper seasoning is often just as heavy on delicate ingredients as full-flavored ones, and the grilling times don't seem to be monitored closely. Tiny squid legs, lamb kidneys and enoki mushrooms were all dry and overdone. So was a main course of quail, purportedly smoked over lemongrass and pine cones. Wok-fried clams in garlic sauce were delicious, though, as were many of the cold appetizers, like a rose formation of pickled radish slices; smashed cucumbers in garlic sauce; and Harbin sausage. A specialty of northern China, Harbin sausage immigrated there from Eastern Europe. Pink and dense with smoked pork and fat, it is deeply reminiscent of kielbasa. It's right at home in the East Village.

He was 16 at the time, but he'd been charging money for tasting menus since he was 13, running an early version of Eureka in his mother's house in the San Fernando Valley in California. Earlier this year he opened a restaurant on the Lower East Side that is meant to be permanent, or as permanent as any business venture in Manhattan can be. This one is called Gem, which if nothing else proves he's better at choosing names now that he's 19. I haven't yet seen the new documentary about him, \"Chef Flynn,\" but over the past six years my media diet has not been lacking in news about Mr. McGarry's productive adolescent years. I first learned about him from a brief New Yorker piece written when he was 13, by which time he had made many of the recipes in \"The French Laundry Cookbook\" and cooked for a week at Eleven Madison Park. He was working several days a week in a Los Angeles restaurant and had apprenticed at Next and Alinea by 15, when he was the subject of a Times Magazine article . When he moved himself and his pop-up to New York at 16, I read that his cooking was influenced by his time in the kitchens of Maaemo in Norway and Geranium in Denmark. Still, as I walked into Gem the first time I was wondering, at some level, whether everyone had been too polite to tell him that his brownies needed more time in the oven. Of course, it would be nice to have the answer to that before you buy advance tickets for the eight- to 12-course meal at $155 a person, the only way to reserve a seat. But it doesn't take more than a few minutes at Gem to see that the adults weren't just humoring Mr. McGarry. His cooking is nuanced, his plating is often lyrical and the flavors, at least this spring and summer, have been delicate, subtle and very fresh. The vegetables and fruits he uses in profusion look and taste as if they had dropped off the vine right on to the hand-spun, earth-toned ceramic dishes. My favorite Gem dish so far, delicate and self-assured, was a morsel or two of grilled king crab legs lightly glazed with rose petal miso and set beside soft chamomile-scented potatoes for ballast, red currants for zing and some fluttering rose petals on top for the heck of it. A close rival was the chilled bowl of barely vinegared mackerel interwoven with grilled cucumbers, sliced plums and salty red dabs of mashed fermented plums. The harmonies were right on key, with a Japanese mood that didn't cross the line into outright imitation. White asparagus, an ingredient that seems to flummox some American kitchens, was subjected to a wonderful treatment, patiently browned and basted in butter, then finished with a reduced chicken jus that had a glimmer of vadouvan in it somewhere. Strewing the plate with tender, pale-green pine needles seemed like an affectation at first, but their flavor lifted and brightened the whole package. Mr. McGarry does fine work with deeper flavors, too. Each menu crescendos in a complicated, multicomponent spread, and the best of these featured lamb: barbecue ribs rubbed with cracked coriander seeds and XO sauce, plus a skewered grilled lamb kebab and a tomato salad. Another night built up to an exhibition of squab. A leg, perfectly cooked and sweetened by a maple jus, was very good, but the high point was a very thin and hearty rye cracker spread with squab liver, cherries and pickled ramps; the fruit's bright notes were played off against earthier ones so skillfully they almost shimmered. Back in the family home, and at the Eureka pop-up, Mr. McGarry used to make everything himself. Now he works alongside two cooks, bringing the kitchen team at Gem to the same size as that of my neighborhood slice joint. Some small defeats could be attributed to Mr. McGarry's lack of experience with weather patterns in the Northeast. A warm beet, languorously braised in smoked beet juice until it is soft and sticky like salt water taffy and then basted with a beet-based bordelaise sauce, was impressive in June. In July's heat wave it was as welcome as a space heater. And maybe he wouldn't have served starchy grilled peas if he'd known how quickly the summer sun can make them tough. By the way, Mr. McGarry doesn't make brownies, at least not at Gem. Dessert after each of my three meals was more or less the same thing: bowls of ripe berries, served one night with whipped cream infused with chamomile and rose hips and another time with bay leaf and bee-pollen ice creams. You couldn't ask for a more refreshing course on a hot summer night, but at the same time it's clear that he has room to grow as a pastry chef. Dessert is served on low coffee tables in a loungey space called the Living Room, which by day doubles as a cafe selling pastries and sandwiches on housemade bread. Rousting diners from their tables in the dining room (called, aptly enough, the Dining Room), probably seemed like a good idea on paper, but in reality it's a bit silly. It's one of several hiccups that keep a meal at Gem from gliding smoothly along. Servers may shoot their cuffs before fiddling with some small detail of the table setting, a fussiness that is not in keeping with the graceful, relaxed tone of the cooking. Wine glasses could sit empty for long stretches and the wines themselves, both whites and reds, were almost always too warm. That Mr. Flynn is more polished as a chef than a restaurateur is understandable. He may need a more experienced partner to straighten out the dining room, and to help him edit the menus, too. With each meal, I had the sense there were at least two superfluous courses, and occasionally Mr. McGarry seems to be straining as he reaches for the sort of razzle-dazzle you'd get at Alinea or Eleven Madison Park. An elaborate lobster course one night looked amazing, but wasn't. An attempt at eggplant carnitas, with an underseasoned salsa of green strawberries and a charred, papery tortilla, was enough to make you wish Mr. McGarry had eaten more tacos before he left California. At times Mr. McGarry seems like a creative-writing student who fills his pages with footnotes because David Foster Wallace did it. It's too bad that he came of age in an era when many people believe that tasting menus are the highest form of kitchen artistry. Like the style of \"Infinite Jest,\" those menus have to be the result of ideas that can't be contained any other way; they're not a blank space to be filled in. Mr. McGarry obviously learned a lot from his mentors, but he can cook in his own voice now, and it may be time to leave his idols behind.

Then he rewrote it. French chefs who covet Michelin stars study the restaurants that get them, and the ones that don't, before deciding where to devote their money and attention. If there is a formula behind the rating system, which for many chefs is an article of faith, almost no one figured it out the first time. Jo\u00ebl Robucho n, who died on Monday at 73 , came closer than anyone . Mr. Robuchon's first restaurant, Jamin, was given one Michelin star in its first year. It got another in its second, and the next year it climbed to the top step, a three-star ranking. Mr. Robuchon was still in his late 30s. What could he do for his next trick? There were new dishes to invent, new honors to win, new employees to terrify. The chef Eric Ripert, who was one of them , has said that he still has nightmares about covering plates with the precisely sized and spaced dots of sauce that were a Jamin signature. Playing the kitchen tyrant, regularly berating young cooks for mistakes nobody else would notice, Mr. Robuchon embodied the old order. At the time, this boot-camp style of running a kitchen was state of the art. But it had already come to seem counterproductive, disrespectful and unprofessional long before his death. In retrospect, the internal forces that he gave vent to when he screamed at his cooks must have also tormented Mr. Robuchon. For most of his career he was restless, unsatisfied. At 51, he tried to retire; of course, it didn't last. In 2003 he returned, and this time he seemed determined not to give the Michelin inspectors what they wanted. L'Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon , his comeback, was staged in a former sushi bar in Paris. He retained the basic setup. Diners sat at a counter, and rather than nigiri and maki, they ate his spoonable pommes pur\u00e9es and langoustines fried inside a single leaf of paper-thin pastry. There were no tablecloths, no chandeliers, no elaborately carved and upholstered chairs that might have come from a garage sale at Versailles. Food was cooked behind the counter by chefs dressed in the same black tunics the servers wore. Sometimes the chefs even placed the dish in front of the diner. The French daily Le Figaro summed up the general reaction when it proclaimed, \"C'est une revolution!\" If you think the Figaro was overreacting, it's because the revolution succeeded. Today, expensive dining is more likely to mean stools and a counter than dining tables on a sea of carpeting. The trappings that Mr. Robuchon stripped away -- the linens, the large dining rooms, the kitchens kept out of sight -- were not just costly to maintain but, by that point, increasingly off-putting, especially to younger diners. Today we don't expect -- or even want -- carpeted, hushed spaces when we go out for meticulously prepared food. Mr. Robuchon was not the only chef of that era hoping to add to the restaurant experience by means of subtraction. In the same year, Paul Kahan and Donnie Madia opened Avec in Chicago, a long skinny restaurant dominated by its counter. Sitting on a bar stool was synonymous with eating at the chef David Chang's Momofuku restaurants in the first few years of his career, from Noodle Bar in 2004, to Ssam bar in 2006, to Ko in 2008. The project of burying the old-fashioned signifiers of luxury and replacing them with new ones has been, in fact, one of the major themes pursued by chefs over the past 15 years. But nobody made a splash doing it like Mr. Robuchon. And in the second stage of his career, he planted Ateliers around Asia, Europe and North America, accumulating 31 Michelin stars . No other chef has as many. This time, he had set the formula. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

Those who did may now be having flashbacks to a rustic-chic Tuscan-esque restaurant, Coco Pazzo, which got a three-star Times review from Marian Burros in 1991 , and to its three New York siblings, all long gone. A restaurateur's name may be emerging from the mists of time -- the name is Pino Luongo -- and linked to it, the names of other vanished restaurants, Le Madri , Mad. 61 , Amarcord and Tuscan Square. For readers of tabloid gossip columns, images of pasta-twirling models and executives in Armani suits may be coming into focus, along with bold-face-laden squibs about the social scenes at Mr. Luongo's establishments in Wainscott, N.Y., and on St. Barts. If you have trouble believing that spaghetti and fettuccine once attracted what The Times critic Bryan Miller, reviewing Le Madri in 1989 , called \"the hugs-and-kisses-I-love-your-hat-Ciao-baby crowd,\" it may be useful to remember that this was an era when pasta was commonly thought to be a health food. Nobody has seen the Ciao-baby crowd in a while. (We'll have to send out a search party if it's not back in 10 more years.) So far that is not who goes to Coco Pazzo Trattoria , which is shaping up to be a reliable and fairly priced neighborhood canteen on the SoHo corner that used to house a deliberately unstylish bar called Milady's . On balance, Mr. Luongo's version of Tuscan food retrofitted for American appetites may be easier to see for what it is now that it has lost its fashionable gloss. (He is the executive chef; Pedro Cruz is his chef de cuisine.) When you order pappa al pomodoro and taste the juicy olive oil that slicks the warm, basil-flecked, bread-thickened tomato pulp, you're not earning bragging rights. You're eating soup, and a very good one. Nobody will think you're a culinary trailblazer if you get the cacciucco, either, but you can console yourself with the tender shrimp, scallops, cod and clams in the faintly spicy and fennel-scented broth. There are two ways to approach dinner at Coco Pazzo Trattoria. (By day the place is a casual outfit called Coco Pazzo Kitchen.) One is to order what Mr. Luongo calls a piatto unico, a helping of pasta next to a related something-extra on one rectangular plate. Baked littlenecks wobble next to a twirl of linguine and, nice surprise here, ribbons of zucchini soaking in a fine white clam sauce that is made with just the firm, sweet bits. Soft chicken-and-ricotta polpettine sit next to rigatoni in sugo, not on top, so you can have pasta first and meatballs second and tell yourself you're eating like a real Italian. Alternatively, you might go with the main courses marked \"Per La Tavola.\" For once these plates really are meant for sharing: a substantial stack of spiced and roasted baby-back ribs under a warm slaw of cucumbers and tomatoes, or a spread of grilled rib-eye slices served with a separate plate of \"Tuscan fries,\" distinguishable from the regular kind by their fried rosemary needles. Those fries may be awesomely browned one week but ghostly and uncrisp the next. The tagliolini cooked in the cacciucco broth as a second course after all the seafood has been eaten might be 60 seconds away from being al dente. I am not enthusiastic about the slightly tough squid in moist bread crumbs, baked rather than fried, although the dish has a following at Mr. Luongo's other restaurant, Morso, next to the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge. The souffl\u00e9s that the servers try to sell halfway through the meal can be a little soupy. But the blueberry crostata is a genuine pleasure, its crust likably sweet and tender. And you'll appreciate the clean, bright flavors of a shot of Aperol dumped over grapefruit granita if, like me, you veer off-script and follow your piatto unico with a couple of main courses. SPEAKING OF laid-back restaurants where you can enjoy a pleasant and unpretentious summer meal, have you been to Yves? It opened without much of a splash about two years ago, despite occupying a handsome, spare dining room whose white interior makes the most of the afternoon sunlight that hits its TriBeCa corner, opposite the restaurant Locanda Verde. I missed the original chef's tenure, but lately I've been intrigued by the cooking of Alex Baker, who took over in February. She is Paris-trained, having gone to culinary school and worked at Spring and Le Chateaubriand there, before coming to New York to help open Rebelle in 2015. At Yves, she interprets French food with an appealingly relaxed, seasonal attitude. In early June she brought little bright-green favas and sticks of asparagus together with fresh-herb pappardelle, and if you're wondering what makes that French, the answer is a pistou loaded with tarragon and chervil. There was also a reassuringly gentle navarin of lamb, with a small spring garden in addition to the customary carrots and potatoes: grilled baby leeks and asparagus stalks, and tender chard stems. Pan-fried steelhead trout is on the menu now, with a smooth, pale-green sauce of cucumbers, melons and avocados pooling beneath a jumble of warm young cucumbers. So is a side dish of recently picked pole beans and string beans charred on the grill and dressed with toasted-almond vinaigrette. As interpreted by Ms. Baker, mussels Proven\u00e7al are not the usual mound of black shells in thin pink liquid with a few slices of baguette; the shells are gone, the mussels are good fat ones and their sauce is more concentrated, augmented with tomato paste and roasted cherry tomatoes and garnished with thick-crusted cubes of toasted bread. The snails are more traditional, parsley-garlic butter sloshing around in their shells. If these land snails wondered what they were doing on a bed of seaweed, they didn't show it. There is some unevenness in the kitchen to be worked out. The fluke meuni\u00e8re may be saut\u00e9ed to a textbook golden crackle, or it could arrive looking as pale as a fish belly. The country ham sandwich could use bread that's easier to chew than the crust-armored baguettes from Bien Cuit. The restaurant is large, and service tends to arrive in rapid bursts separated by long pauses. The wine list is very lopsided in favor of three-figure bottles, an irritating move for a fairly casual spot. But Ms. Baker seems to be making the best of it. It's hard to be cross with a restaurant that makes its own boursin and brings it out in a dish so big I could never manage to finish it, even with a stack of toasted baguette to smear it on.

One thing that sets it apart is that it doesn't have a name. Credit-card receipts call it \"Momofuku Ko,\" even though it operates in its own little room with its own entrance. The door, a few steps past Ko's along the East Village alley known as Extra Place, is marked \"Ko.\" The menus don't give a name at all. They don't look much like menus, either. They're notebooks in which the items available, presented in a short \u00e0 la carte list (in contrast to the hourslong tastings offered for $255 at Ko), are handwritten on a fresh page each day, by different employees using different pens. The date is at the top over a list of dishes that you will not find together anywhere else. Lately there has been a lucid, refreshing plate of raw sea scallops, sliced cold and mixed with fresh green shiso and folds of pineapple, red with ground chiles. Lightly cured fillets of sardine made a thrilling appearance last month in a brick-red oil flavored with paprika, cayenne, and other components of tandoori paste. Both were solidly in the tradition of Momofuku small plates that the world has known since Mr. Chang's Ssam Bar began remixing various Asian ideas after-hours. Both were wonderful. The savory pie stuffed with fresh-made pork sausage patties comes from another place entirely. You could tour the city's proudest French restaurants without coming across a more skillfully done puff pastry crust, notched like a pinwheel and baked to a deep mahogany. The pie costs $45 and typically serves two, sliced into half-moons. It is plated with a reduction sauce, as classical and French as it gets but with an insistent vein of acidity that somehow makes it modern. Even if you're used to the signature Momofuku move of white-knuckle bungee jumping from the high end to the low, certain juxtapositions may call for Dramamine. Alongside the masterly pork pie, you can find a $5 sandwich of pickled daikon and cucumber sticks inside a grilled and buttered Martin's hot dog roll. The pickle sandwich is just the thing to eat with the cold fried chicken that is battered three times, fried four times, brushed with a spicy mirin-yuzu glaze and served nearly at refrigerator temperature. I don't believe I've used that phrase approvingly in a review before, but then I don't think a restaurant has served me cold fried chicken as good as this before. By flipping through the menu pages you can pinpoint the dates when dishes were first served, and see others that came and went. The idea is for Ko's executive chef, Sean Gray, to use the bar as a \"field for research and development for our culinary team,\" according to the website. Ideas are auditioned or refined before they graduate to Ko, which I gave three stars in a 2015 review . Most menus, at least the ones that change over time, are works in progress, but few make that explicit the way the one at Ko's bar does. The cynical way to look at this is that bar customers are paying to serve as lab rats. This will not be everyone's idea of a fun night out. One recent evening, the menu was as meat-heavy as at Ssam Bar in the era when its menus still proclaimed, \"We do not serve vegetarian-friendly items.\" Among the more substantial dishes that night was a mixed-meat sausage stuffed into a chicken neck and grilled. One end of the neck was open. The other was still attached to the chicken's head. It was a sensational sausage, but it did nothing to make Ko's bar the kind of place that you'd take your new pescatarian friend. The bar, run collaboratively by Mr. Gray and Su Wong Ruiz, the general manager, works best for diners who don't need a multitude of choices to be happy. To the extent that it resembles other places, it's probably most similar to a wine bar, with its tight menu, its casual drop-in-and-stay-awhile air and its carefully considered list of wines by the glass, which it shares with Ko. Anyone who wants a whole bottle can order one from the full Ko list, a virtual who's who of cult winemakers in certain specialties such as grower Champagne, chenin blanc from the Loire Valley and Burgundy of all stripes. On the notebook page facing the handwritten menu are two more wines that Ambrose Chiang, the beverage director, is pouring by the glass for one day only. Recently I've lucked into a precisely shaped C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie from Domaine Jasmin and a Saumur from Romain Guiberteau whose self-assurance I envied. These specials can cost twice as much as the regular by-the-glass pours, which tend to fall between $15 and $25. I can't figure out why the wine-geek crowd doesn't bring tents and sleeping bags to camp out at Ko's bar. And I don't understand why the place is almost never crowded, despite getting a fair amount of press after it opened. The experimental nature of the menu can't be keeping people away; people expect that from Momofuku restaurants . The only dish that I thought wasn't totally successful was the fried zucchini made in the style of the fried chicken, and I was still glad I tried it. The prices are all over the place, but a meal here doesn't need to be expensive. While you are welcome to spend $100 on a sourdough crepe with 50 grams of white-sturgeon caviar, you can just get the crepe alone for $8. It is excellent: shiny with tangy cave-age butter, speckled with oregano cinders and crunchy from a pass over hot Japanese charcoal. The chicken, meanwhile, is $7 a piece. The only reason I can think of for the empty seats is that the place is so hard to sum up.

(Want to get California Today by email? Here's the sign-up .) The police briefing on a hostage-taking at a Trader Joe's in Silver Lake that gripped Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon had just ended. But as Mayor Eric M. Garcetti started walking away, reporters stopped him for one more question. What did Mr. Garcetti have to say about the death of Jonathan Gold? Mr. Gold, 57, was the restaurant critic for The Los Angeles Times. For anyone outside of Los Angeles, it is difficult to appreciate what kind of an outsized figure Mr. Gold was in the fabric of the city he called home: much more than just another restaurant reviewer or hometown institution. It was not at all surprising that Mr. Gold's death merited a question to the mayor, followed by an official tribute from City Hall. Or that it inspired a day of tributes from shocked admirers. (He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in early July.) \"We are all so heartbroken,\" Roy Choi, the chef behind Kogi, a Korean taco food truck, said on Instagram . For many people, the joy of Saturday mornings was turning -- even before coffee -- to Mr. Gold's latest inside the Saturday section. The more devout of his fans plucked the reviews off the internet the night before. His reviews sent people scurrying to all corners, and produced lines-out-the-door waits at what otherwise might be unknown restaurants, like Jitlada or Chengdu Taste. You could tell they were Jonathan Gold patrons by the way they peered at their phones, consulting his review before ordering. His annual list of the best 101 restaurants was a road map: Working through it (or claiming you did) was a competitive rite of passage. (And so was arguing over some of his rulings: Was Vespertine in Culver City the best restaurant of the year?) In a world of anonymity, Mr. Gold was unmissable: A friend described him as \"a combo of Falstaff and Custer.\" He was a celebrity, but he was warm, engaging and lacking pretension. Saturday mornings are going to feel a little empty now. \u2022 Here's his obituary in The Los Angeles Times. [ The Los Angeles Times ] Along with notable reviews for the paper.

Meeting deadline was not his strong suit. But then, she recalls, he'd turn in something so darn good you'd forgive him. \u2022 The chef Kris Yenbamroong credits Mr. Gold with saving Night+Market , which had been struggling until the critic came to visit . \u2022 And Eater lets us hear from Mr. Gold in his own words . \u2022 On N.W.A., for L.A. Weekly , in 1989. \u2022 On Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, for Rolling Stone , in 1993. \u2022 Mr. Gold wrote this essay about his neighborhood and L.A. after the riots tore the city apart in 1992. \u2022 He famously ate his way down Pico Boulevard and wrote about it in this 1998 story for L.A.

In name at least, this is the fourth incarnation of the pizzeria that Anthony Mangieri founded in 1996 in Point Pleasant Beach, N.J. He has never run more than one Una Pizza Napoletana at a time; each time he moves to a new location, he closes the old one. In the East Village ( 2004 - 9 ) and San Francisco ( 2010 - 17 ), he essentially stuck to the routine he had established in New Jersey. At the two-month-old location on the Lower East Side, though, he is in business with two chefs, Jeremiah Stone and Fabi\u00e1n von Hauske Valtierra, whose sensibilities are wildly different from his own. Their two other restaurants, Wildair and Contra , are very contemporary and European in outlook. A meal at either one makes it obvious that Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have carefully studied Copenhagen's foremost exponents of fermentation and foraging. Nothing about Mr. Mangieri's rigorously traditional pizza indicates that he could find Copenhagen on a map. The three of them do have common traits. They take their cooking extremely seriously, favor simplicity and aren't interested in easy ways out. So their collaboration -- Mr. Mangieri is the pizza guy, of course, while his new partners handle appetizers, desserts and drinks -- might not be doomed, but it isn't exactly off to a promising start. The problem isn't the common one of strengths in one area undermined by bad performance in others. Una Pizza Napoletana is almost all strengths, but they're at war with one another. Mr. Mangieri is a purist's purist. His dough runs on wild yeast. For each batch, he mixes a lump of starter into Sicilian sea salt, finely ground Italian flour and water. With this he makes a crust that is delicious on its own, a minimum requirement for great pizza. He makes pies in only one size, a wheel about 12 inches across. There are five on the menu most nights. None are topped with more than four ingredients, or six if you count oil and salt. On Friday and Saturday nights a sixth, more complicated pizza is offered. Requests for substitutions or added toppings are not entertained on any night. There is no point asking Mr. Mangieri to put pepperoni on a margherita or Buffalo chicken and blue cheese on a marinara. You would have better luck persuading the driver of the M5 bus to pop a wheelie on Fifth Avenue. The pies are at least as extraordinary as the ones he used to make in the East Village. They may be better. I don't remember the imported buffalo mozzarella's giving the pies the flavor of melted cultured butter back then, the way it does now. And did the tomato sauce -- pulp, really -- always have the same natural, sun-ripened sweetness? Especially on the marinara, unobscured by cheese and seasoned only with dried oregano, fresh basil and raw garlic, it's almost hypnotic. The Concetta pie, which has four varieties of tomato treated four separate ways, probably would have been beyond his abilities as a chef in the Jersey Shore days. He makes it only on Fridays, which is too bad, because it's great. The everyday pie called the Filetti, made with buffalo mozzarella and ripe red cherry tomatoes, manages to be surprising while sticking to Mr. Mangieri's strict principles. It's a personal creed that achieves transcendence -- his \"My Way,\" to put it in New Jersey terms. I ate one non-transcendent pie at the new Una Pizza Napoletana, a Bianco, which is topped with buffalo mozzarella, raw garlic and basil. It was excellent the next time I had it, and I immediately knew what had been missing: salt. All the pies are $25. That is a lot for pizza. On the other hand, it is only about $2.50 more than what Mr. Mangieri charged when he first came to Manhattan in 2004, once you adjust for inflation. Then again, people said he charged a lot for pizza in 2004 . Mr. Mangieri and his wood-fueled oven are located at the back of the dining room, enclosed by glass on three sides. No doubt this helps keep the wood fire from wilting the customers like basil leaves, but it's hard not to see it as a metaphor for the restaurant. Mr. Mangieri's pizzas leave the glass box, but his sensibility doesn't. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have put their own point of view on everything else, and it's not the point of view of a pizzeria. Everybody knows how to eat in a pizzeria; most of us have been doing it since we were kids. The choices are few and relatively predictable. Even when the pizzas are topped with weird stuff, you basically know what you're getting. At the new Una Pizza Napoletana, only the pizzas are predictable. What are bland chunks of white asparagus under a yellow powder of cured egg yolk and bottarga doing here? Not making new friends, I promise you. There's a fine, tender panna cotta with fresh fruit for dessert. One night the strawberry syrup spooned over it was essentially strawberry vinegar; on another night, its sweet-sour ratio was back in alignment. The other desserts I tried -- a bittersweet tiramis\u00f9 with a welcome crackle of caramel hidden in its layers, and some pure-tasting, impossibly smooth, eggless ice creams, including a pistachio flavor that has to be tasted to be believed -- won me over from the beginning. None of the other appetizers were as charmless as the white asparagus. A freshly shucked sea scallop seasoned with translucent strips of lemon peel and individual dots of couscous was exceptional. And raw lobster surrounded by chickpeas was wonderfully jittery with an Italian citrus-chile paste. But the chefs serve it in a form -- a chopped mass of unidentifiable goo -- that can't help but look off-putting. That dish would fit right in at Wildair; here, among the tomatoes and mozzarella, it seems to be trying too hard. The same goes for the wine list. As they have done in their other places, Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske focus on natural wines. These wines can be mercurial, and the way the list is written only adds to the confusion. Almost no varietals are named, and you can't tell much from the Italian regions, which include such major hubs as Irpinia and Solicchiata. When, helplessly, you accept a server's offer of assistance, you'll be asked what you intend to eat with your wine. Are there any people other than sommeliers who want to talk at length about pairing particular wines with particular pizzas? I've never met them and if I do, I'm sending them off to be deprogrammed. Discussing the list, tasting a few samples, trying to find something that fits your idea of a good pizza wine (yes, for some reason there are wines on the brief list that don't taste especially good with any pizza) -- all this slows down the pace, which isn't especially brisk to begin with. By the end of the night, your meal can last twice as long and cost twice as much as it would at almost any other pizzeria in town. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske aren't doing bad stuff at Una Pizza Napoletana, but often they're doing the wrong stuff. They and Mr. Mangieri have taken one of the most accessible styles of restaurant dining and made it complicated and a little intimidating. Una Pizza Napoletana doesn't need to be predictable. But it could be more intuitive.

The song is about what you do once you figure out that you're not going to get the real thing, and Mr. Johansen's answer is simple enough. \"Let's just dance,\" he sings. Never mind love. Frenchette , which opened in TriBeCa in April, isn't fake French, but it isn't the real thing, either. Since 1997, when Keith McNally hired them as the opening chefs at Balthazar , Mr. Nasr and Mr. Hanson have cooked side by side, building a kind of brasserie-steakhouse hybrid out of standards from both genres. Mr. McNally kept loading them up with new restaurants, giving them joint command of Pastis, Schiller's Liquor Bar and Minetta Tavern , none of which could really be called chef-driven. Frenchette, their own place and their first without Mr. McNally, takes some liberties with the formula, but not enough to get them recognized as visionaries on the level of Pierre Gagnaire . Frenchette says: Never mind art, let's just cook. The restaurant is divided into two chambers. In front and on display to the street is a lounge with Art Deco curves, where bartenders percussively clack shakers behind a long river of zinc. If you have a seat, this room is the height of metropolitan civility. If you are waiting for one, as many people are on any given night, it's purgatorial. The dining room is in back, behind a pair of arches and up a step so slight that its only conceivable purpose is to raise the insurance premiums; every time I approached it a worried server materialized to tell me to look out. The small tables are too small and the big ones, encircled by red-leather banquettes the size of living-room sofas, give you enough space to spread out a map while you eat. The room is grandly scaled and conspicuously underdesigned, a simplification of the brasserie archetype that doesn't try to reproduce every chipped tile and nicotine stain. It's a room for people who have outgrown illusions. That must describe half the people in New York, judging by the number of times I've been asked how to get a reservation at Frenchette at an hour when an adult might reasonably be in the mood for dinner. Even well-placed magazine editors with highly resourceful assistants can end up eating at 6 or 10 p.m., as I did. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] In the brasserie mode, the menu rambles. It goes on too long; not everything on it is worth rambling about. But once you sort it out, it's full of dishes worth planning a night around. Some of them don't look wildly impressive unless you know how they're made. For each order of brouillade, a pan of eggs has to be stirred constantly over a small flame for a long time, until they look like grits. (There's a reason you don't see brouillade on many menus.) Dropped on top are a few excellent snails in parsley and garlic, a buttery garnish for very buttery scrambled eggs. Calf's liver was sweet and custardy, the goal in cooking it, and one that's not often reached. Sweetbreads with creamy white insides were fried to a pale, crinkled gold, then served with a brown, French, lovely and anachronistic sauce made from veal jus and crayfish. Lobster was roasted on a rotisserie, sending some of the shell's flavor into the meat, which was then given a very luxurious bath in curry butter. The entire roast chicken is juicy without tasting of brine, a rare thing these days. Hidden under the drumsticks and thighs are rafts of baguette that sat under the rotisserie, imbibing every drop that fell from the bird. Some diners might say bread wet with drippings is too homespun for a dish that costs $68. They don't know what they're talking about. The menu is full of things that take years of practice to get right. Duck breast with a side of fries sounds ridiculously simple, but look at the crackle on that duck skin, and listen to that echoing crunch on the fries. If these chefs learned anything from Mr. McNally, it's that people will overlook many lapses if you feed them great French fries. At Frenchette, they overlook the peculiar steak knife brought out with the duck; its sharp side is straight and its dull side is curved, and everybody who picks one up makes a joke about slicing open a finger. That would be one way to turn tables faster, but I never saw any casualties. The kitchen is at its most sure-footed with big pieces of animals, whether they're classed as appetizers or main courses. (The guinea hen terrine appetizer is a chunky pink brick that could serve as dinner.) All those meats, combined with the chefs' fondness for fat-enhanced sauces that cling to your lips, give the menu a wintry feel, something that the recent proliferation of peas and artichokes on the plates here doesn't quite hide. So far, Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr have responded to the hot weather by changing ingredients but not the menu's spirit. Green celtuce stems can be a nice crisp side dish for summer, but Frenchette serves them in a steaming-hot gratin, slick with bone marrow; it's perfect for January. The blood sausage slab on top of a buckwheat galette that surfaced at the end of June was as seasonal as earmuffs. Reversing the natural order of the universe, the appetizers and the smaller \"amuses\" often seem more tentative than the main courses. Blowfish tails brushed with mustard and spice-bearing bread crumbs are terrific when they're available, and the chefs should get some kind of award from the French government for serving iced oysters Burgundy-style, with peppery finger-length chipolata sausages. But gumball-size smoked eel beignets with a cr\u00e8me-fra\u00eeche ranch dressing called \"Franchette\" didn't taste much like eel; pig-foot croquettes were a washout; and a bowl of oily whole-wheat spaghetti with bottarga needed to be slapped with more lemon and salt. With desserts, Frenchette tries the blunt approach that works so well for its main courses, and comes up short. Not very short, but enough to make you wish more attention were being paid. The mille-feuille doesn't shatter on impact like the ones at Le Coq Rico or Benoit , and the pastry crust under the long band of cooked fruit in the apple tart needs to be crisper or more buttery. One of the more clever moves Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr made is hiring Jorge Riera to shepherd a list of natural, biodynamic and organic wines. Not every sommelier who has become infatuated with these labels knows where to find the good stuff, but he does. This means, though, that you will probably not end up drinking what you thought you wanted to drink. There are few safe harbors of familiarity; even if you just want sparkling water, you have a choice of Vichy Catalan or Mondariz. You'd have to be delusional to wager money on the longevity of a restaurant in New York, but Frenchette is the closest thing to a safe bet that I've seen in years. Mr. Nasr and Mr. Hanson seem to be in it for the long haul; if one of them hasn't held the other's head down in a pot of French onion soup by now, it's probably never going to happen. More than that, they know how to flatter New Yorkers with food that doesn't scream for attention but that smiles back when you notice it.

The details were hazy in my mind until a few weeks ago, when a woman sheathed in a kimono carried a pot of it to my table at Restaurant Nippon on East 52nd Street. There it was: the onions, shiitake caps, bok choi stems, tofu blocks and the frizzy mop of noodles under a cloud of steam. The thin slices of beef going from red to pale pink. The hot broth that is based on soy and mirin but that strangely, magically tastes like French onion soup. The raw egg that, thanks to some long-forgotten cook's flash of greatness, serves as a dipping sauce. This refresher course would have been unnecessary if I'd made myself a regular at Nippon years ago. The restaurant opened in August 1963, a few doors west of its current address, and has offered sukiyaki since the beginning. That summer radios across the country were playing \"Sukiyaki,\" Kyu Sakamoto's oblique protest song that sounded like a love song but was, in the United States, renamed after beef stew for the simple reason that it was one of the few Japanese words almost all Americans knew. The dish was that popular. For modern New Yorkers who chase Japanese thrills at Shuko , Uchu , Tetsu and other restaurants that look and act like cocktail bars, Restaurant Nippon might seem anachronistic -- Kyu Sakamoto in a Cardi B world. Over the years, though, it has served as an unofficial cultural ambassador, using its dining room and its menu to make a case for the Japanese way. The restaurant is designed in the shoin style of a traditional Japanese house. Surrounding a main dining room with Western tables and chairs are the private zashiki rooms where shoes are left outside, floors are hidden under tatami mats and servers materialize at the sliding doors with the push of a button. Many details, like the wallpaper that evokes the opulently stylized folding screens painted by Ogata Korin , are lovely. A few, like the drop ceilings, could use attention. Nippon introduced or championed so many dishes that today the menu preserves the recent history of Japanese food in the United States, the way the rocks of certain canyons in the West record the history of the prehistoric world. Tora fugu, the potentially toxic tiger puffer fish, made its first regular appearance outside Japan at Nippon in 1989 , when the owner, Noboyushi Kuraoka , finally prevailed in his yearslong campaign lobbying the Japanese and American governments to allow importation of the fish. Mr. Kuraoka died in January; now the restaurant is in the hands of Yasuhiro Makoshi, the manager for more than 40 years, and Akira Azuma, who has been the chef for almost that long, and it probably remains the best place in town to try fugu. As sashimi, fanned out in transparently thin slices, it is lean and very firm, like fluke but slightly richer. Nippon sends it out with chives and a spicy daikon mash, which complement its quiet flavor, and cooked fragments of fugu, which don't. The least expensive serving, what is called a \"half portion\" for $70, is just big enough to give four people a couple of bites each. If I were going to spend money on fugu again, though, I would make a beeline for the sperm sacs, or shirako. Barely broiled, either plain with salt crystals or brushed with a miso glaze, Nippon's shirako is as smooth and thick as fudge, with a flavor that recalls buttered crab meat, among other things. Many firsts have been claimed by or on behalf of Nippon. Some of them may be true. Did it have the first sushi counter in New York? I am not convinced. In a 1963 Times review , Craig Claiborne wrote that Nippon had a tempura counter where sushi, \"the traditional service of raw fish,\" was also available. Today the sushi is respectable, if not on its own a reason to visit. Is it a fact that no other New York restaurant was making soba noodles in 1988, when Nippon began to do so? Certainly few places have gone to the same lengths in pursuit of soba as Nippon, which imported not just buckwheat seeds but also a buckwheat farmer from Japan , and planted both in a field outside Montreal. (For years the farm also supplied a sister restaurant, Soba Nippon , now closed.) Restaurant Nippon's soba noodles are nutty, bouncy, springy, slightly rough and very good. I like them chilled, dunked in ponzu. Against my better judgment I even like the odd, Americanized soba salads, with a pile of noodles and meat or tofu on a platter with a fistful of lettuce. The custom-farmed buckwheat also goes into an astoundingly good thing called soba miso that comes smeared on a small wooden paddle. A black sludge of fermented buckwheat studded with buckwheat kernels, it looks like brownie batter and tastes a little like chocolate, too, as well as roasted nuts and espresso and cooked mushrooms. Whether negimaki was invented at Nippon or simply made its first United States appearance there, it's hard to see why tough beef wrapped around undercooked scallions captured America's imagination. More intriguing is another original, beef oroshi, essentially shabu shabu except that it is cooked offstage and you get nothing but meat and broth with some spicy grated daikon. This is also the birthplace of agedashi mozzarella. If you have ever wondered what fried cheese in dashi would taste like, you will find the answer here. The backbone of the menu, though, is traditional Japanese food, nearly all of it good and some of it better than that. There is fluke for those who won't pay up for fugu, and it is just what you'd want it to be. Broiled eel over rice makes a wonderfully soothing meal. The kamonabe is a duck hot pot cooked over a burner set on the table. The duck may not be entirely tender, but it is flavorful. The broth is a symphony. For scale, theatricality and deeply reassuring flavor, its only rival is the sukiyaki, but the kamonabe comes with a dividend: a bowl of rice cooked in the leftover broth as a second course.

Upstairs was a cramped, angular, shadowy dining room with a few tables under a ceiling so low it made tall people stoop. Downstairs was a cramped, angular, shadowy kitchen where oxtails, goat curry and other Jamaican dishes were cooked and sold. To the right of the door, behind a counter, was the restaurant's single stove. It had three burners that were almost always going. No matter when I went there it seemed that about a quarter of the things on the menu had not finished cooking, but complaining would have been cloddish, both because the limitations on capacity were obvious and because whatever was finished was bound to be both nuanced and powerful. The whole operation was one of those precarious marvels of adaptive survival, like a pine growing from a crack in the side of a cliff. So the outlook was grim when news came two summers ago that the structures housing the Islands and another business were being torn down so a new apartment building could be constructed. This neighborhood and the ones to the south between Flatbush and Ralph Avenues owe much of their character to black- and immigrant-owned businesses, including a large swath of Caribbean restaurants such as the Islands. With developers sniffing at this part of Brooklyn, many of them are at risk. Marilyn Reid, who owns the Islands with Shuon Letchford, had other ideas. She had had other ideas since 2001, when she opened the restaurant. \"We were always looking because we had outgrown it by the second day,\" she said in a phone interview. \"We knew.\" Before closing the original space in March 2017, she and Ms. Letchford had found a much bigger one downhill on Washington Avenue. Preparing it took a few months more than she had hoped, but the second incarnation of the Islands has been up and running since January. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] The new kitchen has two stoves and 10 burners. Nevertheless, what's available when I've gone has always been several dishes shy of the complete menu. The stewed okra with cod is especially hard to pin down. At the same time, the comfort of the bigger dining room and the table service, an impossibility in the first space, have encouraged me to branch out beyond my usual favorites. The Islands is best known for long-simmered stews but the kitchen also knows a thing or two about frying. The flattened fritters of salt cod seasoned with fresh hot chiles, known as stamp and go, were crunchy and golden. Some Caribbean cooks deep-fry fish escovitch to oblivion, on the theory that spicy vinegar heals all wounds. The escovitch I had at the Islands was a whole red snapper, obviously fresh and fried just until firm. The vinegar dressing, meanwhile, was seasoned with not just hot chiles but pickled bell peppers, carrots and cucumbers, making this escovitch more interesting than usual. From the old days, I knew the curried goat would be very tender and richly seasoned, although like most of the cooking at the Islands, it was never scalp-piercingly spicy. Now I've found a new standby in the curried vegetables -- a very different thing, of course, but the golden raisins, turmeric and allspice may do even more for cabbage and carrots than they do for goat meat. Barbecue chicken was ordered in a rush verging on panic because whatever I'd first wanted wasn't ready yet. The sauce is nothing like the ketchup-based sludge I'd imagined. Made with raisins and allspice, it tastes more like a glaze for a holiday ham, and it's lovely. I prefer it to the jerk chicken, which will sound like heresy to some customers. Like barbecue, jerk can describe either a sauce or a process, and the process needs to involve wood smoke. The Islands bakes its jerk chicken in the oven, and while I like its sauce, when I want jerk chicken I will cross Eastern Parkway and keep the windows down until I smell burning allspice logs. But I have no quarrel with the jerk shrimp or leg of lamb at the Islands -- there's no place to get an allspice-smoked version of either, as far as I know. The lamb is especially alluring, stuffed with jerk spices and slowly roasted until its outer crust falls, upon slicing, into a dark rubble that in New Orleans would be called debris. Rice and peas, fried plantains and stewed cabbage, slippery with coconut oil, are all mandatory in my book. Others insist on baked macaroni and cheese, served in a brick the size of a pound of butter. When I taste the bread crumbs on top, and wonder if they've been seasoned with dried onions, I think those people may have a point. All of this food is brought to the table on oval platters that could hold a small Thanksgiving turkey. Since opening in January, the new dining room has been embellished bit by bit. The walls are painted in watermelon and aquamarine. Small hurricane lamps decorate the tables. A couple of weeks ago, plaid cloth napkins made their debut in the middle of dinner service. Menus, which used to be kept inside a clear plastic sheath, are now presented inside folders made of textured handmade paper, held in place with stickers of bumblebees and butterflies. The bar, across the dining room from the kitchen, is still unoccupied while Ms. Reid waits for a liquor license to come through. A rumored roof deck has not materialized, either. In the meantime there is an excellent limeade sweetened with demerara sugar and a dark purple, fruity sorrel punch, which can give the impression it has been lightly spiked with rum. Credit for the food at the Islands is shared. There are two chefs, Delroy Henry and Ronald Porter. Most of the recipes, though, are Ms. Letchford's, and she does a lot of the cooking. Like Ms. Reid, all of them were raised in Jamaica before moving to New York, but only Ms. Letchford did any professional cooking there. Ms. Reid is often in the kitchen too. \"I do the light stuff,\" she said. \"I tend to stay with salads, seafood.\" Is the food as good as before? I used to be impressed that anything at all could be cooked at the old Islands. That so much of it was actively delicious seemed like a miracle. It's less astonishing now that the kitchen has 10 burners and room to turn around. But I suspect the only thing that's changed is me. And when I'm in the mood for something miraculous, I'll just remind myself that the Islands is still in business.

They don't wait anymore. If there's no Florent or Schiller's Liquor Bar around, they simply have one built, synchronizing the opening with the move-in date of the first new apartments. This is the tactic being used by Hudson Yards , the glass-and-steel mountain range rising above a one-time dining wasteland where soon not just restaurants but an entire \"restaurant collection\" will flourish, including new projects from David Chang, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and others, all \"curated\" by Thomas Keller . And it is the approach taken by Henry Hall, a tower of rental apartments just north of Hudson Yards on West 38th Street. To give the place the atmosphere and the hangout opportunities of a boutique hotel, Henry Hall has turned its first two floors over to a wine shop, a cocktail lounge, a private dining room and a restaurant. I am telling you all this because that restaurant, Legacy Records, is unusually good and very popular and if somebody invites you there, you should know why you are having dinner down the street from the Javits Convention Center and a stable where Central Park carriage horses go to be hosed down at night. And you will also know why Legacy Records seems eager to suggest that it has local roots -- so eager that it has essentially ginned up a history for itself that brings together sloppy research with a superficial tribute to black culture. It's not a combination that will appeal to everybody. Like the bar and the wine store, Legacy Records is run by Delicious Hospitality, the company behind Pasquale Jones and Charlie Bird . The menu, as it is in those two restaurants, is essentially Italian, but less rustic and more expensive. This is the first time the group has routinely charged more than $30, and as much as $46, for main courses. (The prices, like the ones at Pasquale Jones but not Charlie Bird, include service.) I don't know for sure whether Ryan Hardy, the chef and one of the three partners, has upgraded to better purveyors, but I do know I was taken aback, often, by the quality of the raw ingredients at Legacy Records. There was the raw sea scallop, so intensely fresh that its slices clung together stickily; Mr. Hardy had dressed it with dots of yogurt, tiny oval basil leaves, toasted almonds and tart little pink cells of finger lime. There was chilled Dungeness crab, a few pristine white chunks under sea urchin foam, to be spooned from a shot glass. And tiles of yellowfin tuna belly, not as fatty as bluefin but very rich all the same, under bits of salted lemon peel and a splash of colatura, the Italian fish sauce. Again with the main courses, I stopped and wondered: Where did Mr. Hardy find lamb (with snap peas and smoked cream) that tasted as if it had never eaten anything but fresh herbs? How did he find a rib-eye that's so tender and deeply flavorful without being flabby? Mr. Hardy has been quick to make the most of what the market says is the first month of spring and the calendar says is the last. Creamy new-crop potatoes deserve a little appreciation before they're sent off to root cellars, and Mr. Hardy built a fine appetizer around them with leggy broccoli sprouts and melting chunks of fresh mozzarella spiked with anchovy. Charred snap peas made a tangy salad together with ramps in a peppery buttermilk dressing. But sweet English peas were swallowed up by a too-sharp risotto; seasoned with prosciutto, the rice took on more of the ham's saltiness than its sweetness. Legacy Records doesn't say anything particularly original, but it has a finesse that's new for this restaurant group. There's an exceptional plate of grilled pigeon, neatly carved and served with swooshes of nettle pur\u00e9e. It is at least as impressive as the dish that's becoming a breakout star for the restaurant: a duck breast, its skin rubbed with pepper, chiles, honey and fennel and then roasted until it has a deep, crusty bark that a Texas pitmaster would be proud of. Ordering wine is an event in itself. Robert Bohr and Grant Reynolds, who are Mr. Hardy's partners and the resident wine soothsayers, have seen to it that cultists can rub elbows with the Agraparts, Raveneaus and Gajas, while the rest of us will still find a few bottles under $100 from some of the most expensive arable land on earth. Oddly enough, the wine list makes less of an impression than the ones at Charlie Bird and Pasquale Jones, simply because you'd expect an ambitious cellar in a restaurant this expensive. Then again you might also expect a smart, artful dessert menu; if so, you're out of luck. There is ice cream with strawberries, a dark chocolate meringue and a selection of gelati, served in a cone; all perfectly pleasant, but there's more wit and creativity in the excellent cocktail roster administered by Jeff Bell. I'm sure there are people who are reluctant to go to Legacy Records because of how relentlessly noisy this team's downtown restaurants are. But they seem to have sent the acoustics to obedience school, because all the sound waves do what they're told: Conversations stay at their own tables, while the music stays in the background. Ken Fulk, who designed all the public spaces in the building, covered some wall panels with grasscloth, put glove-soft leather on the tabletops, and found other ways to dampen the noise. Legacy Records certainly doesn't look like any other restaurant; Mr. Fulk went to extremes, using some motifs from the 1980s -- emphatic grids, metallic finishes, whites and country-club greens -- that not everybody is ready to see resurrected. Hanging in the bar is a 2006 photograph by the artist Mickalene Thomas of a black woman with an Afro and a giraffe-print shirt posed in front of albums by Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross. It has a counterpart on the second floor, a mural behind the bar based on the Ernie Barnes painting seen on Marvin Gaye's album \"I Want You.\" Along with the constant hip-hop and vintage soul soundtrack and the restaurant's name -- taken, we are told, from a recording studio that once stood on this site -- Legacy Records tries to present itself as a homage to another era in music. If Legacy Recording Studios had been used by Mr. Gaye, Mr. Wonder and Ms. Ross, that homage might make sense. But it didn't. Lasting just from 2001 to 2009, the studio was built for and mostly used by orchestras, Broadway cast recordings and commercials. Legacy Records has taken this shred of history and turned it into a fantasy of black American music. Exhibited in a museum or gallery, Ms. Thomas's photo might be taken as a comment on the different postures and personas available to black women. Hanging it next to the counter where pastries and coffee are sold by day strips out some of its meaning; it looks like an attempt to buy a personality for a restaurant that doesn't have one of its own. If anyone gets to decide who can use black culture for what purposes, it surely isn't me. But Legacy Records uses it in a gratuitous and offhanded way that made me uncomfortable. Stevie Wonder will always be cool, but a restaurant dreamed up by real estate developers doesn't automatically become cool by putting him on the wall.

With no time to make a roast or stew, the legend goes, the Great Khan's chef carved very thin slices of raw mutton and plunged them into hot broth for a few seconds. Besides serving as an inspiration to those of us who believe there is always time to eat, the chef's impromptu recipe is said to have given China its ancient and delicious hot pot tradition. Hot pots did not jump to Japan until shortly after World War II, when kelp joined the broth and the name was changed, onomatopoetically, to shabu shabu. But like hot pots in China, shabu shabu is a do-it-yourself bash where everybody around the table gets to dunk and swish the ingredients they like best. Chefs are not required. Then on Delancey Street last fall, a new shabu shabu restaurant appeared where a chef standing behind a counter does all the cooking for no more than eight people at a time. Her name is Mako Okano. Out of a style of dining that has always been a big, informal free-for-all, she has built a quiet, refined, intimate spot called Shabushabu Macoron . Usually backed up by two other women, but occasionally working solo, Ms. Okano moves deliberately. She will gesture to the place mat, where the night's eight or 10 courses are written out in Japanese, right to left, and then to another slip of paper with the same courses printed in English, again right to left. The price is $128. There are no choices to be made. Ms. Okano has modeled her restaurant on omakase sushi bars, where the chef calls the tune. When I first arrived, I admit that I couldn't see the point of having a chef do the cooking when I was perfectly able to do my own dunking and swishing. Ms. Okano quickly poured two or three mouthfuls of yeasty, warm unfiltered sake into a little saucer. This arrived with a snack -- cured salmon and salmon roe seasoned with fermented rice -- that artfully underscored the sake's flavor. Then she turned and quietly addressed a saut\u00e9 pan over the stove. When she turned around again she had cooked an omelet and flicked it into a roll in the Japanese style. Served in a bowl of hot, clear dashi, the egg was as tender and delicate as its garnish, a tiny piece of mitsuba stem tied into a knot. Next she poached two pieces of abalone for a few seconds each in abalone broth. One she dabbed with a small, intense blip of the Japanese spice paste yuzu kosho. Over the other she spooned a sauce made from the abalone's liver. I ate them both, and was flooded first with pleasure then with embarrassment that I'd thought simmered food wasn't worth a chef's time. By the time I'd eaten a small tongue of sea urchin combined with silky rags of yuba still dripping with soy milk, I was on board for anything Ms. Okano wanted to cook. For some time the bubbles in an iron pot of dashi set over a countertop burner had been getting bigger and faster. Thin strips of Wagyu beef, streaked with so much fat they looked like stained glass, were stretched out on black slate with pinkish bands of pork belly. Raw vegetables -- cabbage, lettuce, enoki and shiitake mushrooms, half a brussels sprout and a cherry tomato on a wooden spear -- waited on a nearby plate. Before I knew it she had cooked the first piece of beef -- was it the A5 from Miyazaki or the A4 from Kagoshima? The flesh had twisted itself around, and now dusk-gray outer curls hid inner curves of faded pink. The flavors moved in rapid waves: first a few clinging, savory drops of dashi, then some already-melted beef fat, followed by the flavor of the lean meat itself, sweet and refined. Finally came a second helping of fat, freshly melted now. When Ms. Okano fished out a piece of beef, she would suggest seasoning it with one or more of an almost comically large assortment of condiments and pur\u00e9es that she makes herself. She seemed to favor her ponzu, and so do I; it's more radiant with yuzu than any I've had before. I also liked the sweet soy once I learned to doctor it with a few drops of what Ms. Okano calls \"gravy sauce,\" a dark liquid that makes meat taste meatier. Many dismal meals would be saved if I carried an eyedropper of gravy sauce around with me. Swabbing the pork belly in the sticky, thick sesame paste with toasted sesame seeds produces an effect similar to, but more subtle than, the combination of peanut butter and bacon. It's even better with a smear of salted plum, or a few drops of the yuzu-olive oil sauce that seems to have jetted in from Italy. The vegetables were spotless and fresh. A meal without them would be off kilter, perhaps to a degree that would cause grumbling from the digestive system, but on their own they are not a reason to go to Shabushabu Macoron. The chicken meatballs are, though. So are the green tea soba noodles that Ms. Okano somehow manages to cook in between everything else without seeming to leave the few square feet behind the counter. Soba is not standard with shabu shabu, but it is something she has experience making from her time in the kitchen at Cocoron , a soba-ya across Delancey Street. When she began talking about her dream of opening what she hoped would be the world's first omakase shabu shabu restaurant, Cocoron's owners listened. When she came back from a dunk-and-swish tour of Japan, they signed on as her partners. At times, it seems as if Ms. Okano can't believe it all worked out. After she'd cooked me three nearly identical meals, I wondered if she'd still be as giddy a year from now. Will she be able to change the menu with the seasons to keep things interesting? Can she stash surprise ingredients below the counter for repeat customers, the way sushi chefs do? None of these questions occurred to me the first two times I ate at her restaurant. I just sat there in something like a state of wonder while she cooked for me. This is, bizarrely, a rare experience at tasting counters, where chefs are often intent on intricacies of plating. The physical setting of Shabushabu Macoron strongly suggests a shoestring budget -- the paper towel roll in the restroom hangs from what may be an actual shoestring -- but sitting there while Ms. Okano stands a few inches away and makes your dinner is one of the most luxurious experiences this city currently offers.

It was the part that everybody remembered from his first published work, a long essay about the unglamorous and sometimes unsavory work of cooks and dishwashers that ran in The New Yorker in 1999 and that made it almost impossible for waiters to sell seafood between Sunday and Tuesday for at least a decade. And the advice gave Mr. Bourdain, a journeyman cook and chef nobody had heard of, a new career. Before he was found dead on Friday , in what the authorities were treating as a suicide, he was the witty, connected guide who, in memoirs, cookbooks and television shows, would tell you things that others wouldn't. In the glossy, cheerful, relentlessly promotional realms of food and travel writing, that left him a fair number of truths he could claim as his own, and he took full advantage of the situation. A close reader of Orwell , he modeled that first essay and the book that grew out of it, \"Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly,\" on Orwell's \"Down and Out in Paris and London.\" While other restaurant writers had helped build the cult of the creative, artistic chef, Mr. Bourdain made folk heroes out of the dishwasher and the line cook -- a job description previously known only to restaurant employees. He described their lives and their day-to-day work in concrete, indelible detail. When kitchens were being wrapped in a shimmering gauze of glamour, Mr. Bourdain got busy unwrapping them, revealing the injuries and addictions, low wages and high tempers that took a toll on workers. Among other things, he was one of the first writers to tell the dining public that many high-profile New York restaurants would cease to function without the work and talents of Mexican employees. It was almost a casual aside, yet it suddenly opened new subjects to the purview of food writing: immigration policy, labor conditions, racism. He identified with the grunts, portraying himself as a slinger of cheap steaks and French fries. The grunts, in turn, identified with him, not because of his contributions as a chef -- who can name an Anthony Bourdain dish? -- but because he told the world what the work was really like. And once he left kitchens behind for a career in travel television, he didn't lead his camera crews on a tour of the world's most luxurious resorts. He went to Detroit and the Bronx, Libya and Beirut. \"Good food, good eating, is all about blood and organs, cruelty and decay,\" he wrote in the opening sentence of that New Yorker piece, and it set the tone for all the work that followed. [Read more of our coverage on Anthony Bourdain's death: Anthony Bourdain, Chef, Travel Host and Author, is Dead at 61 \u2018 Tony Was a Symphony': Fans and Friends Remember Anthony Bourdain ] Mr. Bourdain was a blood-and-organs kind of guy, and he became identified with his unflinching, at times ostentatious, descriptions of life, death, sex and digestion. Footage of fly-speckled goats' heads in open-air markets was to his travel shows what harbor sunsets were for other programs. Although he wasn't immune to hyperbole, he had an old-school chain-smoking newspaper editor's hatred of self-serving hypocrisy, particularly in other television hosts. He delighted in mocking celebrity chefs like Guy Fieri (whose Times Square restaurant he called \"the Terrordome\") and Paula Deen (\"the worst, most dangerous person to America\"). At times Mr. Bourdain's capacity as truth-teller could bleed into other, less salutary roles: the attention-seeking bully, the purveyor of well-polished shtick, the lecture-circuit fixture who, on cue, would curse like a line cook who has just chopped off the tip of his finger. \"I do a lot of speaking engagements and sometimes I feel like I'm being paid to curse in front of people who haven't heard it in a while,\" he said in a 2008 interview . In the past few months, as accusations of sexual harassment and predatory behavior have shaken the restaurant industry , Mr. Bourdain's swaggering accounts of kitchen life have come in for re-evaluation. He certainly took pleasure in telling outsiders what it was like. Was there some pride in there, too, in belonging to a band of misfits and rule-breakers? Had he helped to popularize a workplace culture in which misogyny and abuse were overlooked, tolerated and sometimes even celebrated? \"To the extent which my work in \u2018Kitchen Confidential' celebrated or prolonged a culture that allowed the kind of grotesque behaviors we're hearing about all too frequently is something I think about daily, with real remorse,\" he wrote on Medium in December. Having regularly heaped disgust and outrage on Harvey Weinstein (who was accused of rape by Asia Argento, Mr. Bourdain's partner), he was also confronted with serious and deeply unsettling allegations about Mario Batali , a friend. \"In these current circumstances, one must pick a side,\" Mr. Bourdain wrote. \"I stand unhesitatingly and unwaveringly with the women.\" But if the feminist perspective was relatively new to his repertory, speaking out about sexual abuse was not. Long ago, in \"Kitchen Confidential,\" he had written about a union shop steward who had inserted his fingers into Mr. Bourdain's rectum every day, in front of the other kitchen workers. Experiences like this may be common for male cooks, but they are not commonly discussed in public. Mr. Bourdain was too unsettled, his moral compass too twitchy, to have written an account of kitchen life that was purely celebratory or purely accusatory. \"Life is complicated. It's filled with nuance. It's unsatisfying,\" he once said. \"If I believe in anything, it is doubt.\" ", "rec_dishes": 0}, {"id": 73, "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/dining/don-angie-review.html", "review_text": " Ever since Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone began rehabilitating chicken Parm and Neapolitan cookies around 2010, I've been waiting for other restaurants to carry the torch of Italian-American food boldly into the future. This is a major branch of American cuisine, too important for its fate to be left to the Olive Garden. For the most part, though, the torch has gone uncarried. I have been told that Palizzi Social Club, in Philadelphia, may qualify, but because Palizzi is a veritable club -- members and guests only, no new applications accepted -- I don't expect to eat there before the nation's tricentennial. Then in October, a place opened in the West Village that seemed to hit all the right tropes. It's called Don Angie . Two chefs share the kitchen -- Angela Rito and her husband, Scott Tacinelli -- and they make versions of chicken scarpariello , antipasto salad and braciole. The dining room brings back the high-glitz Italian restaurant d\u00e9cor of the 1970s and '80s, the period when Formica and oil paintings of the Bay of Naples went out and mirrors with gold pinstripes came in. The floor is a black-and-white checkerboard. The bar is made of polished marble the color of beef carpaccio. There is a house Chianti, and it comes in a straw-covered bottle. There is hope for a red-sauce renaissance, after all. Unfortunately, more or less from the day it opened, having dinner at Don Angie has been only marginally less difficult than eating at a private club. That has something to do with Ms. Rito's and Mr. Tacinelli's knack for cooking things that Instagram can't resist. The two spent three years running the kitchen at Quality Italian in Midtown, where they engineered, among other pieces of shutterbait, a chicken Parm that looked like a pizza. There was some wonderful stuff at Quality Italian and some less wonderful stuff, and almost all of it either arrived on trolleys or was prepared at tableside or set on fire while you watched. The restaurant group behind Quality Italian, Quality Branded , is also backing Don Angie. So as I resigned myself to eating at Don Angie close to 5:30 p.m., when I managed to get an unreserved table, I also braced for a dose of abracadabra. It arrived right on schedule with my first drink, which a server strained into a glass through a coffee filter cone lined with espresso ice. It was called Americano, Americano, and combined at least three meanings of the word: a highball, an Italian aperitif wine and a diluted shot of espresso. The Americano highball, so simple that just about any bartender can make it, doesn't need much improvement. But I have to admit that the coffee did give it some ballast. I'm also happy to report that this was one of the last bits of stagecraft I saw at Don Angie. Ms. Rito and Mr. Tacinelli have a few tricks up their sleeves, but they save them for the kitchen. The result is food that is creative in a more interesting and more consistently successful way than it was at Quality Italian. And it arrives at the table without the aid of trolleys. When you get a Caesar salad, the server doesn't whip together the dressing on the spot. It's been done in the kitchen, where the chefs replaced romaine with tender chrysanthemum leaves that taste like some newly discovered herb. (The feathery leaves firmly grip the dressing and the fluffy rasped cheese, too.) I can't remember seeing chrysanthemum in an Italian restaurant before, and it shows the chefs' skill for cross-pollinating with other cuisines, especially Asian ones. While the Torrisi-Carbone axis is generally faithful to Italian-American standards, using more expensive ingredients and more modern techniques but leaving the basic ideas intact, the Rito-Tacinelli approach is more radical. They trample on tradition when they feel like it. Prosciutto and honeydew melon are tossed with candied hazelnuts and mint leaves in a lime, tamarind and fish-sauce dressing. This very good salad, which obviously glances toward Southeast Asia, is a smart way to handle an antipasto standby that is usually pointless except when melons are in season. Their garlic bread turns out to be a very thin disc with garlic chives and melted cheese inside and sesame seeds on top. Lightweight, salty and irresistible, it's modeled on Ligurian focaccia di recco, but it may also bring to mind Turkish gozleme, Azeri kutab or even a Chinese scallion pancake. There's China again, in the pepperoni fried rice served under barbecued squid. Ignore the squid unless you like it leathery, and just focus on the rice, stirring it with labneh when the heat starts to rise. The dish everybody has seen on Instagram is the pasta called caramelle. In Italian it means caramel, as in candy, but the shape will remind most Americans of an elongated Tootsie Roll, with twists at either end of a drum that's filled with buffalo ricotta. Cameras come out because the dough is striped, with black sesame-flour bands alternating with ordinary egg pasta. The sesame barely registers; the fun of the dish is the sauce, a peppered, pickled cantaloupe that tastes like it's still percolating. But the dish that could be Don Angie's lasting contribution to the pasta sciences is the garganelli with meatball rag\u00f9. The central problem of red-sauce restaurants is this: Pasta and meatballs are always served together, but they remain stubbornly separate. Ms. Rito and Mr. Tacinelli have found a way out of this conundrum by crushing meatballs into a tomato-guanciale rag\u00f9. It's not quite as simple as I've made it sound, but you don't know that when you're eating it; you just think you're magically eating meatballs and pasta at the same time. They've also tried to salvage chicken scarpariello, a dish that is almost always overcooked. Their solution is to make a kind of pie with chicken meat pressed down into a kind of crust made of sausage. The flavors are accurate, and for once it's not dry, but it's not as engaging as other main courses, like the veal cutlet with speck and pickled mustard seeds, or the grilled fillet of orata next to herbed fregola, with buttermilk as the sauce. Reworking tiramis\u00f9 almost never improves it, but as a change of pace I did like how the one at Don Angie shifted the emphasis from espresso to bittersweet cocoa. There's a delicious, if more conventional, plate of tender, light zeppole with tangy whipped robiola under an Andy Warhol mop of spun sugar that people go wild for. I was charmed by a smaller, quieter dessert: a mochi cake stuffed with fior di latte ice cream, with sea salt and a fragrant scribble of olive oil. It's like eating a mozzarella ball that wanted to become a dessert when it grew up, and did. Follow NYT Food on Facebook , Instagram , Twitter and Pinterest .

Just in the past year we've gotten at least five omakase-only sanctuaries -- Sushi Noz, Sushi Amane, Noda, Shoji at 69 Leonard Street and Ichimura at Uchu -- where the price of a meal, before drinks and tax, is somewhere between $250 and $300. If you were already inclined to think that the Japanese seafood game, like so many other things in Manhattan, is rigged in favor of the robber barons, these restaurants won't change your mind. But the next time you despair of ever tasting another slice of yellowtail, I'd suggest dropping into an izakaya called Wokuni for lunch or dinner. A short detour from Grand Central Terminal, it has been in business since October. So far it has not drawn much attention to itself. Given the mixed messages it sends out, this is understandable. It has soaring ceilings, a backlit bar with shelves so high the topmost bottles can be reached only by a gymnast, an undulating wall of overlapping tiles that suggests Frank Gehry in his fish-scale period, and a constant dance beat in the background that won't stop no matter how hard you cry. In other words, it looks like the Asian fusion restaurant in the lobby of a W hotel built around 1999. The menu sings another tune, though. It is full of traditional izakaya dishes like tofu agedashi and chicken karaage, rounded out by sashimi and grilled skewers. There is one twist, though: Wokuni is much, much more interested in seafood than the average izakaya. As a rule, the fish at Wokuni is exceptionally good and almost bizarrely fresh, shipped daily from the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo or from a fish farm in Nagasaki owned by the restaurant's parent company, Tokyo Ichiban Foods . (Its admirable motto: \"We are changing the dietary culture in Japan with persistence.\") Raw or cooked, the seafood at Wokuni sets it apart from other izakayas in New York, best seen as embassies of Japanese drinking culture in which the food plays the role of the ambassador's chauffeur. Sushi is rare at standard izakayas, but it is made and sold at Wokuni, at very moderate prices. While many omakase chefs age their fish to make it supple and relaxed, the sushi at Wokuni is almost insolently fresh. And if you merely get a few $5 pieces of king yellowtail sushi, or $6 pieces of sea bream sushi, and maybe a slice or two of golden-eye snapper sushi at $9 each, you won't regret it. The fish will be shiny. It will probably be chewy. The pinks and reds and ivories and whites in its flesh will be as distinct as if they'd been painted on with a nail-polish brush. But sushi is not the highest use of Wokuni's seafood. What the place lacks are the seasonal fish that can make a sushi excursion really memorable: gizzard shad, striped jack, firefly squid. When it comes to sashimi, though, this is not much of a liability, and the firmness of Wokuni's fish becomes a point in its favor. Before ordering sashimi -- or, in fact, anything else -- check the daily specials posted by the chef, Kuniaki Yoshizawa. They will almost always include several cuts of bluefin from farm-raised fish. If you come very early for lunch and manage to get the Wokuni don, a special that centers on a sashimi rice bowl and shrimp tempura, it will strike you as an incredible bargain at $24. The kitchen makes only five Wokuni-dons a day, though, so chances are you will have to content yourself with the kaisen-don, and chances are that even though it doesn't include tempura, the $18 you pay will still seem like one of the best raw-fish deals in town. Things get even more intriguing when Wokuni's seafood comes into contact with heat. Again, the specials should be your starting point. There may well be a grilled yellowtail collar. If you are in the habit of ordering this at your favorite izakaya, it is a good bet that you will be surprised by how much cleaner and sweeter it tastes here. Bluefin collars and jaws are not served often enough for anybody to get into the habit of ordering them. The grilled collar at Wokuni one recent night was one of the greatest pieces of cooked fish I've had in a long time, every bit of it worth chasing into the hollows of bone, skin and cartilage where it hid. It is not always available, but the grilled bluefin tail is, carved into a steak with the backbone sliced open so you can get at the teaspoonful of hot, clear jelly inside the spine. Mr. Yoshizawa has had the surprising idea of treating the angles and corners of the sea bream's body like chicken wings. Tucked into triangles, fried until crunchy and served with lemon, they are meant to be gnawned on between sips of sake. On the other hand, ei hire, a frequent special of cured, dried skate fin cut into squares, makes a chewy and likable sidekick to beer. Fish and chips, of course, will go with either -- the fish species changes from night to night, but it tends to be extremely fresh, crunchy and light on batter. The chips, made from the Japanese mountain yam, were never crunchy and always needed more salt. Sometimes salt came with them, and sometimes it didn't. Those yam fries are an example of what happens once you venture away from seafood at Wokuni: The ingredients aren't doing the heavy lifting anymore, and everything tastes sort of, well, ordinary. Certain things are on the right side of ordinary, like the fried tofu in dashi; the warm rolled omelet, particularly when topped with grilled freshwater eel; and the tender, ghost-white baby sardines with grated daikon. Others are on the wrong side, like the grilled scallops in butter and the monkfish liver that strongly recalled canned cat food. If I worked in the neighborhood, I would eagerly return at least once a week, sticking as closely as possible to the fish specials. I doubt I'd get bored, but I would keep my eye out for something that Wokuni could put on the menu, but so far hasn't. The parent company runs a farm that raises tiger blowfish, and about 50 restaurants in Japan that serve it. Tiger blowfish is supposed to be the most delicious kind of fugu. I think New York could make it feel appreciated on Lexington Avenue. Follow NYT Food on Facebook , Instagram , Twitter and Pinterest .

I hadn't heard anyone drop a glass or sing \"Happy Birthday,\" so I asked the woman next to me, who had eaten there three or four times already, if she knew what the sudden ovation was about. \"Have you been to Gabe's other places?\" she asked. \"They like to clap for people.\" I hadn't noticed that, but there were other Stulman touches that had been transferred from Bar Sardine, Jeffrey's Grocery , Fedora and Joseph Leonard to Simon & the Whale when it opened in February. Case studies in how to maximize miniature spaces, they are intimate neighborhood hangouts with elevator-size kitchens where the food and cocktails are more interesting than ought to be achievable under such conditions. It's a genre Mr. Stulman understands as well as anybody in the city. With 76 seats in the new Freehand hotel on East 23rd Street, Simon & the Whale isn't one of those. It's an Army mess hall by the standards of Mr. Stulman's Happy Cooking Hospitality group. But the design firm Roman and Williams has styled it like a California Craftsman house and subdivided it into niches and corners with open cabinets. It doesn't display its size the way Upland , another Roman and Williams project a few blocks north, does. Even the bar is personably scaled; it's configured like a horseshoe. Extensive personal research suggests this is the best possible shape a bar can have. Like all of Mr. Stulman's places, Simon & the Whale is thick with high-volume conversations when it is full, which is pretty much all night long. Like Jeffrey's Grocery and Joseph Leonard, its name comes from a relative -- in this case, Mr. Stulman's 6-year-old son, who apparently received an impressive collection of whale-decorated baby gifts. Also familiar to Mr. Stulman's regulars will be the style of the servers. They're young, talkative, fresh-faced, enthusiastic, as if they are new to the city and haven't yet grown the protective exoskeleton of the hardened New Yorker. Our waiter one night showered us with recommendations for dishes, all of which he loved. We asked him about things he hadn't mentioned. He loved those, too. He loved the cocktails, a Happy Cooking strong suit, and was especially keen on one made with mezcal. \"Mezcal never hurt anybody,\" he said brightly. Extensive personal research suggests this is untrue. One place where Simon & the Whale allows itself to spread out beyond the normal boundaries of the Stulman kingdom is breads and desserts. The restaurant shares a baker, Zoe Kanan, and a pastry chef, Charmaine McFarlane, with the hotel's second-floor cafe, Studio, also run by Happy Cooking. Both are very good at their jobs. Ms. Kanan makes the black, thick-crusted barley-rye bread flecked with anise seeds that comes with a halfhearted taramosalata and, more excitingly, a swipe of butter creamed with seaweed powder. The long thin toast, crackling with grains and seeds that sits under cured and smoked Arctic char and smoked sour cream? Hers. The poppy-seed torpedo roll that helps lift the fish sandwich with carrot-squash slaw above the ordinary? Also hers, although to be fair the long, flat fries also do their part. And if your spirits have been sunk, as mine have, by the skimpy and uninspired dessert choices around town these days, Ms. McFarlane will be an answered prayer. No mere afterthought, her panna cotta sits on a low base of semolina cake and is decked out with pink grapefruit fillets and grapefruit marmalade spiced with red juniper berries. A cooling evergreen moat of pine ice surrounds an earthy rye pudding that's enriched with brown butter; pears fried in honey are splayed out on top, and some acerbic cranberries prevent the whole thing from cloying. I defy you to eat it without smiling. I can't say I'm as taken with crunchy knotweed-rhubarb compote as a topping for a buckwheat cake as Ms. McFarlane seems to be, but the same dessert offers one of the most astonishing ice creams around. Made with beeswax, it is as deeply aromatic as honey but not as sweet, and its texture is intensely creamy but not at all waxy. The rest of the menu is in the hands of Matt Griffin, until recently in charge of the food at Fedora and Bar Sardine. He does a neat balancing trick here, giving his adventurous side free rein at times while more often using it to add interest to the standards a hotel restaurant probably needs. A winningly over-the-top recent special was a custard-soaked pain perdu under bacon jus, pickled cabbage and speck, like some kind of demented Reuben-croque monsieur hybrid. Liver and onions turned out to be a less thrilling snack: pickled onions with deep-fried and overcooked chicken livers. Until it swam off the menu, there was an intriguing sideways version of squid ink risotto that had beech mushrooms and very tender squid confit over a black porridge of barley. Now there are spring peas, swirled with mint into a sauce for just-firm shrimp; the combination suggested pasta, but I was glad to have it without any starch getting in the way of the clear, sweet flavors. If it's pasta you want, Mr. Griffin has a glossy, chile-speckled bowl of spaghetti acqua pazza with littleneck clams and cherry tomatoes, and while the sauce is thicker and glossier than a normal acqua pazza, it is very good. What he calls a pork-collar Milanese is maybe a few millimeters too thick for the name, but I'll take it. The cut is more flavorful than a normal cutlet, and the apricot mostarda makes a pungent and welcome counterpoint. If you can't finish the whole thing, it will be taken away and replaced by a plastic action figure of a New York sports hero. This is your claim check. Mine was Don Mattingly, and I wondered if maybe the applause was for him. No, Mr. Stulman said on the phone a few days later. The woman he bought Fedora from, who has since died, was 89 when she sold it and was still showing up each night. When she entered, people clapped. \"We turned that into clapping for our friends,\" he said. Follow NYT Food on Facebook , Instagram , Twitter and Pinterest .

As frequent diners know from sad experience, it is, in fact, possible to cook in an acclaimed restaurant without picking up any of the qualities that it's acclaimed for. Even when actual skills have been learned, they are not always obvious. Or, occasionally, they're all too obvious, and you'll catch somebody in a two-person kitchen trying to replicate dishes originally assembled by a team of 40. One interesting thing about Soogil Lim is that you can almost draw a straight line from his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to what's on the table at his four-month-old restaurant in the East Village, Soogil . It's easy to spot the imprint of Hooni Kim's Hanjan , where he was the executive chef for four years. Mr. Lim lived in South Korea until he was 28, so what he learned at Hanjan was not how to make the country's traditional food but how to rework it into appealing, contemporary small plates. Daniel , where he spent seven years and reached the rank of sous-chef, turns up in the French techniques Mr. Lim leans on, in the crisp presentations that carry an echo of nouvelle cuisine, in the tender braised short rib, in his fondness for foie gras and in his preference for skillfully modulating flavors rather than tossing umami grenades. It's also apparent, when you look around the dining room, that in his earlier jobs Mr. Lim spent most of his time in the kitchen; the lineage you taste in his cooking doesn't show up in the design. Soogil (SOO-gil) doesn't evoke a rambunctious Korean pub the way Hanjan does. Nor is it a carpeted and tableclothed luxury liner, like Daniel. Under the guidance of Mr. Lim's wife, Sasook Youn, the dining room has been done in what we now recognize as the all-purpose Modern Asian style -- a long banquette of blond wood against one wall, a dining counter facing another wall, and a long communal table with benches running down the middle, all of them sitting on a plank floor. A few framed prints by Suzy Taekyung Kim, a New York artist from South Korea, are suspended over the banquettes. French windows on the street can be thrown open if the weather ever cooperates. Hanging in the back is a curtain. Once in a while it parts just wide enough for Mr. Lim's face to appear while he scans the tables. Sometimes they are full. They should be full all the time, because cooking like this does not just sprout up through every crack in the sidewalk, particularly at prices that, with one or two exceptions, don't go over $20. A good window into Mr. Lim's mind is the bindaetteok appetizer. Usually these mung bean pancakes present as flat, starchy discs whose golden surfaces hint at crunchiness without actually delivering it. The ones at Soogil, fried in pork fat, have golden crusts like veal cutlets; by the time you've speared a piece with some chopped kimchi and dunked it in the traditional dipping sauce, you have all the expected flavors, plus a formidable crunch to sweeten the deal. He tinkers with the glass noodle dish called japchae in less radical fashion. The noodles themselves, shaped into a swirl with crisp shreds of vegetables and oyster mushrooms, have drunk in more soy and sesame flavor than they typically do. And Mr. Lim seems to have tripled, at least, the amount of bulgogi, a point he emphasizes by mounding the meat over the noodles so it looks like a sloppy Joe missing its top bun. The care the kitchen pays to technique is obvious in the seafood dishes; I've never had one that wasn't perfectly cooked. Monkfish, which can come off as a rubber replica of some part of the anatomy I'd rather not think about, gets wrapped in a cabbage or lettuce leaf, gently poached, and sliced into neat little wheels. Arranged over stir-fried vegetables in a sea of fermented chile sauce, it's terrific, and about as French as Korean cooking should be allowed to get. An almost silky consistency marks the mackerel that Soogil serves, nigiri-style, over wads of rice that have been seasoned with ssamjang (standing in for wasabi?) and wrapped in chard leaves. The tender Manila clams, squid and shrimp in the spicy tofu-seafood stew kept more of their natural juiciness than usual, although very firm shellfish isn't necessarily a defect in that dish. Mr. Lim herds all the soft tofu into a flan at the bottom of the bowl, rather than letting cubes of it fend for themselves in the broth -- a move that nicely heightens the contrast of tofu and chiles. The least Korean thing on the menu must be the foie gras terrine, and it's also one of the only disappointments, with its crumbly Melba toasts and washed-out green-plum jelly. A dish called nurungji gras is something else entirely: a fine seared hunk of foie gras laid over spinach and pickled mushrooms on a springy, crunchy sizzled rice cake. Slabs of pork belly are braised until the fat streaks are nearly liquid. Then they're given a meaningful sear and served alongside a stripe of a sauce I've never had before, made with fermented shrimp and green plums and fresh red peppers: spicy, salty, sour and hot. The dish that breaks the $20 barrier is the short rib. If you've had Daniel's braised short ribs , the tenderness and concentration will be familiar to you, although Soogil's version is pointedly suffused with soy rather than red wine. Underlining the French connection, this block of beef is served with carrots, potatoes and winter squash. If you eat it by yourself, you could make dinner of it. After which you should probably investigate something that goes by the name Jenga Tower. Cigarettes of fried dough, chewy like rice sticks, are stacked like a log cabin, then dusted with sugar and misugaru, the powdered grain and bean blend Koreans use as an instant breakfast drink. You pull out a stick at the time until the tower falls and brings down the scoop of honey-and-chestnut gelato balanced on top. The dining room could take a few lessons in balance from that dessert. The lights could be dimmed by a few clicks. The pop music, while not actively awful, is just odd enough to be subliminally distracting. Soogil can't seem to find the right tone for service, either. Some nights it's very familiar and on others, peculiarly fussy -- a server insisted on giving the book I'd brought a chair of its own. These are minor snags, but sorting them out is tricky, especially for first-time restaurateurs. Somewhere in the middle is a relaxed, confident style that will match the spirit of Mr. Lim's cooking.

DIRTY, says one. FRENCH, reads the other. Diners who have reservations for Dirty French , secured with a credit card and a gentle warning of a modest $50-a-person cancellation fee, will find a dining room inside the Ludlow hotel that is decorated with a few shoestring-budget items, like a wall-length antique carnival mirror shipped from France. A few weeks ago, the partners had the artist Rashid Johnson, a frequent guest, throw oozing slicks of wax blended with West African black soap against the mirror's glass. (Around the same time, one of Mr. Johnson's wax-and-soap works sold at auction for just under $200,000.) Across from the mirror, over the bar, is a wide French flag that Julian Schnabel splotched with ink. Down on the tiled floor, in another humble little gesture, servers lope around in squeaky-fresh limited edition Air Jordans from the '80s, some of which probably cost more than I paid for my first car. Ever since Carbone and its neighbor, ZZ's Clam Bar, came along, swagger and money have been to Torrisi-Carbone-Zalaznick establishments what blinking lights and sitars are to Sixth Street's Curry Row. If the word for flaunting cash and art-world connections like this doesn't occur to you immediately, look at the strutting crowd of ceramic roosters that Mr. Zalaznick spray-painted in screaming pink: Dirty French is one cocky restaurant. It can also be an immensely enjoyable one. That sounds contradictory, but the same self-confidence that can get on your nerves also allows this crew to mess around with French cuisine with a hugely energizing lack of respect. In unnatural crossbreeding experiments, they force bistro cooking to mate with haute cuisine. To make dinner less stuffy and formal, they bring back stuffy formalities like cut-glass wine carafes and frilly oyster plates. They smudge the pages of Escoffier with strange foreign spices. It may sound like run-of-the-mill fusion, but it is a top-to-bottom remix, and nearly every weird mongrel idea leads in the direction of more flavor or more fun. Chefs more deferential to custom may not have ditched the hallowed basket of levain or baguette \u00e0 l'ancienne in favor of a flatbread inspired by the mahjeb Mr. Torrisi ate, one loaf after another, in a North African neighborhood of Paris. It's no innovation, this bread, just pita dough griddled in plenty of olive oil, buried under Proven\u00e7al herbs and sent out with a snowbank of fromage blanc, but people tore it up with greedy, greasy fingers at every table, mine included. Not that the chefs hide their training. (Mr. Torrisi worked for years under Daniel Boulud and takes the lead in this kitchen.) The mille-feuille is a technical showstopper, an accordion of ribbon-thin king trumpet mushroom stems folded over and over. It looks like pastry but pulls apart like buttered noodles, and when you drag them through a pool of green curry, the scene shifts to Thailand. It's a disorienting dish, and makes your head spin in a wonderful way. The restaurant creates a parallel world where French pastry turns into Thai curry; it's as if the chefs have imagined an alternative history in which the leading kitchens of France turned left instead of right several decades ago. What if nouvelle cuisine had embraced maximalism instead of minimalism, full-frontal abandon instead of lean precision? And what if, instead of teaching Americans to make puff pastry, the country's chefs had taken cooking lessons from the rest of the French-speaking world? For one thing, they might have come up with Dirty French's glorious lamb carpaccio. Brushed with a slow-burning raz al hanout oil, sprinkled with tart sumac powder and fresh herbs, dotted with sheep's milk yogurt and preserved lemon and wheels of roasted eggplant, the slices of lamb loin are saddled with as much flavor as they can reasonably be asked to carry. Or, though this probably needed a push from the roast-chicken gold rush started at the NoMad , they might have hit upon Dirty French's $72 poultry feast. First to arrive is the sneakily rich (translation: you can't see the foie gras) white meat in mustard-herb sauce. Then the bird's hindquarters show up on a cutting board. They've been soaked in a Vietnamese marinade of soy, fish sauce and lemon grass, slowly cooked in melted chicken fat (oh yes they have), then grilled and freshened up with lime zest. The chicken comes with crepes, irrelevantly; just pick up a drumstick and get to work on that burnished skin. The chefs have an instinct for the right kind of too much, but some dishes trip into the wrong kind. A deeply aromatic and fairly traditional bouillabaisse was thick with octopus, mussels, monkfish and one small, whole, wonderful red mullet. Cuttlefish ink took the broth to the outer edge of intensity, but the medicinal taste of fresh marjoram in some spoonfuls went beyond it. And while duck heart kebabs unloaded at the table added brawn to a fris\u00e9e and lardons salad, the blast of mustard in the dressing was an excessive use of force. A programmatic rollout of the formula -- Something Clearly French Under Heaps of Post-Colonial Exotica -- doesn't guarantee a sprinkling of magical pixie dust on every plate. Baked clams seemed perplexed by their thick jackets of almonds and Ethiopian spices, and so was I. A beautifully cooked trout meuni\u00e8re was speckled with sesame seeds and herbs, a mix that came across as an oddly neutered za'atar. Still, you can eat extraordinarily well by calling your shots and rolling with the loose, genial decadence of the place. The mood is set when a server comes over and says, in as laid-back a tone as anyone can manage while lugging an enormous 19th-century sterling silver punch bowl filled with ice, \"I wanted to let you have a look at tonight's oysters.\" Oysters: Why not? It continues when Lela\u00f1ea Fulton, who assembled a wine list that is all French, and fun for all kinds of budgets, shows up dressed like one of Charlie's Angels working undercover as a sommelier. Old Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape? Sure. It goes on through dessert, under the assured hand of the pastry chef Heather Bertinetti, who gracefully threads her way through the French-exotic conceit with a delicately architectural coconut-passionfruit Napoleon and a very short but very good pineapple tarte Tatin, rum-raisin ice cream on top. Mr. Torrisi, Mr. Carbone and Mr. Zalaznick, cautious and retiring as ever, plan to open three original restaurants next year while continuing to build new Parm locations. The question is whether this will leave them the energy to keep refining their mongrel bistro on Ludlow Street while rolling out its breakfast and lunch menus in the coming months. Dirty French needs time to grow into its ideas, and maybe to grow out of a few of them.

Rectangles of pizza bianca cut with scissors on the Campo de' Fiori from long planks shaped like diving boards, yes, but not for regular pizza. The standard circular pie is something travelers eat only after saltimbocca, puntarelle, spicy tripe, salt cod fritters, semolina gnocchi, porchetta, artichokes fried alla giudia and the holy pasta trinity of cacio e pepe, amatriciana and carbonara have all been checked off the list. It is food for the fifth night of vacation. And now the chef Nick Anderer has come to make this lesser stop on Rome's culinary pilgrimage route the main event of his new pizzeria, Marta . For the last five years Mr. Anderer has been a faithful custodian of the more famous Roman landmarks at Maialino , in the Gramercy Park Hotel. Marta, opened in September, is a continuation of that project, a spinoff that might have found a space next door if Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group had not decided to place it about a half-mile away in the soaring, stately lobby of the Martha Washington Hotel. Marta has Roman appetizers and entire Roman dishes repurposed as toppings for pizzas with thin crusts in the Roman style. Hold on, you say. Thin-crust pies are wall to wall around here. It is the house style of New York, a city to which people actually do travel for pizza. The style came from Naples with America's earliest pizzaioli more than a century ago, and it's been rejuvenated by modern obsessives who precisely calibrate their flour blends. What do we have to learn from Rome? Let's keep local pride in check for a minute. Marta's crusts are even thinner than what we think of as thin. Cooks in gray baseball caps press the dough flat with rolling pins on a marble counter. Slipped onto the floor of one of the hulking ovens whose black-tiled chimneys disappear into the hotel's second floor, the pies bake next to flickering stacks of firewood. The crust at first-rank Roman pizzerias like Da Remo in Testaccio is often compared to a cracker, but crackers crumble. This doesn't. It is more like the crust on a loaf of peasant bread from which all the soft crumbs have been stripped. It is durably crisp, unbendingly flat, and when you hold a slice by the edge, the rest of it juts out above the table like a cliff. Because everything I know about cliffs was learned from Wile E. Coyote, I kept waiting for the tip on each Marta slice to give way, but it never did. The pleasure of biting down on this pizza is both physical and auditory. The noise detonates along the jaw and plows right into the inner ear. Every bite sounds and feels like that. There is no soupy middle of steamed dough under wet tomatoes. It's pure crunch, all the way. What you lose with this style is the soft, springy, baguette-like curls at the edges of a Neapolitan pizza. The outer crusts of a Marta pie don't puff up; they stay hard and round, like grissini. When a pizza crust is all crackle, what's on top has to bring the flavor. This is where you see Mr. Anderer thinking like a cook. He has a great pizza-fied version of carbonara, with dots of egg and grated pecorino over crumbled, starchy potatoes and baconlike curls of guanciale. For a while, he was doing an enjoyable two-dimensional trippa alla Romana, too, spreading the rich, chile-boosted tomato sauce around the pie and arranging tender, not too chewy bands of tripe on top. In a more classical vein, the margherita, spread with flavorful tomatoes that are more pulp than sauce and punctuated with mozzarella, is superb. At $16, the buffalo mozzarella, richer and with a faint taste of the barnyard or wherever it is water buffaloes pass the time, is worth the $4 upgrade from the cow's milk variety. And if $18 seems high for a funghi pizza, note that the funghi in question are quartered chanterelles and frilly hen-of-the-woods, seasoned with thyme and just enough salt. Like almost all the toppings, the mushrooms are beautifully cooked with an insinuation of smoke; only the shoulder ham, layered between fontina and arugula, seemed to want more time in the oven, or maybe it needed to be sliced thin, so the edges could crisp and curl. Few pizzerias invest heavily in atmospherics, because pizza and the people who love it come and go in a few minutes. Still, it's a surprise just how little atmosphere the Union Square Hospitality Group has tried to conjure at Marta. The dining room, with its majestic high ceilings and blocky fluted columns, has the cold, empty monumentality of a 19th-century bank. There's some energy at the counter that faces the ovens, but very little in the rows of square tables behind it. The restaurant is open to the hotel lobby, and after a while, the comings and goings can make you feel as if you're eating in the waiting room of a train station. Lingering over a long series of courses is not advised. Marta works best when treated as a pizzeria, not a restaurant. Main courses are available, but they are not as trustworthy as the pies. Pork ribs managed to be both charred and undercooked, while a slow-roasted short rib needed a more potent infusion of flavor than gremolata could give it. The mixed grill of lamb chops, ribs and sausage was a magnificent exception, but in general the larger plates are best for those who can't eat pizza. (Marta does not make gluten-free dough.) A quick appetizer while the pizza bakes is absolutely recommended, though. Wood smoke wraps around rabbit meatballs, heavily peppered and herbed. The kitchen does fine work with hot oil, swathing vegetable fritters or seafood fritto misto in a translucently thin, light-gold batter and gently browning the bread crumbs around green suppl\u00ec shaped from very good basil risotto. After pizza, there is an affogato that is exactly right, an ice cream sandwich that's harder to like than it should be (the salted chocolate cookies could be thinner or softer, the pistachios crisper) and a cup of tiramis\u00f9 that's bracingly drenched in espresso. It costs just $5, which is helpful because pizza and fried food both need bubbles. Marta has a few Italian sparkling wines, but the real action is in the stockpile of nearly 40 Champagnes, from a $66 Roger Pouillon Cuv\u00e9e de R\u00e9serve to some $300-plus vintage treats. Nobody goes to Rome for Champagne with pizza, either, but this isn't Rome.

This review concerns one of the others, a place that stumbled at the start, as ungainly as a day-old giraffe, and only recently found its footing. Bar Bolonat opened in the West Village in March in what seemed an auspicious location, a corner spot looking out on Abingdon Square Park through yards of windows. Two months in, Einat Admony, the chef and owner, was on the verge of closing it, she said in a phone interview. Nearly half of her 54 seats had been taken away after the city ruled that one wing of the dining room was an unpermitted sidewalk enclosure. The disputed area was quarantined behind a velvet rope, although it was hard to imagine a crowd lining up for admission to this patch of bare cement floor. This put a strain on revenues, no doubt, and made the place look pretty weird. Even with reduced capacity, Bar Bolonat was afflicted by suboptimal acoustics. When I ate there early in the summer, the screeching in the dining room could have crushed scrap metal. It nearly crushed my desire to come back, too, but I held on because Ms. Admony was up to something original in the kitchen. The daughter of an Iranian mother and Yemenite father, she was combining the flavors of contemporary multiethnic Israel, where she grew up, with the idioms of modern restaurants in New York, where she has been cooking since getting a job in Bobby Flay 's kitchen at Bolo in 1999. I'd never tasted anything exactly like her shrimp in a Yemenite curry, with a fiery shot of green zhug and a small round of fried bread called malawach to soak up the spicy, turmeric-gold coconut milk. I wanted more food like this in my life, but I wasn't in a big hurry to face the decibels again. Now, with sound-absorbing tiles up above, Bar Bolonat is a quieter restaurant, though it's not entirely library-like. (One small section of ceiling, without tiles, is angled like the soundboard of a grand piano, with a similar effect.) It's also bigger. In September, Ms. Admony finally appeased the bureaucrats and returned all her seats to active duty. While fixing up the space, she made other changes, replacing executive chefs until she found Molly Breidenthal. When I ate there this month, the cooking was more assured than it had been, the spices applied more fearlessly. The giraffe is on the move. Energetic seasoning drives Ms. Admony's cuisine at Bar Bolonat, as it does at her exemplary falafel shops, Ta\u00efm , and to a lesser extent her Mediterranean comfort food restaurant, Balaboosta . One of Bar Bolonat's most likable dishes since the unsteady early days has been the lemony grilled baby artichokes with a creamy band of pistachio yogurt under a pale-green powder of dukkah. That blend of chopped nuts and herbs can get tired if it sits around too long, but Bar Bolonat's is extremely fresh, the pistachios still sweet and bright green. A swipe of corn pur\u00e9e takes its seductive, toasty flavor from turmeric, cardamom and ground cloves, Ms. Admony's version of a warming spice blend called hawaij that Yemenis stir into soups. Together with the creeping heat and sweetness of a red pepper sauce, the spiced corn makes something exciting out of a grilled octopus leg. Nearly everybody orders the Jerusalem-style sesame bagel, so light and fluffy it's almost an anti-bagel. Nearly everybody is right about this. What makes this racetrack-shaped bread so hard to pass up is the spoonful of really fragrant and complex za'atar that you dunk each piece into after giving it a preliminary bath in peppery olive oil. When dishes were underwhelming, as several were one August night, timid seasoning could be to blame. \"Za'atar ravioli,\" stuffed with smoky eggplant, might have been interesting had it included some actual za'atar. On the other hand, Bar Bolonat's zabzi, an Iranian fresh-herb stew served with soft specks of fresh couscous, was fantastically vivid, and it could have become one of my favorites if the short rib in the stew had not been tough and dry. The dishes at Bar Bolonat are meant to be shared -- everybody sing along -- and come out of the kitchen as they're ready. Or so the servers say. The menu is split into small, medium and large plates. As common sense would tell you if the servers weren't telling you otherwise, the bigger ones, like the lamb neck braised with dates and chestnuts until it is pull-apart tender, are a lot easier to split than the few mouthfuls of fluke ceviche with dried pomegranate seeds and juice. The kitchen could do more to help by, say, carving the pomegranate-glazed poussin instead of sending it out whole with a serrated knife. The bit about the dishes' showing up at random times is misleading, too, but in a good way. My table was never laden down with more plates than it could hold. This ought to go without saying, but in restaurants these days nothing does. Apart from one or two unscheduled leaves of absence one night, the service was generally excellent, with a professional bearing that signals Ms. Admony's intent to have Israeli cuisine taken seriously. The white napkins, polished stemware, sheer curtains and understated modern furniture are all a determined bid for the kinds of diners who would steer clear of anything resembling a hummus hut. For dessert, Ms. Admony makes a homey, from-scratch version of Milky, a chocolate pudding brand so central to Israeli life that it became the symbol of a protest this fall against the high cost of living. The halvah cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e tastes more like butterscotch than sesame, but it is worth getting for the tuft of halvah floss on top. The most entertaining and probably the best dessert is a fried envelope of baklava with ice cream sealed inside, although the ice cream should be colder and the pastry hotter if Ms. Admony wants to live up to the high standards once set by the fried ice cream at Chi-Chi's . Having fought City Hall and the screaming demons of dining-room noise, she's probably ready for a new challenge.

This is the happiness of thinking about a friend's newborn baby when you get into bed for a full night's rest; the thrill of knowing that at the exact moment when your marathon-running co-worker is gasping across the finish line in Central Park, you are at home, not running; and the joy of skipping over all the articles on turkey thermometers and lump-free gravy because it's not your turn to host. Of course, as a Thanksgiving guest, you still have work to do. The altruistic way of looking at this is that you should try to make the host's job easier. This assignment began back when you accepted the invitation. That was the moment to mention your allergies and to ask what you could bring with you. Now, with just a few days to go, it's time to take stock. Are your white and sparkling wines chilled, and do you have a way to keep the bottles cold while you are getting there? If you are bringing your famous yam lollipops, will they be ready to serve, sitting in an ovenproof serving dish that can be warmed up while the turkey is resting? Don't count on free counter space. Nathalie Dupree , a cookbook writer and veteran host in Charleston, S.C., ruefully recalled the year somebody showed up with boiled potatoes and proceeded to mash them on site. \"Splattering potatoes on the wall at a time when everything else is going on is not welcome,\" she said. If you absolutely must use the host's kitchen to finish the yam lollipops, today would be a good time to confirm that it's O.K. While you're at it, ask if there's something more that you can bring. \"I certainly don't always know, and would guess many a host doesn't always know, what I need until closer to the event,\" said Eric Diesel, who writes about food and lifestyle on his Urban Home Blog , and who has helped organize some sprawling Thanksgiving feasts with up to 30 guests. By the day before the holiday, he said, the host has a much better idea of what's missing: cocktail napkins, folding chairs, ice or, Mr. Diesel suggested, piles of plastic containers for sending guests home with surplus food. The last items should be brought only if the host wants them and only if there are enough for everybody. One woman whose annual spread starts with two turkeys and eight pies and goes on from there said the most egregious guests of all time -- worse even than the relative's new girlfriend who entertained the multitudes with tales of their fantastic sexual escapades -- were the couple who brought just enough Tupperware for themselves. \"We didn't get leftovers from Alan's mom,\" they explained. (The hostess, though still seething, asked that her name be withheld.) These suggestions help with the altruistic part of your mission. But remember that your highest priority is to make sure you are invited back so that you can enjoy the delicious sensation of not hosting again next Thanksgiving. Here, a small bribe is helpful. A bottle that is too good for the mob can be pressed discreetly into the host's hands as you murmur, \"This is for tomorrow.\" The more thought you put into the bribe, the better the odds it will be effective a year from now. \"Somebody brought me a nice box of stationery,\" said John Winterman, the general manager of the Manhattan restaurant B\u00e2tard and a polished host at home, when asked about gifts from guests he has invited more than once. \"Somebody brought me a chile pepper plant, which we used, of course.\" Flowers growing in a pot (cyclamens look dapper at this time of year) beat cut stems, which will send the host rooting through the cupboards with gravy-splattered hands to find an empty vase. Your shot at a repeat performance will be seriously jeopardized if you spill Burgundy on the heirloom table linens, so a light, alcohol-absorbent lunch may be advisable if dinner will be served late in the day. On the same principle, pregaming with a few shots before you arrive is a risky maneuver. You should be relatively sober when you present your host gift and size up the situation. \"Tune into how the event is going and plug into whoever needs something,\" Mr. Diesel said. \"If the cook is hiding in the kitchen ask, \u2018Can I help, or do you need me to be out there so you can be in here?' \" If you are shooed away, he said, appoint yourself coat-check clerk, bartender or babysitter. Or talk to the stray great-aunt who's on her own. If you are given a kitchen assignment, make sure you understand it down to the last detail, unlike the guest of Ms. Dupree's who piled potatoes on the turkey platter. If the host refuses help, that should not be taken for an invitation to stand in front of the refrigerator and chat, even if that's what you'd do on another, looser day. On Thanksgiving, home kitchens are almost as busy and focused as professional ones, and you shouldn't enter the combat zone any more than you would bust through the swinging doors at Jean-Georges during dinner service shouting: \"Yo, J. G.! What up, dog?\" Most of all, encourage the cooks from the sidelines. Bite your tongue if you notice the gravy hasn't been degreased as thoroughly as you think it should be. \"It's so important not to give any kind of advice on anything,\" said Denis Gainty, a professor of Japanese history at Georgia State University. \"You need to be the cheerleader for the food that's being produced by the host. I have lots of opinions about brining, but I realize I need to steer the conversation to safer topics, like religion and homosexuality.\" At last, the turkey has been carved and you can finally enjoy the fruits of someone else's labor. The urge to cash in with soaring mountain ranges of your favorite foods will be strong. This is the time to recall that you are playing the long game. If the stuffing is gone before everyone has had a crack at it, the host can't make more but can easily look around and identify the looters. For the last two decades, Tom & Jerry's bar in downtown Manhattan has been the site of an open-house Thanksgiving to which any local restaurant employees with nowhere else to go are invited. Daniel O'Connor, an architect who is one of the hosts, said the event is notable for its spirit of cooperation and sharing. Still, not everyone plays along. \"You really see the divide when it's leftover time,\" he said. \"You have some people literally taking an entire turkey home, not a piece of a turkey. Or taking a whole pie. There's always someone like that.\" As you load your plate, remember the Wall Street saying: Pigs get fat; hogs get slaughtered. While taking modest initial portions, though, it's important to act as if you have never encountered such bounty. Leo Carey, a senior editor at The New Yorker, who was born in England and has successfully extracted an invitation from the same Boston family for 15 consecutive Thanksgivings, noticed this American technique of complimenting the host early on. \"Everyone self-consciously, self-mockingly but also weirdly proudly, talks about gluttony,\" he said. \"But the literal amounts of food consumed haven't struck me as totally unprecedented.\" Compliments should be delivered between mouthfuls and scattered far and wide. Keep in mind that there may be many cooks around the table and that each one is a prospective source for next year's invitation. Most of all, though, remember that no dish in the American canon provokes more performance anxiety than roast turkey, and the host needs to hear that all the effort was worth it. One year when I invited people to my house for Thanksgiving, I suggested, in one of those fits of neurotic self-deprecation that hosts are prone to, that the white meat was a bit dry. A guest I didn't know very well agreed. Amateur move. When you don't roast it yourself, the turkey is always perfect.

For the last eight years, Ms. You has been the chef and proprietor of the Tianjin Dumpling House, which is not so much a house as a narrow shaft of elbow room behind a sneeze guard in the basement of a Chinese food-vendors' market on Main Street. The first dumpling of hers that I tried had a sea-bass stuffing cut with minced ginger, which gave bracing clarity to the few drops of broth sealed inside. It was so satisfying that at first I felt no need to branch out. The dumplings were irresistibly priced, though, at about $5 a dozen, and I began to experiment with new ones: lamb and chopped zucchini humming with Sichuan peppercorns, maybe, or pork with threads of fresh dill. These were wildly good, too. One day, I noticed a sign inviting me to pick my own custom dumpling fillings from a grid of 24 ingredients. This paralyzed me. Ms. You clearly had a kind of genius for creating miniature worlds of flavor. Who was I to tell her what she ought to fold into her circles of dough? It was as if somebody had handed me a box of feathers, bones, beaks and flesh and said, \"Here, build a parrot.\" What I wanted was more of Ms. You's recipes, not mine, and I got my wish earlier this year when Ms. You opened Dumpling Galaxy a few blocks from her original stall. Dumpling Galaxy sits back from the street, inside a shiny new mall it shares with a Korean-French bakery and a purveyor of sparkly false eyelashes. Ms. You designed the striking, modern interior herself, splashing bold Chinese red across walls with a basket-weave relief and building deep semiprivate booths, each with its own TV screen showing highlights of the 100 dumplings on the menu. The Dumpling Channel goes heavy on cross-section shots that reveal the central core of filling. Take a good look, because this is a sight you should never see if you want to get the most out of a meal at Dumpling Galaxy. Resist the exploratory nibble. Dip one side in black vinegar and soy, and paint it with chile oil if you like, then pocket the whole thing in your mouth. It won't gush with a waterfall of broth. It will, however, hold a few drops of liquid shed by the filling as the dumpling boiled. Those drops belong to you. Sometimes those juices taste like fresh green herbs, as when Ms. You mixes cilantro with minced lamb, or dill with excellent softly scrambled eggs. Sometimes they combine those qualities with a whiplash of heat, as in the head-twistingly good spicy beef dumpling, seasoned with scallions, fresh red and green chiles, and searing dried chile sauce. As a young girl in Tianjin, China, Ms. You was taught to cook by her mother and grandparents. Her dumplings are sturdy, knobby, domestic creatures in the Northern Chinese tradition. Sometimes you see the ghostly outline of the fillings through the shiny white skins, and sometimes you can't. But her dumplings are stuffed to order, and Ms. You fine-tunes them with the sensitivity of a natural cook who listens to her ingredients. Mixing shrimp with two varieties of celery, the more bitter and self-assured Chinese and the sweeter, shyer Western kind, and using both stalks and leaves, she builds exhilarating harmonies. It would be a miracle on Main Street if all 100 varieties at Dumpling Galaxy were equally lovable. They aren't. The one with shrimp, scallops and crab meat didn't deliver the sweet seafood luxury it promised. Steamed har gow were less juicy than those wheeled around on the best dim sum carts. My strategy is to seek out the proprietary blends, which justify prices that can be slightly higher (as much as $7.95 for six) than those at other places in Flushing, including Tianjin Dumpling House. I've eaten entire meals that delivered less flavor than a single one of Ms. You's dumplings stuffed with terrific little meatballs of duck and shiitakes. And if those hadn't cheered me up, the fried dumplings would. Ms. You pours watery cornstarch into the pan, which bubbles and browns into a shatteringly thin, dumpling-studded pancake. Cracking that crust, I felt like the happiest guy in the galaxy. That feeling wavered whenever I had to lean out of my booth with one arm extended for minutes at a time to ask for water or the check or for empty dishes to be cleared. It was like hailing a cab on Broadway at 5 p.m., but less effective. As time dragged on, I wondered why nobody had invented Uber for waiters. Looking at the tables of Chinese families, I noticed that their dumpling consumption was considerably less piggish than mine. They might share a single order, a mere six dumplings, before moving on to the dishes from Northern China, Hunan and Fujian on the rest of the menu. (One cook specializes in each region.) I came to see the wisdom of allowing fish and vegetables to supplement all the boiled flour I was ingesting. The Hunanese preserved pork stir-fried with stubby lengths of pickled long beans was superb, both fiery and tart. Triple delight vegetables (green chiles, barely tender potato and eggplant so creamy it may as well be pudding) was an unusually good version of the Dongbei standby. Whole fish with spicy bean sauce was a hit at my table, even if we did use the marvelous sauce to obscure the fish's slightly muddy flavor. You can find these dishes elsewhere, but no other kitchen offers such an embarrassment of dumpling riches, including dessert. Some sweet dumplings are pinched in dough like the savory ones, such as tart dried hawthorn berries with white wood ears, or pear with eight treasures, which I now think of as fruitcake pirogi. Others, called tang yuan, are tinted orbs of dough that are springy and chewy, like mochi. My favorite was the pumpkin-flavored globe with a sugary paste of black sesame at the core. These orange globes arrived, not on a plate like the others, but bobbing in a thick, clear, steaming soup. I could stare at ingredient lists all day and never come up with a parrot like this.

It can take time to sort out which are borrowed and which have the sting of the new. Thomas Chen, fresh from the trenches at Eleven Madison Park and Commerce , opened his first restaurant in August, called Tuome. Like so many other places in the era of Noma , it is tastefully spartan in appearance. Its two small dining rooms are furnished with small tables set with small menus printed in small type. The wood chairs and metal bar stools are unsoftened by fabric or cushions. The lights are dim -- not flattering, first-date dim but I'm-too-young-to-be-going-blind dim. In terms of glitz and glamour, Tuome falls somewhere between a yoga studio and Thoreau's cabin . I've eaten in plenty of rooms like this over the last few years. And I've seen any number of dishes resembling these: the Nike swooshes of ultra-blended vegetable pur\u00e9es; the green leaves the size of chipmunk ears arranged just so over a deviled egg; the row of scallops all crouched together as if hiding from some scallop-hating predator on the other side of the plate. Clearly Mr. Chen and I have been following the same Instagram feeds. That egg, though. Wait a minute. This is something different. There is half of a hard-cooked white, deep-fried in panko. Spooned into the divot is a dot of deviled yolk, sharp with pickles and Dijon mustard. On top of that is a spoonful of fried garlic and dried chiles in their spicy red oil. It's fun to feel the temperatures and textures, creamy and crackling and slippery, meet in your mouth, and to taste the strange collision of church-picnic-style eggs with a Chinese condiment. How can half an egg do three or four things at once? Later, a server points a siphon into the crook of an octopus leg. Out comes a suede-colored snowdrift. He says it's brown-butter-and-potato espuma. I say it's foam and I say the hell with it. I focus on the octopus, which crunches emphatically and has a rounded, slightly fruity flavor. With it is a chewy, chunky, lightly gingered XO sauce. Chopped caramelized pork and Chinese sausage give it the sweetness of bacon; fish sauce and dried shrimp take it broader and deeper. I can't get enough of it. The foam will not be ignored forever, though. While it is not the most original notion, it does add something, unlike most foams. What it adds is a fluffy wave of toasted butter, like the frosting on a caramel cake minus the sugar and the heft. The dish is peculiarly good; it makes an extraordinary indulgence out of the octopus. And it shows off the clear and fresh point of view Mr. Chen brings to his cooking, particularly when he interprets Chinese flavors. Before working at Eleven Madison Park and Commerce, Mr. Chen was an accountant. The idea was to stay as far from restaurants as possible, and it came from his parents. After moving from China to New York City, the Chens operated a Chinese restaurant outside of the city. They wanted something higher for Thomas (he was Tommy at home, but on his parents' lips the nickname came out \"tow me,\" which is how Tuome is pronounced), but after shepherding balance sheets by day and attending culinary school by night, he came to see cooking as the higher calling. A little more than two months in, Tuome is already starting to feel mature. The one-page wine list is seriously eclectic, but it's not too cool for a Napa Valley cabernet and an Anderson Valley chardonnay. The servers take their jobs seriously, although I'm not sure the point has to be underlined by forcing them all to wear tailored T-shirts the color of wet cement. Mr. Chen doesn't need to make his staff look like a modern dance troupe to tell people Tuome isn't your average East Village spot; his cooking does that for him. (And the East Village average is getting higher every year.) He has terrific control over salt, spices, texture and contrast, weaving them together until you ask, why hasn't anyone done this before? Adding slick duck fat to packets of Cantonese sticky rice steamed in lotus leaves seems like an obvious good idea. So does the extra crackle he puts into the Chinese sausage bits to save the rice from gummy monotony. But they aren't obvious until you taste Mr. Chen's version. A few dishes show off Mr. Chen's technical command more than his originality. The scoop of chicken liver mousse with maple syrup pooled in a hollow on top, like the gravy on mashed potatoes, is exquisitely done, but feels familiar. Another dish fell out of focus between meals, when the carrot-miso pur\u00e9e accompanying seared scallops lost its savory, salty depth and became merely sweet. And there's one I'd like to forget, a dully sweet squash soup impaled with frogs' legs that were both mushy and stringy. But a striking number of dishes at Tuome are memorable for the right reasons. Serving sous-vide chicken on soupy rice cooked with garlic chives and shiitakes, Mr. Chen doesn't try to sex up his homey inspiration, congee; he just makes it more layered and modern, surrounding the chicken with a dark basil jus, and lets the flavors quietly win you over. I wish he would take the same approach with pork belly instead of forcing it to do double-duty as a marketing event. Right now it's called the Pig Out (a name meant for hashtagging), and it marches to the table as a $49 feast for two, 10 bite-size squares of pork belly riding on a slate shingle with a parade of sauces and bowls of spicy-peanut noodles following behind. The crashing cymbals can't disguise how easily the dish, and its price, could be divided in half. But Mr. Chen has done something amazing to this pig. His inspiration may have been Cantonese roast pork, but these compressed, intensely flavorful squares of well-rendered belly partake of Peking duck, too. After I'd topped the reflective pane of skin with ginger-scallion sauce and a few drops of sambal from a squeeze bottle, I wanted to tuck the pork into a steamed bun or a crepe, and then chew and crunch and chew and crunch some more. Forget the gimmick. There are fresh ideas in this dish, and they are all Mr. Chen's.

One was the common football-size butternut that weighs down shopping bags at this time of year. The other had the same shape but was about as big as a sparrow. I held it in my palm. It felt good in there. Without thinking about what I was doing, I began petting it. The couple at the next table asked if they could see my tiny squash, and I let them stroke its smooth, cool skin. Before things got too weird, our server took my pet squash back to the kitchen. When it came back, it had been roasted and cut in half. Specks of white pepper and strands of grated chestnut lay against its dark orange insides. It was sweeter than a normal butternut, but what I mostly noticed was that it tasted squashier, as if all the flavor had been compressed. Selective breeding was responsible, our server explained. Dan Barber, Blue Hill's executive chef and a co-owner with his brother, David, had asked a Cornell agriculture professor to design a squash for him, making it as small and tasty as possible. The result is the 898 squash , served exclusively at Mr. Barber's two restaurants, Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., and this one, just off Washington Square Park. Mr. Barber opened the one in Manhattan first, in 2000, with the idea of using local seasonal produce, including some from his family's farm in the Berkshires. This put him in the company of, oh, several hundred other chefs. A few years later, though, he was chosen to lead an ambitious project at Stone Barns that combined a farm and a restaurant with research and education programs. It turned out that he was born for the job. Patient, intense, curious, enthusiastic, articulate, Mr. Barber has become a dirt poet and kitchen philosopher whose time outside with the pigs and the beans has had a deep, lasting effect on the way he cooks. Today no other chef has the information he keeps in his head (how to make pure carbon out of a cow's femur) or the vegetables he puts in his ovens (sparrow-size squash). To get the Full Barber, you have to go to Stone Barns for a $198 menu-free, open-ended meal that may include, if you're lucky, a tour of the manure shed where hot compost is put to work as cooking fuel. The original Blue Hill sits in the English basement of a townhouse in Greenwich Village, a historically tolerant neighborhood whose tolerance does not extend to manure sheds. The city doesn't afford the time or space for the leisurely unfurling of Mr. Barber's complete vision of how our appetites should fit into the land and the climate. The low-ceilinged space is too much like a saloon, the tables too close together, the restaurant's many ardent admirers too accustomed to treating it as a place to catch up over an excellent weeknight dinner. If Blue Hill had as many cooks and servers as its more favored sister upstate, they would probably iron out wrinkles like the long, stranded layovers between courses; the wineglasses that sat empty and were finally cleared with no offer of fresh ones; and the $23 glass of Rully poured ice-cold, so it was clenched and astringent. It also seems far out of character that this intensely local restaurant sells just two New York wines on its Francophilic (and not very value-minded) list, and that its only cider comes from California when there is a cider revival going on in Mr. Barber's own, apple-rich state. But while it may give you only a Half Barber, Blue Hill is still an exceptional restaurant. Mr. Barber's long search for flavor out of town pays off downtown, where you find yourself thinking, again and again, that each new ingredient may well be the best example of its kind you've ever tasted. For this reason and others, Blue Hill is one of the few New York restaurants that seem to get better and more original as time goes by. This was true the last time it was reviewed in The New York Times, in 2006, when Frank Bruni brought it from two stars to three, and it is true now. Dinner at Blue Hill can go in one of two directions: a four-course, $85 menu that you choose, or a longer, free-form \"farmer's feast\" chosen by Mr. Barber or his chef de cuisine, Shingoon Hong, for $98 or $125, depending on how hungry the farmer is. Either way, the night will include a couple of surprise cameos by fruits and vegetables that drop in like the kooky neighbors in a sitcom. A meal in September started with wispy young fennel stalks that had a clean and pure licorice sweetness and ended with firm, green-skinned, yellow-fleshed plums on ice. Both made me happy I had come to Blue Hill then, not a week sooner or later, which is the effect that certain fruits and vegetables can have when they're picked at the right time. In a more recent meal, the kitchen sent out a raw hakurei turnip as big as an apple. In fact, it had been pushed through an apple slicer. I picked up a white wedge, swiped it through a pool of tarragon vinaigrette and braced for the harsh turnip aftertaste that never came. I won't tell you that I ate the whole thing, or that it was as sweet and juicy as an apple, but it came much closer than I would have thought possible. When it comes to actual cooking, Mr. Barber's approach is to intensify ingredients that are pretty intense already. Looking at the saturated orange color of fat slabs of roasted carrot \"cutlet,\" I could tell it was going to taste richer and rounder than any carrot I had met before. The approach works on things that once had a pulse, too. Grass-fed, dry-aged veal, carved into a sampler of cuts, some fattier, some leaner, was ruddier and more bloody-tasting than most veal, but it still had a focused, refined taste that set it apart from beef. The caramelized outside edge of a slowly roasted neck from a Blue Hill Farm goat had a profoundly satisfying chew; the meat hiding under it was astoundingly tender and juicy. It had some of the primal pleasures of barbecue, and I wanted to tear into it with my hands. In the early days of Blue Hill, I respected the cooking but didn't want to wallow around in it the way I do now. The whole complicated web that Mr. Barber oversees has many purposes, spinning off in all directions, but if you just sit down to dinner, you can believe that the point of the entire operation is to provide you with one delicious taste after another. And maybe it is.

The concrete tops are polished smooth with beeswax, and the sides are edged with copper. The shapes look irregular, but the sides are slightly bowed so that a pair of two-tops can spoon against each other and become a four-top. \"That's the idea, anyway,\" our server said. \"But they don't all fit together.\" Blenheim is like that, too. A tremendous amount of thought and effort has gone into the food, drinks and design, but they don't always connect. This seems to have been an issue since the beginning. The first chef left about three weeks in because of what the owners called \"irreconcilable differences.\" In July, they hired Ryan Tate, who had been the chef at Le Restaurant in TriBeCa until it suddenly closed. I admired the $100 set menus he served there enough that I happily gave the place two stars in a review last year. Mr. Tate has set his ambitions even higher this time. Besides a sizable \u00e0 la carte menu, he offers a $115, nine-course tasting loaded with extra dishes. At times, his cooking is as thoughtful and transporting as it was at Le Restaurant, but with a higher degree of intricacy. At other times, the kitchen is obviously struggling to keep up. Meanwhile, the service runs the gamut from charming and slightly lost to nonexistent. On my first night there, the disparity between the two was the widest I had ever seen in any restaurant. That is not the only disconnect. When tables are set up outside next to the cobblestone streets, Blenheim looks as if its only desire is to be your drop-in-and-hang-out corner tavern. The dining room, with an antique tree saw, a wooden yoke and a whole array of carpentry tools on the walls, looks like the historical society of some upstate village, where it would be the only tourist attraction. Underlining the point, servers tell you right away that this is a farm-to-table restaurant, that ingredients are trucked in from Blenheim Hill Farm in Schoharie County, southwest of Albany, owned by Mr. Sohlberg and his wife, Min Ye. You might reasonably expect pork cutlets, creamed corn, maybe pie. Mr. Tate has other ideas. Terrific ideas, often, even if they have as much business in a rusticated farm-to-table tavern as white tie and spats. The stream in Schoharie County where tilefish and sea urchin splash around together hasn't been discovered yet, but at Blenheim they swim happily side by side on one plate. The tilefish falls into big, sweet white flakes that taste of shrimp. The urchin is whipped into a creamy, slightly briny sabayon that is like a richer, more luxurious taramosalata. Also on the plate are fat blueberries and carrots roasted in coffee bean oil. I can't explain why blueberries taste so good with sea urchin sabayon, but they do. Alaskan king crab meat had been made almost as sweet and tender as some tropical fruit, but the midnight funk of squid ink sauce brought it back to the sea. With dense roasted chanterelles and wands of naturally pickled sea bean scattered around the plate, this was an appetizer you could go quietly crazy over. And it would take a crazy person to complain that Alaskan crab and sea urchin are insufficiently farm-to-table when they're cooked this skillfully. Not that Mr. Tate turns his back on the owners' land entirely. The carrots and the chanterelles come from Blenheim Hill Farm. So does the pork loin, which is slowly roasted until it drips with juices and then sent to the table with a cast of cool Southern characters: pickled peaches, okra charred to a crisp husk, and sorghum syrup, like molasses cut with espresso. Those are Blenheim lettuces and crunchy chips of smoked Blenheim ham in the gloriously crisp and fresh salad, and that's creamy Blenheim pork fat spackling the side of the bowl. The lemon balm, thyme and pineapple sage in a sensational group of herb sorbets: Blenheim-grown. The gap between the farm-to-table ethos and Mr. Tate's style is minor compared with the gulf between the restaurant Blenheim could be and the restaurant that currently sits at 283 West 12th Street. The same dish can be stunning one night and a contorted mess on another. The first time I had the roasted king mushrooms with spaetzle and sauerkraut, the mushroom stems had something like the flavor and texture of weisswurst. A German-inspired vegetarian main course with mushrooms standing in for sausages is a fantastic notion, and I couldn't wait to taste it again when I returned. But when I did, the stems were watery inside and rubbery outside, like a steamed hot dog wrapped in a balloon. An unusual dessert soup of cooked barley and Champagne grapes in a chilled barley-jasmine tea went out of whack between visits, going from fascinating to weird. And there were glitches that were surprising in such a technique-focused kitchen. The grapefruit pearls with cured Tasmanian sea trout were meant to burst with juice, but they had solidified. Eating them was like chewing on the drippings of a grapefruit-scented candle. On Blenheim's better nights, I might have ranked the food among the most exciting and interesting I've eaten in the last year. But it came to the table so very, very slowly that it was hard to stay excited or interested. It took more than three hours one night to order and eat appetizers, main courses and desserts. I wondered if the kitchen was overwhelmed. I was sure our server was. We had to flag him down to ask for more of the soft, warm and yeasty rolls made with Cheddar and Marmite. They never came. It took two tries and about 20 minutes to get a second glass of wine. We were left alone with menus for three-quarters of an hour before we waved like drowning sailors and begged him to take our order. \"There are some additions to the menu tonight,\" he began. Additions? When the kitchen can't send out more than one course an hour, the menu needs subtractions. And Blenheim has no business offering nine-course tastings unless it is ready to provide pajamas and sleeping bags. Maybe its pieces would fit together better if there weren't so many of them. I hope so, because I'd like to see it transform itself from a puzzle to a restaurant.

Chanterelle, a downtown pioneer when it opened in 1979, was an institution by the time it went out of business , just a few months short of its 30th anniversary. Like all institutions, it had become padded by ritual, tradition and reputation. You went there to eat, of course, but you also went because it was supposed to be one of the city's greatest restaurants, holding four stars from The New York Times at various points . You went to find out whether the artist who had drawn the cover of the handwritten menu would be at the next table. You went because Karen Waltuck, the chef's wife and partner, and her ballet corps of elegant, mildly bohemian servers knew how to make you comfortable even if grand restaurants like Chanterelle weren't usually your thing. At \u00c9lan , which Mr. Waltuck opened with George Stinson north of Union Square this summer, the institutional padding is gone. Restaurants like Chanterelle have a wine directory the size and mass of the Oxford English Dictionary, but \u00c9lan's fits on four very tempting pages of reds and whites up to $105, with a short appendix of more-expensive bottles under the heading \"treat yourself.\" The one reminder of Mr. Waltuck's downtown-bohemian past is the quintuple self-portrait by Chuck Close that hangs opposite the wide concrete bar, a black curtain from which disembodied Close heads stare grimly out of the darkness, like a trick in a haunted house. The monochromatic dining room is attractive enough, but a little too bright by night when the pinpoint lights beam straight down. Look along the banquette, and you see a row of shiny, illuminated noses. A heavy framed mirror seems to be suspended by a thick white rope, which somehow makes it look less secure. It's a reasonably quiet room, friendly to conversation, but not one whose innate beauty will draw you back. There is, in other words, little in the environment for the food to hide behind. Standing out in the open, Mr. Waltuck's cooking is revealed to be as variable, as prone to peaks and valleys, as anyone else's. This may rattle the Chanterelle sentimentalists, but it seems to have liberated Mr. Waltuck. A chef with stars to defend and a reputation to maintain does what politicians do in close elections: sticks to the script, tries to stay predictable. At \u00c9lan, Mr. Waltuck gets to play. He doesn't have to ask himself whether a pair of pot stickers filled with mashed potatoes can be a four-star dish. That's a boring question. The point is that finding potatoes inside crimped pan-fried dumplings surrounded by a haze of shaved summer truffles is a funny, delicious surprise. He must be playing, too, when he stirs sea urchin into a deep bowl of guacamole. Avocado doesn't need extra creaminess, but it takes extremely well to briny seafood, as you find out when you spread some on a grease-free taro chip. Occasionally, what seems like a fun idea will land like a bag of wet laundry. Foie gras lollipops sound decadent, but the cold wad of dull liver rolled in uncrunchy pistachios is a grim treat. General Tso's sweetbreads are another game gone wrong. If the sweetbreads were ever crisp, they aren't by the time they've been stir-fried with bok choy and sloshed around in an orange-chile sauce that seemed to need more spice and citrus tang. (This dish may fall into one of my blind spots, because the Chinese takeout classic doesn't ring my doorbell, either.) Servers at \u00c9lan will announce conspiratorially that there is an \"off the menu special,\" a burger of duck and foie gras, even though it's always available. The whispered hard sell is a tired ploy to begin with, and this slightly mushy pile of meat sweetened with onion chutney and figs isn't spectacular enough to make the gimmick pay off. At times, \u00c9lan seems a little unfocused, as if Mr. Waltuck is hedging his bets by combining a grown-up bistro with a gastro pub in the crazed-carnivore style of the past decade. One of \u00c9lan's least pleasant dishes is scallop fettuccine dressed with a sauce that seems to be pure duck fat. After one forkful, I wanted a salad. Fashions have changed since Chanterelle closed, of course, but \u00c9lan is at its best when it is not trying to keep up with the youngsters. The mere sight of tea-smoked salmon on the menu may cause Asian fusion flashbacks. (Enormous Buddhas! Chopsticks as hairpins! Raw tuna served over bowls of live Siamese fighting fish!) But Mr. Waltuck's salmon is no throwback. It is silky and elegant, given a sweet-sour depth by a lightly curried tamarind sauce. The dish that made Mr. Waltuck's name, the seafood sausage in which sweet bits of scallops and shrimp are bound together by a subtle fish mousse, is back, looking hopelessly behind the times in its sauerkraut beurre blanc. Do not be fooled: It is also one of the most delicious things at \u00c9lan. I enjoyed Mr. Waltuck's steamed zucchini blossoms at Chanterelle and enjoyed them again at \u00c9lan, where they were stuffed with zucchini and Parmesan and served with slow-cooked tomatoes and very fresh, clean-tasting lemon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. With dishes that call for lightness and delicacy, \u00c9lan comes into its own. The menu changes all the time, and at every meal, one or two recipes seemed to need more time in the test kitchen. A red-wine butter sauce with striped bass was very vague, as if it needed to be reduced longer. But a special I had the same night, fluffy fish quenelles bobbing in an aromatic Thai soup, skillfully combined Mr. Waltuck's longstanding love for Asian traditions with his habit of jumping outside tradition when the mood strikes. Diana Valenzuela, the pastry chef, seems to work the same way. She will be zigging in one direction, then she'll zag left on you. Panna cotta with Concord grape jam and fragile sheets of pine-nut brittle starts like dessert but ends like a cheese course; Ms. Valenzuela makes the panna cotta from Gorgonzola. A pastis-soaked chocolate cake might have been more interesting if it hadn't been topped with an oddly waxy chocolate mousse. But a swatch of basil pastry cream is an unexpected and excellent addition to blueberries in a thin, crisp corn-flour tart shell. Ms. Valenzuela's desserts are just right for a restaurant that takes the predictability out of tradition.

They'll call us.\" This was the grim report from inside the latest East Village restaurant to have turned its no-reservations policy into a viral marketing campaign. A small, hungry mob was gathering on the sidewalk. Hoping to find a pleasant place to drink and snack until the phone rang, I herded my group to Huertas, a new Basque-leaning tapas place a few blocks away. The room smelled like garlic and smoke. A cured pig's leg sat at the end of the bar, its ankle held tightly in a clamp. A sharp knife had exposed its interior architecture of meat and fat and sinew. Later, we ordered a few slices of this Iberico ham, and as it melted on our tongues, warm and salty, we all traded looks. We did it again when we ate crumbly shards of aged manchego that tasted of brown butter and caramel. The looks meant: This kitchen knows where to get the good stuff. That applied to many things we ate that night. Jonah Miller, Huertas's chef, has written a concise menu of Basque-inspired tapas, not all of which could be called cooking and a fair amount of which is canned. I am not revealing any secrets here. Some food is still in its can when it comes to the table, like the dense mackerel in olive oil, which we ate, happily, on sliced baguettes with piment\u00f3n aioli. \"All the best Basque seafood goes straight into cans,\" our server told us, and she was so convincing that we asked if she knew a store that sold these marvelous cans. She did. She also knew where we could buy the manchego, which she was as excited about as we were. From the front door to the table, our service had been proactively friendly and enthusiastic. In New York, servers who learn that night's menu are rare enough; here was one who seemed to know everything about every ingredient. She told us about a restaurant in San Sebasti\u00e1n, where the chef had come out of the kitchen to point out the most delicious parts of a turbot, showing her how to scoop out his favorite part, the cheeks. Then she took a deep breath and said: \"Spain, you guys.\" It wasn't all cans and hams in Mr. Miller's kitchen, not that I would have minded. We asked for something called Huertas rotos, which turned out to be the Basque dish huevos rotos interpreted as a kind of pasta dish. Skinny threads of potato were cooked al dente and tossed with chorizo and its oil, with a soft-cooked egg on top. It was gone in 30 seconds. We drank vermouth, made on site, while every few minutes somebody came around with a tray of small bites straight from the kitchen. There was egg salad on a slice of baguette, with a sweet red shrimp on top; a golden croqueta of rice with creamy mushrooms in the center; and sweet roasted piquillo peppers stuffed with a cheesy, porky froth of fresh sausage whipped into goat cheese. These came in single servings that you could take or decline, depending on how good they looked and how hungry you were. Each plate you took was marked down on a card, dim-sum style, by servers. Huertas calls these items pintxos, a Basque term for snacks smaller than tapas and pinned together with a toothpick. In Spain, pintxos do not circulate like dim sum. (Mr. Miller got the idea from State Bird Provisions in San Francisco.) Yet we felt much closer to the Spanish tapas-bar spirit than if we had ordered 10 or 15 \"small plates meant for sharing\" at once, passed them around the table and called it dinner. This is rarely a satisfying way to eat, but it's how many Spanish restaurants in New York deal with tapas. The Huertas modified dim-sum approach was perfect for people like us, who want to start with drinks and see how the night goes without being forced to turn tapas into dinner. The way this night went was that by the time the other restaurant called, we didn't want to leave. I went back to Huertas a week or two later. I had made reservations for the small, square back dining room, where Mr. Miller serves a set menu for $55. In the front room, the plates are unconnected episodes, and you supply the narrative yourself. In the back, you settle in while Mr. Miller tells a story in five courses. He started with a nod to the front room, a plate of little bites. There were gildas, found in every tapas bar in San Sebasti\u00e1n, sharp, clean and salty skewers of white anchovy threaded with spicy green pepper and an olive. There was a blistered mound of Padr\u00f3n peppers and garlic shrimp on toothpicks, too, not the sweetest or firmest I'd ever eaten. This was an anomaly; in general, the cooking at Huertas stands out for its pure, fresh flavors. Then a separated egg. The white, fried, lay under a jumble of corn and tomatoes cooked quickly with crisp-chewy piment\u00f3n-cured bacon. The yolk, raw, sat on top and served as sauce. Next was skate, sweet and still a little juicy inside, with roasted turnips and a pale-green, herbaceous sauce of pur\u00e9ed turnip greens and fennel. The seasonal Greenmarket aesthetic was familiar to me. Would any Basques recognize the dish? They would know the next course, wonderful garlic-and-piment\u00f3n-scented lamb hot dogs called chistorra, even though they would be used to seeing chistorras made with pork or beef. Alongside these house-made sausages, Mr. Miller had a wonderful succotash of late-summer beans. Dessert was a dream, a round and closely packed little goat-cheese cheesecake with a topping of candied almonds instead of a bottom crust. More tangy than sugary, the cake took beautifully to a sauce made from ripe nectarines. This night and a later one made it clear that dinner in Huertas's back room ranks among the best deals in town, up there with the how-do-they-do-it bargains at Contra and Delaware & Hudson. Mr. Miller shapes his menus so skillfully that it's hard to imagine wanting more. Still, once the familiar conventions of the modern tasting menu kicked in, I did steal a few looks at the front room, where a tray of hot croquetas always seemed to be going around. Maybe I wanted more spontaneity. Or maybe I just wanted a croqueta.

He looked like the boy in a tornado movie who notices that the birds have stopped singing. \"There's no music,\" he said. \"They have speakers all over the dining room, but they're not using them.\" The restaurateur Keith McNally opened Cherche Midi in June on the corner of Houston Street and the Bowery, in a neighborhood where you don't go out to dinner unless you are prepared to shout over some Pavement song the chef loved in college. But we were talking, with no recorded soundtrack, as if we were in some Continental restaurant off Sutton Place in 1964 eating veal Orloff by candlelight. This is the paradox of Mr. McNally. Food writers who were still eating applesauce through a straw when he opened his first restaurant ( the Odeon , 1980) write about him with the same reverence that music writers have for Leonard Cohen. He's \"the king of cool,\" the restaurateur who \"owns NYC.\" Yet when it comes to current dining trends, particularly those in favor downtown, Mr. McNally shows a healthy disregard, verging at times on hostility. Of the six restaurants he operates between 14th Street and Canal Street, Cherche Midi may be his most thorough repudiation of the downtown scene. It isn't just music that's missing. There's almost no view of the street. Tapas, shared plates, tasting menus, wine pairings, \"Chef recommends,\" two-hour waits for a table the size of a chessboard -- no, none of that. Nor did Cherche Midi's servers try to tell me \"how the menu works,\" as if it were some complicated and expensive piece of machinery that I was likely to break. In Mr. McNally's restaurants, chefs are rarely treated like stars. At Cherche Midi, two men, Shane McBride and Daniel Parilla, share the work and the credit. As a result, perhaps, their cooking is almost egoless; it's not about what they want. It's about what you want, especially if that happens to be red meat and French wine. The prime rib may be the only dish at Cherche Midi that could be accused of trying to make an impression. The dark, roasted edges had the irresistible intensity of the bark on great barbecued brisket, even on the night they were aggressively salted. Lending this slab of dry-aged beef a bit of finesse is the side dish of pommes souffl\u00e9es, like inflatable potato chips or, as one guest said, \"gluten-free beignets.\" The menu gives three more main-course slots to beef. Steak frites does a fine impersonation of a Parisian bistro steak, the kind you don't mind chewing and chewing between glasses of the house Beaujolais Villages, served at Cherche Midi in an $18 carafe. Filet mignon au poivre is far more tender, of course, with less sacrifice in flavor than usual. The tall, compact, rather lean, drip-free and wholly excellent burger is made from dry-aged prime rib; if you put your nose close enough, you can smell the meat locker right through the aroma of onion-bacon jam. All three dishes come with dark, skinny fries. Cherche Midi is so good with beef that even the best of the other main courses may register as a half step down: a pot of fat, clean mussels with bits of preserved lemon clinging to them; a roast chicken done right; a salade ni\u00e7oise that pays attention to the last detail, including, in a wonderful departure from tradition, the pile of smashed potato salad at the bottom of the bowl. Here and there, the kitchen tends to overembellish. The decent roasted salmon comes with a lentil salad that tries to do too many things at once, and limp white stewed onions and fennel did not give skate Grenobloise (billed as meuni\u00e8re) anything that it really needed. It would be nice, too, to taste the meat under the aggressive seasoning in the steak tartare appetizer, given the chefs are clearly buying good beef. At least it made a strong impression, which is more than I can say for the $18 heirloom tomato salad. Heirlooms from where, exactly? Food Emporium? Still, unless you are coming to Cherche Midi to commune with the essence of summer, it is a good enough salad. The desserts are much better than that. The floating islands, the mocha pot de cr\u00e8me, the small pink raspberry souffl\u00e9 hovering above a bed of warm berries -- the lineup is one argument after another for bringing back old-fashioned pleasures. After a recent tour of all his restaurants, I think Mr. McNally's great talent may be knowing which things are worth worrying about and which can get by with being just good enough. At Morandi , the main courses were almost impressive in their mediocrity, but the pasta was just swell, which may be all the place needs to keep its chairs full. The short-rib patty melt was the only good dish on a table full of disappointments at Schiller's Liquor Bar , but I enjoyed myself more than I have at far better restaurants. There is a limit, though, and Balthazar is approaching it. The cooking, under Mr. McBride, has become utterly mundane, a pretty but flavorless imitation of French food of the kind found at any generic fake bistro. Cherche Midi's salade ni\u00e7oise is delicious from start to finish; Balthazar's is a bowl of ingredients that can't remember what they're supposed to taste like. How can the same chef and the same restaurateur be responsible for both? Mr. McNally does worry about service, which at Cherche Midi manages to be everywhere without crossing the line to helicopter waitering. And, of course, he worries about the interiors. Cherche Midi's is lovely. Outside is a dystopian intersection. You'd never know it in the dining room, which feels intimate, almost private, although of course every face is on display, bathed in light the color of apricot jam. For three decades, Mr. McNally has been rooting around in the same Lego kit: distressed mirrors, chipped subway tiles, bottles backlighted to look like stained glass. In his hands, these well-worn tricks give restaurants the battered nobility of a vintage Saab. When anyone else tries, they end up with a 1986 Ford Escort. Sets and lighting will never be the whole show.

To know where we are, do you need to see the smeared pitchers of schmaltz on every table? Smell the chopped garlic on every steak? Hear the yip of the small child whose head hits the ceiling as he is hoisted on a chair by adults drunk on \"Hava Nagila\" and Stolichnaya? Did you think the person commanding the imaginary visitors from North Korea to get up and dance the hora was the ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel of Per Se? No, the only possible setting is Sammy's Roumanian Steakhouse , the most wonderful terrible restaurant in New York. What happens at Sammy's doesn't happen at other restaurants, and vice versa. The rest of the Lower East Side can obsess over filament light bulbs and salvaged barn beams; Sammy's, virtually unchanged since opening in 1975, will be ready when fluorescents and drop ceilings make their triumphant return to fashion. Inside the dining room, lighted like a bail bondsman's office in Detroit, are hundreds of faded business cards, yellowed newspaper clippings and curled snapshots taped and tacked to every surface. Outside on Chrystie Street, scaffolding obscures the faded red and yellow painted signs in front of the building, which looks as if it has been marked for demolition. Like a Mississippi juke joint, Sammy's seems to have been put together under the theory that nobody is likely to stay sober long enough to inspect the d\u00e9cor. (Known for selling vodka bottles encased in ice, Sammy's is New York's original bottle-service restaurant, and still the only tolerable one.) Other steakhouses can drive themselves crazy over internal temperatures. At Sammy's, the meat will be cooked. If you have something more specific in mind, if you want it medium or black and blue, then write your request on a sheet of paper, tear it into small pieces and throw them into the air when the piano player sings \"Happy Birthday.\" Two times I asked for garlic-smeared skirt steak, called Romanian tenderloin at Sammy's, cooked medium rare. One steak arrived medium well, and the other time a single steak ranged from well done to bloody, and every degree in between. I wasn't asked how I wanted a broiled veal chop. It was seared on the outside and raw inside, the way other places serve tuna. When nobody asked how I wanted sweetbreads broiled, I feared the worst. Another surprise: Scored and blackened on top, they were close to perfect. The servers follow a template unique to this restaurant, too, dressed in Sammy's T-shirts and jeans with a dishrag swinging from one pocket. Speed trumps ceremony. Standing over a metal bowl of chopped liver, they pour a cascade of schmaltz from on high, go at the liver with forks to mix in the shredded radishes, fried onions and lumps of fried chicken skin, and do not necessarily notice the stray bits that escape the bowl and land on the table. The ritual ends, not with \"bon app\u00e9tit\" or \"enjoy your meal\" but with, \"O.K., start eating.\" The classic style of waiting tables at Lower East Side Jewish restaurants, by turns cranky, funny and crankily funny (discerning one from another could take decades of practice) probably died with Ratner's, but flashes of it still surface at Sammy's. One night, when we kept asking our server if we'd ordered enough, he rolled his eyes, checked his watch and said, \"Tell you what: If you're still hungry, the Chinese food will be here at 9:30.\" Hungry we weren't. As always at Sammy's, I walked out feeling as if I had eaten a football stuffed with chicken fat and beef. The kitchen, so unpredictable when it comes to meat temperatures, is absolutely consistent in its ability to produce starch that detonates inside the stomach. The fried kreplach are grenades of dough with a tiny core of chopped meat that tastes like dough, too. The latkes are flavorless and textureless, but not weightless. Better than either, the kishke could stand some gravy and some salt. In fact, with the exception of the grandmotherly sweet-and-sour stuffed cabbage, almost everything at Sammy's needed salt. Once it was added freely, the chopped liver was beyond reproach, the skirt steaks and lamb chops were excellent, and the fried silver-dollar potatoes were worth talking about. I can't figure out why Sammy's is cutting back on sodium after all these years, unless it is suddenly trying to atone for decades of treating schmaltz as a dietary supplement. The menu is less distinctively Romanian than it once was. The last review of Sammy's in The New York Times, written by Mimi Sheraton in 1982, praised the Romanian salad of whipped eggplant with green peppers; the broiled brains; the mush steak; the pitcha, a seasoned gelatin made from calves' feet and garlic; and the baked unborn eggs. The recent menus, stapled inside manila folders as they have been since the Koch administration, haven't offered any of these specialties. This is how a culture disappears. But if Romania has faded, Sammy's is still loudly, raucously, endlessly, embracingly Jewish, a permanent underground bar mitzvah where Gentiles can act like Jews and Jews can act like themselves. One night, I went with a woman who had spent the summer in Europe, as synagogues and Jewish-owned shops burned in one city after another. In Sammy's basement, when strangers joined their hands in the air and danced between the tables, eyeing our food as they passed, I could see her grow less tense every minute. \"It feels so good to be back in a place where I can be out,\" she finally said. And if this is not your heritage -- if you aren't quite sure what is happening when the man at the keyboard belts out \"Sing us a song, you're the schmatte man\" -- the entertainers at Sammy's will still get to you. Dancing and singing along to some dumb old tune being played by a musician in the corner: This is how people had fun in the Old World, by which I don't mean just the parts of Europe where the Lower East Side's Jews came from, but also the world before amplifiers and apps and first-person-shooter video games and all the forms of entertainment that drive us into ourselves. Sammy's forces you out of yourself; I don't think there's another restaurant in New York where people talk to strangers as readily as they do here. \"Would you like me to take your picture?\" somebody at the next table asked one night. \"Do you want our seltzer charger for your egg creams?\" another asked us. As a table of about two dozen people filed out, a woman in the back called to them, \"Thank you for dancing with us!\" Is this a three-star restaurant, as Mimi Sheraton thought in 1982? By today's standards, of course not. It is closer to one. But if you need stars to tell you what to think of Sammy's, I'm not sure I want to share my seltzer charger with you. I'll give it to those nice North Korean Jews instead.

Today, that seems less like the end of an epoch than a salutary cooling-off period. If you are having trouble getting a reservation at a new place this year, odds are high that the menu is speckled with accents grave, acute and circumflex. Dirty French is turning away customers at the door. Keith McNally sent frogs' legs marching to the rescue at Cherche Midi after his pizzeria there fizzled. And just north of Washington Square Park, at an address that had started to look like a certain restaurant-killer, the doors at a new Proven\u00e7al spot called Claudette have been thrown open to reveal closely packed rattan chairs, none of them empty. Claudette's charms are many and begin with those doors, which replace the woebegone sidewalk enclosure that used to make it look as if nobody were home. Losing a few seats has made reservations harder to land, but the reward is that the doors have let in the atypically cool breezes all summer, along with a view of lower Fifth Avenue's wide, leisurely sidewalks, where somebody is always walking a bichon fris\u00e9. Inside, Claudette looks like an expensive summer rental that is being used as a French street-corner cafe. (Rattan connects the two motifs.) The beach rental aesthetic is supplied by the whitewashed tables, throw pillows and shelves lined with books that are arranged by color and separated by anonymous knickknacks. Contributing to the cafe look are the compact bar and the winning cast of aperitif cocktails, which all seem to be named after Roger Vadim's wives. Small, gentle and very appealing, the Brigitte and her cohorts cheerfully buck the trend toward potent, convoluted cocktails that don't know how to behave at the dinner table. Claudette's food follows the example of the aperitifs; it is light, approachable and unlikely to impair your ability to stand up at the end of the meal. If you are in the mood for an intelligent salad, Claudette has plenty: green beans and vinegared hearts of palm with heaps of fresh mint; a nest of freshly shredded zucchini, still crisp under its anchovy vinaigrette; a crunch-fest of raw radishes and snap peas tugged in an unexpected, intriguing direction by cumin. Even less expected was the cinnamon-laced raz al hanout spice blend dusted on the bistro-style fries. More brushes with North Africa lay ahead. Claudette makes an unleavened, layered flatbread, similar to traditional kesra, that is good when hot from the griddle, especially with a thick smear of pistou. (I couldn't see the point of another spread, the bland and expensive hummus with chopped truffles.) Gradually, it becomes clear that Claudette's chef, Wade Moises, and chef de cuisine, Koren Grieveson, have made a smart decision about Provence. Rather than treating it as if it were frozen in time and sealed off from the world -- Peter Mayle's \"A Year in Provence\" repeated forever -- they cast a few glances at the North African immigrants who live and cook there. Claudette's owners, Carlos Suarez and Mark Barak, were traveling in Provence when, like many English-speaking tourists, they fell under the sunny spell of Lourmarin. They had a charmed meal in that town at a restaurant founded by Claudette Sammut, a Frenchwoman who lived in Tunisia until the 1950s. Before it was over, they had asked her family if they could take her name back to Manhattan. They brought her bouillabaisse, too, an eccentric white version that has a puff-pastry hat and lemon juice but no tomatoes and an undetectable quantity of saffron. I was not as smitten by its tenaciously sour broth as they were. As a sauce for the monkfish, baby octopus and shellfish, it might get by, but as a soup, it lost its appeal after a few spoonfuls, and even sooner the time it was oversalted. A somewhat more successful souvenir from Lourmarin is the pieds paquets. Traditionally an all-day stew of sheep's trotters and tripe, it has been de-trottered for New Yorkers. Or, as a server with an oratorical flair put it, \"we absented the feet for cleanliness of flavor.\" What we get instead are tripe-wrapped bundles of pork shoulder braised in white wine and tomatoes. Tender but polite, they are upstaged by the grilled bread, fantastic when dunked in the expanse of rust-colored sauce. As the absented feet suggest, Claudette's exploration of Provence can be undercut by its impulse to play it safe, to water down the pastis. Braised chicken thighs on a bed of nutty toasted bulgur arrive in a tagine, but they aren't cooked in one. When servers lift the glazed lid, the mint and other aromatics don't rush into your lungs the way they would in Tangier. The tiny dab of harissa doesn't go far, either. But the chicken is moist and well browned, the sauce gets sunny Mediterranean sweetness from oranges, and for complexity and originality, the dish leaves the other main courses in the shade. After making its opening moves so gracefully, Claudette grows oddly clumsy at the end. The most reliable dessert is the pistachio cake sandwiching a layer of citrus cream, smartly accompanied by candied orange peel. But a chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me with harissa was grainy, and a supposed bread pudding of chocolate-almond croissants looked and tasted exactly like a stack of stale pastries. Most of the time, though, the kitchen does what it sets out to do, even if it seems to be holding back. If Mr. Moises and Ms. Grieveson choose to dive a bit deeper into their vision of an African-tinged Provence, they could make the Gallic revival more interesting by cleaning the dusty windows of nostalgia through which New Yorkers like to view French cuisine.

Narrow the list to those with the confidence to serve it raw, and you're probably down to one finger and one name: Dave Pasternack. The challenges of bluefish are formidable. If it isn't iced right after it's hooked, if it isn't killed and chilled properly, if too much time goes by before it arrives at the table, bluefish has a habit of tasting and smelling like discount cat food. Its flavor is strong but its flesh is soft, and when it is raw, a dull, unsteady knife can reduce it to a bruise-colored pulp. Of course I had to have it when I spotted it under the crudo section of the menu at Barchetta , which Mr. Pasternack opened in Chelsea in April. And of course it was immaculate: firm slabs of bluefish, standing at attention on a cold plate with olive oil, a few drops of lemon juice and inky green shreds of caper leaves. The rich oils melted while I chewed, and I was convinced that this particular specimen must have been slashing through the Atlantic while I had been brewing that morning's coffee. In 14 years as the chef at Esca , Mr. Pasternack has proved to be one of the city's most resourceful and skillful seafood cooks. It goes without saying that Barchetta, where Mr. Pasternack's partner is John Meadow and his chef de cuisine is Christian Goerner, is a seafood restaurant. It is a very good one at times, but not at all times. There were encouraging nights, including the one that started with raw bluefish, when I was sure that Barchetta would become one of the first places I'd send people who really love the taste of fish. And there was one when it seemed mired among all the also-rans. Inconsistency in a seafood restaurant presents a quandary. Great ones are rare enough that seafood lovers will feel a strong tug to check out Barchetta and hope for the best, but they'll also be tempted to stay away out of fear that they'll hit it on an off night. This is not a problem that plagues diners who simply want a grilled pork chop. Fish cooking tends to be an all-or-nothing game, though. An extra day between the ocean and the table or an extra minute in the saut\u00e9 pan can mean the difference between a memorable dinner and a wasted evening. The chefs who understand the factors that make that difference, and can navigate them, are in shorter supply than bluefin tuna. I knew I was in the hands of one of those chefs on my first and second meals at Barchetta. Monkfish liver was treated like foie gras, darkly seared on the outside but as wobbly as pudding within. On the side were figs roasted into a jam-jar sweetness. The idea was both obvious and inspired. The crudi were just the way I remembered them from Esca. Each fish was carved with a sushi chef's sensitivity to fish anatomy, then given only as much added flavor as it could handle. To bring out the minerality and sweetness of pink snapper, there were plum-red grains of sea salt blended with Long Island merlot. Subtle, supple halibut belly was splashed with sunflower oil that was so mild it almost wasn't there. Golden spotted bass, slightly more forceful, was given a light application of olive oil and lemon, while bluefish got a similar treatment but in the stronger dose that it needed. Main courses like wonderfully rich grilled kingfish steak, a roasted whole black sea bass and a bread-crumb-crusted hunk of pumpkin swordfish were pulled from the heat precisely at the moment their thickest sections had firmed, before they had a chance to seize up into a tough fist that would chase away their sweet oceanic juices. On the night when the kitchen seemed to fall behind the beat, though, the skin on a grilled Spanish mackerel was too severely charred and the flesh had been heated a few degrees beyond the ideal. Toasted cracked hazelnuts and orange sections helped make up for it, and the dish wouldn't have raised eyebrows in most other restaurants, but it lacked the finesse that I knew by then Barchetta is capable of. A handsome, thick cut of cobia had been left on the grill until it had the first signs of squeaky overdoneness and the grate had burned the bread-crumb coating. Raw blackfish dotted with pine-bud syrup was tougher than the crudi had been on other nights. Some greens in a relentlessly dull salad were showing their age. A bowl of pasta with mullet bottarga was swimming in olive oil that took the crunch right out of the toasted bread crumbs. A few excellent dishes surfaced from the murk, like the gently fried spearing and the appetizer of velvety marinated herring with raisins and cauliflower. The evening's most memorable dish was a grilled lamb porterhouse, though, which says less about the lamb than about the kitchen's struggles landing its catch. When dinner is less than transfixing, you have time to notice how incoherent Barchetta's dining room is. Gone are the nightclub intimacy of Bette and the Riviera sparkle of Bistro La Promenade, the last two tenants. In their place is a mishmash of ideas: old nautical flags hanging beside new art from Chelsea galleries; Danish modern chairs mixed with tan simulated leather banquettes that would suit a Midtown coffee shop. On good nights, you're more likely to notice how thoughtful the service is. Setting the tone is the outstanding rosemary focaccia that shows up while you're still scanning the menu. Assistance with the wine list, about half Italian and priced to sell, is quick to arrive, too, and unusually perceptive. The general manager and wine director, George Hock, always seemed to know what my table wanted, translating a few vague adjectives and a not-so-vague price limit into a bottle that was just what we were looking for and then some. At a fairly casual restaurant like Barchetta, wine service of this caliber is a gift. The total check, of course, is no gift, but it is very fair for fish at a place that never stoops to flabby farmed salmon. Barchetta could still turn out to be the seafood restaurant that downtown needs. If a nautical flag were flying over Barchetta's door on West 23rd Street, it would be the one that means \"Proceed, but exercise caution.\" ", "rec_dishes": ["Crudi", "charred octopus", "grilled and roasted fish", "lamb porterhouse", "fingerling potatoes with garlic", "fruit crostata."]}, {"id": 91, "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/dining/restaurant-review-bar-primi-in-the-east-village.html", "review_text": " Main courses are never as good as the starters, people like to say. I've always argued that a good chef won't let that happen, but I have to admit that it does seem true for a lot of Italian restaurants, at least in New York City. There are exceptions, of course, but as a general rule, it's all downhill after the spaghetti. One of several reasons to like Bar Primi , Andrew Carmellini 's new restaurant at East Second Street and the Bowery, is that there is almost nothing on the menu but appetizers and pasta. You can eat all the things you go to Italian places for without ordering a $35 grilled salmon simply to prove that you know fusilli is not considered a main course in Milan. Mr. Carmellini and his partners (Josh Pickard, Luke Ostrom and Sal Lamboglia) have not exactly discovered life on Mars with this concept. After all, this is the founding principle of cheap Italian restaurants across the country. It's unusual, though, to see it endorsed by a chef who knows better. Pasta is the whole point of Porsena , which the chef Sara Jenkins calls her \"pasta-centric restaurant,\" as you know if you've had the firm, chewy rings of anneloni tossed with fiery lamb sausage and bitter greens. But then her menu proceeds to a full roster of secondi. To be fair, Mr. Lamboglia, a longtime Carmellini cook who leads the kitchen at Bar Primi, does offer one main course a night on a weekly rotation. (On Wednesday, it's the Italian sausage served at Mr. Carmellini's Sausage Boss kiosks in Madison Square Garden .) Each time I was there, the servers also pushed a special, a grilled branzino \"muffaletta,\" which they said meant the fish comes with chopped green olives, like the sandwich. I ordered it once. It was fine. I preferred the pasta. The menu divides them into \"traditional\" and \"seasonal.\" We would be here for hours if I tried to figure out what is seasonal about orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe, a widely known classic from Southern Italy, or which tradition gave us spaghetti with a sauce inspired by clams casino. The important thing to notice is that there are 12 choices in all, and one of them is almost certain to be exactly what you feel like eating. For me, on almost any given night, that would be the linguine with golden bread crumbs and garlic that's been slapped around in hot olive oil for a minute or so. It may be because the kitchen is using this season's garlic, but the sliced cloves (four of them, the menu says) tasted as juicy and fresh as corn and, in their oniony way, almost as sweet. For this, I paid $14 and counted myself lucky. Spaghetti pomodoro, also $14, is just as uncomplicated and just as right, with green basil clinging to plum tomatoes cooked to the halfway point between fruit and sauce. Mr. Lamboglia makes those dishes with dried imported noodles. Most of the other pasta is fresh and very good. Its finest use may be the fiore di carciofi, a long, fat spiral filled with creamy artichoke and mascarpone. The sauce (a hot ladleful of fried bacon, garlic, chopped parsley and white wine) works mysteriously well with this mutant, vaguely flower-shaped cannelloni. Bar Primi applies its sauces more liberally than a place in Parma might. Italian verisimilitude is not the goal. Mr. Carmellini and Mr. Lamboglia, who was raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, by a father who cooked for years in restaurants on and off Mulberry Street, have given the menu a red-sauce generosity, even when the sauces aren't red. Sal's Antipasti Salad is basically an antipasto sampler of the kind usually seen on a checkered tablecloth -- sliced salami and provolone, raw celery and radishes -- thrown into a tossed salad with a small blizzard of Parmigiano-Reggiano. It's impossible to dislike. Shrimp and octopus with boiled potatoes and pickled cherry peppers make a cold seafood salad that few checkered-tablecloth joints could rival. There are even meatballs filled with melted fontina in a rough tomato sauce. You want them to taste handmade, honest and delicious. They do. Grilled broccolini dressed with stewed onions and Aleppo pepper sits on a shiny, smooth brick-colored emulsion. It looks creamy and soothing. It is fierce, fiery and garlic-drenched, a fantastic trick played by the kitchen. The menu has minor dips but no major sinkholes. That disassembled clams casino over spaghetti could do with more clams and less cleverness. The day I had orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe, the divots of dough weren't as shiny with pork fat and olive oil as they might have been. The idea for Bar Primi came to Mr. Carmellini years ago, before he left A Voce and built his fief of a half-dozen restaurants in New York and one in Miami. The chance to do it finally came along when Peels quietly shuffled out of business this year. Taavo Somer, an owner of that restaurant, was hired to rework his Peels design, mixing domestic idioms like white paneling and mullioned windows at tree-branch height with rustic Italian motifs, like wine shelves of unfinished wood. The result is an inviting, civilized spot, one that reaches back over the Bowery's skid-row period to the brief age when the East Village was on Edith Wharton's map of New York society. Within Mr. Carmellini's fleet, Bar Primi is more a neighborhood hangout in the spirit of the Dutch than a big, booming circus like Locanda Verde or Lafayette . Like all of those places, and unlike the stereotypical linguine slinger, Bar Primi has a deeply affordable wine list you could happily get lost in. Off topic for a linguine slinger but very much on topic for a hangout, there is at all hours a great hot roast beef sandwich, shaved thin and kicked into action with spicy red pepper sauce. So sure of itself it is known simply as the Sandwich, it deserves to join the venerable epitomes of the genre found at Brennan & Carr and Roll-n-Roaster in Brooklyn. New Yorkers who have watched Mr. Carmellini's game throughout his career may complain that he now rarely drives to the basket for the spectacular dunks he used to throw down when he was coached by Daniel Boulud. I made that complaint myself about the unimaginative, stubbornly un-French cooking at Lafayette when it opened. But a well-timed layup like Bar Primi can win games, too.

Nothing on his gracefully composed plates was chewier or crunchier or softer or saltier than it wanted to be. Mr. Glocker's kitchen chops were not exactly a surprise, given that he worked in Vienna for Heinz Reitbauer, in Chicago for Charlie Trotter and in London and New York for Gordon Ramsay , none of them ever known to have smiled indulgently at a young cook and said: \"Don't worry about burning those onions, kid. The customers won't notice.\" Technical prowess is a fine thing for a chef to have, but it's no guarantee of memorable, expressive cooking, just as a big vocabulary doesn't necessarily mean an author will write books worth reading. In both cases, you need to have something to say. Mr. Glocker has many things to say, and he says them clearly and with charm, as I learned over three excellent meals since B\u00e2tard opened in May. Some dishes were so successful they seemed destined never to leave the menu. One was the springtime-sweet bowl of minted pea soup with fried sweetbreads that seemed more flavorful than anybody else's sweetbreads. Another was a kind of bouillabaisse in which rabbit (a roasted loin, a perfectly cooked kidney and saffron ravioli with a light and delicately herbed rabbit filling) splashed around in the tomato-fennel-saffron broth. A month later, both dishes had been retired, and in their place was something new and just as wonderful. A fried zucchini flower, filled with bits of poached prawns and served with lightly candied lemon zest and whole pieces of poached lobster, was a full immersion in summer, a swim in a clear pond in the pines. A slab of octopus terrine, small circles of leg pressed together with smoky pastrami spices and dabbed with whole-grain mustard, evoked an entirely different terrain, nodding to the delicatessen, though the nuggets of braised ham hock, as rich and seductive as tuna belly, won't be found at Katz's. The complexity of Mr. Glocker's plates never blurs the focus of his flavors. Every drop of sauce and pinch of seasoning extracts some new pleasure out of the main ingredient. There is joy in his cooking. There are high spirits in B\u00e2tard's dining room, too, which hums and at times roars with the sound of people having a fine night on the town. This was not frequently heard during this restaurant's last incarnation , Corton . Everyone whispered as if a baby were sleeping in the next room. Even Drew Nieporent, the avuncular saloonkeeper who has held the lease on this address since he opened it as Montrachet in 1985, seemed to tread across Corton's carpet on tiptoes. The carpet is gone. Mr. Nieporent and his partners in B\u00e2tard, Mr. Glocker and John Winterman, last seen as ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel at Daniel , had it replaced with herringbone floorboards. The white tablecloths have been whisked away, too. The architect Glen Coben gently raised the temperature on the interior that Stephanie Goto designed for Corton, which was elegant but aloof, more like a modern-art gallery than a restaurant. The walls that lean in and their twirling vines in bas-relief are flush with a tobacco-resin hue borrowed from Keith McNally's crayon box. Banquettes that had been covered with scallion-green fabric are now dark leather and mohair. If the bare tables and floors weren't enough to raise the decibel level, the amount of drinking going on would. Mr. Glocker's cooking plays well with others, and his flexible \u00e0 la carte menu, with a choice of two courses ($55), three ($65) or four ($75), encourages you to get to know a bottle or two. For some drinkers, it will be impossible not to order Burgundy at a restaurant called B\u00e2tard, and Jason Jacobeit, the head sommelier, is happy to oblige. Swimming alongside the white whales, the La T\u00e2che and Roman\u00e9e-Conti grand crus, are some lesser-known Burgundies at what are, by the region's standards at least, reasonable prices. (The list, however, needs more bottles under $60, no matter where they come from.) Nonconformists will find blue-chip Napa Valley wines and a deep pocket of whites from Alsace, Germany and Austria, where Mr. Glocker was born. B\u00e2tard is hardly a cruise down the beautiful blue Danube, but the kitchen can give you an excellent Viennese dinner in the form of the Poussin schnitzel, a special in perpetuity, and the Sacher torte, a special on occasion. Both are classical, the chef's fingerprints visible only in details like the mouthwatering sea buckthorn jam and unaccountably exciting potato salad with the schnitzel. When B\u00e2tard begins serving food at the bar, I suspect that every stool will be taken by a schnitzel-eater. Full of ideas, Mr. Glocker comes up with the desserts, too. His caramelized milk bread with berries and brown-butter ice cream is already a certified hit, the song of the summer that radio failed to provide this year. A slice of white bread, rich like brioche, has been glazed on both sides with a shatteringly thin shell of melted sugar. It looks like the simplest thing in the world, but if it's so simple, why isn't everyone making it? Other desserts are good, but not so good that the restaurant can do without a full-time pastry chef forever. The flat-footed key lime pie should be repaired or replaced, and the poached fruit in a moat of sparkling wine was a little too Ladies Who Lunch for me. Mr. Winterman, the general manager, has put together a lovely little cheese cart, although he hasn't figured out how to show it off. \"We have several goat cheeses,\" my server said one night. \"Some cheese from France, of course. Some cheese from Vermont.\" Finding this picture a little vague, I asked to see them. This seemed to catch him off guard. \"I could bring the cart over,\" he said, \"but it would be a little tight with these tables.\" The cheeses are much too good to be stranded on a landlocked cart. For now, you have to rely on Mr. Winterman to choose, and hope you've come on a night when he has the honey made by downtown bees who do their buzzing above a Shoegasm store. There is another dance routine that needs practice. Maybe somebody imagined it would be fun for customers who get the vast, pink, terrific lamb chop to serve themselves lamb confit out of flame-colored Le Creuset pots. It's an awkward fishing party. The confit is some kind of new achievement in flavor and tenderness, but to get it out of the pot, you have to lift your butt off the seat. A few cards have yet to fall into place, but Mr. Glocker and Mr. Winterman are reshuffling the deck to get a fresh combination of refined and relaxed dining, a game Mr. Nieporent has played for years. One night, Mr. Winterman showed me a cross-section of a tree trunk. (Neither he nor Mr. Nieporent pretended not to recognize me.) He thinks it would be fun to drag it out to the dining room and let customers test their skill at Hammerschlagen, a game Germans play with a hammer and nails. If the baby isn't awake yet, that should do the trick.

I am. An old farm recipe, green tomato pie was new to me when I ate a small wedge of it at a very likable Brooklyn restaurant called Delaware and Hudson two weeks ago. Now I can't stop thinking about it. Double-crusted like an apple pie, bobbing between sweet and savory, it had the herbaceousness and tang of unripe tomatoes and the very old-timey flavor of molasses and brown sugar. The ingredients combined in ways that had me tasting spices that weren't, in fact, in there. Patti Jackson, the restaurant's chef and owner, called the recipe \"an agglomeration of Pennsylvania Dutch and Shaker pies, stuff that's always interested me.\" At this point, it's hard to find a New York chef who doesn't cook with ingredients from the mid-Atlantic, but ones who draw on the region's recipes are much more unusual. Delaware and Hudson, which opened in May, looks the part of the contemporary Brooklyn restaurant that preaches all things local and seasonal. The tables are bare wood. The ceiling rafters are exposed. Pickle jars sit above the kitchen door. The walls are pinned with glamour shots of farmers' market bins piled with strawberries and purple-tipped asparagus. The restaurant stands out from the pack, though, in part because Ms. Jackson draws on the traditions of long-gone Americans who would have been amazed to hear that farm-to-table would become a slogan one day. Old-time regional recipes (\"from Baltimore to Buffalo,\" says a sign by the door) flit on and off her weekly menus. They don't define the restaurant's cooking, though. Ms. Jackson does. Her four-course $48 set menus are drawn from her life, and their personal point of view helps make Delaware and Hudson so winning. She grew up in Clarks Summit, Pa., close enough to Pennsylvania Dutch country to know how a fresh pretzel ought to taste. You'll know, too, because the first thing to land on the table after you choose your main course is a galvanized pail of hot pretzel rolls, boiled in lye and studded with white salt crystals, like Amish rhinestones. The chewy, yeasty pretzels were wonderful smeared with ramp butter or a green mash of fava hummus that came out alongside breakfast radishes and crisp, cool slices of fennel. Putting herself through culinary school in Baltimore, Ms. Jackson cooked at the Harvey House restaurant for Rose Baumel, known to all as Miss Rose. \"Miss Rose was in the kitchen every single day in a housekeeper's dress,\" she recalled. \"She did all the money and all the liquor, and when it was time to do the crab cakes, all the guys in the kitchen would prepare separate parts of it for her and she would go off in a corner and secretly mix it all together.\" Ms. Baumel's precise formula probably disappeared along with the restaurant's sign, a rabbit in purple neon, but the young cooking student watched closely enough to have her own ideas. Delaware and Hudson served Miss Rose's crab cakes in June on top of hollandaise with purslane leaves. They were precisely the golden pan-fried patties of clean white crab meat, just barely holding together, that I see whenever I look at a blue crab. Pretzel rolls followed by three other small dishes, like the crab cakes or a hungry farmhand's salad of string beans and creamy new potatoes in vinegar and warm bacon fat, are the appetizer course. Next comes handmade pasta, and dinner suddenly veers toward Italy. This is inconsistent with the stated theme of the restaurant, but consistent with the life of Ms. Jackson. She was the chef at a string of Italian restaurants in Manhattan -- Le Madri , I Trulli and Centovini -- and she knows her way around a pasta roller. In June, sweet pea ravioli had delicate thin-skinned wrappers, perfectly formed little flying saucers in a butter sauce with slivers of Virginia ham. Her fresh spaghetti in a quick sauce of ripe tomatoes and basil dotted with milky ricotta got the dish, which often goes wrong, exactly right. Ms. Jackson's food doesn't have the buzz-cut professionalism of some restaurant food, which seems to have been produced by Adderall-chewing line cooks who practice their brunoise in front of a mirror while listening to \"Eye of the Tiger.\" Her cooking has a more relaxed, informal air. This is its charm and sometimes its weakness, too. Earthy and delicious noodles made from einkorn wheat and fresh herbs were clumped together one night, as if the noodles had not been sauced soon enough. A vegetarian main course called corn mush was as dense and bland as a bowl of hot cereal you made at breakfast and forgot about until lunch. Corn pudding was a nicer variation on this idea, sweet kernels of corn baked into a soft, custardy dome of cornmeal. But the ratatouille served with it wasn't the usual soft, sweet melting pot of summer; the vegetables were still half-crisp and noticeably bitter. These slumps may soften my recommendation, but they weren't enough to knock any of my meals seriously off-track. Any bad impressions were wiped out by a half-dozen good ones, by a duck breast with rhubarb or a hunk of wild striped bass with yellow cherry tomatoes cooked just until they wilted. Servers were stiff in the beginning, marching around with one hand awkwardly ratcheted up behind their backs as if their wrists were attached to bungee cords, but they are more at ease now, giving the restaurant a friendliness that can make you think you have traveled much farther than 10 steps from Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg. Then, a pair of desserts, small and homey, like a warm button of steamed chocolate cake next to a miniature peach shortcake. Why two desserts? Why four appetizers? I think it's the generosity implied by the out-of-print cookbooks Ms. Jackson reads, by the spirit of places like the Harvey House, by the old way of cooking to fill people up and make them happy at the same time. Finally, a plate of four mignardises arrives. There may be a chocolate-caramel candy and a one-bite macaron infused with the taste of ripe Tristar strawberries. The plate is always delivered by Ms. Jackson with the smile good cooks have when they know everyone will leave the table happy.

But if domestic intimacy is rare at Giada, the restaurant that the Food Network star Giada De Laurentiis opened in June inside the Cromwell Las Vegas hotel, there is little doubt whose place it is. Ms. De Laurentiis is invoked so often that it can seem she wants you to feel as if you're in her museum. The board of flatbread and grissini is announced as \"Giada's bread selection,\" and the plate of thumbprint and \"mega-chip\" cookies is \"Giada's cookie selection.\" \"Giada\" is stenciled on a large pink canvas that hangs on a wall. Her words, familiar to her television audience, are even repeated in six chandeliers around the dining room, cut out in silhouette so that light beams from behind: \"I eat a little bit of Everything and not a lot of Anything.\" As a quotation for posterity, this is not exactly \"Et tu, Brute?\" But it may describe Ms. De Laurentiis's philosophy for the food at Giada. All of it is in a relaxed, approachable California-Italian mode, and none of it is very hard to leave on the plate. A medium-size twirl of flaccid bucatini in bland fresh tomato sauce ($24) made the case against the common view that simple food is the best. The margherita pizzette ($10), soft as a Parker House roll and covered with mozzarella that had the pale-yellow color and elusive flavor of processed cheese, might have come from the children's menu of any restaurant in America except an Italian one. Sold as \"Giada's signature dish,\" the chicken cacciatore for two ($55) was a puzzle whose pieces didn't fit. First, a server brought out a pan with a trussed and roasted chicken, colorful peppers, cipollini onions and mushrooms. This was taken away. What was served sometime later was a stack of browned, dry chicken pieces that seemed to have no relationship to the original bird, along with a dish of tomato sauce made from some vegetables, but not (as far as I could tell) the ones I had seen earlier. Something was missing here -- maybe the commercial that on television would have run between the first chicken and the second. In May, two weeks before Giada was scheduled to serve its first meal, Ms. De Laurentiis fired her executive chef. She has been looking for a permanent replacement ever since, but the restaurant stays open. The ideal candidate should have experience with pizza and pasta.

Mio Ogasawara, the chef and a native of Japan, set a drum of coconut panna cotta in a wineglass, and surrounded it with buttons of mango mousse, balls of cantaloupe sorbet and bananas she had caramelized with a blowtorch. She covered the glass with something that looked like a coaster. Then, raising a pitcher that stood on little feet with red toenails, she poured hot mango syrup over the top. The sauce pooled and spread and was about to cascade over the edge when the coaster, made from white chocolate, melted away and dropped into the glass. At that point, I couldn't remember all the ingredients in this sweet tropical magic trick, but it was too late to check the menu. I had dipped it in raspberry sauce and eaten it. Of all the surprises that made my meal at Sweets Raku so entertaining, perhaps the most interesting was its location: a shopping plaza about two miles from the Las Vegas Strip, in the sprawling and still-growing Chinatown area. It is one of many excellent, intimate restaurants that have sprung up in the last two or three years far from the leviathan casinos where celebrated chefs have made the city a global dining destination. In a recent week spent restaurant hopping around this city, I was drawn back by remarkable meals in Chinatown again and again. I was well fed downtown, too, where little independent restaurants and cloistered cocktail lounges are helping that historic area climb back from years of decay. Every day, I would leave my hotel in the City Center complex for some other part of town, eat a couple of lunches followed by a dinner or two, then return to my hotel bed. I believe this makes me the first person in history who went to the Las Vegas Strip to sleep. When I did hike along the mountain range of glass towers, pyramids, Roman arcades and Manhattan skyscrapers on Las Vegas Boulevard, I kept seeing famous chefs used as advertisements for no-holds-barred indulgence. Giant photographs of Daniel Boulud and Thomas Keller hang from the Doge's Palace at the Venetian . At the Paris , a huge scrim superimposes the Arc de Triomphe with the scowling face and crossed arms of Gordon Ramsay. Seeing Europe's great monuments repurposed as billboards was almost enough to make me wonder why we fought World War II. For a taste of food that wasn't advertising anything other than itself, I veered off the Strip. The distinctive, original new restaurants there tended not to be ones imported from far away but ones grown here in the desert. They were built by and feed the year-round residents whose numbers have been climbing at a healthy clip since the housing-market crisis. The population of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, grew by nearly 4 percent from 2010 to 2013, and now stands at more than two million, according to the latest Census Bureau estimates. Many of those new arrivals come from Mexico, as evidenced by the tiny taquerias sprouting up around the city, and from a host of Asian countries. To get to Sweets Raku, I had driven past block after block of strip-mall restaurants: Hong Kong-style seafood houses, Filipino family restaurants, Korean barbecue grills and Vietnamese sandwich shops. Then there were the Japanese places: izakayas, sake bars, ramenyas, curry and tonkatsu specialists. Sweets Raku occupies a space on Spring Mountain Road, Chinatown's main drag, in a mall called Seoul Plaza. The name is as imprecise as Chinatown's. Seoul Plaza has become a one-stop-shopping destination for excellent Japanese food since 2008, when the chef Mitsuo Endo, who also owns Sweets Raku, opened Aburiya Raku, an exquisite yakitori grill. Aburiya Raku has won a measure of national recognition, but I knew it deserved even more with my first bite of Mr. Endo's oyaji tofu, as rich and fluffy as ricotta, served with a sauce of dried chiles and fried garlic so good I ate it with a spoon. Everything that passed over Mr. Endo's glazing-hot charcoal was seasoned and cooked with spooky precision, from flaky white yellowtail belly to the tender kurobuta pork cheek that made me think all the pork-belly worshipers are eating the wrong end of the pig. In 2012, a friend of Mr. Endo's opened Kabuto , a traditional Edo-style sushi bar across the plaza. This spring, he handed the chef's position over to Ken Hosoki, who was carving delicate sheets of rarely seen species like hairtail when I arrived while another chef rubbed a wasabi root on sharkskin. I wasn't thrilled with the overcooked omelet or the menu format, which forced me to take some lackluster grilled items I didn't want to get the sashimi that I did. But the sashimi turned out to be exceptional, skillfully chosen to bring out contrasts in texture and fat, and the nigiri was very good as well. My grudge against the menu softened with the last course, a sorbet made from the citrus called sudachi by Sweets Raku. For years, the one restaurant that justified a taxi ride away from the Strip for many visitors was Lotus of Siam , specializing in northern Thai cuisine. Two years ago, a manager and sommelier from Lotus of Siam named Bank Atcharawan struck out on his own to open Chada Thai & Wine . He placed it in another Chinatown plaza that he shares with one of the few North American restaurants serving the lamb-centric cuisine of China's Shaanxi Province. Chada's menu is shorter than Lotus's, the portions more dainty, but the cooking struck me as more exact and polished after one meal at each. The flavors at Chada tilt toward southern Thailand, as in the stunningly fine coconut-based crab curry served with nests of rice vermicelli. Quail eggs fried into little bull's-eyes were topped with dried shrimp and set in a superbly focused lime-chile dressing. A tamarind-chile dipping sauce that hit every flavor on the grid at once was sensational with chewy oddments of pork called lo-ba in Phuket. Has anyone in Phuket ever chased pigs' ears with Eric Bordelet's sparkling pear cider from Normandy? Mr. Atcharawan has priced the wine list to encourage experiments like that, with many bottles around $40. Like Raku, Chada stays open until 3 a.m., the better to ensnare cooks and servers on their way home from the Strip. Workers in the celebrity-chef restaurants, whether they stay for a year or decide to settle down, help many off-Strip restaurants stay in business. Sometimes they do more than that. In June, the chef Kerry Simon opened Carson Kitchen in the John E. Carson Hotel, a former flophouse downtown. Mr. Simon runs restaurants in casinos on and off the Strip, but Carson Kitchen has a personal point of view that's hard to find in dining rooms located within sight of the slot machines. On a chef's counter facing the kitchen, a glass urn labeled \"Swear Jar\" is quickly filling up with dollar bills. It's hard to imagine a swear jar on the Strip, where nothing is supposed to get in the way of the implicit message that everything is permitted. Mr. Simon, who recently learned that he has a severe form of Parkinson's disease, installed Matt Andrews as executive chef. The menu of small plates is antic and border-crossing in a way that could be awful or great. It turns out to be mostly great. A vertical caprese salad deserved sweeter tomatoes, but the gyro tacos were fantastic, with grilled pita instead of a tortilla, holding spiced lamb that spills juice as you eat it. Veal meatballs in a rich, camel-colored sauce of foie gras and sherry played the high-low comfort food game as well as any dish I've come across. The John E. Carson Hotel might have joined the vast graveyard of boarded-up hotels on and around Fremont Street if not for the Downtown Project. A $350 million effort to bring back the city's original core without demolishing it -- Las Vegas's usual solution to aging buildings -- the Downtown Project bought the hotel in 2012 and rents commercial space for $2 a square foot. One block from the resurrected hotel is Eat, another child of the Downtown Project. If I were staying nearby, I'd start every day with Eat's biscuits in strawberry sauce, an ingenious way to turn breakfast into dessert, and come back at lunch for corned beef hash, the real article, chopped by hand, a treat any time you can find it. And I would escape the afternoon sun on Fremont Street for a bottle of Beerlao Dark at Le Thai, a tiny room outfitted like a Bangkok pub. Le Thai, open since 2011, won't expand anyone's notions of Thailand's cuisine the way Chada or Lotus of Siam can, but among more routine stuff, I came across two finds worth seeking out: the deep-fried chunks of pork jerky, to be picked up with a wad of sticky rice and swabbed in spicy nam prik, and the woozily rich fried rice with bits of sweet and full-flavored short rib. More out-of-towners have been finding their way downtown lately, and places like Carson Kitchen should help. Far fewer make it to Summerlin, in the city's west end, an area rich in chain restaurants. That's why I was interested in Honey Salt . It opened there two years ago, owned by Kim Canteenwalla, a chef who has worked on and off the Strip, and his wife, Elizabeth Blau, a consultant who helped lure Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Michael Mina and many other chefs to the Strip. She and Mr. Canteenwalla were key figures in making Las Vegas a stop on the food-tourism route, and I wanted to see how they were treating the locals. Very well, it turned out. Honey Salt doesn't have pirate ship battles or indoor roller coasters. It's just a restaurant, with paintings by Ms. Blau's sister and cooking that's seasonal, up-to-date and refreshingly free of drama, like the summer salad of greens with honey-roasted peaches and the appetizer of fried squid and tender soft-shell clams with shishito peppers. If you're lucky, you have a place like this in your neighborhood. Honey Salt doesn't try to compete with the casino restaurants, but as a downstream effect of the Strip's high-end scene, it's an emblem of where the rest of Las Vegas is moving these days.

The camera will pan majestically across \"The Art of the Slurp,\" Nathan Fox's manga-style strip that hangs over the counter and starts with a fat boy in a Batman mask snapping his chopsticks apart, as a narrator intones: \"In 2014, Ivan Orkin, a Long Island native who grew famous cooking ramen in Tokyo, opened his flagship restaurant on the Lower East Side.\" The plucking of a samisen fades out; punk guitar chords clang; the screen is filled with a close-up of a noodle bowl. \"Developed in Japan around the turn of the 21st century, mazemen is a drier variation on ramen, more like pasta than soup. Mr. Orkin dressed fresh whole-wheat noodles with a slab of simmered pork belly, chopped bacon and enough pork-bone stock to moisten the noodles. Then came the garlic: raw, pickled and roasted.\" Cut to a heavyset, white-haired, unshaven, downtrodden man in pajamas, identified as a former restaurant critic for The New York Times. \"Actually, there was a fourth pork and a fourth garlic in there,\" he says. \"Garlic oil and pork fat. Maybe Orkin thought \u2018quadruple pork' sounded too much like \u2018quadruple bypass.' Those ingredients could have gotten into a shouting match, but they were harmonious. It was like a summation of all the lard-wallowing and umami-slinging that had rippled through American food since the first drop of grease ran down the chin of the first customer who tried a Momofuku pork bun. I could eat a bowl of that mazemen right now, if they would let me have anything besides kale pellets.\" Get that old guy off the screen. He's bringing me down, though he's right about the triple pork triple garlic mazemen. It's an undeniably intense dish that shows how energetically and skillfully Mr. Orkin colors outside the lines of Japanese cuisine. Since Ivan Ramen opened in May, there is usually a line for the single restroom but rarely one to get in the door. Some of the pent-up steam in the ramen community may have escaped late last year, when Mr. Orkin opened Slurp Shop, in Gotham West Market. A quick-service counter with a noodle-dominated menu, Slurp Shop is a fine introduction to Mr. Orkin's ramen philosophy (essentially, make everything -- noodles, broth, droplets of fat on the surface of the soup -- better), but not to his full breadth as a chef. For that, you need to go to Ivan Ramen, where he invests in creativity well outside the scope of standard ramenyas. Mr. Orkin supplements the noodles with dishes that cover many bases, though not the sweet one just yet. Desserts are promised down the line. As suggested by a dining-room collage made of hundreds of pictures of Asian and Western pop icons and foodstuffs, Mr. Orkin's cultural allusions are quick and funny, and come from several directions at once. He makes a whacked-out vegetarian chili dog with fried tofu in place of the frank, a rich and intense stew of mushrooms and miso as the chili, and a squiggly line of American yellow mustard. (There's no substitute for yellow mustard.) Called a Tofu Coney Island, it's a joke that tastes great. That was true for the JFC, too: deep-fried chicken hearts and livers with a honey-mustard sauce that tasted similar enough to the traditional McNugget garnish to make me laugh, and different enough (sharper, stronger and enriched with ponzu) to make me want more. The Japanese borrowed ramen from China, and Mr. Orkin keeps up the custom. There is steamed Chinese broccoli with soy-pickled garlic, as well as a salad of crunchy daikon threads topped with spicy, funky XO sauce. On tables that could become laden with pork very quickly, each was a cool, welcome oasis. The pork tended to disappear as quickly as it arrived. True, the scrapple waffle, a takeoff on Japanese okonomiyaki, hadn't moved beyond the gimmick stage; it was all crisp, bland surface without the peculiar bits of fat and face that excite scrapple fans and terrify everybody else. But the improbably fluffy tofu-pork meatballs catapulted themselves into my mouth at the slightest encouragement, and little do-it-yourself handrolls of nori spread with sushi rice and pulled roast pork, as slick and rich as carnitas, were gone almost before I noticed the bright, sweet-sour relief they got from roasted tomatoes. As our server promised, roasted tomato performed the same favor for a cheese mazemen, a kind of Japanese alfredo. Servers at Ivan Ramen are always pushing add-on garnishes for the noodles for an extra $2 or $3. \"All our ramens are improved by an egg,\" we were told one night. If Mr. Orkin thinks his ramen is better with an egg, he should put an egg on it, and charge accordingly. Value is a sticky issue with ramen. Because it is served in a minute and eaten almost as quickly, it seems to call for fast-food prices. It takes more than a minute to prepare, though, particularly at Ivan Ramen, where the noodles are made in the kitchen from rye or whole-wheat flour. Springy and hearty, they are exceptional. The broths are painstakingly simmered until their flavors are deep and focused, particularly in the vegetarian ramen's soy-mushroom stock and the shio ramen's base of dashi stirred into a golden chicken soup that a grandmother might want to steal credit for. The most expensive ramen is $15, or $17 with the suggested egg. The mazemens, a form Mr. Orkin has mastered more fully than anyone in the city, justify the price. (The red-hot cold mazemen, dressed with salty, spicy sesame and accessorized with two prawns, should settle any doubts.) The soup ramens do not, at least not yet. Several times, the broth arrived well below the scalding heat that gives ramen its temporal dimension, as you race to eat the noodles before they go from slightly undercooked to al dente to overdone. The soups at Ivan Ramen barely changed, so there was no rush, no need to illustrate the art of the slurp. Maybe mine sat too long in the kitchen. The ramens shouldn't stop just short of the finish line when so many other items on the menu sail right over it.

To which I'd say: What's wrong with that? The cafe, which opened in May, is modeled on the store, to an almost obsessive degree. Backlit signs in black and white proclaim the presence of sardines, chubs, rugelach and pickles by the barrel. Below the signs are boxes of matzo and jars of chocolate-covered jelly rings. In the center of the restaurant sides of salmon and whole, golden-skinned whitefish with their slit bellies pointing up wait in a refrigerated case until they are sliced to order by a counter worker in a white jacket, just as on Houston Street. But Niki Russ Federman and her cousin Josh Russ Tupper, the fourth-generation owners of the family business , have added to, elaborated on and deviated from the store in ways that make the cafe a three-dimensional restaurant, not just a theme-park homage designed to cash in on the original's popularity. Take, for example, the rye bread. Everybody talks about good Jewish rye but hardly anyone has tasted it. To get a rye that deserved to share the table with their smoked fish, the owners imported a baker from Massachusetts known for his artisan loaves, Gordon Weissman. His rye is dense and rugged, with a crisp, ragged crust, a sourdough depth and a generous strafing of seeds, not just caraway but also onion-scented nigella. Called shissel, the bread is as different from most ryes as bourbon is from light beer. Or take the way that items the store is known for have been worked into the menu. Halvah is sold by the block, but shouldn't be eaten that way. It should be eaten this way: broken into chewy bits and scattered over rich sesame ice cream along with salted caramel sauce and a spackling of sesame seeds. Or take the new line of dishes from the Eastern European Jewish canon that are not sold at the store, like the baby knishes stuffed with potatoes and caramelized onions. Over the years the New York knish has become so dense it could be used as an anchor for a small boat. These little specimens are light and fluffy, and they taste not like flour and grease but like baked potatoes. Or take the bar, situated by the front door on Orchard Street. How does a 100-year-old temple to sturgeon get into the cocktail trade? With a reimagined old-time soda fountain of the kind that would have blasted jets of seltzer into egg creams when Joel Russ, newly arrived from Galicia, in what is now Poland, was selling herring from the barrel on the Lower East Side. The white-jacketed bartender makes fresh cucumber soda, cherry shrubs, egg creams and excellent Bloody Marys. He looks as if he belongs there, and the drinks, with Eastern European flavors like caraway, taste as if they belong, for the most part, although my egg cream was not as volcanically fizzy as it might have been. There is a small but well-considered wine list, too. The sparkling wines, especially the less expensive ones from outside Champagne, might have been made to go with smoked-fish platters like the Anne, which collects some of the store's most luxurious treats on a briefcase-size board: its famous sable and Western nova smoked salmon, its underrated brook trout, its extraordinarily fine wild salmon roe and its \"private stock\" sturgeon. I asked our waiter what made it private stock. \"They get a lot of high rollers at the store, some very particular customers,\" he said. \"This one lady came in and asked for sturgeon, but when they started to slice it, she said: \u2018No, no, no. I don't want your regular sturgeon. I want your private stock.' \" This private stock of sturgeon did not, as of yet, exist, but the slicer obligingly found her an unusually sleek specimen. From then on, the fattiest fish would be kept under the counter for customers who would not settle for the regular sturgeon. (As with many stories about Russ & Daughters, the waiter's account has the ring of folk legend. When I asked Jen Snow, who has the title of Yenta at the company, whether it was historically accurate, her response was long and began with \"Oy vey.\") At the restaurant, private-stock sturgeon is advertised but is still a high-roller item; the Anne platter goes for $90. The Anne feeds three or four people. And it does come with a basket of the excellent rye and other breads; a very good, crisp salad of thin-sliced potatoes with mustard; the house cream cheese, which sets the standard for the rest of the city; and all the usual fixings. Still, $90 is not bupkis, and it is not the only disconcerting price at Russ & Daughters Cafe. Forget the caviar service, which starts at $105 for 50 grams of paddlefish and inclines swiftly from there. At the store, long admired for competitive prices on tins of fish eggs, the same 50 grams cost about half as much. The markups are an unpleasant surprise, and guarantee that for most value-minded diners, the caviar section of the menu will be strictly a curiosity. At $60, the scrambled eggs with paddlefish caviar may seem like a more reasonable splurge. But when I had it, Mr. Weissman's challah, although toasted, was going stale and the eggs didn't have the voluptuousness achieved at, say, Jean-Georges . Some everyday items seem out of line, too, like $22 for four slices of sturgeon with butter, capers, tomatoes, onions and a serviceable bagel. For most people, fish on a bagel may not be enough reason to go to a restaurant at night. Russ & Daughters Cafe is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., with the same paper place-mat menu day and night. You could certainly make a light supper from one of the egg dishes, especially the creamy and soft scramble with onions and lox. (How did the Lower East Side get along without this?) But that is a meal best enjoyed alone with a book. The kitchen offers very little that will provide enough traction for a group of friends engaging in a round of cocktails followed by a bottle of wine. Unlike most New Yorkers, the menu looks best by daylight. Most helpings are modest, good for noshing. Salmon roe and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche with latkes, with hard-shell exteriors and fluffy white interiors, seem like breakfast. So does the sturdy bagel chip piled up with whitefish and salmon salads and flying-fish roe infused with wasabi. At lunch the excellent cold borscht could lead up to the herring sampler featuring rollmops, Swedish matjes and pickled herring, which has immediately joined the small list of dishes whose flavor helps define New York. The cafe might have a stronger nocturnal allure with a separate dinner menu or beefed-up portions of plates like the latkes. And it might look into slicing Mr. Weissman's breads closer to the dinner hour so they aren't as fatigued. I'm not expecting to see any big changes right away, though. This is, after all, a business that took a century to give its customers a place to sit down.

We could, for instance, use a few wine bars of the type that began sprouting around Paris about a decade ago. Like traditional bars \u00e0 vins, they have closely considered wine lists whose length and prices are geared for the curious drinker, but they championed winemaking's noninterventionist avant-garde before that was the thing to do. They also flicked the dust off the traditional menu of ready-to-go standbys like hams, cheeses, terrines and open-face sandwiches. Sure, there is excellent charcuterie, but there is some cooking, too, and it betrays care and originality. For the chefs of small restaurants like Septime and Frenchie that are full nearly every night, the wine bar next door has become the preferred way to expand. Racines , which the chef Pierre Jancou opened in 2007 under the glass roof of a 19th-century shopping arcade on the Boulevard Montmartre, was an early example of this breed and one of the most militant. It poured only wines made without sulfur, which even most purists admit can keep good bottles from going bad. Mr. Jancou was a believer, and he could be intolerant of those who didn't share the faith. If you thought one of his wines smelled like a running shoe filled with Gorgonzola, fine. You could go elsewhere and drink Bordeaux with the rest of the heathens. If not for the name, you would never guess that Racines NY, which appeared in TriBeCa this spring, is any relation. It's three times the size of the 20-seat original. The service is solicitous. The sommelier, Arnaud Tronche, genuinely appears to care whether people like what they're drinking. Sulfur, in minimal doses, is tolerated. This being New York, prices at the low end of the long, mostly French list aren't as low. And although wine will be the main event for many people, Racines NY is not a wine bar. It's a restaurant -- or \"neo-bistro,\" in the words of the owners: Mr. Tronche; David Lillie, a partner in Chambers Street Wines, down the street; and David Lanher, who bought the first Racines from Mr. Jancou in 2009. In other words, the menu is meant for dining, not snacking. Nor for sharing, either, although my attempt to keep my fork out of my wife's plateful of whole, warm Oregon morels on a pool of half-liquid burrata failed miserably. For the most part, the chef Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Duca's appetizers are opening moves, and very elegant ones. Mr. Duca served a length of barely seared wild salmon, the raw flesh inside the intense orange-red of a persimmon, with a scoop of cucumber sorbet and a schmear of warm cauliflower cream. These are two of the mildest vegetables in existence, so combining them would not seem like a formula for excitement, but it was like watching summer and winter meet for the first time. Raw veal with warm mayonnaise probably doesn't sound like a bell-ringer, either. But with pine nuts and tarragon folded into cubes of meat, it made a delicious tartare, unorthodox but unmistakably French. Mr. Duca, who grew up near Marseille, had begun to win recognition as the chef of L'Instant d'Or, in Paris, when Mr. Lanher talked him into moving to Chambers Street. Transplanted chefs often need time to find the right suppliers. But almost every ingredient I tasted at Racines NY was fresh and swimming with flavor. If you haven't fully wallowed in berry season yet, go and get the full, dark-red strawberries layered over basil panna cotta. It's currently the star dessert, outclassing a tart of chocolate and salt caramel that comes across as a knockoff (though as knockoffs go, it's very well made). And his main courses are events: the hanger steak over a smoky eggplant pur\u00e9e with blistered shishito peppers and a rustle of cumin somewhere in the background; the red snapper with octopus and fantastic mussels fried in herbed bread crumbs, one of the nicest treatments I've seen anyone give a mussel in a long time; the lamb cooked two ways, most impressively as a braised shank with a deep, almost gamy intensity that fought it out with a teasingly bitter salsa verde made from arugula. All of these dishes are brought to a pitch of refinement that is somewhat at odds with the wine-bar spirit. True, Racines NY doesn't claim to be a wine bar. Neither does its Parisian ancestor. But New Yorkers keep talking about it as if it were one, and it's easy to see why. A big, open bar dominates the dining room, which doesn't have the sense of occasion you expect from a restaurant or bistro. In fact, it's pretty generic. The walls are white or brick; the light fixtures are black and simple; the small vineyard photographs are black-and-white on white matte inside skinny black frames. Bottles, an easy and cheap decorative motif, are inexplicably absent from the shelves behind the bar's barren white surface, which could be mistaken for the cosmetics counter at Barneys . Not every French restaurant in New York needs to look like Bofinger , but does this one really have to look quite so much like a spread from the Restoration Hardware catalog ? Especially if you are spending $35 for the morels or $38 for the lamb, prices that approach those of the entry-level wines, you might hope for a room that you could picture when you close your eyes the next day. Some New Yorkers will keep Racines NY out of their regular rotation because it doesn't look French enough. This would be, to put it kindly, dumb. Dinner and drinks at Racines NY come as close as anything in Manhattan to the flavors of Paris today. The last night I ate there, the wine directors for Piora and the Momofuku group were in the house, cherry-picking the list. It doesn't take an expert to get a great glass at Racines NY. Stuttering a few disjointed syllables to Mr. Tronche, I ended up drinking a rich, almost tropical Sancerre from Sebastien Riffault, poured from a magnum; a dessert wine from Fran\u00e7ois Pinon, a Vouvray with acidity and sweetness so closely balanced I found it hard to believe; a Reagan-era verdelho, a mere toddler as Madeiras go, that is one of the best companions for a cheese course I've ever met. Mr. Tronche could probably even find a wine to get me excited about macarons.

Almost immediately, the universe began sending her a message: don't. The space had structural weaknesses, and propping it up would become a long, expensive project. Gas burners would not be an option. Nor would the grinding and stuffing of sausages in bulk; as it turned out, there wasn't enough room. Ms. Norris ran out of money, raised more, blew through that, scraped up a little extra, spent it on the best kitchen equipment she could afford, and announced that she would open soon. The universe, surmising that the message wasn't getting through, sent a flood. The night of Hurricane Sandy, water filled the streets of Red Hook and filled Grindhaus, too, wrecking all that kitchen equipment. By this point, the signs had to be clear. Evidently Ms. Norris didn't care, because she mucked the place out, banged in new, mold-free walls, began a Kickstarter campaign to fund repairs and fresh equipment, and hired Aaron Taber, a chef she had met at the dog run. The 20-seat restaurant she opened last December, without the sausage theme, is still called Grindhaus. This may be a sign of Ms. Norris's stubbornness, or it may show that she grasps a basic principle of business: When you have a restaurant name that suggests a lost Russ Meyer film set in a German wurst hall staffed by karate-kicking supervixens who are barely contained by their black-leather dirndls, you don't give it up because you can't serve sausages. Grindhaus is not entirely sausage-free. I did eat a few pinches of fresh merguez there once. It was terrific stuff, rich and spicy, folded inside fresh cappellacci. Around these pasta bundles, Mr. Taber had set a snake-curve of charred scallion, confidently seasoned chickpeas and yogurt for a sauce. There were also balls of chickpea cakes called panisses. Panisses may not seem to go with pasta, but these were good enough to go with any dish they wanted. In his short cooking career, Mr. Taber has worked at the Pines in Brooklyn and made dough for a mobile pizza oven. At Grindhaus, his first post as chef, he cooks alone in a kitchen almost exactly the dimensions of the restroom. He makes the kind of earnest, fashionably austere, handsomely arranged food that is signified on menus by sans-serif lists of ingredients, with no capital letters, verbs, articles or hint of how one thing may relate to the next. In some restaurants, they don't relate. At Grindhaus, they do. The first thing I ate there was written this way: rutabaga carrot, sorrel, grapefruit Was it a salad? A soup? A purgative juice blend? No. It was a delicious and ingeniously simple vegetable tart. A buttery pie shell was just big enough to contain a thick, soft wheel of rutabaga held in place by a layer of pur\u00e9ed carrots. The lemonlike bite of raw sorrel and the true citrus of grapefruit acted as welcome rays of sunlight breaking into this ode to the root cellar. Mr. Taber's style of cooking is often found in druidic, wood-filled restaurants with tasting menus, cupboards stacked with hand-thrown pottery and painfully earnest names derived from natural materials, like Resin. Grindhaus isn't as high-minded as those places. It has some rock 'n' roll in its trousers. A steel silhouette of a broken wine glass hangs in the front window, and the jagged shards attached to the stem look like the fingers of a hand raised in a heavy-metal salute. The framed sketches of the heads of Keith Moon and Brian Jones were drawn in high school by a friend of Ms. Norris's whose later work, under the name Cynthia Plaster Caster, would depict other regions of rock-star anatomy. On the bar is the stuffed head of a white horse, its gaping mouth now a vase for eucalyptus branches. Like most things in Grindhaus, the head has a story. It was made to Ms. Norris's specifications by a taxidermist who waited three years for a dead horse in the right color to come along. \"The throat was to open up so it could have a lot of ephemera and antique drug paraphernalia, prescriptions from the 19th century,\" Ms. Norris said. Even if you never figure out what's in the horse's throat, the head with its flowing mane still works its spell as part of Grindhaus's invitation to let it loose and come on down. It's not a rowdy place, but it is one where classic rock may play all night. It's a place where I felt quite at ease singing along to \"Volunteers\" while tearing off a fistful of sourdough bread, which Mr. Taber bakes inside a cast-iron pot to give it a crust that is as stiff, crisp and dark as bread crust can get without being burned. It's a place where certain flavors, like the seared foie gras with ripe strawberries in warm strawberry-rhubarb juice, or the duck breast with morels and rye berries, were so intense that I called over the server and asked for the same dish again, please, before another course left the kitchen. Ms. Norris buys the wines. Almost all come from the natural school, and a few were chosen with more enthusiasm than discernment, so it's wise to taste before committing to a bottle. As they are all poured by the glass, this is easy to do. Wines that didn't seem quite ready and a slightly undercooked monkfish were the only tastes I regretted. I could also wish for more than one dessert on the menu. Recently it was a chocolate mousse with a caramel-like strawberry cream, cacao nibs and puffed rice; I liked it just fine, but the people at my table who didn't would have appreciated an alternative. Mr. Taber, no doubt, would appreciate a bigger kitchen and someone to share it with. Like the romance in a screwball comedy, though, Grindhaus gets its energy from the meeting of opposites: Mr. Taber's large ambitions and his tiny work space, the carefully considered cooking and Ms. Norris's wild paraphernalia. She hasn't decorated the place with canes or masks from her dominatrix days, but she believes the dungeon helped shape Grindhaus. \"That's also the hospitality industry, in a way,\" she said, adding: \"So it finds its way into how things are run and taking care of people. Making sure no one leaves scarred. Or unhappy.\" ", "rec_dishes": ["Sourdough bread", "Parkerhaus rolls", "cabbage and pork jowl with huckleberries", "fresh pasta", "duck breast", "cheese."]}, {"id": 100, "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/dining/restaurant-review-tavern-on-the-green.html", "review_text": " Restaurant critics are supposed to be impartial, but I can't help feeling some proprietary interest in Tavern on the Green . Not a financial interest, except insofar as a profitable Tavern is good for the city's budget, which, in a fractions-of-pennies way, is good for me as a grumpy taxpayer. It's more like a civic interest. Tavern on the Green belongs to the city and sits inside the most beautiful public park in which I've ever rowed, cycled, struck out in softball, misidentified a confusing fall warbler and illegally consumed alcoholic beverages. I'd let the city keep those fractional pennies if that helped Tavern on the Green live up to its setting. So you may detect an extra cup or two of enthusiasm in my voice when I say that under its new management , the building is woven into the life of the park more fully than in its last incarnation, a wedding-cake palace as imagined by a 6-year-old princess with a high fever. And you may hear a few teaspoons of added regret when I say that it's not a good restaurant yet by any measure. The place reopened just two months ago , which may not be enough time to get a 700-seat Winnebago like Tavern up to highway speed. In time, the kitchen may figure out how to get plates on the table while they are still hot. The chef, Katy Sparks , may rethink some of the overworked, underdelivering recipes. The hosts may learn how to read their reservations screen so they don't tell a customer he's the first to arrive and ask him to wait while the rest of his party is already in the restaurant's inner recesses, wondering if he's gone for a carriage ride. Somebody may tell the servers not to drop the check while people are still eating dessert. The sommeliers may turn down the thermostat so that red wines aren't the temperature of a kiddie pool. Still, compared with its last days before its death from insolvency in 2009 made it the subject of countless dry-eyed eulogies, Tavern on the Green is much, much improved. One of its real joys is seeing the exuberant Victorian building, constructed in 1871 as a dormitory for the grass-munching residents of Sheep Meadow, restored down to the last copper drainpipe. The snaggletoothed slate roof has been to the orthodontist. The Parks Department, determined to end the Tavern's sparkly isolation, tore down the Crystal Room, which used to galumph halfway across the courtyard. The Berlin Wall of giant topiary animals that blocked the view of Sheep Meadow is gone, too. Now if you eat on the terrace, you can see the runners and the pedicab drivers on West Drive, and they can see you. The restaurant's new operators, Jim Caiola and David Salama , have tried to put the tavern back into the Tavern. Ms. Sparks's plates are substantial, and any leanings toward fanciness are confined to the perimeters of the plate. The menu does not say, \"Aunt Althea's 80th birthday\" as much as it says: \"Hi there. If you happen to be going to Lincoln Center, don't forget about me!\" The glittering, un-tavernlike interior encrustations have been scraped off. Next to the entrance is a bar shaped like a racetrack next to a convincing artificial marble fireplace flanked by carved rams' heads. It's dark and reassuring, just the kind of sheltered saloon you'd want to end up in after working up a thirst in the park. In the main dining room, though, the tavern motif explodes in a whiteout. Everything is bright and off-white: tables, chairs, banquettes, floors. It looks like the indoor-outdoor, all-day, casual-dining option at a family-friendly resort in Florida. The servers have the determined enthusiasm of counselors poached from a summer camp in Maine and given a crash course in big-city restaurant customs during the bus ride down Interstate 95. One of them thought everything we did and said was \"wonderful\": our clever preference for sparkling water over still, our bold decision to look at dessert menus. Another picked up a few crumbs from the leather-topped table with his fingertips, then left the rest. Somebody showed up the instant the plates had been set down to ask brightly, \"How does everything look?\" I can't blame her for not asking how it tasted. The answer may have made it hard to stay chipper. Prying tiny quail bones away from meat that was griddled until it was as dry as a week-old English muffin wasn't very wonderful. Neither was the greasy scattering of mushrooms and gummy, flavorless farro strozzapreti baked under a mound of ricotta that had no idea it was supposed to act like a sauce. The ceviches aren't ceviches; they're rough-sawn carpaccios of seafood covered with garnishes that are either thuggish (harsh pickled onions and acrid, stale fried garlic chips on yellowfin tuna) or useless (avocado lumps on salmon). Then acid is thrown at them. The directive seems to be: terminate with extreme prejudice. Is it too late to bring back the sheep? No, no. Patience. Maybe the food, which isn't especially ornate, still needs to come down a notch or two. The pork chop could lose the stringy, sour, half-raw roasted rhubarb. The brisket in a sweetish barbecue sauce, which you'd be happy enough to find at your local brew pub, could do without the comatose potato salad. And the menu would be easier to handle if Ms. Sparks didn't organize it by heat source. (\"I don't really care what I eat, as long as it was cooked on a plancha!\") The most enjoyable dishes tend to be the simplest. The Serrano ham and melted Gruy\u00e8re sandwich was totally likable, which is my clever way of saying it was fried in butter. I couldn't taste any wood smoke in the hearth-roasted mussels, but they were tender and flavorful in their Spanish-leaning sauce of garlic and chopped almonds. The $56 strip steak was excellent, too, although it probably helped that it was the only main course that arrived hot that night. (It is by far the most expensive of what the menu calls \"large plates.\" The others hover around $30, which might squeak by as reasonable for dinner in the park if the cooking didn't get away from the cooks so often.) The prize dessert is also the most modest: the birthday cake. White and soft, with whipped ricotta between the layers and whipped cream on top, it's exactly what a plain-vanilla American layer cake should be. The other desserts are fine, but they could learn a thing or two from it. The berry shortcake needs a richer, creamier biscuit, and if the fudgelike brownies want to graduate to sundae status, they deserve more than a single scoop of ice cream. The best of my four meals at Tavern on the Green was brunch at a shady table in the courtyard, where I watched Sheep Meadow slowly fill up with weekend layabouts. The food wasn't so wonderful that it would lure crowds, but it wouldn't keep them away, either. No doubt the restaurant is aiming higher than that, but it wouldn't be a bad place to begin.

Will the replacement be a caretaker cook mimicking the style that made the place exciting? Or will the successor be a creative whiz who can make the menu jump through a new set of hoops? A Voce Madison and BLT Fish, two Manhattan restaurants that won enthusiastic three-star reviews from Frank Bruni in The New York Times shortly after they opened, have faced this question. Laurent Tourondel whipped up BLT Fish in 2005, but walked away from it and his other BLT restaurants around the country four years later in a messy split with his business partner. Andrew Carmellini put A Voce, as it was called then , on the map in 2006, but he is long gone, too. The two restaurants didn't capsize after their captains jumped ship, but some of the wind has gone out of their sails. The companies that own both restaurants are not run by chefs, which may explain why they have hired successors from outside; neither organization has the deep bench of up-and-coming cooks that a Daniel Boulud or a Mario Batali can draw on. A Voce Madison is on its third chef. Mr. Carmellini was succeeded by Missy Robbins, who also opened the sister A Voce in the Time Warner Center. At the original, off Madison Square, she was replaced last summer by Ben Lee. Mr. Lee is an assured cook who earned his stripes working for Marc Vetri and Michael White , and under his watch the kitchen at A Voce Madison has taken an understated turn that still offers a rewarding interpretation of modern Italian cuisine. He exerts a fine-tuned control on brawny, rustic flavors, setting octopus stewed in red wine on a savory semolina pancake with a thick ridge of concentrated tomato sauce and browned crumbles of fiery \u2018nduja . He has a five-minute egg on toast that sounds like a desperation dinner scavenged from an empty refrigerator, but as the liquid yolk coats lightly pickled hen-of-the-woods mushrooms under a nutty Parmigiano-Reggiano cream, it turns out to be a very elegant appetizer. There was an echo of Mr. White's silky way with pasta in the fettuccine tossed with a meaty braise of rabbit with rosemary and black trumpet mushrooms, and in the tender yellow packets of agnolotti filled with lovely lemon-scented ricotta. Other pastas lacked a sense of proportion, like the buckwheat pizzoccheri that needed more than a few stray leaves of chard to balance the gooey slick of melted bitto cheese. And one was just strange: the cassoncini, pale fried ravioli with a filling of mozzarella, anchovy and sundried tomatoes that tasted like pizza run through a blender. In the main courses, Mr. Lee shows more nuance with seafood than with meat. A hulking braised lamb shank in midwinter was more blunt than focused, while a lukewarm pork chop that was probably never going to get off the ground didn't get much aerodynamic lift from the mushy, oily mass of pine nuts and raisins on top. He brought more finesse to wild striped bass with fennel braised in orange juice, and to satiny olive-oil poached cod with sweet littlenecks. A new pastry chef, Kristin Menton, is making desserts that are as charming as a handwritten thank-you note. A honey-lavender panna cotta with fresh peaches and peach sorbet had an understated hum of sweetness, and extracted a gentle perfume from the lavender without giving in to potpourri overkill. Service has been variable -- so lethargic one night that it must have added an hour to the meal, almost pushy on another, when a server loomed over the table with a grappa bottle the size of a softball bat. \"They make it for us. It's very nice,\" she said. We showed no interest, but still: \"You want to try?\" This time we said no. \"Just a little bit?\" At least she didn't start swinging the bottle at us. When Mr. Carmellini ran the shop, the food felt imperative, almost insisting that you give in to its full-flavored seductions. Mr. Lee's style doesn't have the same strong personal imprint, but he has kept A Voce Madison among the city's more enjoyable practitioners of contemporary Italian cuisine. BLT Fish, in Chelsea, was always a trickier proposition. The engine that drove its initial success was the tension between Laurent Tourondel's sophisticated French technique and the crowd-pleasing trinkets he tossed out like Mardi Gras beads. (A meal might kick off with fried rock shrimp in Buffalo wing sauce and blue cheese.) The restaurant was serious and fun at the same time, \"the culinary equivalent of a poetic page-turner or a mass-market movie helmed by an auteur,\" as Mr. Bruni put it. With the poet and auteur subtracted, the formula grew creaky. Last spring, the owners brought on a new chef, Luke Venner. Most recently the chef de cuisine at Millwright's in Simsbury, Conn., Mr. Venner seems miscast here. He doesn't hit the high notes as effortlessly as Mr. Tourondel did, so the populist touches don't feel witty and self-aware anymore. They just feel like gimmicks. Often enough, the kitchen outfits seafood in flattering ways. Very sweet raw scallops were minimally but effectively dressed with lemon oil and thyme leaves. Spaghetti in a parsley-cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche sauce flickering with red Thai chiles provided a bright setting for sliced razor clams. Ham-hock broth, white polenta and sweet spring peas made for a winning version of shrimp and grits. Lightly charred octopus was served on briny, intense black olive pur\u00e9e above a bed of potatoes, which came together as a combined condiment and side dish. But there are also sauces that don't click, like the washed-out mandarin emulsion with halibut, or the dashi broth with scallops and nine kinds of mushrooms, which proved that more umami is not always the answer. There are odd pairings, like the curried oxtail stew served with smooth shrimp that refused to cling to the sauce. There is inattention to detail, like the crunchy, gritty morels in a thin, salty asparagus soup, or the branzino left to bake inside its salt crust until it was slightly dry and tough. The prices at BLT Fish, never gentle, are hard to support now that the food is uneven. The branzino, meant for two, cost $68. A $70 seafood platter offered bland, not very tender lobster tail; undercooked mussels with their beards left intact, and big, rubbery shrimp. It held some very good tastes, too, but they delivered about $35 worth of pleasure, rounding up. Desserts are a mixed lot as well, but the first choice should be the excellent tarte Tatin, baked in a little cast iron pot with a thick swirl of caramel. While you're eating it, a glass jar of cotton candy arrives. In the beginning, this circus flourish was like a wink from a chef with the heart of a carnival ringmaster. Now it's one of the few claims BLT Fish has to being more than another expensive place to eat seafood.

The cooking at Gato is many things, often all at the same time, but it is rarely shy. \"Tons of olive oil,\" Mr. Flay promised in a January interview in The New York Times as the space in NoHo was under plywood. \"Tons of salty flavors like anchovies and olives and capers. Lots of citrus. Tons of things like tomatoes and peppers, both hot and sweet.\" Stand aside, all you chefs fiddling with tweezers and eyedroppers; Bobby Flay is backing up an 18-wheeler loaded with anchovies. Of the first generation of gunslinging Food Network chefs, Mr. Flay is the only one who stayed in the saddle as the channel's mission shifted from dump-and-stir cooking lessons to ticking-clock gladiator contests. He also kept his dignity; he acts like a professional, not a cartoon. Still, playing a chef isn't the same as being one, and as the real estate market picked off first Bolo and then Mesa Grill , his New York presence was whittled down to just Bar Americain , a Whitman's Sampler of American regional favorites. To audiences who don't remember how skillfully he conjured up bursts of sunlight in Mesa Grill's prime, Mr. Flay was in danger of becoming another Old West sharpshooter who'd joined up with Buffalo Bill Cody to delight big-top crowds by blasting holes in playing cards. With Gato, he's a grizzled sheriff pinning on his badge again and returning to the precincts where he first laid down the law. He's out to prove he's more than just a big hat. But the frontier is a-changin'. The townspeople expect all kinds of newfangled foolishness. If they aren't amazed by every bite, they'll yelp like coyotes. Worse, they can't live without small plates. Fine, Bobby Flay can do small plates. He can crush small plates with one hand. His bar snacks, three porcelain bowls lined up on a slate for $17, are compact flavor bombs that detonate quickly and leave a vivid afterimage. He'll stuff cubes of tuna tartare inside a piquillo pepper, pitting cool and raw against roasted and mildly spicy. He makes a tiny powerhouse of fresh chorizo wrapped in caul fat, and gives it some shaved pickled fennel to calm its hotheaded tendencies. Many chefs leave burrata to its own, oozy devices; Mr. Flay piles on roasted beets and a vinaigrette made from oil in which black olives have stewed, and suddenly it's a dish with something to say. I'm omitting some other stuff on these plates both for brevity and because they never swamped the rest. The size of the bar snacks may limit how much flavor-troweling Mr. Flay can do. Some of the bigger plates show his maximalist embroidery at its bring-it-on best; others seem to leave too much space for his BeDazzler . Rabbits have a famous love for carrots, but I've never seen one take to the vegetable the way Gato's juicy braised rabbit leg takes to its carrot hot sauce, which tastes like sweet fire. Nor have I tasted a tarragon chicken in which the minty-licorice character of the herb had the flute-note brightness it has at Gato, which carpets the bird's crisp skin with a variety of salsa verde made from chopped raw tarragon. Mr. Flay can put a crust on a paella like nobody's business, and the crunchy grains of rice, once you unstick them from the bottom of the pan and mix them with a steamed egg, fried artichokes and big, tender leaves of saut\u00e9ed kale, have a flavor-texture dynamic that's just fun to eat. Steamed halibut promises all the thrills of curling up in bed with a bond fund's quarterly report. Mr. Flay plunks the fish into a bowl of saffron-tomato soup made from halibut stock and bulked up with couscous, and if it's not quite thrilling, it still has a winning depth of flavor, and some nuance, too. Nuance has never been Mr. Flay's middle name, but he can achieve it, particularly in the main courses. With some of the more hyperactive dishes at Gato, though, it's as if his years of competitive cooking have trained him to go for the knockout punch right away. He'll funnel every ounce of flavor into the first bite, and he seems to be afraid that if he leaves out some trick, the judges will have enough taste buds left to notice what his rivals are up to. Fettuccine was soaked with potent, briny squid ink and mussel broth until it elbowed everything else -- red prawns, mussels and a quiet green-onion pur\u00e9e -- right off the plate. A side of piment\u00f3n-dusted potatoes fried to shattering bits, like crumbled bacon, was oily enough on its own without the extra richness of a runny poached egg and salty enough without a frosting of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Cheese is wheeled out again and again: soft shreds of fontina in a chicory salad; crumbs of pecorino over asparagus and fava beans whose spring freshness would have been better off with just the yellow romesco; goat cheese with crunchy potatoes alongside that tarragon chicken; gobs of bucheron in a plate of scrambled eggs blitzed with romesco. Sweetness can turn up where it's not needed, too, whether in the romesco with an unprepossessing pork chop or in the apricot-almond dressing in that chicory salad. But if Mr. Flay sometimes lights up the tilt sign on his pinball machine, there is still a lot to love on the menu. There is a lot, period. Gato shows an all-too-rare generosity in its flavors, its eager service, its good-tempered desserts, like the summery blackberry crostata and the fromage blanc cheesecake whipped into a froth by the pastry chef, Clarisa Martino. Seeking a decent bottle of wine for $50 or under at an ambitious New York restaurant is becoming a lost cause, but there are more than a dozen of them at Gato. The wine list brings together affordable, everyday bottles with others that will sing their song to advanced drinkers. (It makes a happier hunting ground than the humdrum cocktail menu.) Given Mr. Flay's fan base, the dining room might have been a pack-'em-in nightmare, but there's space to flex your elbows. The architects at Rockwell Group, past masters at injecting life into big, boxy rooms, have turned this onetime homeless shelter into a flickering lair where the heat-lamp glow of hanging lights is set off against receding pools of darkness. It looks like a set for a TV show about sexy young downtown vampires who unwind over blood sausages -- \"Cheers\" for the undead. All the reviews of Gato note that Mr. Flay is really, truly working in the glassed-in kitchen. I saw him, too, not twirling cilantro sprigs at the pass but facing the burners, his back to the audience, like Miles Davis. He says he's sticking around indefinitely. Nobody can say he's giving us anything less than the full Flay.

It is a classic Manhattan restaurant that seems to have emerged on East 82nd Street fully formed out of a time capsule sealed in the last century. When you call the restaurant, which is the only way to reserve one of its 11 tables, Ms. Vaughn will write your name in something called a \"book,\" holding an implement known as a \"pen.\" She applies the same antique tool to the menu, which she writes out in cursive and photocopies each time Mr. Smith changes it. The Simone's search-engine strategy is the opposite of optimized. The restaurant is not on Open Table, Menu Pages, Twitter or Facebook, and an Internet search will turn up an unrelated martini bar's website before the Simone's . I often think that restaurants with outdoor-concert noise levels, backless benches and no-reservations policies are deliberately trying to scare off older diners. The Simone seems to be attempting something like that in reverse: If you wanted to keep away anyone under 35, this is how you'd do it. But as some of those youngsters know, the worn grooves of an old LP can sound richer than the shimmering precision of an MP3. And the Simone has the kind of textured, lived-in, analog warmth that has become rare in Manhattan's increasingly corporatized, professionalized restaurant scene. Though expensive, with main courses fluttering into the low $40s, and formal, with waiters in vests and neckties primping white tablecloths, the Simone isn't starchy at all. It's a living, breathing mom-and-pop outfit where Ms. Vaughn will gush with bubbly pride about the Proven\u00e7al bottle she spontaneously offered to work into a flight of ros\u00e9s, while Mr. Smith, no showboat, channels his pride into the cooking. (A third owner, Robert Margolis, keeps a poker-faced watch on the dining room.) Like the rest of the Simone, Mr. Smith's kitchen is a bit of a throwback. The winds of New Nordic and modernist cuisines do not ruffle the surface of his stockpots. He works within French tradition in a manner that was almost the default New York style 15 to 20 years ago. Mr. Smith, who trained under Patrick O'Connell and Jean-Louis Palladin, is not rewriting the rules of French cooking. It's simply the language he speaks, and he's fluent enough that he can use it to talk about the ingredients in his part of the world. If you were designing a dish to go viral on Instagram, you'd start by ruling out flounder, which has the must-see quotient of a \"Matlock\" marathon on TBS. The fish is a favorite of Mr. Smith's, who served me two flounder dishes that rank among the best seafood I've tasted this year. In late winter, he rolled juicy, big-flaked fillets around a mousse of flounder and black truffle flecks; I would have burrowed into it until spring if I hadn't also wanted to eat the whole thing. The flounder's cold-weather swaddling disappeared a few weeks ago, and a jaunty new May outfit appeared: a golden sheet of bread crumbs speckled with fresh green herbs on top of the fish, a platform of crushed, minted favas below. Mr. Smith's main courses often pair two takes on a protein, one very good and the other exceptional: a juicy roasted chicken breast with fried croquettes of dark meat, ham and foie gras so hard to ignore that dinner came to a dead stop while we passed them around; a drum of braised lamb shank with a single rib daubed with a Moroccan spice blend that landed with a menacing uppercut of heat; a crisped boneless duck thigh with thin slices of breast that were pink right out to the edges and almost surreally tender. One time, Mr. Smith doubled down and lost. The grilled loin and braised thigh of rabbit, both on the dry side, must have been a fluke, because he usually showed the intuition of a chef who knows just how his ingredients want to be handled. He has good sense with appetizers, too, and an admirable sense of restraint; he doesn't turn them into scene stealers that leave the main courses nowhere to go but down. The first king salmon of the Alaskan season were shown off handsomely in a tartare with crisp cucumbers and bright preserved lemons. His goat-cheese souffl\u00e9 was more warm custard than eat-it-now atmospheric condition, but it was still an excellent custard. He carves sweetbreads into long planks, creating more surface area for the crunchy coating of bread crumbs and Dijon mustard that was more than half the point. House-made charcuterie sits at the top of the menu, and it belongs there. Mr. Smith treats the tradition with a rare classicism, as in his recent bacon-wrapped terrine of pork, chicken liver, pistachios, pink plugs of foie gras and Armagnac prunes. I wished that the brioche toast served with it had been a little softer and lighter, but I was happy enough eating the terrine alone. It was like a rousing chorus of \"La Marseillaise\" made of meat. One night, Ms. Vaughn explained that during some lean times at a previous restaurant when they had to let the pastry chef go, Mr. Smith taught himself to make desserts. He has more of a feel for the last course than many chefs, although there were a few false moves, like a lemon tart that wasn't puckery enough to withstand a sugary overload of meringue. But other desserts fell right into line, like a tart of Mr. Smith's own marmalade with a crushed almond topping, and a little tower of Lord Baltimore cake , the yellow layers filled with pecans, dried fruits and coconut that were addled with bourbon, the way Lord Baltimore intended. There is no bar \"program\" at this restaurant, no list of nine-ingredient cocktails with dingbat names like Simone Says. But if your drink request is normal enough, it will materialize on the staircase in the hands of a waiter who presumably got it from some unseen, unheard Jeeves on the second floor. The Simone is a personal restaurant, and it has some personal quirks. The sophisticated-lady playlist can push nostalgia a step too far; raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, on the original cast recording, may not be everybody's favorite thing at dinner. And Ms. Vaughn has a funny habit of sidling up to the table to ask single-word questions: Delicious? Lovely? The thing is, there was always a single-word answer: yes.

Grandpa wants to tell you a story about wealth, power, real estate, pornography, carrots and a sweet-faced dairy cow named Narcissa. About 90 miles north of Manhattan is a 76-acre triangle of land on the Hudson River whose owners over the centuries have acted out the history, in stop-frame animation, of social power in New York. When Dutch families ran half of the Hudson Valley, it was farmed by the son of a settler from the Netherlands. He sold the place to one of the Livingstons, an aristocratic Scottish family who ran the other half. As Gilded Age capitalists crashed New York society, the property was bought by William B. Dinsmore, a founder of a company that was the U.P.S. of the Civil War era , but with stagecoaches instead of brown vans. The Dinsmores had a Gatsbyesque time there, entertaining trainloads of weekend guests with a private golf course and a greenhouse full of orchids . Pipe down, I'm getting to the porn. There are always fun new ways to get rich in America, and in the prolonged group grope between the invention of the Pill and the Meese Report , Bob Guccione got rich by printing photos of Penthouse pets, who exposed things that the blushing Playmates didn't. With his earnings, Mr. Guccione bought the old Dinsmore estate. But when we chased pornography off our streets and onto our laptops, Mr. Guccione wasn't rich any more, and his country retreat was seized by creditors. Now we save our soft-focus pictures for pork chops, and restaurants are one of the last places where moaning in public is still acceptable. So of course the person who bought the property at auction is a restaurateur, Andr\u00e9 Balazs . Renaming the estate Locusts-on-Hudson, Mr. Balazs rents it out for weddings ( the website tastefully passes over the gold-chained Guccione years) and farms the land again. Today it is home to vegetable plots, laying hens and a retired cow, Narcissa. She gave her name to Mr. Balazs's latest restaurant, inside his Standard East Village hotel, and her moony eyes look down at the dining room from framed photographs. Narcissa the cow has no role in the restaurant's rib-eye steak, but the farm is supposed to help in other ways. Last fall, Narcissa's chef, John Fraser, started planning this summer's menu by choosing the vegetables he wanted from illustrated seed catalogs. These books, he said, were \"food porn in and of themselves.\" Whether teenage boys will hide pictures of undressed kohlrabi under their mattresses remains to be seen, but Mr. Fraser has already come up with one of the year's most photographed carrots. A take on beef Wellington, it has salt-cured roasted carrots inside the puff pastry where the meat should go. It's a startling success. The carrots are tender without a trace of mushiness, and a walnut paste darkened with cocoa and coffee gives them a brooding, bittersweet depth. Mr. Fraser is known for his refined, thought-out vegetable tasting menus at Dovetail , on the Upper West Side. His vegetable plates at Narcissa are more unbuttoned and generous. They're complex, but in a relaxed way that fits this casual, many-things-to-many-people dining room, where tables of chef chasers sit next to narrow-waisted colts who look as if they get their nutrients from air kisses. Beets are spit-roasted for hours until their outsides are charred like grilled steak and the insides have a focused, waterless intensity; then they're lightly crushed into deep-ruby hunks that drink up a horseradish cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Plum-size sweet potatoes go on the rotisserie, too, getting a hot allspice-heavy jerk sauce completely right for their sugary flesh, which can taste flabby on its own. This kitchen knows how to build a salad, mixing vinaigrettes that have a switchblade edge and tossing in sophisticated-hippie handfuls of sunflower seeds (with saucerlike leaves of brussels sprouts) or crunchy chopped pistachios (in the mixed-greens Narcissa's salad). Side dishes are often a crass adventure in check-padding. That's not the case at Narcissa, although the carrot fries -- overdone carrots in a greasy battered shell -- just made me miss the Wellington. (This is why magicians never repeat a trick.) But I could eat Narcissa's steamed new potatoes in green garlic and olive oil all summer long, and I wish steakhouses would steal its \"supergreen spinach,\" wilted leaves folded into a b\u00e9chamel-fortified pur\u00e9e that has a Sprite-bottle gleam. I'm giving these vegetables lingering close-ups because they have a swaggering originality that the meat and seafood rarely match. Hake with a south-of-France trio of tapenade, oranges and artichokes, and a poussin the size of a mango with legs, in a vaguely truffled chicken reduction, were extremely pleasant, but wouldn't get Narcissa noticed on their own. Other dishes seemed designed for jet-lagged hotel guests who don't want any back-talk from their dinner, like the not-quite-juicy roasted branzino with a standard-issue salsa verde. Mr. Fraser could use a few more main courses like the steamed black sea bass, which worked up some excitement -- an uphill battle for steamed fish -- by means of a toasty coconut-curry broth and hollow cross-sections of green almonds, squeaky-crisp as an unripe pear. Deborah Racicot's desserts are just clever enough; if you're paying attention, you can tell that she is, too. To go with a round chocolate tart, like a brownie with a melted center, she lightly curries bananas, using slightly green ones so they're not too cloying. The nicest thing I can say about the long winter is that it allowed her citrus salad with tapioca pudding and orange-blossom granit\u00e9 to stay on the menu until May. Tableside patter can be strange. A server one night talked up the \"day-trip scallops\" (lucky them) and pushed carrots Wellington as a mid-meal \"palate cleanser.\" There was no song and dance from the wine staff, led by Ashley Santoro, only to-the-point advice on a very appealing list. The design has a disjointed feel. Wooden chairs hang from pegs, in the aspirational Shaker Zen style, but the low zigzag partition along the bar could come from a Vegas coffee shop. Then there's the steep staircase to the restrooms with crazy diagonal stripes reflected in the mirrored ceiling. It looks as if the director of \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" had remade \"The Lost Weekend.\" If you've been drinking, tie a rope around your waist and have a friend slowly lower you down.

He saw enough flowers for a year of proms, he saw a piano player massaging a Steinway, he saw a curtain of glass framing the Brooklyn Bridge and the lights of Fortress Manhattan on the other side. All of this he saw floating on a barge in the East River. After pleading for permits for 12 years, he persuaded City Hall to see it, too, and in 1977 the River Caf\u00e9 dropped anchors. Did Mr. O'Keeffe see men producing diamond rings from their jacket pockets? He has seen it hundreds of times since. So have I, sitting at the bar one summer a few years back when a young man talked his date into catching the view from the deck outside then dropped to one knee, right next to the swiveling mounted binoculars. I'll never forget it, or the look in the couple's dewy eyes when they discovered that the door to the dining room had locked behind them. No questions were popped at the River Caf\u00e9 for more than a year after Hurricane Sandy dished out a surge tide that even a barge couldn't stay on top of. When the River Caf\u00e9 opened again in February, the walls, ships' deck floorboards, the grand piano, most of the wine cellar and nearly everything else was new. You'd never know it. Mr. O'Keeffe paid for a museum-quality restoration. As before, you reach the River Caf\u00e9 by traveling down a cobbled driveway with lanterns and a miniature forest of plants on either side, as if Snow White's cottage were at the end of the road. The entrance casts its fairy-tale spell on a good number of wanderers who follow the winding road only to be sent away because they don't have jackets (for the men) or reservations (for everyone). Those who are allowed inside cross a short gangplank to the floating dining room, where captains in black tuxedos stand guard. On the right, flowers; on the left, a pianist who gently spoons out ballads for hours on end without ever seeming to need a break. He doesn't sing, but memory dredges up the words: When I'm close to you, dear, the stars fill the sky. So in love with you am I. This trickling brook of melodies babbling away in the background is more pretty than beautiful. Like many things about the River Caf\u00e9, it is white-limo elegant. But so few New York restaurants today reach for elegance of any kind that the resurgence of this one is a gift to the city. Even harder to find are restaurants where tourists can go to gape at the view and New Yorkers can go without being embarrassed. Windows on the World, once straight across the river, is gone for good, and the return of the revolving dance floor at the Rainbow Room, scheduled for October, can't come soon enough. No place in the city combines spectacle with hideaway intimacy and undiluted romance the way the River Caf\u00e9 does. And if more customers will take photographs of the Brooklyn Bridge's steel underbelly than of their plates, the food is still much better than you might fear if you've been to other restaurants with souvenir views. \"The kitchen aims to please but not to shock,\" William Grimes wrote in his two-star review 12 years ago , the last time the restaurant was assessed in The New York Times. That hasn't changed. Neither has the chef, Brad Steelman, who has been in his post since 2000. The sailor's \"steady as she goes\" might be the River Caf\u00e9's motto. An opening salvo from the kitchen, a single shrimp on a Southeast Asian papaya salad with crushed peanuts, makes it clear that flavor epiphanies are not in store. The rack of lamb I ate recently, which was inside a skinny ring of mint jelly zipped up with mustard seeds, appeared to be the same dish Mr. Grimes described. (We both liked it.) Radiating like spokes from a hub of firm, hand-chopped steak tartare are lines of mustard, chopped capers, shallots, cornichons and chives: the usual suspects. Mr. Steelman doesn't need his garnishes to provide hologram moonwalks, though. His main ingredients are almost always good enough to be their own special effects. For his shrimp Oscar, he sets hollandaise boosted with blood-orange juice against beautifully sweet Pacific blue shrimp and meaty white lumps of crab. In another appetizer called Three Shells, strips of abalone dunked in a yuzu-kaffir bath and firm little kumamoto oysters in a classic mignonette had the shining immediacy of great seafood, too, even if the third shell, Taylor Bay scallops ceviche, didn't quite keep up. And while poached lobster could probably find more exciting companions than celery root pur\u00e9e and slightly sweet-sour butternut squash dice, the lobster itself was tender and sweet enough to be a solo act. A duck breast whose skin has a terrific crisp shellac, seasoned with lavender and a trace of dried chiles, was better served by the cozy Eastern European comfort of glossy braised red cabbage and crisp squiggles of sweet-potato spaetzle. Some of Mr. Steelman's ideas can be questioned. His extremely good Barolo-braised oxtail appetizer would get along nicely with either polenta or pasta, but perhaps not with polenta stuffed inside pasta. And he piled too much breading on fried oysters, which were rescued from dryness only by their topping of smoked salmon and caviar. In general, though, he sticks to classic notions and we get the rewards; his mushroom Wellington turns the obligatory vegetarian main course into a real event. Desserts, included in the three-course $115 fixed-price dinner, could use refreshing. Vanilla ice cream and vanilla ice milk turn up on several, with no noticeable taste of vanilla. But that didn't hurt the milk-chocolate souffl\u00e9, already sweetened by a melting cap of toasted marshmallow, or the chocolate marquise straddled by a dark chocolate replica of the Brooklyn Bridge's towers and cables. Maybe a chocolate bridge is a little hokey, but so is dropping to one knee in front of the Manhattan skyline. In both cases what counts is not the originality of the gesture but its sincerity. In its desire to sweep us into its secluded, flower-strewn island, the River Caf\u00e9 is sincere in a way that restaurants hardly ever are these days. At the end of a night there, I always regret that it's time to come back to the mainland.

The thumbnail curve of the sardine-can tapas bar is just the way it's been since the beginning, packed, every seat there and on the opposite wall a few inches away taken almost any time you show up. Turn right at the door, though, and you'll find something new. Last fall, El Quinto Pino's owners and chefs, Alex Raij and her husband, Eder Montero, took over the lease on the apartment next door and filled it with tables, making their sardine can a real restaurant. \"It won't make a bid for your entire night: You will snack at El Quinto Pino and almost inevitably eat more somewhere else,\" Peter Meehan wrote in a \" $25 and Under\" column in 2007, its last review in The New York Times. With a reservation for that side room you won't need to go anywhere else for dinner. You won't want to, either, once the food starts zooming out of the kitchen. Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero also own Txikito, across Ninth Avenue, which digs into Basque cuisine, and La Vara, in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where the menu is a master's thesis on Moorish and Jewish imprints upon Spanish cooking. A short \"men\u00fa tur\u00edstico\" at El Quinto Pino investigates a different region of the country every few months, which gives regulars a reason to keep coming and gives the kitchen a launching pad for dishes that may hit the permanent roster. Other than that, the two chefs haven't tied themselves down. Having laid down their Iberian credentials in their other restaurants, they've given El Quinto Pino a passport to roam around. Among the bar sandwiches tightly wrapped in paper is a visitor from New Orleans, a po'boy with closely packed, terrifically crunchy fried squid legs at its core. Another is a fortified Cubano, in which the ham and crisp pickle have more oomph than usual, the cheese doesn't taste processed, for once, and the braised pork is supplemented with a red wallop of blood sausage. The chefs do a takeoff on Catalonia's version of the croque monsieur, the bikini, but they aim a double-barreled blast of Mexico at it, topping the melted cheese with roasted poblanos and huitlacoche, the flamboyantly weird, mushroom-tasting black fungus that grows on corn ears. Geographic freedom between pieces of bread was written into El Quinto Pino's charter from the start, when Ms. Raij brought out (all rise, please) the uni panino. A pressed ficelle filled with creamy sea urchin, melted butter and a lashing of mustard oil, it became one of the city's essential sandwiches. It still is, even though one night mustard-oil supplies must have run low and the panino wasn't the same without its throat-catching rumble. The rest of the menu is made up of tapas-style plates, and the servers are careful not to overload the small tables, bringing just one or two at a time. The kitchen mostly presents these dishes as tangles that are easily shared, and resists the impulse toward multicomponent platings. With Raij-Montero portions, four people seems to be the breaking point at which you're not so much eating as nibbling. I enjoyed El Quinto Pino more in a party of three, and best of all with just one accomplice. Some of the seafood is so appealing and out of the ordinary that dividing it can test your ability to play well with others. I hated surrendering the last fried lump of sea anemone folded into soft scrambled eggs. Called ortiguillas, they tasted almost like fried oysters, but not quite, and I wanted to get to the bottom of that \"not quite.\" My curiosity and my appetite also wanted a few more runs at the Catalan salad xat\u00f3, which mixed chicory and canned bonito with raw salt cod, soaked to pull out the salt and to reveal a flavor of quietly intensified fish. Dressed with both romesco and an uncooked tomato sauce, this salad seemed to get more lively with each bite. Tender, apple-blossom-pink gambas al ajillo get a little fresh ginger along with the garlic, an addition that made me want to eat them twice as fast. (Mashed and sliced avocado don't have the same effect on an oddly inert salpicon of shrimp.) Smaller shrimp from Cadiz, the size of a paper clip and intensely flavorful in their shells, are pressed into a tortillita, a wonderful fritter that looks like a latke cooked under a brick. Fried on their own, these shrimp turn up again to bring a marine undertow to a jiggly poached egg with slivered snow peas. The kitchen's hand is so steady that it's easy to pass over its occasional bobbles, unless you're unlucky enough to be served two or three in a row. My disappointments were spread out: dully spiced lamb skewers; underseasoned bits of fried pork whose name, \"bag of bacon,\" raised undue expectations; seafood fideua, like paella made from noodles, that lacked the oceanic depth I loved when I had the same dish at La Vara. And it's unclear how the xocolata dessert is meant to be served. One night the salt-sprinkled ingot of chocolate ganache was filled with fruity green olive oil that spilled out at the touch of a fork; I don't think I've ever enjoyed the pairing of the two ingredients more. On another, the oil was cold and congealed like Vaseline. Fortunately I had the excellent crema catalana, roused from its usual custardy slumber by cinnamon and lemon zest, to fall back on. Everything I know about dating could be carved onto the head of a pin with a butter knife, but a younger man who lives down the block from El Quinto Pino assures me it's a great date place. He didn't mean the bar, with its was-that-your-foot? dimensions, but the new dining room. Separated from the drinkers by a galley kitchen, its 30 seats feel secluded and romantic, but not in an obvious way. The architect Silvia Zofio gave it a quietly domestic, midcentury look, with an earth-toned tapestry covering one wall and a chandelier that suggests the swoosh of a flamenco dancer's skirt in mid-twirl. It's a room for talking, and if it's not exactly the boondocks, it's easy enough to get lost there for an hour or two.

In between came a dozen courses made from turnips, carrots, peas, beets, cauliflower and potatoes. Two see-through bands of lardo on grilled white asparagus and, down at the bottom of vegetable minestrone, some bits of chorizo that would have fit into a gum wrapper were the only visible signs of animal flesh. My employer paid $375 for my dinner. While I can't call it a bargain, I can say without pausing to think that I would skip espresso for two months until I had enough money to try Alain Passard's vegetable tasting menu at L'Arp\u00e8ge again. There are tasting menus that leave you glutted and blunted. This one made me feel more awake. I don't just mean that I didn't need to be carried out to the Rue de Varenne on a stretcher at the end of the night, although that was nice, too. Mr. Passard's cooking pulled me in like a conversation with a smart, literate, funny friend. When he sent out a mirrored bowl of quartered baby turnips, saut\u00e9ed in butter, with firm, barely sweetened rhubarb, I leaned forward -- wait, what? -- then sat up. The carrots and peas and so on tasted as bright and vivid as any I've had, but there was something more. If vegetables can have feelings, these did. They tasted happy. The emotional valence of the turnip and its friends is a hot topic in cooking these days. Many chefs have been saying lately that their imaginations are no longer fired by pork chops and chicken wings, that the most exciting frontiers in cuisine are growing in the garden. Vegetables are both medium and message in the arty, sculpture-park assemblages by chefs including Dominique Crenn and Christopher Kostow in Northern California and John Fraser and Shaun Hergatt in New York City, to name just a few. In the rising cult of the vegetable, L'Arp\u00e8ge is seen as an example, an inspiration and an early adopter. If you have been following global restaurant news, you've probably read that France stopped mattering after nouvelle cuisine flared down. By 2000 the culinary zeitgeist had decamped, fluttering over Spain for a while before winging its way north to sprinkle magical lichen powder around Scandinavia. Recently, it's been sighted in South America. According to this narrative, France may be fun for a no-reservations meal in a hipster bistro whose chef goes camping with David Chang , but it's certainly not one of the countries that call the shots anymore. I'm sorry to say this, but that narrative is a lie dreamed up by people who want to put France in its place. The most dramatic example of a restaurant that won't fit into that story is L'Arp\u00e8ge. While chefs in other countries were racing into the future, Alain Passard was tortoising around his three farms, learning about soil amendments and natural predators, picking vegetables in the morning so they could ride the high-speed train into Paris in time for lunch. Now that this seems like useful stuff to know again, chefs are starting to pay tribute. In David Kinch 's recent book \"Manresa,\" named for his restaurant in Los Gatos, Calif., he devoted a chapter to Mr. Passard. \"Passard, who recognized the importance of a cook's relationship to the land and those who work it long before it became fashionable, is now rightly considered a visionary by the best chefs in the world,\" Mr. Kinch wrote. \"His philosophy helped change the course of gastronomy by inspiring chefs to reflect their immediate natural environment in their dishes.\" Mr. Kinch had the latest in perhaps a dozen meals at L'Arp\u00e8ge last month. \"It's a better restaurant now than it ever has been,\" he said. \"There's been an evolution in his understanding of vegetables. He seems to have reached another level in his cooking, right now.\" The chef Dan Barber , who researched Mr. Passard's career for his recent book, \" The Third Plate ,\" points out that L'Arp\u00e8ge's devotion to vegetables expands on ideas pioneered by the nouvelle cuisine generation. What Mr. Passard contributed was \"this idea of bucking what's expected,\" which Mr. Barber called \"a throughline in his career.\" Today, he said, Mr. Passard's iconoclasm has given him a freedom that many of his peers envy. \"I don't know a chef who wouldn't want to cook like that, an improvisational vegetable experience,\" Mr. Barber said. After L'Arp\u00e8ge opened in 1986, Mr. Passard's slow-motion method for cooking meat to an unrivaled juiciness in pans that were barely hot enough to melt chocolate made him one of the leading chefs in France. Then, in 2001, he announced that he was done with red meat and seafood. Customers at his restaurant, perhaps the most expensive in Paris, would dine mostly on leaves, roots and stems. Alain Ducasse and Charlie Trotter had served elaborate vegetable tastings, but they didn't bet the farm on the idea. Mr. Passard did, in more ways than one. At his three farms in various regions of France, the agriculture goes beyond organic. The soil is turned over by horse-drawn plow at one, and ponds have been dug so bug-eating frogs can do the work of insecticides. Mr. Passard's break was not dogmatic or final. Roasted lamb and lobsters cut lengthwise into four equal quadrants, another early innovation, have reclaimed their slots on the menu. Even so, the vegetable experiment has grown into something important, and the only way to understand how far it has taken him is to eat at L'Arp\u00e8ge. There is no Arp\u00e8ge Bistro or natural-wine bar, no Passard Pizzeria at Charles de Gaulle Airport. A big yellow caution flag flies from any write-up of a single meal. In this case, the flag is bigger and yellower than usual. Even googly-eyed fans admit that meals at L'Arp\u00e8ge are not always transcendent, that the Art Deco dining room can look a bit weary, that the level of cooking and service can thud to the ground while the prices remain above the clouds. I saw hints of a more gravity-bound Arp\u00e8ge when, 10 minutes after I'd eaten wafer-light miniature tarts of beets and turnips, the same course arrived again. There was more redundancy when two vegetable medleys were served back to back. So with one hand I'll wave that yellow flag but with the other I'll type out this message: For its lightness, brightness, beauty and elegance, my single meal at L'Arp\u00e8ge was in an eye-opening class by itself. Apart from the radishes and the extraordinary mesclun salad dabbed with a vinaigrette of fresh-ground hazelnuts, heat was applied to most of the vegetables I ate, but they tasted more fresh and unmediated than if they had been raw. The green garlic soup under white peaks of ham-infused whipped cream, the vegetable ravioli in their glassine-thin wrappers bobbing in a precise, utterly clear vegetable consomm\u00e9, the young yellow carrots and sweet peas in a beautifully done vol-au-vent shell surrounded by a fresh, milky white onion sauce: The cooking was so unfussy and purposeful that it was almost transparent. How does he do it? Don't ask the chef unless you collect aphorisms. I wondered aloud in a later phone interview about the idea for that turnip and rhubarb saut\u00e9, and Mr. Passard told me, through an interpreter: \"I did not create that dish. Nature created that dish.\" It's worth noting, too, that he gets his effects without rare, bragging-rights species that look as if they came from the far side of the moon. \"It's tough to get a good tomato, a good carrot,\" he said. \"It's best to focus your effort on the quality of known products rather than trying to go around and offer things nobody has ever heard of.\" That insistence that the ordinary can be luxurious is going to be part of Mr. Passard's legacy, along with some of his other ideas: farming as a logical extension of cooking; time and place not just as passing inspiration but as the whole point; the fresh creativity made possible by ditching old achievements and starting over; and finally the example, almost unknown these days, of a renowned chef who, at 57, still cooks in his restaurant almost every day. If all that time in the kitchen weighs on him, it didn't show when Mr. Passard entered the dining room. When he reached my table and asked where I was from (\"Ah, New York! I have never been there.\"), he seemed to have springs in his shoes as he bounced lightly on his toes like a bandleader. He looked free. 84, rue de Varenne, Seventh Arrondissement, Paris; 011-33-1-47-05-09-06; www.alain-passard.com .

Glossy and dark, it looked, if you had a suggestible turn of mind, something like the barrel of a snub-nose revolver, with a metallic sheen it got from its seaweed wrapper, a rare blend of green and black kelp. The gunpowder was inside: an extra-hot, nostril-punishing slug of wasabi implanted alongside strands of sweet squash, waiting to go off when I bit into it. The maker of this nifty loaded firearm is Toshio Tomita, the chef and owner of Cagen, which opened last summer in the East Village. Mr. Tomita worked for 16 years for Nobu Matsuhisa , and he has his mentor's ability to bend Japanese tradition in his own directions. If you've tasted the shiso chimichurri at Nobu , you won't be surprised to hear that Mr. Tomita serves it with sashimi at Cagen, but this is his own version, made not just with shiso but also with wild Japanese wild ginger, yuzu juice and more than a little jalape\u00f1o. Next to it is a dish of soy cooked with mirin, but it was the chimichurri I kept coming back to, basting it on pliant slices of skipjack, sea robin or suzuki, the Japanese sea bass. One minute Mr. Tomita will do the unadorned, noninterventionist thing you expect from a Japanese chef. His ingredients, especially the fish he brings in from Japan, are often exceptional. Three broiled fillets of ayu, a Japanese trout, wore nothing but their shimmering skins, the better to show off their delicate freshwater taste. The next he will throw a curve. A plate of small appetizers offered ham deep-fried katsu style with a splotch of Worcestershire on its panko crust, along with a single mouthful of the Nobu classic, miso-marinated black cod, as irresistible as ever. But then there were two little flavor bombs of grape tomato halves barely cooked in white wine and yuzu. Were they pickles or candied fruit, or both? Either way, I wanted more. And what was inside this little paper parcel secured with a twist-tie? A pea-size speck of goat cheese, white chocolate and wasabi. It tasted like an after-dinner mint from another planet. Cagen inhabits the empty shell left behind by Kajitsu when it moved to Midtown . Kajitsu specializes in the vegan cuisine of Japan's Zen temples, and the two basement-level dining rooms of the East Village original had a monastic severity; the walls were coated with sand from Kyoto, and everything else followed that color scheme. Mr. Tomita appears to have moved in and gotten right down to work, without putting too much energy into redecorating. Time has not brightened the interior's subterranean charms, which could use a fresh coat of good cheer. You notice this more at the tables than you do at the counter, where Mr. Tomita's samurai intensity supplies extra atmosphere. Cagen is a kappo ryori restaurant, in which the chef prepares most of the food facing the diners across a counter. (Mr. Tomita's son, Rei, works on hot dishes out of sight in the kitchen.) You can pick a path across the \u00e0 la carte menu or just free-fall with a seven-course, $120 omakase meal. It's a question of budget and time, but the big splurge shows off all the things Cagen does very well: sashimi with that nervy chimichurri, sushi wrapped in grilled seaweed that crackles like autumn leaves, and zaru soba, served as three small ponytail bunches of cool soba noodles. The first is plain, the next is dusted with yuzu peel, the last is freckled with kuro shichimi, the black seven-spice blend. They all get dunked in a soy dipping sauce. When they're gone, you get a pitcher of the hot, cloudy water they were cooked in, for pouring into the dipping sauce. Good as this fancy Cup-a-Soup was, I always wished I had more of the firm, nutty noodles. Then I would look over the counter at the two matching stones that grind each day's soba flour out of whole buckwheat. Each stone is the size of a birdbath and they are powered by hand -- Mr. Tomita's hands. The thought of all that labor was the only thing that stopped me from asking for seconds. *** Given the rate at which Michael White's Altamarea Group spits out restaurants these days, this column has adopted a new policy. The amount of time spent critiquing each Altamarea place will be proportional to the time Altamarea spent coming up with the idea. This review of Ristorante Morini, open since December, will be brief. The name, a tribute to Mr. White's mentor in the kitchen, has been used before, at Osteria Morini , which this new restaurant doesn't resemble in any way. The downtown osteria serves the fun, lusty food of Emilia-Romagna, while the ristorante, on the Upper East Side, is not defined by Italian geography or, really, much of anything. The website promises \"pan-Italian regional cuisine with a menu that covers various seasonal specialties, both inland and coastal.\" Well, that narrows it down. The menu is most similar to that at Mr. White's Marea , and while seafood isn't the only choice, in my experience it tended to outshine other options, like the fine but slightly dull sage-roasted chicken or short rib braised in red wine. Main courses were mostly memorable for their prices, which start at $35 and inflate from there. But dull dishes are rare. Gordon Finn, the executive chef, is turning out the most carefully prepared and well-considered food that the Altamarea Group has given New York since Ai Fiori opened in 2010. You should get an excellent meal if you stick to the cured and raw crudi, like the wonderful bay scallops with bits of pink grapefruit and dots of pistachio pur\u00e9e; the pastas, which are as good as they are at any Michael White restaurant, which is to say they are as good as at any place in the city; and dessert, overseen by Altamarea's corporate pastry chef, Robert Truitt. What you won't get is a solid argument for going there and not to another Altamarea subsidiary. If you want refined, expensive seafood, you can get it in much more attractive surroundings at Marea. Inside Ristorante Morini's split-level space, the chandeliers look like grotesque experiments in stretched skin, and the artwork is the type that speaks eloquently of corporate tax write-offs. Ristorante Morini hasn't bestirred itself to become a unique destination; it seems to want nothing more than a piece of the action in a neighborhood whose residents proved long ago that they don't mind overpaying for pasta.

After a friend and I had finished a small opening snack, the server brought our appetizers and main courses. At the same time. It's impossible to imagine any kitchen, even the most tragically inept one, making the same mistake five years ago. This was a pure symptom of the current small-plates epidemic. The old two-course menu has broken down so badly that some restaurants feel no obligation to send dishes out in any particular sequence, even if diners clearly order appetizers and mains, as we did. Until we work out some protocols for small-plate dining, the way cultures like Spain's have done, we're going to be eating on a lawless, fast-changing frontier. Sometimes innovative restaurants like Recette or Pearl & Ash come swirling out of the chaos. At other times it coughs up half-formed and unconvincing places like Telepan Local. It's easy to imagine what Bill Telepan was thinking. Since 2005 he has done all his sensible, seasonal, ingredients-first cooking in one restaurant, Telepan , on West 69th Street. In a perfect city, Telepan's success would have lured more places of its caliber to the Upper West Side. Instead, the center of gravity of Manhattan's dining scene has migrated steadily downtown, while a looser style has swept in to make even relatively youthful places like Telepan look a bit antediluvian. A small-plates menu in TriBeCa must have seemed like a way for Mr. Telepan to reach diners who couldn't find Columbus Avenue without the aid of an Uber driver. In practice, Telepan Local, which Mr. Telepan opened on Greenwich Street in early January with Joel Javier as chef de cuisine, offers most of the drawbacks of small-plates eating and almost none of the advantages. As at so many of these restaurants, the dishes at Telepan come out whenever, they land wherever, and you have no idea if you're going to get too much food or too little. The meal unfolds, or unravels, on tables built in Nicaragua from dark and white slats of wood approximately cobbled together. They are the size of the ones in cocktail lounges where, in another era, people had manhattans and mixed nuts while waiting to be moved to the dining room. Now, this is dinner: glasses for water, wine and cocktails; blue carafes for carbonated water and clear ones for filtered tap; bottles of wine; plates for eating and plates for serving; and a votive candle, all vying for two or three square feet of real estate. Something's got to give, and it is the silverware, which falls to the floor with surprising frequency. Or maybe it jumps, through some instinct for self-preservation. \"We're a farm-to-table American tapas restaurant,\" my server said one night. \"All the food is small plates that you can share.\" In fact, many plates struck me as too small, even for one. The carrots, tiny and multicolored and al dente, tossed with oregano and bits of feta, come in a dish slightly bigger than a coffee lid. They cost $8, which in many restaurants would get you a side dish two or three times larger. A special of bay scallops with black-trumpet-mushroom pur\u00e9e was delicious, but there were six of them, and three of us. The price was $16. A $12 plate of eggs scrambled with smoked trout and fried bread worked out to about two forkfuls for each of us. These dishes were all sensitively made from great ingredients, but they were all a bit well-mannered for this style of dining. The best small plates cause a clamor. Sharing them provokes tension: Who's getting the last bite? That question came up with the wonderful little grilled cheese panini topped with a Spanish tomato-garlic-olive oil spread. And I could imagine arguing over the sea scallops and diced fried potatoes bathed in warm olive oil and spicy Aleppo pepper. But far more often, after a bite of, say, soft cauliflower in Cheddar sauce, or a mini-pizza with fried calamari over tomato sauce, or corned tongue with charred cabbage (really good) and Russian dressing (not quite as good), I would nod happily, and move on to the next thing. A single taste of some plates was too much. With its shrimp poppers -- peculiarly bland fried shrimp stuffed with peculiarly bland crab and fish mousse -- Telepan Local seemed to be trying to imitate Red Lobster and not quite succeeding. Fried watercress with cashews and chile sauce was an obvious homage to a Thai dish, yet it lacked the rippling energy of lime juice and fish sauce that any number of restaurants in Queens would have given it. Telepan Local's pigs in blankets, however, perfectly mimicked everybody else's pigs in blankets. Some of the best small-plates restaurants are glorified bars; picture tapas joints in Barcelona or izakayas in Tokyo or wine bars in Paris. Telepan Local looks at first as if it might fit the bill, with its long line of white barstools in an aggressively mirrored corridor up front. And the wine list is intriguing and affordable. But I had a hard time finding anybody who knew the bottles; one night my server couldn't tell me about any of the three Greek whites except the one poured by the glass. The cocktail list comes on strong, too. Most of the spirits are distilled locally; bitters are made on site. And I was surprised by the low-key sophistication of the Mai O Mai, a pineapple juice and rum concoction. The rest were too sweet, except for a gin and tonic that was too flat and a martini variant, the Jabberwocky, that was too warm. I had one of the worst desserts of the year at Telepan Local, a galette of underripe, undercooked pears on a gummy, doughy crust. I also had one of the best. Larissa Raphael, who pulls double duty as pastry chef here and at Telepan, has come up with a champion recipe for coconut cake that is rich like poundcake but lighter -- poundcake that could fly. Maybe it can fly right out of this small-plates version of Telepan Local and into one that makes sense, not an American tapas restaurant but simply an American neighborhood restaurant. Some of the understated cooking that gets lost when it's shared by the whole table might, in more generous portions, make lovely appetizers or main courses for one.

Mr. Chang's unpredictable appearances in the kitchen are at least as famous as his Sichuan-style dry-fried eggplant. He used to have a habit of quitting any restaurant where his food had attracted a fanatical following or, worse, a good review. This, of course, made his followers all the more fanatical. He hopscotched around Chinese restaurants in Virginia, turned up at several in Georgia and was briefly sighted in Virginia again before surfacing in Tennessee for a minute or two. He must be the only chef in America whose Wikipedia entry contains a section called \"Disappearances and movement.\" The current, stable period of his career began when he struck up a business partnership with Gen Lee, a Chinese chef in semiretirement. Three years ago, they opened Peter Chang China Grill in Charlottesville, Va. An owner at last, Mr. Chang did not quit this time. Not that he stayed put, exactly. He and Mr. Lee quickly began colonizing the rest of the state, planting Peter Chang restaurants in Fredericksburg, Williamsburg, Virginia Beach and here. They hope to open one in Fairfax, outside Washington, later this year. Now, instead of worrying that Mr. Chang's menu will disappear overnight, his admirers play a different kind of shell game. On any given day he will probably be cooking in a Peter Chang restaurant, but which one? Before coming to Virginia with a plan to eat at three of his places in 24 hours, I asked one of my operatives in the state to gather intelligence from a source inside Chang headquarters. \"The betting on Chef's whereabouts -- and he generally informs no one of where he intends to pop up -- is Monday-Tuesday in Virginia Beach, Wednesday-Thursday in Richmond, and Friday-Saturday in Fredericksburg,\" my informant wrote. \"I'm assuming it's subject to change on a whim.\" In fact, when I got to Virginia Beach that Monday, I learned that Mr. Chang was in Fredericksburg. But the night before in Short Pump, where I hadn't expected to spot him at all, he was lingering casually by the front door. At some point, he slipped into the kitchen. Scallion pancakes led off. These were not the flaky pancakes I knew, though. They were air-filled puffs, as round and light as a beach ball. I tore off a patch, dipped them into a dish of warm curried broth, and wondered how the puffs still kept their shape. A minute later there were spring rolls, green leaves of cilantro showing through the wrappers, with an airy filling of flaky ginger-seasoned flounder. It sounds too simple to be as delicious as it was. Then we were given a piece of woven cane, the kind used for chair seats, bent into a cone and pinned with a skewer. Inside were chunks of crisp, nearly greaseless fried flounder tossed with a small salad of cilantro sprigs, sweet onions, dried chiles and cumin. Cilantro, chiles and cumin appeared again with dry-fried eggplant, float-away sticks that made me think of eggplant marshmallow. There were Sichuan standards, too: spicy dan dan noodles with an expertly gauged sweet-sour ratio and a numbing blast of Sichuan peppercorns; outstandingly crisp and tender twice-cooked pork; beef with tofu-skin noodles lightly scored on one side to catch the searing chile oil; and, to tamp down the fires, cooling chunks of firm raw cucumber dressed with garlic. This was Chinese cooking with true finesse. The muscular Sichuan dishes were unusually well balanced, while the charm of some others was arrived at through subtle and delicate means. The United States has any number of very skilled Chinese cooks. It has far fewer who put their skills in the service of the imaginative leaps we expect from major chefs. By the end of my dinner in Short Pump, I had no doubts that Mr. Chang is one of them. At one time, talent like Mr. Chang's was not so rare in this country. After the Communist takeover of mainland China in 1949, many of the country's top chefs fled. After the federal Immigration Act of 1965, a number of them moved to New York, which was exposed for the first time to extraordinary Sichuanese and Hunanese cooking. In 1971, Raymond A. Sokolov wrote in The New York Times that \"Chinese chefs have emerged as figures of the same importance as French chefs.\" The most famous of all was probably Tsung Ting Wang , the chef of Shun Lee Dynasty on Second Avenue in Midtown. Ed Schoenfeld, the operating partner of the two RedFarm restaurants in Manhattan, began his career in Chinese restaurants during that era. He recalls T. T. Wang as \"world class, a Ferran Adri\u00e0. Just an incredibly great chef.\" \"I met a group of people like that,\" Mr. Schoenfeld said. \"When they died, I didn't come across any others.\" The profession of chef nearly vanished from mainland China, and with it the apprenticeship system through which highly trained chefs passed on what they knew. Peter Chang was born in 1963 in a poor village (\"not even a village\" Mr. Lee said) in Hubei Province, next door to Sichuan. By the time he was a teenager, China had begun to value its cooking traditions again, and he was sent to culinary school in Hubei. He worked in hotels and on cruise ships on the Yangtze River, where the woman he would later marry, Lisa Chang, was his supervisor. In 2000, after auditioning for the government, he was dispatched to Washington as chef of the Chinese Embassy. After two years, he left that job and began his suburban wanderings, as chronicled by Calvin Trillin in a 2010 New Yorker article . The restaurants where he alighted were as unlikely as the ones where he has now settled down, in his restless way. He has a special affinity for strip malls in cities that are not particularly known for the vibrancy of their Chinese restaurants. When he opens a new place, local newspapers tend to tell readers that it is not affiliated with P. F. Chang's . Sean Brock, the chef of McCrady's in Charleston, S.C., and the Husk restaurants in Charleston and Nashville, estimated that he had eaten about 15 meals in Mr. Chang's restaurants, and said that each time, \"I feel like I'm sitting in a roomful of people who don't know how lucky they are. He's got legions of fans, but you can tell that not everybody in the dining room knows where they're sitting.\" Peter Chang's servers, most of whom look like local college students, do not push too hard when they inform customers that the kitchen makes familiar dishes like General Tso's chicken along with more adventurous, chile-laden items. Pointing to the list of cold Sichuan appetizers, one explained: \"They tend to be a little more out of the box. I like a lot of them, but that's just me. The other menu has some more Americanized dishes. It's not as weird as the other stuff.\" In Williamsburg, before I could eat pigs' feet stir-fried with dried chiles and Sichuan peppercorns, I had to overcome my server's gentle concern. As I had hoped, the feet were fantastic. The Sichuan hot-and-numbing effect put an electric charge in the sticky, crunchy bits of skin, but the spice never overpowered the deeply flavored pork. Tea-smoked duck stir-fried with sticks of ginger, another high point of that meal, was more restrained, but just as flavorful. A couple of other dishes there did not have the same sharp focus. That was true in Virginia Beach, too, where I ate crispy pork belly that looked like the great bamboo shrimp I'd had in Short Pump but didn't have nearly the same impact. Other dishes, though, were remarkable. Cold cucumber with garlic and cilantro outraced the Short Pump version; noodle soup with brisket seemed to get better as the meal went on; and a kind of pan-fried ravioli called Golden Marble, filled with soft tofu seasoned with shrimp and cilantro, was a subtle knockout. Virginia Beach also had a dim sum menu devised by Mr. Chang's wife. I would return just to find out whether it is all as delicious as the domed, pan-fried bun stuffed with lightly sweetened pork I tried. The fans who say that the best Peter Chang restaurant is the one where Mr. Chang is cooking may be on to something. The best of my three meals, start to finish, was the one in Short Pump. But the others still offered cooking of unusual power and subtlety, and introduced me to dishes I'll remember for a long time. In fact, I could make a strong case that the best Peter Chang restaurant is the nearest one, as long as you order so many things that the server starts to act as if you might be insane. And then eat until you think you can't hold any more. For that, Mr. Brock has developed a strategy: \"You run outside, you go to the parking lot, you run around, you go to the bathroom, you splash cold water on your face until you can eat again.\" When that stops working, he said, he orders it all again, to take home.

That is all. Thank you for your time. On second thought, there may be a little more to say. Because great restaurants can fade fast, especially these days, and Jean-Georges Vongerichten's serene flagship serves a city vastly different from the one it set out to dazzle and seduce 17 years ago last month. Back then, Jean-Georges was a radical reimagining of the grand style of French dining, \"an entirely new kind of four-star restaurant,\" as Ruth Reichl put it in her review for The New York Times. Jean-Georges didn't just blow the dust off the candelabra; it tossed them out. In a room that was all right angles and Manhattan energy, men and women servers (a rarity in formal restaurants then) circulated with unfussy, level, American poise. Most of all there was the brilliant cooking, which was lighter, brighter and more embracing of other cultures than French food had any right to be. What we want from restaurants is changing, though, along with our notions of luxury. The kind of comfort Jean-Georges excels at providing makes some diners distinctly uncomfortable. Chefs who couldn't peel a banana when Jean-Georges Vongerichten got his first four-star review ( for Lafayette , in 1988) now run adventurous, unluxurious dining rooms where people come for the journey and where the thrill of the ride is more important than the condition of the shock absorbers. Jean-Georges glides like a Mercedes sedan, but Mr. Vongerichten takes the curves like a Formula One driver. Consider the squab dish that just popped up on the menu. It comes on like jerk chicken, coated in a blackened rub, and while the seasonings are Middle Eastern, the searing heat is almost Jamaican. And here comes the creative leap that separates Mr. Vongerichten from other spice-peddlers: a hot sauce has been splashed around this charred squab, and it is made from flowers. A bright-orange blend of lime, fresh red chiles and peppery nasturtium petals, it makes the already fiery squab into what may be the spiciest dish ever served in a French restaurant. Over and over, Mr. Vongerichten takes risks that are almost shocking. A little canal dredged into a pool of sweet parsnip pur\u00e9e is filled with a fruity riesling raisin vinegar, straight up. Taste it alone and you pucker, but swirl it into the parsnips with a forkful of meltingly soft Arctic char under an airy black-truffle crust, and it's spectacular. In the same vein, the buttermilk sauce under red sea bream sashimi or the unsweetened lemon mousse with raw sea trout and roe are almost acidic enough on their own to clean copper pots. Taste a little of everything, though, and the sourness takes its place and galvanizes the rest. There's not much sleight-of-hand in Mr. Vongerichten's cooking. Nearly everything is visible, and the effects can still take you by surprise. Won tons stuffed with grilled foie gras are squirted, somewhat randomly, with a spiced red-wine reduction, but what makes the dish take off are the tart, crunchy passion-fruit seeds and the raw papaya chunks livened up with a dab of lime gel. This skill for getting the greatest impact from just a few components is Mr. Vongerichten's foremost talent. Most of the time, you couldn't take something away from one of his dishes without hurting the whole. This is why so many of his classics still jump with energy; they're not dragged down by pointless ornamentation. Was the sweet sea urchin with slivers of green chile and drops of yuzu on a tongue of black bread invented last week, or last century? What about that intensely aromatic lobster sauce seasoned with fenugreek and lemon grass that surrounds lobster on toast? Or the chicken with the Parmesan crust that stays crunchy for an improbably long time, even after crumbs have fallen into the lemon-butter sauce that has more lemon and more balance than ought to be possible? If you are having your first $118 four-course dinner at Jean-Georges, you won't always know. Regulars will, though. And they may start to wonder, along with me, how many of Mr. Vongerichten's new dishes are as indelible as his greatest hits? I couldn't imagine improving on any of the six savory dishes I enjoyed on a $198 tasting menu of classics. They had all snapped into place for good. The only dish on a spring tasting (same night, same length, same price) that I could pay the same compliment to were the stout asparagus stalks under morels in hollandaise, and I recall people rhapsodizing about them in 1997. This could become a danger to Jean-Georges's pre-eminence. Mr. Vongerichten and his business partner, Phil Suarez, run a company that is responsible for 22 restaurants around the world. Diners tend to worry about this empire-building in terms of quality control: Does the food suffer when the head of state is traveling? It can, even at Jean-Georges. At a recent lunch while Mr. Vongerichten was in Japan, a salmon tartare spring roll, one of the three little bites that opened the meal, wasn't crisp enough to stand up to its lettuce wrap, and the fish was barely seasoned. Gulf shrimp in an appetizer were overpowered by the heavily toasted flavors of fried artichokes and mushrooms, and a lemon-fennel aioli lacked the verve to pull it all together. These were blips, though, well within the standard deviation for one of New York's most daring and high-performing kitchens. In the long run, the greater question is whether Mr. Vongerichten is channeling more of his creativity into building new restaurants than into building dishes that might run 10 years from now on the classics menu at Jean-Georges. Because each dessert is made of several mini-desserts that riff on a single theme, it's hard to tell whether any of them has the staying power of the molten chocolate cake. (It has a permanent spot on the chocolate-themed dessert, and remains better than its imitators.) But as constructed by the pastry chef, Joseph Murphy , almost all of them are deeply, instantly lovable. For anyone feeling left behind by the current fashion for scattershot, disputatious desserts, Mr. Murphy's citrus tasting -- with its tiny, crisp strudel filled with candied kumquats and pistachios, and its plush, delicately floral citron snow and citrus sections over amber riesling jelly -- is an answered prayer. The wine list is book-length. But it is unusually nimble, built for versatility. The chief sommelier, Laura Williamson , has a bottle up her sleeve for any trick the kitchen might pull. Listening to her or one of her colleagues suggest a wine can be a quick, thoughtful education in the principles of pairing. The rest of the dining room staff has the original poise and unfawning attentiveness, but servers can seem remote. Smiles bloom beside some tables, but not all. Lately some top-tier restaurants have invented a new style of service that is seamless, intuitive, guided by a species of emotional intelligence. Jean-Georges hasn't quite evolved. Examples are so minor that they may sound petty, but here's one. A guest of mine approached the reception desk, a sci-fi podium populated by a row of three or four humans with unnervingly perfect teeth, at the same time as two other diners. A host tried to pair them off: \"Are you two together?\" Um, no. Another attempt was made: \"Are you two together?\" Unless Mr. Vongerichten is trying to run a matchmaking service, there are smoother ways to begin. The game can always be played at a higher level. That is the challenge for any restaurant that wants to shine among the striving competition. And Jean-Georges does shine. The restaurant was redesigned in graceful, gentle curves by the architect Thomas Juul-Hansen in 2008 (two years after Frank Bruni's four-star review, its last evaluation in The Times) and is the most elegant modern dining room in the city. The enormous windows let in the setting sun, and sometimes they catch the moon rising over the treetops in Central Park. You are in the city and hovering slightly outside it all at once. Then the food arrives, the flavors fall into their startling alignments, and there is only one place you could be: Jean-Georges.

A Williams College graduate, she remembered its earlier incarnation as the school's alumni club. \"I practically lived here at one point,\" she said, looking over her shoulder at the stuffed peacock stashed in one corner. \"I took almost all my meals here.\" How was the food? \"Ghastly.\" By the end of the night, she announced it is much better now. For that, she can thank her fellow alumni for selling the building on East 39th Street to a developer who turned it into a boutique hotel. Called the William , it opened before Christmas with two upholstered cocktail lounges and two distinct places to eat reformed English cooking. We were upstairs in the Peacock , a civilized, grown-up restaurant where Ray Charles shimmies from the speakers and the wine list is refreshingly nondenominational. One floor below, in the English basement (what other kind would an English restaurant use?) is the Shakespeare , a rustic pub with a rock soundtrack, soccer on both televisions and taps for British lagers and cask ales. The two spots share a kitchen, a chef named Robert Aikens and just enough dishes to justify corralling them into a single review. The food I ate during two dinners at the Peacock and one at the Shakespeare was always appealing; the settings were somewhat less so. This was particularly true in the Shakespeare, where in the early evening packs of beer drinkers can crowd out those of us who are there to find out if the shepherd's pie made by Mr. Aikens is better than the mound of ruined groceries that went by the same name in our mothers' kitchens. It is, by leaps and bounds. The potato crust, golden with sharp Cheddar cheese, blanketed a lamb stew, thickly spiced with thyme and rosemary. All winter, I had hoped something would push back at my interior polar vortex. This cast-iron pot of ground meat buried under mashed potatoes finally did. Other pub standards at the Shakespeare were true to form, like the highly credible bangers and mash and the fish and chips, with a light sheath of custardy batter around a hunk of very fresh cod. The Scotch eggs, molten at the yolk and wrapped in juicy, salty sausage before being plunged into the fryer, were good enough to eat by the dozen, although I would be round as an egg if I had tried. I was annoyed, though, when the $16 \"pint of prawns\" turned out to be a pint glass of ice cubes holding up five nearly flavorless boiled shrimp. The Shakespeare needs to do better than that if it wants customers to put the emphasis on the first word of \"gastro pub.\" Right now, it lands firmly on the second. The Shakespeare's two rooms have low timbered ceilings, and the one with the bar, where I sat, has two TVs bigger than some movie screens. I couldn't make out much beyond that because the place was crammed with after-work warriors there for the drinks, not the food. I couldn't hear much, either. But I did feel something: the creeping damp chill of a full pint of beer that someone, in the crush of bodies, had knocked over on me. A champion drink spiller myself, I wasn't upset. My soaked jeans did undercut the warming effect of the shepherd's pie, though. If I had wanted to get out of those wet clothes and into a dry martini, one of the two cocktail dens at the top of the stairs would have been the place to do it. The armchairs are plush, the paneling is polished, the fireplaces are burning (with gas, but still) and the bartenders don't smirk as they mix cocktails as well structured as a Savile Row suit. The William has given Midtown the hotel bar that I've always wanted out of the Algonquin. The fireplaces came with the building. The plush and polish were supplied by Reid & Taylor Studios, which also designed the Peacock's two contrasting dining rooms. One has the flickering allure of the cocktail dens up front, along with emerald wallpaper in a peacock pattern. I wanted to eat below those peacocks. Apparently so did everyone else, because there were never any free tables. Instead, I was seated in what's called the Garden Room. Bright and oddly underdecorated, it is probably a better place for lunch than for the nocturnal consumption of meat pies. Mr. Aikens, a veteran of Le Gavroche in London, has done the gastro-pub thing before, as chef of the Dandelion in Philadelphia. He is far from a flashy cook. He just believes in doing things the right way, which often means the hard way. As our server put it, \"The simpler the dish, the more complicated he makes it.\" For gammon steak, which in most parts of England would mean a slice of ham on a plate, canned pineapple optional, he starts from scratch. The ham is pork loin, brined in the kitchen, then grilled, as is the slab of fresh pineapple. Potato pur\u00e9e below, a sunny-side egg on top. I can't imagine finding a better gammon steak in England. Details elevate dishes like an honest chicken soup, or grilled Spanish mackerel on toast: the velvety, chardlike softness of the wilted spinach; the sweet-tart tension of the sherry vinaigrette; the crisp snap of the bacon. Roasted chicken came with a terrific plank of fresh pork-and-sage sausage and a run of gravy that neatly managed to taste rich but not oily. I appreciated the robust and musky spices and the fluffy grains of biriyani rice with a lamb curry straight from the kitchens of the Raj. The desserts are staunchly English and tended by Mr. Aikens himself. In another restaurant, this might relegate them to stepchild status, but not here. Mr. Aikens lavishes care on them, not to mention historical research and generous amounts of cream, eggs and butter. The result is a roster of sweets as deeply gratifying as any I've spooned my way through in the past year. One night, Mrs. Beeton's Snow Egg appeared on the Shakespeare's blackboard. The dish, a version of the French oeufs \u00e0 la neige, comes from Isabella Beeton's 1861 manual on household management. In Mr. Aikens's hands, the meringue egg, rising from a sea of warm custard like steam from a hot bathtub, was studded with cracked pralines and decorated with kumquats in syrup. English cooks can work a hundred variations on the same idea, so another night brought a bowl of custard mixed with brioche crumbs below dime-size domes of meringue, melting and soft like marshmallows on a stick. Sandwiched in the middle was warm, fresh raspberry jam. It goes by the name the Queen of puddings, and asking for it is almost as good as eating it.

All'onda is the name, and in truth it's not quite like any other place, although it's not as far-out as the elevator pitch makes it sound, either. The space glows with warm invitation to passers-by on East 13th Street, who can see the communal table and bar downstairs and, through second-story windows, the main dining room. Inside, there are no terrifying beasts with Japanese heads grafted onto Italian torsos, no teriyaki calf's liver or soba pesto. There is nothing terrifying at all. Chris Jaeckle's cooking at All'onda is recognizably and elegantly Italian, and for the most part it's wonderful stuff. Mr. Jaeckle is a sophisticated chef whose marriage of Ligurian and French-Mediterannean cooking at Ai Fiori , under the guidance of Michael White, helped the restaurant win three stars from The New York Times in 2011. At All'onda, he has teamed up with the restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow. The relationship between the two cuisines at All'onda is less a marriage than an infatuation. It's as if an Italian menu had a raging crush on Japan and couldn't stop bringing it up in conversation. Most of this is done so smoothly, you hardly notice. Black truffle risotto, slick with Parmesan and butter, would strike you as old school if you didn't know that Mr. Jaeckle finishes it with the rice mash left over when sake is fermented. The Japanese ingredient adds a rounded, softly fruity flavor that quietly works its way into the risotto. Far more prominent are the flecks of winter truffles, whose aroma, part onion and part animal, goes directly from your nostrils to your brain. Long quills of garganelli are tossed with chunks of sweet crab and toasted bread crumbs. It's all very classic, as is the warm spiciness that lifts up the pasta. But the source of the spice is yuzu kosho, the Japanese condiment fermented from yuzu peel and a weaponized dose of chiles. The way Mr. Jaeckle uses it, though, nearly convinced me that yuzu kosho should be sold at Eataly . As usual with crushes, the object of affection occasionally comes up in a context so strained you have to roll your eyes. All'onda's winning dark chocolate tart grew menacing when it came with a salty scoop of soy gelato. And the most regrettable dish I ate was an ill-advised twist on tortellini in brodo, in which the pasta parcels stuffed with unmelted cheese sat in a gelatinous, lukewarm and indistinct stock made from Parmesan and dashi. Other slight misfires can't be blamed on Japan. The aged-duck rag\u00f9 with bent tubes of pasta called lumache simply needed more depth, as if the soffritto had not been caramelized enough, and the very dark chocolate in the rag\u00f9 and around the rim of the plate didn't cover the deficit. For the most part, though, good sense and good taste prevail. All'onda just opened in early January, and already Mr. Jaeckle has come up with two dishes so appealing that he will have a fight on his hands if he tries to take them off the menu. First, there is the bucatini with sea urchin. Sea urchin pasta is so popular now, it will probably turn up on the menu at the Olive Garden before the year is over, but Mr. Jaeckle has done something novel and delicious with it. The urchin is cold-smoked, which makes it something like briny bacon and, when folded into egg yolks, cream and garlic, makes the rest of the dish something like spaghetti carbonara from the deep. The first time I had it, the bucatini were too soft and doughy, but the next time they had the proper snap to offset their creamy sauce. And there is the short rib for two. The side dish of saffron risotto calls osso buco to mind, but this is not another brown, sticky braise. It's cooked sous vide for three days until the meat is glistening pink-red with veins of rich fat inside, then grilled to give it a spicy black crust. It looks like pastrami, and I can't get it out of my mind. As has been widely reported, New York law now requires raw seafood appetizers in all Italian restaurants. The ones here are generally very good, like hamachi in a soy sauce bath with strands of pickled kuri squash and tiny cubes of peperoncini. Among the main courses there is not one that isn't well thought out, from the skate under a veal glaze to the guinea hen, separated into a roasted breast and confitted leg beneath a naturally sweet pur\u00e9e of parsnips. Like many new restaurants, All'onda isn't strong across the board. Service can be rushed and not exactly polished, and I can't say the soy gelato was the only disappointing so-called sweet. Affogato is no treat when the espresso tastes charred and the ice cream has big ice crystals. Panna cotta flavored with Fernet-Branca is an oddity that would be easier to bear if it were a palate cleanser before a real dessert arrives. Until All'onda gets the rest of its lineup in shape, the dense and lightly crunchy olive oil cake is your best hope. Despite the risks, All'onda is fun and lively enough that I can imagine dropping in once a month or so for a short-rib reunion. This is late-period Chodorow, with the nightclub grandiosity stripped away. The dining room staff looks almost ostentatiously casual -- none more than Chris Cannon. New Yorkers who remember Mr. Cannon in a stiffly knotted necktie standing at attention behind the host stands at Marea , Convivio , Alto or Palio won't recognize him here, where he works as a consultant. He lopes beneath the exposed rafters outfitted in jeans, a plaid shirt, a quilted vest and a backward wool cap. With a dead rabbit or two over his shoulder, he'd look like an Italian winemaker coming back from a hunting trip. If he lopes to your table, get him started about wine. He knows who makes the good stuff in Italy, and laid the foundation for the wine list before Nathan Rawlinson took it over. The list doesn't trawl for big spenders the way some of Mr. Cannon's others have, but many of the bottles taste more expensive than they are. Especially impressive is the carefully edited selection of affordable nebbiolos and the range of 40 sparkling wines, which makes welcome detours beyond prosecco. There's a bit of sake, too, as there is in all the best Japanese-Venetian places.

Now David Chang has. At M\u00e1 P\u00eache , his sunken restaurant at the bottom of the Chambers Hotel in Midtown, the long cross-shaped table that used to bisect the dining room is gone to make room for the carts. Apart from a few dishes that Paul Carmichael's kitchen will prepare to order, like the fried chicken, most of the menu will eventually show up if you wait long enough. \"These are David Chang's pork buns,\" a server says, wheeling by with stacks of bamboo steamers. A minute later comes a portable raw bar, and I say yes to chilled lobster knuckles dipped in a lemon-grass butter that the server just swirled together. Bringing Europe to Asia, some of the trolleys double as gueridons so meats can be carved and sauces heated at tableside. As uses of dim-sum carts go, it's much more clever than stowing a plate of preshucked oysters on the bottom deck. No doubt they were opened just minutes ago, but as they circle the room, they become as inviting as conveyor-belt sushi. At least the raw-bar cart has a theme. A few minutes later comes a server who's hawking about 10 items: two kinds of fritters, several raw seafood dishes and some salads. I can't keep all the choices straight and take only the shrimp balls, although they are so crunchy and juicy I can't consider that a bad outcome. When the trolleys have less to carry, they can turn ordering a meal into a point-and-shoot adventure. Despite a few misgivings (Wouldn't that roasted lamb taste better straight from the oven?), I enjoyed my dim-sum meal much more than the one I had at M\u00e1 P\u00eache a year and a half ago, when the flavors were less focused and Mr. Carmichael's menu seemed to be struggling to emerge from the primordial soup of Momofuku tropes. In its four-year life, M\u00e1 P\u00eache has skittered from one concept to another. If Mr. Carmichael really commits to dim sum, and gives some thought as to which dishes are flattered by the format and how many to send out at once, M\u00e1 P\u00eache may finally find its identity. Or the trolleys may keep rolling right out the door. M\u00e1 P\u00eache, 15 West 56th Street (Fifth Avenue), 212-757-5878, momofuku.com/new-york/ma-peche/ .

This is meant as praise, and not the damning-with-faint kind. The cult of the new in restaurants has brought us many wonders, but it has also left us with the curse of compulsory creativity. It's no longer enough for chefs to cook hot food that makes us happy; they are supposed to dumbfound us with flavors the human tongue has never tasted. This is why writers like me devote energy to, for example, puzzling postmodern taquerias while taking for granted the simple excellence of traditional ones. The change in restaurant culture is something like the shift that overtook popular music after the Beatles. Singing old Cole Porter tunes was out; suddenly every kid with a guitar and an amplifier was supposed to have the songwriting chops of Lennon and McCartney combined. R\u00f4tisserie Georgette isn't writing any new music. The kitchen, now under Chad Brauze, plays standards from the French songbook and plays them well, with what a colleague who has eaten high and low around the city calls \"a refreshing lack of creativity.\" If this restaurant had a clock, its hands would be stopped at five minutes before nouvelle cuisine, when meat was carved to cover the plate and sauce came on the side and nobody turned down potatoes, when people eating a roast with a good but not-too-expensive Bordeaux could hardly imagine a better night out. You can feel this way at R\u00f4tisserie Georgette, although the joys of time travel end with the Bordeaux. Jean-Luc Le D\u00fb 's list has an affordable 2002 Haut-M\u00e9doc from Ch\u00e2teau Lanessan for $62, but the other red Bordeaux have been adjusted for inflation and then some. R\u00f4tisserie Georgette has a real rotisserie and a real Georgette, both easy to spot. There are two rotisseries, in fact, standing back to back in the open kitchen. The one facing the dining room is a tall steel model with brass trim, loaded up with pudgy chickens, small flocks of stuffed quail, dorade locked in a cage with lemon wheels and thyme branches. There is one Georgette. Her last name is Farkas. A coiled spring of proprietary energy, Ms. Farkas started cooking in restaurants at 15, attended hotel school in Switzerland and interned with Alain Ducasse in Monte Carlo. She was on her way to running a restaurant of her own when Daniel Boulud offered her a job. After she said yes, she learned that she would be handling marketing and public relations. That little gig lasted 17 years, which may be one reason that R\u00f4tisserie Georgette seemed to have traveled from another decade when it landed on East 60th Street last November. The loft-height walls are hung with a cluster of antique mirrors, an Aubusson tapestry and bronze Louis XV-style sconces. Carpeting helps muffle the noise, which tends to wane around 9 p.m. This is an early-to-bed crowd, and with an 8:15 reservation one night I was the last to leave. At one end of the room is a porter's chair, its egg-shaped back upholstered in leather. Now I know where to seat the dowager countess when she comes to visit. In some ways R\u00f4tisserie Georgette is a delayed-gratification version of the restaurants opened in the '70s and '80s by young Americans who fell for European ways of dining. What set Ms. Farkas's heartstrings humming were the rotisseries of France. R\u00f4tisserie Georgette will sell you half a chicken for $24 or a whole one, which feeds two people for $36 each. The economy model, raised on an Amish farm in Indiana, is rubbed with herbes de Provence and cracked coriander seeds. Roasted chickens don't always pick up the flavor of the herbs they're stuffed with. These birds do. The legs are tender without disintegrating into strands, as rotisserie dark meat can do. The white meat is close to ideal, with just a whisker of dryness at the narrow tips. The pricier chicken is called the poule de luxe, French slang for a woman with high upkeep costs. It is brought up in Pennsylvania under Mennonite supervision, hides a terrific mushroom stuffing under its skin, and features a slab of seared foie gras that is both unsatisfying and beside the point. Too bad you can't get the stuffing without paying for the liver, but I'm sure if I were French I'd understand that this is always the way with a poule de luxe. There is nothing fancy about the quail, just juicy meat wrapped around a pale-pink poultry forcemeat seasoned with paprika and piquillo peppers. The dorade, roasted whole and then filleted, breaks into beautiful white lemon-scented chunks. A special one night was rotisserie duck \u00e0 l'orange, carved and arranged on a silver platter. Mr. Brauze had defied the modern rule of duck cookery, taking the breast all the way to medium. He knew what he was doing, because medium-rare meat wouldn't have taken as well to the bittersweet orange-peel sauce. Only once was I served meat that didn't come off the spit at the ideal moment: a crumbly, dried-out lamb shoulder with a merguez stuffing that tasted as if it had been left out in the rain. With any main course, the fat-basted rotisserie potatoes are almost required, although the frites, fried to a mahogany crisp, will also do. But a strict meat-and-potatoes diet can be supplemented by creamed spinach with garam masala, tiny and fiery-hot brussels sprouts and purple cabbage stewed with cider and bacon. I'd be surprised if the vegetables at Ms. Farkas's long-ago French rotisseries were worth noticing, but these are. Ms. Farkas put her first initial on the better of two salads, the salade G, with a time-tested mix of endive, pears, blue cheese, bacon and candied walnuts. There is also a salade Francine. If I were Francine, I'd be on the phone with my agent trying to get my name taken off it. Nicole Kaplan, the pastry chef who made her name at Eleven Madison Park and Del Posto , handles the desserts, mostly stock characters from the bistro repertory. The tarte Tatin has been circling the target: the caramel was too scorched one time, not scorched enough the next. But the chocolate souffl\u00e9 hit the bull's-eye, and so did the dark chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me in a coffee mug. Neither was the least bit surprising. That's a compliment, too.

They want to create a style of cooking that New York can call its own. \"This is an incredible food city, but sometimes you can see a lack of identity in the restaurants here, where people want to channel another place, another time,\" Jeremiah Stone, a former sous-chef of Rino in Paris who helped open Isa in New York, told Eater shortly before the restaurant opened in October. \"They want to do modern Thai, Roman, creative French.\" His partner in the kitchen, Fabian von Hauske, who worked in the pastry kitchen of Jean Georges and, briefly, at Faviken in Sweden, pursued the idea. \"I don't think there's that much of a style here,\" he said. \"You go to San Francisco and there is definitely a style there when you go to places like Coi or Commis . I think there should be more of an identity here, something that's contemporary that you can't find anywhere else.\" In most other cities, hatchets would be out for a pair of 20-something chefs who rode into town promising to show everybody how it's done. But not New York. Here we just say, All right, kids, let's see what you've got. What Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have is a personal, understated, modern approach to deeply seasonal cooking. Mr. von Hauske makes the desserts and the bread, which costs an extra $3 and is worth it for the supremely creamy butter alone. Mr. Stone does the rest, but their styles are compatible. I'm not enthusiastic about what strikes me as a Northern European phobia of spices, but I came to admire their restraint with salt and added fat. You can see this approach catching on among other young chefs, some of whose food gets lumped in with the New Nordic movement . A more accurate name for their quiet, naturalistic, drama-averse approach may be mumblecore cuisine. Contra, at the moment, pulls it off with an originality that is sometimes dazzling and always worth following. The monkfish that appeared one recent night was cooked with faultless timing, roasted slowly, with the kind of tender pink center you'd find inside a seared scallop. It shared its chunky earthenware plate with leaves of charred kale, a marmalade of caramelized onions and a fish-sauce foam, but if you are thinking Vietnamese-molecular fusion, forget it. The fish sauce was a complex and milky froth made of monkfish bones and smoked trout, and it was very, very good. This was truly expressive cooking, exploring shades of flavor more watercolor than acrylic. The dish is either changed or gone by now, no doubt, but the impression lasted. And I won't forget Contra's pairing of chicken breast with pickled daikon, toasted sesame seeds and blood sausage. The sausage had been transformed into a swipe of soft, tangy, beet-red paste, dotted with marjoram leaves and tart nubs of dried raspberries. It all came together in a way so unexpected and right that I had to shake my head. New dishes roll onto the tasting menu every few days, and old ones are subject to restless tinkering. (Old, at Contra, means anything that was invented before today.) The first time I ate monkfish there, a mash of raw walnuts and garlic in miso was trying out for the role that was later played, with more depth, by the onion jam. And I liked watching the evolution of a raw scallop dish outfitted with noodle-like ribbons of raw kohlrabi. As wide as seatbelts the first time, they had slimmed down and looked more like fettuccine the next. On the other hand, the dried raspberries had gone from the blood-sausage swoosh the second time I saw the monkfish. I missed them a little. You get the luck of the draw at restaurants that offer only tasting menus, but the format suits Contra's food unusually well. The flavors are subtle, and on first encounter it's a bit like walking out of the daylight and into a candlelit room: you need to adjust. Five courses is enough time to open your eyes (you may get more time than you need on nights when the pace drags). Another advantage of the tasting menu becomes clear when you are served dessert, followed by a second dessert. As you may have guessed, Mr. von Hauske is judicious with sugar and quite comfortable with vegetables. I liked a beets-and-yogurt number more than I did a creamed gianduja studded with tough sunchoke chips that put up more of a fight than I could face at the end of the night. But at least I knew everybody else would be crunching along with me, and I'd already smiled my way through a less-antagonistic dessert, a kind of rebuilt apple crisp, with an oat crumble and whipped oat-infused custard around a cider-like apple granita. This dessert was pure fun and charm, like Mr. von Hauske's partnering of tangerine granita with a smooth popcorn-infused mousse and smashed bits of caramel popcorn. Linda Milagros Violago, who stocked the cellars at Mugaritz in Spain and Geranium in Denmark, has put together a list of bottles from the kind of small winemakers who think of themselves as farmers and avoid modern tricks. The results aren't always what you'd predict; a French cider, she said, had a note of blue cheese, and it did. The list almost forces you to try something unfamiliar, which feels just right for this restaurant. I hope Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske achieve all their goals except the one about creating a shared New York style. The crazy riot of voices chattering in hundreds of accents is the whole point of this crazy, riotous city they have adopted. We don't need other chefs imitating Contra's style. We've got the original now.

When Joshua and Heidy Smookler were serving noodle soup by night inside Bricktown Bagels in Long Island City, Queens, the hours and reservations policy seemed to change week to week. Then the location changed, as the Smooklers began serving guests in their apartment or at other addresses that were disclosed upon making a reservation. On Wednesday morning, Mu Ramen became even more elusive. It stopped serving ramen anywhere at any time. The ramen, when you could still get it, was superb. When I made a list of my favorite bowls of ramen in the city, I put it in first place. Mr. Smookler told Eater that he had received more than 2,000 reservation requests after the list appeared online on Tuesday. But he also began getting offers from people who were suddenly interested in going into the ramen business. He cleared his calendar the next morning, canceling all reservations and putting off new ones until he could talk to these prospective partners. \"I literally got inundated with investment opportunities,\" Mr. Smookler said in a phone interview on Thursday. \"I was trying to meet with all those people, so I had to stop that anyway,\" referring to the existing reservations. A few weeks ago, the Smooklers signed a lease for Mu Ramen's future home, at 1209 Jackson Avenue in Long Island City. They plan to open in July. Mr Smookler said there is a chance he will be ladling out his tonkotsu and miso broths again in the meantime, if he can find a temporary home for Mu, perhaps in another restaurant.

With the first bite of my first course at a new restaurant in Brooklyn called Dover , I knew I'd been missing something else, too. Broiled oysters. Specifically, these were Wellfleet oysters, keeping warm under a lightly toasted blanket of one of those eggy, creamy Gallic sauces. Vaguely old-fashioned, the oysters were just rich enough to feel like an extravagance without bringing on gloomy reflections about the brief duration of our time on earth. It turned out that my winter had been missing more than just broiled oysters. It was missing the style of cooking that they represent. The style is often French in spirit if not in all its particulars. It is both refined and generous, and it responds to the time of year not just in its choice of ingredients but in its instincts for feeding seasonal cravings. It is a style that Dover's chefs, Joseph Ogrodnek and Walker Stern, practice fluently and charmingly. If the rigorously tweezered austerity that is in vogue in the city's kitchens has begun to seem as comforting as an icicle, Dover's cooking will strike you as a sweet relief. Mr. Ogrodnek and Mr. Stern met in culinary school. Their orbits crossed again at Alain Ducasse's satellite in the Essex House , and then in 2011 when they built Battersby, a broom closet of a restaurant on Smith Street. They worked side by side in a space as roomy as the back seat of a Mini Cooper. (Think of them the next time you say you'd do more cooking if your kitchen were bigger.) Since Battersby opened, long waits have been routine , except for diners who are hungry at the stroke of 5:30 p.m. or who reserve for the much-praised tasting menus. At Dover, a few blocks away on the Carroll Gardens end of Court Street, anyone can make a reservation and everyone gets more breathing room. Fifty or so pale bentwood chairs match the bare wood tables set on bare wood floors. The walls are white or brick, and the paint on the paneled wainscoting is the color of modeling clay. It has the elegant severity of a 19th-century parsonage inhabited by a very neat, unmarried New England minister. There is also a bar in one corner, suggesting that the minister enjoys his cocktails. With some 16 choices under the headings Raw (what it sounds like), First (appetizers), Second (seafood main courses) and Third (meat), the menu is more expansive, too. The servers, bright-eyed and polite, may tell you that it is designed for four-course dining, or may suggest three courses instead. As a professional overeater, I will tell you that four followed by dessert is too much. Three is a fun route if you are hungry and curious, and two with dessert is what, in another era, used to pass for a full dinner. Dover's chefs do not cook for hummingbirds. Caviar pie, at $35, is the cocktail-party classic last seen in the ritzier suburbs, a layered dip of chopped egg and thickened cream under the midnight gleam of American paddlefish roe. Mounding some on folded blini or white toast will make at least two people smile as they scheme to get the last spoonful without looking greedy. For an earthier opening, there is a spicy lamb tartare in yogurt sauce brought to the table with a stack of newly grilled pita. Unannounced on the menu, the pita is an example of the care Dover gives to the small details that make a dish. It's one of several warm breads and savory pastries that appear without notice, like the goug\u00e8res filled with fondue, and a skinny loaf of stecca with a smooth white-bean dip. One of the four slots on Dover's menu should be handed over to vegetables, because the chefs handle them very nicely. An appetizer of roasted cauliflower with toasted hazelnuts and raisins built contrasts (sweet and savory, crunchy and soft) so successfully that every bite was different. A $95 seven-course tasting menu brought sunchokes that had been caramelized until they looked like seared scallops. Even the best sunchokes can use a little help, and these got it from tahini and za'atar, along with candied pine nuts that were sweet and airily crunchy, like kids' breakfast cereal. A French grandmother would say Dover's cream-saturated root vegetable gratin was old hat. Then, if she were smart, she'd eat the whole thing. The gratin is served alongside a roasted chicken for two that has been likened to the NoMad's . The comparison is inevitable in that both birds are presented whole to the table, carved in the kitchen, and brought back in two forms (in Dover's case, the breasts with a simple jus and the legs shredded in a lukewarm salad with a hint of truffles). On my scorecard, the NoMad takes the gold medal in both the dark-meat and white-meat events. Dover's gratin is a winner, though. You never get the sense that Mr. Ogrodnek and Mr. Stern are grandstanding. They are cooking to please, whether they are carefully balancing the lemon juice and cream in an artichoke sauce for black sea bass or trying to inject luxury into the buckwheat served with a terrific duck breast that has a filet mignon tenderness. In the colorless trudge of January, carrots and orange sections arrayed around excellent seared scallops were a treat for tired eyes; the melding of carrots and orange in the sauce made a clear appeal to the taste buds, too. The energetic Vietnamese dressing of lime, peanuts, mint and chiles was a welcome break from the wintry mix, too, and from the richness of grilled lamb ribs. Did a long, bittersweet slab of Brooklyn blackout cake need a scoop of beet ice cream? Does anything? Maybe not. But the clean taste of verjuice sorbet was an elegant counterpoint to the buttery tang of a cheesecake mousse served in a jelly jar. That jar was Dover's one nod to Brooklyn's shaggy armies of picklers, and I'm not sure it was meant that way. Mr. Ogrodnek and Mr. Stern don't seem very interested in playing along with the clich\u00e9s about the borough. It's one reason their restaurant stands out. When you're the last one on the block without a tattoo, you become the conspicuous one.

Every corner of the city is churning out affordable hits of deliciousness, and a long wait is often the only obstacle between wanting some and getting some. Even acclaimed chefs are in this game now, making creative cooking more accessible than ever. And if the meal turns out to be less exciting than you had hoped, you've lost only a few hours and a few dollars. The next day will bring some new taste, a Filipino tapas bar or an artisanal spaetzle truck. So while much of the nonconformist Mexican food at Mission Cantina is curiously unsatisfying, the disappointment does not sting the way it would if the prices were higher. The chef is Danny Bowien, who has a deep talent for short-order cooking that takes loopy twists and turns. His first New York restaurant, Mission Chinese Food , bent Sichuan cuisine into strange new shapes. Its kung pao pastrami, which sounds like a parody of modern food trends, is something I crave on a regular basis. (For now, I am out of luck. A family of mice believed it had squatter's rights on the address, and Mr. Bowien, following a Department of Health order, has closed the restaurant until he can evict the unwanted residents.) Starting with Mission Chinese, Mr. Bowien has been committed to keeping his restaurants within reach of the nonrich. This has become all the more admirable as awards and accolades have piled up around his limited-edition sneakers. Mission Cantina, which opened on the Lower East Side around Thanksgiving, charges less than $10 for almost everything on the menu and gives away sparkling water. For those prices, you don't grumble too loudly when a dish fizzles. And while some of the food can be remarkable and original, a surprising number of things do fizzle on this menu, a book of wet matches from a chef who can make sparks shoot from his fingertips. Like April Bloomfield , Dan Kluger and Alex Stupak , Mr. Bowien brings the habits of a modern American chef to Mexican food. When making tacos, he sees the tortilla not as an edible utensil but as an edible plate. Chile vinegar is available if you ask, but otherwise there is no do-it-yourself taco doctoring. Each taco is a composed dish, garnished and sauced in its own way, theoretically complete. The theory was sometimes true in practice. I loved the mushrooms hiding under what looked like a mutant pepperoni wheel but was really a round of shredded Jack cheese browned on the griddle. A white mush of stewed zucchini with fresh oregano was much more appealing than it will ever sound, and a warm gust of Mediterranean ingredients like pine nuts and raisins did wonderful things for small, sweet eggplant. After the skin-rippling heat of Mission Chinese, the calmer spicing at Mission Cantina is a small surprise, though not necessarily a liability. I didn't taste much cumin in cumin lamb, but the meat got by on its own assertive flavor. A hunk of braised pork cheek was soothing and warm under shredded purple cabbage and pickled habaneros. In some tacos, though, the main ingredients faltered. Fermenting the pineapple in tacos al pastor gave it a tingly acidity, but the pork belly beneath it was flabby and flavorless. The shrimp in a mixed marriage with fried beef tripe tasted heavily of iodine. Carnitas had been disassembled into little fragments of cracklings folded into excessively mild pork shoulder. The parts didn't go back together again, like a clock taken apart by a 5-year-old. Underwhelming fillings like these rarely drew much energy from salsas, which tended to fade into the background. A cucumber salad was dressed by a peanut salsa that seemed to be just ground peanuts. It didn't do much for the cucumbers, which had been left in their thick, bitter skins. Some of the best things on the menu are not in taco form. I would run back for the fried chicken wings, dusted with a spice mix that's like a dehydrated mole poblano, down to the sesame seeds and chocolate. Mexican cousins of the magnificent ones from Mission Chinese Food, the wings are one of the few dishes in which Mission Cantina pushes so hard against the original cuisine that it breaks through to the other side. Crunchy, fiery and messy, they are both recognizable and new. There's almost nothing recognizably Mexican about the bowl of supple, tender collards braised in beer above fluffy, creamy masa treated like grits. With an angry orange sluice of hot sauce on top, this masa is Southern, if it's anything, and it's so good I ordered a second bowl while I was still spooning up the first, shaking my head over the profound corn flavor. Consistency was beside the point at Mission Chinese Food, which could have been subtitled Fast, Cheap and Out of Control. None of the dishes there tasted the same way twice, but they always tasted good. That's not the case at Mission Cantina, where little variations from night to night can mean trouble. Deep-fried chicken livers on a tostada spread with pur\u00e9ed white beans were as creamy and sweet as whipped butter one night. On another they were hard, dry, unlovable things, and the pickled chipotles that had made the tostada so exciting the first time were applied stingily. Maybe the kitchen was running low on supplies, because the tacos were missing the white onions that usually lent them a crisp, juicy lift. Later in the meal, a rotisserie chicken, good if not earth moving, came with rice so greasy I put down my fork. The tortillas varied, too, but they have been getting better. A little dense at first, they have started to bloom on the griddle into a low-rise fluffiness. But from the start they have had that deep, fragrant corn flavor that I had admired in the bowl of collards. Mission Cantina makes all its masa from excellent dried field corn kernels, which is not especially complicated but takes time and effort. The work is absolutely worth it, opening up flavors and aromas that are as alluring as they are short-lived. Making masa from scratch is not, to put it mildly, the easiest way to run a Mexican restaurant. If you are running an inexpensive Mexican restaurant on the Lower East Side, it's almost lunatic. And it's awesome. It tastes like a promise from Mr. Bowien that one day everything on the menu will soar to its level.

After that, I sharpened my sales pitch. I told people that we would be inhaling ramen that is famous in Tokyo, and for good reason. I said that we would be drinking beers that were more unusual and delicious than what they were used to, and that for ballast we'd put down a layer of lamb sausage. I noted that we might sit at a tapas bar that in flavor and spirit comes as close to the Spanish ideal as any place in New York. That worked. Once I had convinced them, my guests tended to like everything about this food court, called Gotham West Market , except getting there. It occupies a block of 11th Avenue in the West 40s that lately feels less like Hell's Kitchen than Hell's Freezer. But the inconvenient address is the reason this new eating adventure exists. It was built to lure renters to Gotham West , the 1,238-unit apartment complex above and behind it. As any New York real estate agent can tell you, even buyers who think of themselves as pioneers don't want to mill corn and slaughter hogs like Pa Ingalls. Gotham West's developer tried to answer that objection by bringing forth a troop of places to eat in a spot that had almost none. It is not the only effort to upgrade the food court , long the province of soft pizzas, sludgy stir-fries and swollen cinnamon rolls. A few blocks south, the sprawling Hudson Yards development will have a food hall (the preferred term these days), as will Brookfield Place in Battery Park City. This spring, Crown Heights in Brooklyn will get Berg'n , a beer hall with food from stalwarts of the Brooklyn Flea and Smorgasburg. Anthony Bourdain, meanwhile, has driven his fans into a near frenzy with his plan to bring street food from around the world to Manhattan. With an unusual degree of imagination, Gotham West smartly stakes out a middle ground between the star power that packs Eataly and the hope of discovery that drives small-business proving grounds like Smorgasburg and the Golden Shopping Mall in Flushing, Queens. Somewhere between famous and brand new, at least to New Yorkers, is Ivan Orkin , the American chef who taught himself to make ramen in Tokyo. Manhattan is becoming enmeshed in ramen, but his noodles at Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop stand out from the tangle. Of the traditional ramens, my favorites are the shio, a supercharged chicken soup of phenomenal depth and clarity, and the vegetarian shoyu, darker and heartier, tasting of soy sauce and roasted mushrooms. Both broths were scalding hot, with a fatty richness that made my lips slippery. After the first few mouthfuls of rye noodles, I put down my chopsticks and stared into the white ceramic bowl, trying to see where all that flavor was coming from. If I ever showed up at Slurp Shop in a linen suit, I might forgo slurping and order roasted-garlic mazemen, a more recent style that dresses the noodles in a thick sauce, something like Italian pasta. Or I might eat a rice bowl. The one with smoked whitefish tastes like a Japanese translation of a morning at Russ & Daughters. But I was even more taken by the one topped with tender, soy-rich pork and a smear of salty, sour plum paste. The chef Seamus Mullen is here, too. His tapas bar, El Colmado, expands on the Spanish menu he developed at Tertulia but is set up so it's easier to drop in and graze and drink wines from Catalonia or Bierzo and pretend that 11th Avenue is in Spain. El Colmado feeds the illusion. The cooks are dressed in sky-blue grocers' jackets and dark gray caps, and the counter is propped with jars of squid and cans of piment\u00f3n next to oysters on ice. They are excellent, as is the Serrano ham, which falls from a vintage Berkel slicer in shaggy pink leaves that are meltingly pliable. With the exception of fried artichokes smothered below overdressed arugula, the cooking has a light hand that befits the elemental flavors of Spanish cuisine. Frying is a strength, in croquettes filled with smoked eel, or fried whitebait, their pinpoint black eyes staring up from a swirl of lemon-yellow aioli. Lamb meatballs are a model of the form. So are the gambas al ajillo, red shrimp in a quarter-inch of garlic- and shrimp-infused olive oil that I would drink from a shot glass. The market showed some discernment in electing Caroline Fidanza's Little Chef as a delegate from Brooklyn. Ms. Fidanza helped create the borough's current restaurant aesthetic as the first chef of Diner in Williamsburg, before she downshifted to a smaller shop, Saltie . Little Chef's menu expands a bit on Saltie's, adding soups and spirited juice blends. (I'm a fan of the carrot and fresh turmeric cocktail.) The core mission is the same, though: lavishing care on breakfast and lunch with a modest roster of eggs and sandwiches. Simplicity is luxury in the Ship's Biscuit, a raft of creamy scrambled eggs and ricotta on very fresh focaccia studded with crunchy sea salt. Across the hall, staring down the largely vegetarian pleasures of Little Chef with a meaty gleam in its eye, is the Cannibal. An outpost of the cultish East 29th Street original steered by the chef Francis Derby, this baby Cannibal makes do without a full-fledged kitchen. Sometimes it shows; the brussels sprouts I had tasted like Thanksgiving leftovers. There is a baked Japanese sweet potato that was a wonderful thing to find at the end of a cold walk, but in general charcuterie is the strong suit here, like spicy lamb sausages in natural casings or a surprisingly gentle sausage of juicy rock shrimp with fennel pollen. Even better is the beer fridge, shelved with obscurities that the servers expertly match with your tastes. Some spots are geared for the day-to-day needs of locals. Genuine Roadside is an all-day diner annex designed and run by AvroKO , the design firm that did the rest of the market. I got more of a kick out of the hipster-truck-stop d\u00e9cor, with its shelf of vintage beer cans that includes deep verticals of Schlitz, than I did from an uninspiring pulled pork sandwich or the hard-shell ceviche taco spackled together with guacamole. But if I lived upstairs, I would make an occasional lunch of the fried chicken sandwich. And I would be devoted to the high-end heroes built by the Court Street Grocers Sandwich Shop. Dessert is a weak spot, especially at night. Little Chef, which bakes homey sweets during the day, closes at 6 p.m. Another early closer is the Blue Bottle Coffee kiosk. The baked goods devised by one of its owners, Caitlin Freeman, like crisp almond biscotti with more than a hint of saffron and the excellent, sweet-and-savory shortbreads, taste best between sips of state-of-the-art coffee and espresso. After dark, the best choices are the old-school flan from El Colmado or the s'mores icebox cake from the Cannibal, worth ordering just so you can see the toasted marshmallow slab. Nearly every vendor has counter seating, but servers will run food out to the communal tables and benches in the center of the hall, which is handy if you want ramen and your friends want tapas. The offer is always made with a smile; while the businesses are separately run, they share a common spirit of friendliness. It's as if everybody knows you didn't really want to come to 11th Avenue.

Even she, when naming the cookbook she wrote with Charlotte Druckman, defined her style by what it is not. The title is \"Cooking Without Borders.\" What is remarkable about her food, though, is not exactly the absence of borders but the ease with which she crosses them. Take the stunner of a Spanish mackerel dish that I ate there a few months ago. After marinating in sweetened soy sauce, the fish is blistered under a hot salamander, flesh side down, until the skin is crunchy with a bittersweet char. This is not far off from the way a Japanese cook may handle mackerel, but Ms. Lo's passport will be stamped a few more times before she's done. In Hong Kong, she will pick up some fried milk , golden battered globes of squishy-soft pudding made from condensed milk. The oily mackerel could demolish the meek taste of milk with one flick of its fin, so she builds in depth by blending the pudding with mellow roasted garlic and, after a quick shopping run to Southeast Asia, fish sauce. For the brick-red paste beneath the mackerel she pops over to Seoul for gochujang, funky and unabashedly hot. At last, Ms. Lo returns to Japan for creamy cubes of roasted satsumaimo, the yellow sweet potato. By now she had racked up frequent flier miles by the thousands, but what my mouth noticed were the exhilarating runs from one pole of flavor to another, from sugary to savory, soothing to fiery, nuanced to potent. The far-flung elements were anything but all over the map; they touched down precisely where Ms. Lo wanted them, and I followed along, hungrily. Free-form creativity like Ms. Lo's is rare. To explain it, we often fall back on family history. Ms. Lo's mother is Chinese, from Malaysia. Her father was Chinese, too, from Shanghai, but he died before she knew him, and she was raised in Michigan by her mother and a non-Chinese stepfather. As a girl she ate Chinese food, Hungarian food and American food, and marked her birthdays with steamed lobster. The two chefs who taught her much of what she knows about professional kitchens were David Waltuck and David Bouley . Many of the techniques they imparted are French, but the chefs are not. Biography takes you only so far. Ms. Lo will tell you that the taste of her mother's cooking made its way into Annisa's soup dumplings. They have been on the menu from the beginning, and can still startle with their seductive filling of foie gras mousse in a thick, glistening broth seasoned with ginger, star anise and cinnamon. But the hot-and-numbing Sichuan-inspired sauce on another remarkable appetizer, a hearts of palm salad, owes its presence on the plate to Ms. Lo's roving curiosity. So does the main ingredient, hearts of palm that are shipped overnight to Greenwich Village by a farmer she met on Oahu. They are grilled just enough to soften them without taking anything away from their fresh, quiet, rounded sweetness. Annisa's impressive beef tartare, chopped by a knife and chilled so it is the opposite of mushy, borrows its cinnamon and steamed bulgur from the family recipe of Annisa's sous-chef, Mary Attea, whose father is Lebanese. Ms. Lo's ear has always been attuned to the lilt of the Middle East. You can also catch it in an elegant main course of roasted rabbit loin stuffed with chopped pistachios and grape leaves with a thick and lemony yogurt sauce. In a few of the main courses, Ms. Lo's skill at layering flavors didn't quite manage to maintain interest in larger expanses of fish or meat. I wished that every piece of roasted lamb had been as remarkable as the brooding stew of merguez meatballs that came with it, or that the warm avocado dice had brought more fizz to an admirably well-grilled cobia fillet. In the slightly smaller portions of a five-course dealer's choice tasting menu for $85, that trouble disappeared. Ms. Lo devises the desserts herself, but if you are still trying to figure out which box she fits into when they arrive, I'd suggest you give up and enjoy yourself. Multicultural syncopation gives way to more homey pleasures like a banana and peanut butter \"tower.\" It must be a tower that fell over, because it is short and flat like a napoleon. You can't draw any conclusions about the person who made the long plank of poppy-seed bread pudding, which has twice as much toasted surface as usual and a pool of creamy lemon curd to swish it around in, except that she must really like eating dessert. (The feeling evidently doesn't extend to bread, based on the perfunctory dinner rolls. The little dish of retro butter curls is good for a smile, though.) The space in which these pleasures play out is remarkable for how unremarkable it is. The dining room sits a few steps above Barrow Street, where you can watch terriers wearing warm jackets and disapproving expressions take their evening walk. The canine fashion parade is virtually the only distraction from food and conversation. Around 10 one evening, when a few tables had emptied, a friend asked a question nobody ever asks in most new restaurants: \"Have they been playing music all night?\" Every week I get emails from readers who say they feel unwelcome in restaurants that have industrial noise levels, congested dining rooms, penitential chairs and subterranean lighting. Annisa is free of these annoyances. I don't think anyone of any age who enjoys going out to eat would feel out of place there. Service is graceful and unfussy, although perhaps not quite as watchful as it was before Annisa's other founder, Jennifer Scism, moved to Maine a few years ago. One night, as my guest stood by the door, a host asked how she had enjoyed dinner. It was nice of her to wonder, and would have been even nicer a couple of hours later, after we had eaten. Still, the overall tone Ms. Scism set, one of maturity and inclusiveness that Sam Sifton called \"rare and noteworthy\" in his two-star review in The New York Times from 2010, still prevails. Today, Annisa deserves a third star. Ms. Lo pulled out of a dumpling side project shortly after that review, and it may be that the restaurant has benefited from her undivided attention. She may never have an empire, but she has a superb Greenwich Village restaurant. Then again, it's just as likely that time has simply made it more clear how singular Annisa is. It's still not easy to say what Ms. Lo's style is, but it is hers, and hers alone, and the city is a more exciting place for it.

Not financial trouble, because new ones keep opening, but spiritual trouble. Its soul is unwell. Because many other restaurants now offer better beef, the steakhouse serves little purpose except as a stage set for the dwindling number of occasions that require men to bond by spending money and consuming red meat together. Sensing that it has lost its swagger, chefs have tried to revive the genre by applying their culinary-school training. Their knifework is geometric, their potato recipes are French, their menus prettified with appetizers like diced raw bluefin under droplets of Ligurian olive oil. Each dish may be a delight on its own terms, but the whole approach is wrong. Trying to save the steakhouse by adding sashimi is like trying to improve a martial arts movie by casting Gwyneth Paltrow. We all know that there's a problem, but only Hugue Dufour and Sarah Obraitis seem to have any idea how to fix it. Husband and wife, chef and manager, the two came to New York a few years ago and began waging a merciless attack on all that is fastidious and fussy in modern dining. First was the 18-month run of their gonzo diner , and then their \"dinette\" inside MoMA PS 1 . Their most recent assault on propriety is M. Wells Steakhouse, which opened in November in a converted auto-body shop in Long Island City, Queens. M. Wells Steakhouse needs some fixing itself. Discipline is not its strong suit, for better and for worse. It can lurch from magnificence to sloppiness, from inspired fever dreams to inarticulate notions that aren't ready to leave the kitchen. One thing that needs improvement is the steak. This isn't as fatal as you'd think, because when M. Wells Steakhouse succeeds, it does so in a deeply satisfying fashion, by feeding the lust in your gut for a meal that is not just a dinner but a feast. Mr. Dufour and Ms. Obraitis get this. They know that we go to steakhouses to feel more alive. They respond appropriately, even if that sometimes means feeding us enough to kill us. Let other chefs precisely engineer 130-degree steaks with immersion circulators and digital thermometers. Mr. Dufour has gone back to the cave, grilling meats over a crackling wood fire. This makes the steaks smoky, of course, and a little uneven, slightly overdone in spots, the meat seasoned with the scorch of burning fat. It's an imperfect steak, and those imperfections are just the kind of the premodern thrill that makes a traditional steakhouse great. When we go to a steakhouse, we want to wrestle with our own appetites, to learn their exact dimensions. Luckily, confrontational portions are the way Mr. Dufour signs his name. I have eaten whole tasting menus that were less filling than the appetizers at M. Wells Steakhouse. French onion soup is more solid than liquid, stuffed with poached pork belly and a marrow bone (tiny spoon provided) that takes the natural beefiness of onion broth to its logical conclusion. Solomon Gundy, a dish that takes pickled smelts as its starting point, adds half a potato waffle, a huge outcropping of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and a landslide of intensely crunchy trout eggs. If winter is getting you down, I'd prescribe one Solomon Gundy, to be taken at the bar with a glass of Champagne. (\u00c9tienne Gu\u00e9rin, imported from Montreal to be the wine director, has built a winningly nondogmatic list that is mostly French but doesn't turn up its nose at a well-made retsina.) Less photogenic but just as wonderful are the sweetbreads blanquette in an unnervingly delicious expanse of white sauce. The blanquette is also offered as a side dish, but only the appetizer version is served on a plateful of mashed potatoes. There are two very good salads as well. Do not be na\u00efve enough, however, to think that you will be eating lightly by ordering the romaine Caesar under a heap of grated Parmesan, as fluffy and white as the frosting on a coconut cake, or the improbably crisp grilled iceberg wedge in a blue cheese dressing speckled with bacon and candied pecans. Ready for your pork chop tower? Here come a half-dozen thin-cut grilled chops piled up, with a salty pat of anchovy butter between each one, as if it were a stack of pancakes. It's deranged and wonderful. With other main courses, though, we have to face the unpleasant reality that dinner at M. Wells Steakhouse can at times resemble \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", that all this heroic swaggering comes with a certain amount of swaying and weaving and stumbling over the furniture, gastronomically speaking. A Moroccan tagine with soft hunks of full-flavored lamb was as sweet as Jell-O salad. A torpedolike lobster roll tasted of its bun, and not much else. In the caviar sandwich, the pop and brine of what must have been a fat helping of sturgeon roe from Florida were muffled between two fried planks of Texas-toast-size bread. I kept thinking of what I could have done with that much caviar, or the $50 I'd just spent. I wasn't much happier paying $17 for the bone-in burger, a dense bundle of ground beef on the very low end of the juiciness and tenderness scales. The dish, with a swoosh of bone jutting out from within the bun, is a hit on Instagram. Too bad I couldn't feed it to my camera. The skin of the trout au bleu, netted from a tank in the kitchen, conked on the skull with firewood, gutted and slipped into a tangy court bouillon, is meant to turn blue, eponymously. Does it, though? Hard to tell, because it was always covered up by fingerling potatoes, cabbage and tartar sauce. The flavor and feel of the trout seemed terrific, but with so many things competing for attention, that was hard to tell, too. And while the fire does great things to the steaks, the meat didn't always live up to it. The grass-fed Kansas City strip was all elastic muscle and very little flavor. The somewhat retiring chateaubriand needed the help of a sauce, but sauces are sold separately, and nobody offered us one. The best steak I ate at M. Wells Steakhouse came from a neighbor's tomahawk chop, grilled on a whole rib almost the size of a goalie's stick. It could have served six, so we bartered for a taste. The meat gushed with juices and shiny, delicious fat. M. Wells Steakhouse was in the works for about two years. Still, I sometimes got the sense that Ms. Obraitis and Mr. Dufour are making it up as they go along. They wanted a dessert cart but decided to keep it stationary, requiring customers to walk over to it to select one of Bethany Costello's sweets. (I can save you the trip: Get the tall pile of cheesecake or the Paris-Brest, which crackles with scraps of hazelnut brittle.) It's a crazy way to run a restaurant. And if Mr. Dufour can fix the trout dish and find a steak that has the tomahawk chop's intensity for less than $200, I hope it stays that way. A great steakhouse should make you feel a little insane.

Whether it's worth the wait is a separate question. In general, though, the crowds know something. Dominique Ansel Bakery is a wonderland, and Maison Premiere's happy hour is such an amazing bargain that I am afraid that simply mentioning it may spook the owners into charging more than a dollar for each pristine oyster. There are exceptions to this rule. It does not apply to lines formed by tourists who trade their vacation days for a handful of cake crumbs under a waxy helmet of frosting on Bleecker Street. Nor does it apply to lines for brunch. Be wary of the opinions of people who will endure hunger and hangovers for a free mimosa. And so far, the rule does not apply to the lines at Han Dynasty in the East Village, a Sichuan restaurant that has been quoting waiting times at dinner of 45 minutes or more since it opened around Labor Day. This is nothing new for its owner, Han Chiang. Lines have been a feature of the six Han Dynasties he operates in and around Philadelphia. Despite his habit of informing customers, in loud and profane terms, that certain items on the menu should not be ordered by anyone but children, Han Dynasty has been so popular that he plans to open 100 locations around the country. I can think of quite a few towns where this would be great news, but I'm mystified by the popularity of Han Dynasty in Manhattan, where there are far better Sichuan restaurants. Han Dynasty's translation of the cuisine has a thick American accent. Many main courses are heavy on sugar, bell peppers and especially MSG, which is often used in great, slashing doses. They come across as close relatives of the kung pao chicken made by the best Chinese takeout in your neighborhood. In fact, your local joint might do this Sichuan crossover hit better than Han Dynasty, whose version was one of the sweetest and least appealing things on the menu. In the restaurant's anemic interpretation of cumin lamb, floppy bands of meat, drenched in a syrupy sauce, were too wet to give off any of the amazing fragrance of toasted spices that announce the dish's arrival before it reaches the table at Szechuan Gourmet in Midtown, Little Pepper in College Point, Queens, or a dozen other restaurants around town. Under the menu heading \"Shifu Special\" (shifu means, roughly, chef) is the classic Taiwanese dish Three Cup Chicken. By tradition, the sauce is made with a cup each of rice wine, soy and sesame oil. Han Dynasty seemed to add a cup of sugar, too, and applied so much sauce that the chicken, meant to be served sizzling, arrived in a caramel soup. Apart from the dan dan noodles, which needed more snap from black vinegar, the appetizers were a less cloying crew, their seasoning closer to the Sichuan spirit. Cold rabbit with peanuts in chile oil, with the thrilling, classic combination of red chiles and Sichuan peppercorns, made my lips vibrate like a tuning fork. Dry pepper chicken wings had all the crunch, complexity and aromatic power I'd missed in the cumin lamb. I had hoped that somebody would curse at me when I ordered. It never happened. Actually, the service was unusually friendly and forthcoming with the kinds of detail about the dishes that can be hard to obtain in some Sichuan restaurants. And the egg-yolk-colored paint and modern, Chinese-themed art on the walls give the place some energy. Still, if I want Han Dynasty's wings again, I'll get delivery. A 45-minute wait for the doorbell to ring would be well within reason. There are no lines at Hirohisa, which opened last summer on a quiet SoHo block. Instead there are reservations, which lately have not been hard to come by. In some ways, it's easy to see why the crowds have passed it by. The cooking is very Japanese, in the let-the-ingredients-speak mode that can leave some Americans cold. \"It's ... subtle,\" one person at my table said. \"Very subtle,\" another said. At times, I agreed. Some of the grilled meat courses, for instance, didn't leave an impression on my memory as large as the one they left on the bill. But for the most part, I love the way Hirohisa Hayashi, the chef, brings out the whispering harmonies that result when one small wave of flavor laps against another. He finds those harmonies in the way lightly charred blocks of sesame tofu come together with buttery lobes of sea urchin and shreds of fresh wasabi. And again in the bowl of raw salmon layered over white rice, which becomes a steaming soup as you add roasted green tea from a pot. And again in the gently sweet and seductive stew of lobster in white miso and dashi. But nuanced flavors can also be potent, as an omakase meal last fall made clear. Mr. Hayashi intensified grilled lamb by marinating it in red miso. Served on top of a hunk of grilled tilefish was a slab of broiled foie gras; the heat chased the fat from the liver, and this became the sauce for the fish. It was a dish to make you shake your head twice, once for how luxurious it felt, and again for how simple it was. Hirohisa is a kappo-style restaurant, a form of Japanese dining in which the chef makes both hot and cold dishes behind a counter. There are two kitchen islands floating at the edge of the serene white dining room, one for cold dishes like sashimi and another where the cooking takes place. You watch the action and relax, drink in hand, as if a friend had invited you over for dinner. In this case, you're drinking sake from a list of junmai (\"subtle rice and water\"), junmai ginjo (\"unrestrained challenge\") and junmai dai ginjo (\"a specific target\"). With a carafe on the table, the soft light flowing from alcoves in the ceiling, the chefs bending over their knives, all the lines around the city seem very far away.

This seemed like a connect-the-dots conclusion. It's a restaurant. It's in a hotel, the New York Palace. And it was awful. That didn't make any sense, though. Born in Brittany but a star in the United States, trained in pastry but adept in every corner of the kitchen, Michel Richard has been one of the most respected chefs in this country since the 1980s. Settling in Washington, he gave the city a restaurant, Citronelle, that earned national fame. Michel Richard was serious. He would not have come to New York last fall to open an awful hotel restaurant. Other possibilities had to be considered. Hoping that I was wrong about the awfulness, I went back two more times, concentrating on the \u00e0 la carte menu served in the bistro on the Madison Avenue side of the restaurant rather than the tastings presented in a room named the Gallery, where dinner starts at $140 for four courses. The Stanford White interiors look better than they have in years, thanks to the attention the design firm Jeffrey Beers International paid to the way light strikes the paintings and fireplaces. White's giddily opulent Gilded Age rooms can awe out-of-town visitors. Two weeks before Christmas, the restaurant was full of little girls in fancy dresses, most of whom stared, hypnotized, into phones and tablets, although one young rebel held a doll in her lap. A glass cube in the center of the dining room shows off the wine stockpile amassed by Gilt , the last restaurant in this space. It's not too hard to get a wonderful and affordable bottle, but you may have to manage on your own. One night, when my table of three wanted a little Beaujolais, the sommelier tried to sell us a magnum. Another time, when I asked for help choosing among more than 80 German whites, a manager said apologetically that he didn't know much about them, and that the people who did weren't around. Still, I always ended up drinking well. And if everything had been on the level of the roasted chicken, the rustic bean soup and the salmon fillet on a bed of lentils energized with balsamic vinegar, Villard Michel Richard would easily qualify as an average hotel restaurant. But many other dishes vaulted across the gap that separates average from awful. Think of everything that's great about fried chicken. Now take it all away. In its place, right between dried-out strands of gray meat and a shell of fried bread crumbs, imagine a gummy white paste about a quarter-inch deep. This unidentifiable paste coats your mouth until you can't perceive textures or flavors. It is like edible Novocain. What Villard Michel Richard's $28 fried chicken does to Southern cooking, its $40 veal cheek blanquette does to French. A classic blanquette is a gentle, reassuring white stew of sublimely tender veal. In this version, the veal cheeks had the dense, rubbery consistency of overcooked liver. Slithering around the meat was a terrifying sauce the color of jarred turkey gravy mixed with cigar ashes. If soldiers had killed Escoffier 's family in front of him and then forced him to make dinner, this is what he would have cooked. Yes, Villard Michel Richard is, in fact, an awful hotel restaurant. But it still didn't make any sense. Was Mr. Richard not the chef I had thought? Were the ecstatic reviews, the five awards from the James Beard Foundation, the induction into the Ma\u00eetres Cuisiniers de France, all a mass delusion? I doubted that, but to make sure I had dinner at Central Michel Richard , a bright, loud French-American bistro that opened in Washington in 2007. (Citronelle has been closed since 2012.) If a dish was served in both cities, I ordered it. In every case, the Washington version looked and tasted better, for the same price or less. Mr. Richard makes a chicken-liver mousse he calls faux gras, and at Central it was so silky and rich that the pun was not much of a stretch. The one in New York wouldn't be mistaken for anything but mediocre chicken liver. Lobster bisque in Washington had a robust shellfish intensity. The Villard version was floury, pale and almost completely bland; you could get nearly as much flavor by putting a lobster bib into a juicer. A fris\u00e9e salad at Central was garnished with crunchy little croutons, freshly crisped bacon matchsticks and a warm poached egg. At Villard, the croutons were stale, the bacon limp and the egg cold. The strangest thing about my dinner at Central was the fried chicken. It looked like the one at Villard, but it was terrific. The difference between them was like the difference between winning a medal for figure skating and falling through the ice. Mr. Richard was so clearly a smart, accomplished chef that for one crazy moment, I wondered if Villard Michel Richard was bad on purpose. Maybe he was paying tribute to the awful hotel food of years past, the way Grant Achatz and Dave Beran of the restaurant Next are paying homage to Chicago's steakhouse tradition. The seafood pasta, after all, is almost a direct quote from the 1980s, when doughy, gluey, overcooked fresh pasta and washed-out bits of unidentifiable seafood drooped in flavorless pink sauces. Of the same vintage, and just as bizarre, were the mushrooms under a tower of puff pastry ringed with cold, mud-colored sauce that tasted of uncooked wine. (If Villard Michel Richard doesn't make it as a restaurant, it could reopen as the Museum of Unappetizing Brown Sauces.) The flaw with this hypothesis was the desserts. They broke character. Mr. Richard's elegant, reverse-engineered Kit Kat bar; his rectangle of classic cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with mango sauce; his profiteroles in the style of a croquembouche, with a steeple of puff pastry spheres enclosing the ice cream and a pitcher of warm chocolate sauce to be poured over the top: They were all too good to be a joke. The girls in dresses even put down their phones for the celebration cake, a chocolate drum that shoots out sparks and, when you break it open, reveals a jumble of fruit and spongecake. There was another possibility: Perhaps the restaurant was awful because Mr. Richard wasn't actually involved. It's true that he is not the owner, but neither does he have the kind of licensing and consulting deal that has often made the names of Gordon Ramsay or Todd English little more than celebrity endorsements. He is a partner, a publicist said, sharing in profits and overseeing \"day-to-day operations.\" A union contract limits his ability to hire and fire cooks, but that didn't keep Paul Liebrandt and Justin Bogle from pulling off formidable technical feats when they ruled this kitchen. There is one more theory. Villard Michel Richard may be a symptom of the deal-making culture that afflicts the restaurant business. Too many chefs are being tempted with too many offers from too many developers and investors. Hotels especially know that a famous name lures travelers, who won't realize until it's too late that the food being served has nothing in common with the cooking that made the name famous. Opening a restaurant used to be a brutal process, and for many chefs it still is. If you've spent your own money and borrowed from your friends and family, you're too scared to slack off. But the best-known chefs don't have to worry about this anymore. It's become much easier for them to open restaurants. Maybe it's too easy, because running one is still as hard as ever.

When he listed past the gleaming, monumental espresso machine and produced a bottle of off-brand tequila from his jacket, I was sure of it. Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield , the New York restaurateurs who converted this landmark dive bar into an Italian restaurant last year, had clearly put him on the payroll to keep up Tosca's reputation as a haven where unmoored eccentrics raise glasses with actors, go-go dancers, politicians, heavy-metal drummers, cops and Russian ballerinas. Thirty seconds later, though, I was proved wrong when bartenders, managers and servers surrounded the man and gently steered him back to Columbus Avenue. Eccentrics may still be welcome, but not when they bring their own alcohol. Hiring local color may be the only step Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield did not take in their painstaking restoration of Tosca Cafe, in this city's North Beach neighborhood. They carefully shored up an interior that had marinated for 94 years in cigarette smoke and spilled brandy, then added an open kitchen that fills the back dining room with the smells of roast chicken and melted pork fat. In so doing, they joined the small group of restaurateurs who double as historic preservationists. Urban planners understand that cities thrive when we find new uses for old buildings. Much less attention is paid to the fate of timeworn restaurants and bars, apart from the handful whose architectural interest has earned them landmark protection. Yet some of us spend more hours -- many, many more hours -- eating and drinking in our favorite restaurants and bars than we do staring up at Louis Sullivan cornices. Though privately owned, these places become hubs of civic life. In some cases, the bond we share with them is so strong we feel as if they belong to us. Alain Ducasse is the best known of several French chefs to have rehabilitated Parisian bistros and cafes. With somewhat more modest culinary ambitions, Keith McNally, Graydon Carter and John DeLucie have done something similar with the saloons and corner taverns that are New York's answer to the bistro. But in the rapidly shifting tides of American dining styles, many grand and historic restaurants have run aground. When a proprietor can't pay the landlord's idea of market rent, these spaces may be torn down, neglected or changed beyond recognition. In 2012, Locke-Ober Caf\u00e9 in Boston closed after 137 years, despite an attempted resuscitation by the chef Lydia Shire. Plans to open a new restaurant there are in the works, but it won't be called Locke-Ober, or look much like it; many of the antique fixtures and ornaments are gone. The chef Jose Garces recently took over Old Original Bookbinder's, which was padlocked five years ago amid bankruptcy filings. Philadelphians who want to get another look at the turn-of-the-century dining rooms are mostly out of luck, though. Mr. Garces said he intended to use Bookbinder's as a commissary for his other businesses, a private-party space and a small oyster saloon that he said would operate on \"a limited basis.\" Gage & Tollner , where the chef Edna Lewis once baked pecan pies and stirred sherry into she-crab soup, is now an open wound in Downtown Brooklyn. A bangles-and-bikinis shop obscures the 19th-century facade with huge hot-pink banners (\"Wow! All handbags $9.99\"). A Doric column holding up the portico is rotting away. Inside, gaslights, embossed walls and cherry-framed mirrors are hidden behind rows of cellphone cases and racks of thongs. The Landmarks Preservation Commission plans to issue a violation this week for failure to clear up illicit changes to the interior and exterior, both of which have landmark status, said Elisabeth de Bourbon, its communications director. The building's owner, Joseph Jemal, said Tuesday that he was working on a new plan to satisfy the commission. This civic vandalism is going on in a city where a brisk trade in salvaged interior details supplies many new restaurants with just the kind of atmosphere that has been trashed at Gage & Tollner. \"Old is still kind of in,\" Mr. Friedman said in a phone interview. \"You look around at these places with Edison light bulbs and reclaimed wood, they look old. You look at Tosca and it looked like the kind of places we tried to create -- me, Taavo Somer , Keith McNally .\" As anyone who has bought a neglected brownstone knows, it can be cheaper to replicate period details than to repair them. In fact, Mr. Friedman met with architects who had elaborate plans for studiously defacing new materials to craft fresh grunge. In the end, he and Ms. Bloomfield spent $1.5 million to keep the old grunge. Nearly everything was restored, buttressed or subtly upgraded. Layers of cigarette smoke were peeled from Ted Levy's 1938 mural of Venice on the back wall, but the tar stains were left on the ceiling, which was encased behind clear sealant to keep plaster from falling into the bucatini. Vinyl chairs and banquettes were done over with red leather. Checkerboard floor tiles were patched up. New mechanical guts were built for the cappuccino machine and the jukebox that plays opera 45s. \"It didn't make sense financially at all,\" Mr. Friedman said. \"It will in years to come, I hope, but it was the right thing to do, and if we had passed on the place and somebody else had done it wrong, I'd be kicking myself.\" Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield did make some purchases: restroom plumbing, a meat slicer that looks as if it belongs under the hood of a Ferrari, and a tiled kitchen to replace the old one, which hadn't seen combat since the 1960s. Some open kitchens can be chilly, stainless-steel showpieces with all the charm of an operating room. Tosca's glows like a fireplace. \"I really wanted the kitchen to be quite welcoming,\" Ms. Bloomfield said. \"The heart of the restaurant is the kitchen, and to see it alive and beautiful and inviting was a big important thing to me and also Josh.\" Josh Even is her chef de cuisine. The menu the two of them arrived at is Italian, unfussy and marked by Ms. Bloomfield's well-known fondness for innards (a terrine of pigs' ears) and often-overlooked skill with vegetables (sweet, cherry-size Tokyo turnips, roasted with their greens on). My one meal at Tosca Cafe had its dim moments, like a sharp, aggressively garlicky mussel soup and a delicate liver sausage that was no match for a harsh, salty pumpkin pur\u00e9e. Cannoli filling, which was supposed to be lightly sugared ricotta, had the bland sweetness of pastry cream. But Mr. Even's crew also makes dried semolina pasta shells called lumaconi -- baked with lemon-scented cream, Treviso radicchio and a fistful of bread crumbs -- that I would eat once a week if I lived nearby. I'd follow them with the chicken and a dish of potatoes roasted with garlic and rosemary until they're crackling and golden, then dressed with hot pork fat. Our server insisted that we swipe the potatoes through the chicken's wonderfully old-school sauce of Marsala and cream. \"That's where the money is,\" she said. Actually, I liked it better than money. I also liked that Ms. Bloomfield and Mr. Even's menu doesn't reach for a 1919 Italian-American version of retro-authenticity.

It could have been when we were swaying like drunken sailors over the suquet de mariscos, a chowder by way of Catalonia with cool sea urchin and warm lobster bobbing in parsnip-infused milk. Or when we had finished the last shrimp in the gambas al ajillo and were scraping up the last bits of a sauce for which a tank full of lobsters must have given their shells. Or when we were crunching through croquetas of ham mixed with unmistakably earthy meat from a pig's head. Or when we were cutting into another croqueta, this one filled with unusually fluffy and moist salt cod sitting under two golden hoops of fried lemon peel. Or when we had emptied a sardine tin of its raw mackerel marinated in a Thai-derived green curry, rich with coconut milk and sharpened with lime juice. But I remember his smile and his question: \"How can a place this big have food this good?\" Toro, opened in September by the chefs Ken Oringer and Jamie Bissonnette and based on their enduringly popular Boston original, has factory-height ceilings, an industrial-chic design and 120 seats at long communal tables and smaller, unshared ones. It isn't all that large compared with Morimoto across 10th Avenue, or Buddakan on the east side of the same building, or the teeming mess halls of the meatpacking district a few blocks south. By local standards, it is a bungalow in a neighborhood of McMansions. But by the cozy standards of the Barcelona tapas joints that inspired Mr. Oringer and Mr. Bissonnette, Toro might as well be a Home Depot. It sells almost as many items. The beverage list alone is a major treatise on Spanish drinking. There are spins on Spain's beloved gin and tonic, dressed up with lemon grass syrup or yellow Chartreuse, although my Vauvert Elixir was a bit flat and cloying, as if the tonic came from a bartender's hose. More inviting at the start of a meal are the feisty and autumn-crisp hard ciders or the cavas, a few of which settle any doubts that Spain is making world-class sparkling wine. Moving beyond bubbles, Toro stocks the garnachas and tempranillos you'd expect, but it has discoveries in store, too, from underappreciated grapes like xarel-lo and mencia. You may need a drink before ordering dinner, because the menu gives you something like 60 choices. Some are fully traditional Spanish classics like toast spread with raw tomatoes that shimmer with olive oil; others are non-Iberian interpretations like yellowfin tuna in white soy sauce with tissue-thin vinegared cucumbers. This presents a corollary to my dinner companion's question: How can a menu this big have so many excellent dishes, and so few disappointments? I've certainly tasted things at Toro I wouldn't be in a hurry to order again. One November night, I stayed cool to several dishes that could have used more warmth themselves. Chilly deviled eggs were somewhat generic despite being topped with a slip of preserved tuna belly. A $36 plate of streaky jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico should have been warmer, too, to help soften the flavorful fat. This was an oversight I didn't expect from a restaurant that goes to the trouble of hand-slicing the tagged Spanish hams that it proudly hangs from the ceiling. And while I loved the way mint yogurt brightened the wintry sweetness of rutabagas, sunchokes and carrots in a vegetable paella, I had no luck finding the socarrat, the crunchy bottom layer of browned rice that our server had promised would be the best part. The pan had been hustled off the flame before the crust had set. But there were fewer misfires each time I went, suggesting that the kitchen is settling down to business. I was happy to sink into the profoundly Spanish flavors of a vegetable stew called escalivada, with smoked eggplant in olive oil that carried the sweetness of simmered red peppers and onions. I immediately wanted more of the hot blowfish tails seared in a crust of North African spices. And I wondered how the simple combination of potatoes, octopus, harissa and charred onions could result in a contender for the best octopus dish in a city that's gone cephalopod-mad. The octopus and blowfish gave me a hunch that later meals confirmed: The seafood at Toro can be spectacular. Can be, but not always: A whole sole griddled on a plancha could have used a kick of acid or salt, while delicate threads of sea cucumber were kicked around by acrid bits of over-fried garlic. But griddled red shrimp from Galicia were wildly delicious, from the tips of their tails to their heads packed with buttery orange fat. A blood-red run of fresh-pressed cranberry juice made an exciting vinaigrette for oysters, briny and raw. The clams, mussels and shrimp in paella Valenciana had plenty of character, and this time that irresistible layer of golden rice had fused to the pan. There were delicious oddities, too, like softly springy cod stomach flavored with some intensely funky stuff from inside the head of an octopus; it occupied its own wonderful niche between mild and extremely weird. A third question: Would this food taste even better if the place weren't so big? Tapas in Spain are intimate, convivial bites. They're snacks, sometimes running into meals, that you eat during hours when you fall into a bar for an hour or two of purposeless hanging out. New Yorkers aren't so good at that. We eat tapas in restaurants where the casual, offhand moment of unplanned deliciousness gives way to the wait list, the crowds, the reservation before 6 or after 10, the upsell, the table smilingly offered with the condition that \"we'll need it back in an hour,\" as a host at Toro told me one night. To their credit, Mr. Oringer and Mr. Bissonnette do not cook as if they are in a huge restaurant. Toro's food isn't stagy or gimmicky; it's honest and thoughtful, and it can feel a bit lost in this space. There are times when eating tapas here is like watching card tricks at Yankee Stadium. And if I ever want to try some of these dishes in a smaller room, I can just go to Boston. The original Toro is less than half the size, and for the eight years it's been in business, people haven't stopped complaining about how hard it is to get a table.

Francine Stephens and Andrew Feinberg had worked in kitchens and dining rooms in Manhattan, but their restaurant borrowed some of its values from Northern California. Like Delfina in San Francisco and the cafe at Chez Panisse, Franny's served thin-crust pizzas topped with farmers' market produce and meats cured in the kitchen. In the spirit of the Bay Area, Franny's stood for food that was earnest, handmade, low-tech, unfussy and, of course, local-and-sustainable, pronounced as one word even then. (The back of Franny's menu told you who had grown everything on the pizzas and salads, and where.) Today, Brooklyn and Berkeley seem connected by an underground tunnel in which hybrid vehicles carry curing salts, butchery manuals and biodynamic wines back and forth below the continent. But at the time, nobody thought that West Coast sunshine was going to rescue the borough of brownstones and strollers from Manhattan's long shadow. A few months ago, Franny's moved across Flatbush Avenue to a bigger and busier space, with a second pizza oven and towers of takeout boxes by the bar. Maybe it was inevitable that as it grew, Franny's would feel less like a mom-and-pop mission and more like a business. In the churn and hustle, your pizza might show up with blisters of char the size of baseballs. Your beet salad might look a little more slapped-together than you remember from the early days. On the other hand, all those new tables mean you might start eating much sooner, because Franny's generally doesn't take reservations. Meanwhile, Ms. Stephens and Mr. Feinberg have converted the original Franny's into a new trattoria called Marco's . Some of the small-scale spirit survives next to a newfound maturity and comfort. The lights are gentler, the room more handsome, the tables less cramped. The places are set with dead-grandmother silverware. At the bar of radiantly white marble, you can raise a bittersweet Italian aperitif, on the rocks or folded into a cocktail, then move to the table you reserved by phone, without having to slide past some toddler's half-eaten pizza. It is among the most civilized first acts that dining in Brooklyn offers. The chef is Danny Amend, who fought in the trenches at Franny's for six years. On his menu, antipasti are followed by pastas that are succeeded by fish and meats. This sounds like Italy, but it tastes like Northern California. The late San Francisco chef Judy Rodgers may have thought up the casually Mediterranean and very charming fried egg, sunny-side up, crisscrossed with rosemary needles and sent out with roasted mushrooms and sweet, soft pumpkin. Paul Bertolli may have grilled the duck gizzards on a double-pronged skewer and served them with a jammy puddle of red grape must. There is a loose, Cal-Ital freedom to the way Mr. Amend spoons saffron-pickled fennel over oysters that have been rushed into and out of the wood oven. These oysters are hot and smoky, but still as fat and juicy as when they were raw. They come five to a plate. There were four of us. About two seconds later, I ordered more. Not only did I look like a genius to the other people at the table, but I got a second oyster. Smoke can be an invisible ingredient at Marco's. I couldn't always find it in the same dish from one week to the next, but it was always there in those oysters and gizzards, and on some nights it was there in three delicious main courses: the black sea bass that pulled apart into soft, glistening flakes; the spit-roasted pork loin with a crust of herbs; the lamb chops generously sharing their delicious pink juices with a bed of toast brushed with fresh dill. A lot of rustic Italian cooking in New York is either simple but dull, or flavorful but overworked. Mr. Amend has a knack, all too rare, of building flavor without appearing to go to much trouble about it. The worst moments at Franny's can arrive with the check, when you learn that pizza night with the kids had cost more than a week of groceries. It is a sneakily expensive pizzeria. Marco's is for the most part a reasonably priced trattoria, although the sense of value can come and go without warning. The pork loin was $21, and I took home enough for lunch the next day. For an exceptionally good braised chicken with a sticky pan sauce that clung to tender leaves of cabbage, $25 seemed completely fair. But for $21, a squid main course was smaller than many appetizers, and there were so few gigante beans on an $8 side dish that I counted them: 12 \u00bd. Mr. Amend also made a bowl of steamed Carolina gold rice that was sweetly nutty, lightly vinegared and unnaturally fluffy; it cost $7, and if he would have asked, I would have given him my credit card and let him charge whatever he wanted. It was almost satisfying enough to be grouped with the primi, an imposing bunch led by silky pockets of agnolotti filled with soft, warm fontina. Bucatini tossed with garlic, anchovy essence and walnuts was very good, although more finely chopped nuts would have had more flavor. The one pasta that let me down was slightly overcooked tagliatelle with prosciutto, a simple dish that didn't transcend its simplicity. Desserts have the lean Italian outlook sweetened with a little extra sugar: a wedge of polenta-buckwheat cake with fig preserves; soft crescents of quince poached in syrup; a light honey pudding with crumbly biscuit-like buckwheat cookies. Any time I left Franny's feeling as if my pocket had been picked, the wine list was a prime suspect. I'd walk in thinking beer, and within five minutes I was drinking franciacorta. The list at Marco's is virtually all Italian and even more dangerous, especially if you are vulnerable to Piedmontese reds, but prices, in legal-disclaimer-size type on dark paper, are almost illegible without a flashlight app. Smart drinkers will ask for help, which was always close at hand. A manager gave me smart and enthusiastic wine guidance, but everyone working in Marco's dining room was poised, observant and informed. The level of service is like Manhattan. These days I probably need to add that I mean that as a compliment.

All 10 of the black-leather-and-chrome swivel seats, the same kind you'd perch on to play the slots at the Venetian in Las Vegas, were taken. Most of us had reserved a month before. Now we found ourselves sitting in the small, bright, glossy, black-and-white front room of the restaurant, which opened in August in the West Village. It looked about as Japanese as Peter Luger . Servers in black suits were offering hot towels, water and drinks, and more water, and then small talk, until it became clear that they were stalling. Were they going to let us eat? Finally, Daisuke Nakazawa walked in the front door. \"I'm sorry,\" the chef said cheerfully as he slid behind the counter and prepared for work. He had just come back from Pier 76 , he said. The police had towed his car. Then he picked up a palmful of rice and began to serve one of the four most enjoyable and eye-opening sushi meals I have ever eaten. I had the other three at Sushi Nakazawa over the next few weeks. The moment-to-moment joys of eating one mouthful of sushi after another can merge into a blur of fish bliss. But almost everything Mr. Nakazawa cups in his hands and places in front of you is an event on its own. A piece of his sushi grabs control of your senses, and when it's gone, you wish you could have it again. These little events carve themselves into your memory. So does the meal, 21 pieces or so over about two hours. I remember precisely the dull luster of Mr. Nakazawa's mackerel and the way its initial firmness gave way to a minor-key note of pickled fish and a major-key richness that kept building the longer I chewed. I can feel the warmth of just-poached blue shrimp from the South Pacific islands of New Caledonia, which had a flavor that was deep, clean and delicate at the same time. I can tell you about the burning-leaf smell of skipjack smoked over smoldering hay until it becomes a softer, aquatic version of aged Italian speck. We don't normally think of one sushi piece as wildly different from the next, apart from the inherent qualities of the main ingredient. But one of the points made by the 2011 documentary \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" was that a driven, obsessed chef will treat each sea creature as a unique challenge. He'll ask, how can I make the best piece of horse mackerel anyone has ever tasted? When Jiro Ono dreamed of sushi, what he saw were new dishes waiting to be invented. In the movie, Mr. Nakazawa was the young apprentice who cried when Mr. Ono conceded that he had finally made an acceptable egg custard. With his shaved scalp, bowed head, downturned eyes and meek acceptance of Mr. Ono's criticisms, he gave the impression of a novice Zen monk who was accustomed to abuse in the name of enlightenment. (He also gave you the idea that Jiro could be kind of a pill.) Mr. Nakazawa must have learned something, because his fish often tastes as if it has been coaxed along until it's as delicious as it's ever going to get. Each slice has a slightly different temperature, affecting flavor and texture, whether it spreads on your tongue or stays firm and chewy. All good sushi chefs do this, but Mr. Nakazawa seems to be able to hit any point on the thermometer with an assassin's aim, locating a temperature for yellowtail belly that makes its buttery richness into a time-release pleasure bomb. He gets other effects by skipping the standard wasabi smear. He dabs Japanese mustard under medium-fatty tuna and the hay-smoked skipjack, bringing out its bloody-lip tang. Yuzukosho, a paste of bright yuzu peel and burning chiles, bites playfully into the cool sweetness of a sea scallop lopped from its shell just a minute before it's served, its edges still fluttering. That scallop dish is distinctively his, and once you've had it you'd know it anywhere. Not everything I ate was in that category, and not everything is the best in town. The eel and octopus at 15 East are still undefeated, and possibly the rice, too, although Mr. Nakazawa's has a wonderfully rich, rounded flavor. The $450 menu at Masa may glide to a higher pitch of pleasure, but the most striking dishes arrive before the sushi starts. No restaurant in town does as much with sushi, and sushi alone, as Nakazawa. Behind the counter of Sushi Nakazawa, the chef is nothing like the movie's humble stepchild. He laughs, he jokes, he handles live animals. One evening he held out a tray of sea urchins, their spikes groping the air, and asked each of us to choose one. The tiger shrimp he set down on white plates another night had more energy. With a flick of its tail one jumped up in front of a woman at the counter's end. She jumped even higher. Another customer, more game, picked up the shrimp just above its wriggling legs, pointed toward his mouth in pantomime (Mr. Nakazawa is learning English), and asked the chef, \"What is the best way?\" The best way is to wait until Mr. Nakazawa yanks off its head, strips its shell and drapes the raw shrimp over a cushion of rice. Everything is gently pressed over rice, in the two-century-old Edo style of sushi that Mr. Nakazawa respects and refines. Sashimi is not served, and there are no hot dishes from the kitchen. Sushi Nakazawa operates more like a tasting-menu restaurant than most Japanese sushi places. Mr. Nakazawa does not take requests until the very end, when he offers to sell you a second taste of anything. He does work around dietary restrictions, though. (He also notices who's left-handed, and sets their sushi down with the ends pointing at 8 o'clock and 2 o'clock so it's easier to pick up with the fingers.) There are three seatings a night at the counter. Reservations there can be made only for parties of two, which is needlessly unaccommodating; sushi counter dining is one of Japan's great gifts to solo diners, and I can't imagine Sushi Nakazawa would have trouble filling the slots. Reservations for the 25 seats in the back are more flexible, with staggered times and a discounted price, $120 instead of $150 at the counter. You can't see the show from the cheap seats, and the room, while perfectly comfortable, will not be appearing in any interior-design magazines. But the sushi is rushed to the tables while the rice is still warm, which is crucial, and the dining room is the place to sit if you want to have a conversation without interruptions from jumping shrimp. Interruptions from Rick Zouad, the sommelier, are welcome, though. I am skeptical of pairings with tasting menus, but Mr. Zouad's choices flattered each style of sake, and the price, $40 for six or seven glasses, is almost a gift. There are some very tempting half-bottles of Champagne from Chartogne-Taillet and other small producers or, for $12, about 15 percent of the price of the Champagnes, a 17-ounce Japanese lager brewed by Echigo from sushi rice that hits the reset button as effectively as pickled ginger. Sushi Nakazawa is owned by Alessandro Borgognone, whose other restaurant is Patricia's , his family's place in the Bronx. At home one night, Mr. Borgognone watched \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" and announced that he was going to bring one of the chefs to New York. His wife, reasonably, said no, you're not. Luckily, he ignored her, and eventually found Mr. Nakazawa working in Seattle for another former apprentice of Mr. Ono's. The trip from the Bronx to the West Village is probably easier to make than the trip from \"spaghetti Frank Sinatra\" to raw triggerfish under a squiggle of its own liver. Every once in a while, the distance tells. Mr. Borgognone has been bringing in sorbets made by his father at Patricia's. The gesture is lovely, but superfluous. The egg custard Mr. Nakazawa cried over, made with mountain yam and shrimp, is the final, transporting piece of sushi. It hovers over the border between pudding and cake, and it tastes like an ending. Welcome to New York, Mr. Nakazawa. It's a nice town for a great sushi chef .

Armed with nothing but good cheer and a smile that could stop a war, she had the unenviable job of preventing an uprising in a waiting area by the door that might comfortably hold three people if they were very skinny and could survive for minutes at a time without breathing. There were around 10 of us. Tables weren't emptying out as fast as new reservations were arriving, and hungry customers were piling up like rush-hour riders on the platform at Times Square when, \"due to an earlier incident,\" the uptown No. 1 is nowhere in sight. The earlier incident causing the short delay at Charlie Bird was one that has occurred regularly since the restaurant opened in June: It gets packed early on and stays that way for hours. There was no room at the bar, but Robert Bohr, the wine director and an owner, had wedged himself into the tiny foyer to take drink orders, enthusiastically recommending a \"tanky\" and \"gulpable\" Piedmontese Barbera from Scarpetta. The host squeezed past him to look at the dining room. As she passed, there was a light pressure on my shoe. \"Oh, I'm so sorry,\" she said. \"I did not mean to step on your foot!\" I had barely noticed, and once she unholstered that smile, I hardly cared. She was one of those servers who can make you feel better after a misstep, even one that lands on your toes, than you would have if nothing had gone wrong in the first place. The tone she set carried through all my meals at Charlie Bird, and it went a long way toward smoothing over any wrinkles. Quick, experienced and friendly, the servers add to the hip-hop-fueled energy of the dining room, which has the slightly too crowded and slightly too loud spirit that keeps people living in New York, even while they gripe about it. This was fortunate, because the cooking at Charlie Bird is surprisingly erratic: tremendously likable one moment, strangely off-key the next. Ryan Hardy, the chef and Mr. Bohr's partner, is working in an eager-to-please Italian mode that leans heavily on cheese, salt and crunch. The kitchen announces its intentions right away with focaccia that is so crisp and shiny with oil that it seems to have been deep-fried. Bits of bread roasted in chicken fat multiply the crunch of a half chicken that Mr. Hardy sears, pressing down on it until the skin crackles. Apart from a near-perfect risotto with tiny clams, the soulful mush of Italian cuisine is mostly banished; when a wonderful classic tripe stew turns up, simmered to vanishing softness in tomatoes, Mr. Hardy spoons it over crunchy slices of toast. There is a heroic veal chop at Charlie Bird, pounded and floured and browned at scorching heat, but not scorched, served with tender porcini slices and wedges of lemon. There are chopped razor clams that ride in the long canoes of their shells alongside a fiery mash of pickled peppers. A special of bay scallops with chopped pistachios was given little capes of lardo, which may not have been the most flattering look but made the scallops seductively good to eat. Jarringly, ingratiating dishes like these were mixed in with careless ones. Some main courses weren't hot enough, including, on one night, that star chicken. A few of the handmade pastas were standouts; others were washouts. Squid-ink chitarra with too few strands of crab was drowned in oil, and pappardelle with tender veal belly was lost in a weak, watery broth; even $50 worth of white truffles couldn't coax it to life. One evening, the cooks seemed to be applying salt with a snow blower. Salty croutons undid crisp leaves of escarole dressed with anchovies and lemon. Chanterelle pickles and a caper-raisin pur\u00e9e both brought extra salt to a wing of skate that already had more than its share. Dessert could have offered safe haven. But a warm chocolate cake with a molten, sunken center like the crater of a volcano and the olive oil ice cream next to it were topped, sadistically, with much more than a pinch of Maldon salt. A few weeks ago, the sodium had been purged from that chocolate volcano and it was the best dessert on the table. If the rest of the menu can shape up, Charlie Bird will be a very good restaurant. The other pieces are already in place. The narrow space, essentially a split-level bowling alley that runs along Avenue of the Americas, has been made over as a modern bistro, with squash-colored banquettes and Lyle Owerko's blown-up photographs of vintage boomboxes shot like Avedon portraits. The music is carefully aged hip-hop. Over the summer the decibel level could have been classed as an enhanced interrogation technique, although if it elicited any confessions nobody would have heard them. Acoustic retrofitting and a lower volume setting have helped. Mr. Bohr, who built the epic wine list at Cru , keeps a much shorter one at Charlie Bird. Working with one of his sommeliers, Grant Reynolds, he has assembled it with such care that I fell hard for everything I tasted. Ordinarily I'd be put off by seeing more bottles over $100 than under in such a casual place, but the markups are kind and, if your curiosity outstrips your budget, you can buy a half bottle of anything except sparkling wines for half the price. Even the cheapest wines were exciting, like the grignolino from the Piedmontese producer Cavallotto. At $45, it cost less than the retail price of the handblown glass it was served in, which had a crystal stem as thin as a chive. Like Pearl & Ash , another downtown restaurant that opened this year, Charlie Bird is on a mission to make the thoughtful wine service that you used to find only in hushed, special-occasion restaurants into an everyday event. That philosophy shapes the whole meal. Servers watch the tiny details, the way they do at far more formal restaurants, but they're loose and relaxed. It's a style ideally suited for the way we go to restaurants now, and it would lure me back, once the kitchen becomes more consistent, even if I have to wear steel-toed shoes.

At Somtum Der in the East Village , that person is not a host who may banish you to a table in the frozen wastes of Siberia but a cook who can set your mouth on fire with the flavors of northeastern Thailand. Wearing a T-shirt and a straw hat, he stands behind the bar, surrounded by glass candy-shop jars filled with shallots; heads of garlic; peanuts and cashews; granules of white sugar and little cakes of palm sugar; blistered sticks of fried pork skin; and, crucially, dried bird's-eye chiles. When an order comes in, he grabs a wooden bat that would come in handy if he were caught in a riot and pounds it against the bottom of a deep wooden mortar. He looks as if he is churning butter. What he is doing is making tart, salty, crisp and exhilaratingly spicy papaya salad. Called som tum in Thailand, papaya salad gave its name to this nearly three-month-old restaurant and is its star attraction, made to order in eight variations. One has brined, boiled eggs, which are fluffy and creamy and soothe the burn of the chiles. Another is seasoned with slivers of grilled pork neck, sweet and pink. The one called som tum poo-plara is darker than the rest in color and in flavor because it's mixed with intensely funky fermented fish sauce and rock-hard miniature crabs scooped up in Thai rice paddies. It was the most complexly rewarding on the roster; the least was the one with rice noodles and sweet chile sauce, which seems to lull the noodles into a shallow, sugary daze. Nearly everybody in Thailand loves papaya salad, but the rest of the country got it from Isan, the vast northeastern plateau. Isan probably got it from Laos, next door, but that's another story. In stalls all around Bangkok, street hawkers from Isan pound green papaya, and in 2012 a pair of restaurateurs brought the mortars indoors to a bright and offhandedly stylish place called Somtum Der. Like the Bangkok original, the East Village branch has knotty-pine walls and ceiling fixtures made from bamboo rice steamers and fish traps that could pass for the work of a modern design studio. To recap, this is a New York replica of a Bangkok restaurant that interprets that city's street-food renditions of traditional Isan cooking . Amazingly, the food survives this journey, and if it has lost some herbs and other ingredients, it is still vibrant, fresh and delicious. It has picked up a few things, too. Although Isan cuisine is on the march in New York, Thanaruek Laoraowirodge and Supanee Kitmahawong, who own Somtum Der, were worried that the city would wilt under the force of an all-Isan menu. With their consulting chef, Kornthanut Thongnum, they have padded it out with dishes from central Thailand. A salad of sardines with mint and improbable quantities of crunchy, fragrant chopped lemon grass is worth a detour from Isan. Somtum Der's drunken noodles or pad Thai with crab are more than credible, too, if you cannot imagine a Thai meal without those standbys. But they are not why you are here. You are here to build an Isan meal around sticky rice, a bowl of soup, a bit of fried or grilled meat and rustic, fiery salads. Very few dishes cost more than $12, and this is one restaurant where the refrain of \"small plates meant for sharing\" is not just accurate but culturally appropriate, so order as many as the table can hold. (Or maybe not quite that many. The food launches out of the kitchen quickly and relentlessly, and I felt lost in an avalanche until I learned to order about half of what I meant to eat, and then, when it was gone, put in a second order.) You want a larb or two, one of the chopped salads lavished with chiles and mint and a dusting of toasted ground rice that crackles between your teeth. The larbs with chopped duck and pork are very good. The one with crunchy flakes of grilled catfish that soak up the lime and fish sauce is even more satisfying. Another takes the opposite strategy, with minced mushrooms that don't absorb the dressing at all but quietly allow the fresh herbs and chiles to sing out. Animal proteins do not demand the center of the plate in Isan cuisine, and while pork turns up frequently, it's possible to put together an excellent vegetarian dinner at Somtum Der. Carnivores, though, will want at least one fried or grilled meat. Skewers of beef or pork marinated in coconut milk didn't hold much interest, but the grilled \"house special\" pork did, especially when it was dipped in savory, salty jaew sauce. Of the deep-fried dishes splashed across two pages on the full-color picture menu, sun-dried beef and pork with fried leaves of Kaffir lime made an easy-to-crave snack on their own, while the Isan sausages and pork roll worked better as pauses between spicy bites of larb and papaya salad. The restaurant is proud of its chicken thigh under a shower of fried garlic; it might have been wonderful straight out of the oil, but it was distinctly warmed over when I had it. Above all, you want papaya salad, absolutely, and you want it as spicy as you can stand. Somtum Der measures heat on a chile-pepper scale, with four chiles denoting a psychotropic level of spice. The cooks don't always interpret this the same way, even on the same night, but most of the time a four-chile papaya salad will mean five minutes during which you are incapable of doing anything but sweating, squirming, trying to blot your tongue with rice and gulping mouthfuls of Beer Lao . A lager from Laos, Beer Lao is a definite notch in quality above Singha, and several notches above Somtum Der's stabs at Asianesque cocktails. It will, however, be all but useless if you are in the grips of a papaya salad armed with four-chile firepower by the man near the door. In that case, there is nothing you can do but wait.

When an exciting chef works in a terrible dining room, though, you feel the way you do when a friend hooks up with somebody you can't stand. You may visit the two of them once or twice to savor the full extent of the new partner's awfulness, but then you run for cover while you await the end. That's the reaction most diners had to Tenpenny when Chris Cipollone was the chef . Nearly everyone agreed that his food was terrific but that eating it in the charmless lobby of a Midtown hotel was like being buried alive with your last meal. When news of the breakup finally came, Mr. Cipollone's admirers began to hope they could start hanging out with him again. This summer, they got what they wanted, and Mr. Cipollone got the restaurant he deserved. Piora, next door to a West Village pet boutique where you can buy metallic-gold PVC dog collars, isn't large. The tables are leather-topped, as if you were about to sit down for a hand of whist, and they are hemmed in so snugly that when servers converged to set down three plates at once, they looked as if they were playing Twister. Right hand, trout! Left hand, suckling pig! But the place has been put together with intelligence and taste. You walk past a long bar attended by men in spotless white jackets, as if they had been flown in from Harry's Bar in Venice. Then you arrive in a square dining room with walls inscribed by long, sinuous horizontal lines. They look a bit like tentacles emanating from a sideways jellyfish, but they're strangely soothing, and they make the space look bigger. In another optical trick, the room seems to extend past the windows in the back to a tiered and illuminated garden that makes those of us with plants at home wonder why ours don't look this green in November. Mr. Cipollone has definitely traded up, and he's cooking as if he knows it. Imagine, if you can, four people fighting over carrots. It happened, and one of his appetizers was the cause. Some of the carrots were roasted in ham fat until they collapsed into their own sweetness; some had a humming spiciness locked inside them; under them was tangy white yogurt and on top, a pink drift of powder. \"Ham snow,\" our server said. If there are Bac-Os in heaven, I had better get some religion, because this is what they'll taste like. Piora is owned by Mr. Cipollone and Simon Kim, a Korean-American who has management experience under Thomas Keller and Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and Korean flavors dart in and out of the menu. Mr. Cipollone makes fearless use of gochujang, the fermented hot-chile paste, blending it with shrimp stock and slathering it over crunchy and charred legs of grilled octopus. The gochujang, hot and deeply funky, is almost too much, but fresh basil leaves and candied pine nuts rein it in. But before you file Piora away under Asian fusion, be aware that the one thing you must eat is the pasta. Mr. Cipollone, an Italian-American, loves to play with pasta, but he is not chained to the traditions of Italy. He simmers black garlic bucatini in crab stock and tosses it with crab meat, adding maitake mushrooms for earthy depth. He underlines the candy-like flavor of roasted red kuri squash inside tortellini with a butternut squash juice that's a little less sweet, a two-note melody in the key of squash. Purple rigatoni -- there's red wine in the dough -- looked odd but tasted great, with peppery, fennel-seed-flecked duck sausage and lengths of the bitter green called spigarello. \"I like the tortellini,\" the best cook at my table said, \"but I want the recipe for the rigatoni.\" Personally, I want to know how to make the side dish of toasted hazelnuts with crisp bits of caramelized sunchoke. It's as crunchy as granola and nearly as sweet, and I'd eat it for breakfast. Life can't be all sunchoke granola and ham snow, though. Dullness creeps in. A pur\u00e9e of prunes stewed in tea wasn't dynamic enough to help the washed-out flavor of a duck confit appetizer fried in a puck. Even more spectral was the taste of a suckling pig main course, although a wonderful slaw of fried burdock root and radishes nearly made up for it. But dry-aged duck breast had a potent steakhouse intensity, and if its sauce of pur\u00e9ed jujubes, the Korean date, had a somewhat flat sweetness, duck jus enriched with black garlic gave it a savory kick. In a gentler mode, halibut was topped with sweet-sour ribbons of pickled butternut squash and given a last-minute swirl of toasty brown-butter fumet. Piora is about to hire its first pastry chef. With luck, it will land one who has better ideas than squirting lychee foam next to a gooey chocolate tart, or doubling down on the perfumey taste of Earl Grey cake with a scoop of Earl Grey sorbet. Until a new regime enters, I'll content myself with a glass of 12-year-old Guyana rum filtered one drop at a time through sliced bananas. It sounds like what you would put in the bottle of a baby with a drinking problem, but it is an excellent and serious nightcap. The men in the white jackets know their booze, and Piora's cocktails are tautly balanced and ungimmicky. This restaurant and chef are so pleased to have found each other that at times they fall into the slightly stiff good manners of somebody trying to impress future in-laws. The servers, in slate-colored striped aprons, are attentive, numerous and rather serious about this whole business of dinner. Ours can't be blamed for our fight over the carrots, having solemnly informed us when we sat down that Mr. Cipollone's food isn't meant to be eaten family-style but should be consumed in separate courses, one dish to each diner. You don't say. Now could someone please tell me what I'm supposed to do with these shiny pieces of metal next to my plate? This style might play better in a grand restaurant like Per Se or Jean Georges than it does in this cozy back room on Hudson Street. Once Piora moves beyond its self-imposed formality, it and Mr. Cipollone can start to settle in and get comfortable. This time, it looks like things may last.

Everybody called it Disco Sushi, and I loved it for reasons that had nothing to do with the food. I had eaten enough good sushi to know I couldn't afford it. But cold rice, fake wasabi and sinewy fish mattered much less when vinyl records and the mirror ball were spinning, the tables were filling up with musicians waiting for a 1 a.m. gig at Brownies, and we were all on our third round of sake bombs. I didn't realize how much I missed Disco Sushi until I found Sushi Dojo, which opened this summer on First Avenue near East Sixth Street. There were no turntables in sight, but the room was filled with retro disco. Usually, bone-thumping dance music is the way restaurants say \"we hate you\" to their customers. But at Sushi Dojo the tracks by Chromeo, Sare Havlicek and the like were played at a humane volume and compiled with an evident love for high-sheen, poppy neo-disco. And while I didn't spot any sake bombs, plenty of people were getting bombed on sake. Ask the sommelier, Max Lidukhover, for a recommendation and he'll give you two samples that would pass for full pours in other places, and if you're not wild about either, he's likely to uncork a third. Along the way he'll teach you the basics. \"Ginjo sake is very harsh,\" he'll say. \"I don't recommend it unless you're looking to get wasted.\" This is not necessarily discouraged at Sushi Dojo, where you can see customers in lip locks, customers waving their arms in full I-love-you-guys mode and customers buying rounds for the chefs, a Japanese custom that the staff avidly embraces. All this would earn Sushi Dojo a heartfelt welcome to the neighborhood even if the food didn't stand out. But it does. The soul of this party is sushi worth getting crazy for, made by three chefs with a strong traditional bent: Hiromi Suzuki, Makoto Yoshizawa and David Bouhadana. Mr. Bouhadana is the ringleader , and the most exuberant customers seem to gravitate to his end of the counter. One night I asked Ms. Suzuki for $75 worth of sashimi and sushi, dealer's choice. Sashimi came first: entwined bands of unshy, oily horse mackerel under a stubble of chives; firm white squares of local striped bass; shiny sunset-pink Arctic char jolted with lemon; bonito seared by a pass of the blowtorch; a slippery-soft tongue of raw spotted prawn next to its armored head. The streaks of fresh wasabi I drew with a chopstick tip underscored what Ms. Suzuki had already done with her knives, her torch and her seasonings to enhance the texture and taste of each kind of sashimi. Next, she placed one matchbox-size piece of sushi at a time on a banana leaf: glistening golden-eye snapper; a purplish strip of needlefish with skin that flashed like steel; yellowtail belly that melted like whipped lard; wild Alaskan salmon warmed by Ms. Suzuki's blowtorch just long enough to melt some of the oils; and a delicate slip of sea eel, one of the finest I've found anywhere. This was more than raw seafood; it was the work of a thinking chef, and it was a treat. It was also a lot of high-quality fish for the price. If $75 is beyond your means, an entry-level 10-piece omakase sushi meal costs just $45, although it probably won't include many seasonal specialties like needlefish or rarities like live, still-wriggling octopus. Not every piece I had at Sushi Dojo was exceptional; baby cuttlefish refused to surrender its flavor, and I wasn't sure if a scallop, overpowered by wasabi, had much to hold on to. The rice can wad together stubbornly rather than falling into separate grains, too. But its gently vinegared seasoning blooms in the mouth, lifting up the taste of fish. There is a surprisingly long menu of cooked food, and while it doesn't quite keep pace with the sushi, it's more than respectable. If this kitchen fried it, you want it: shrimp in their crackling shells; a beehive of mizuna and seafood tempura with green-tea salt; a horse mackerel's skeleton, dispatched to hot oil after you've eaten its body as sashimi. Kurumazushi is where I would have gone in my Disco Sushi days if I'd been able to afford it. Ruth Reichl gave it three stars in its last review in The New York Times, in 1995. At the time, many sushi hounds regarded it as the best in the city. Some still do, but I am not one of them. My meals in this restaurant, hidden on the second floor of a small Midtown office building that, like one of the artist Ben Katchor 's streetscapes, has sidestepped the modern age, offered some extraordinary tastes: king crab from Canada; very sweet squid made tender by a fine lattice of crosshatched cuts; gleaming amberjack and horse mackerel; and a hand roll of fatty tuna and scallions that made me forget how to speak for a minute or two. But an omakase meal that starts at $300 should make you fall silent more than once or twice. Some of the sushi might have come from a far less exalted restaurant: the eel drenched in sugary sauce, the forgettable salmon roe, and an array of seafood that would have had no character at all if not for the dab of fresh wasabi. The fish was too cold, a particular issue with fattier cuts like toro. The main culprit, though, was rice, a mass of starch so in need of seasoning that it erased the flavors of the fish like blotting paper. And while the wasabi on sushi was the real thing, the green stuff on a sashimi plate, one course in a $140 prix fixe meal I ate in the front dining room, was not. That room is a cheerless place, and lacks Kurumazushi's greatest asset: Toshihiro Uezu, the chef. An antic, grinning presence, Mr. Uezu has as much fun as anyone in the restaurant. Standing between the sushi counter and a wall that looks like a raked sand garden in Japan, he slams metal trays of fish on top of one another, catches his breath, and turns to a customer: \"O.K.! Sushi or sashimi? You choose or I choose?\" And then he is off. \"Horse mackerel,\" he says, reaching across the counter with a length of pinkish fish draped over rice. \"Horse?\" a customer asks, unsure he'd heard it right. Mr. Uezu loves this. \"Yes! Horse!\" he says. \"Secretariat!\" He laughs. Everybody laughs. Just like that, it's a sushi party.

First, the show. Our server parks a trolley next to a window above Midtown in Quality Italian's sprawling main dining room. \"I'm going to make your steak sauce,\" he announces as he drops oregano and parsley leaves into a mortar, cranks the pepper grinder and muscles down on it all with a pestle. \"Tomato-garlic sauce,\" he says, adding three spoonfuls. \"Now raisin molasses.\" He stirs with a clatter, making as much of a production of it as any mutton-chopped bartender ever made of a julep. \"The owner likes us to do things tableside,\" he says. \"It's a little kitschy, but it's fun.\" This would make a reasonably accurate motto for Quality Italian itself. The owners are Michael Stillman; his father, Alan; and Craig Koketsu, whose company, Fourth Wall Restaurants , is bravely battling the creeping solemnity and earnestness of parts of the New York restaurant scene. Fourth Wall has one restaurant where not just the menu but the d\u00e9cor and the name change with the seasons (Park Avenue Winter, Park Avenue Spring, etc.) and another that salutes the tiki gods with drinks in watermelons and coconuts ( the Hurricane Club ). To the Stillmans, \"gimmicky\" is a compliment and \"too gimmicky\" is a phrase with no meaning. Quality Italian, which opened this summer, is in some ways a clone of Fourth Wall's steakhouse a block away, Quality Meats, but the executive chef, Scott Tacinelli, has grafted some Italian-American food onto the menu for good measure. The result is, as my server promised, both kitschy and fun, although the food is so uneven you may as well order by spinning a roulette wheel, a gimmick the Stillmans don't seem to have tried yet. This is the restaurant that finally answers the question, \"What if we set lobster fra diavolo on fire?\" Enter a server pushing another trolley. He pours vodka infused with hot Calabrian chiles over a pan of sweet red-pepper sauce. Now the match. The flame climbs the stream of vodka and engulfs the bottle's neck. It threatens to engulf the server, too, but he's quick, and there is no damage: neither to his hand, nor to the lobster, which was not stunningly flavorful the night I had it, nor to the sauce, which was. At Quality Italian, you don't get zeppole after dinner. You get a Zeppole Workshop. The pastry chef, Cory Colton, fills a galvanized pail with fried balls of dough and sends them out with a sifter of powdered sugar, a jar of honey with a honey wand, a tiny pitcher of chocolate sauce and a scoop of ricotta ice cream, creamy and not too sweet. You do the rest. That's the kind of work I excel at, especially if it means that I get to skip the Zeppole Workshop's less exciting cousin, the Cannoli Cart. This is yet another trolley upon which a server stuffs limp wafer shells with a blend of mascarpone and ricotta that is as blandly sugary as canned frosting. After tasting these cannoli, I wanted to flag down another cart to take them away. Better yet would be a swap cart, where you could trade the cannoli for the lovely lemon meringue tart in its rectangle of crisp sugar-crust pastry. Even the vegetables perform tricks. Servers stir an egg yolk into bacon-studded kale carbonara, and they crack the glassy surface of caramelized sugar above corn baked in a sweet custard: corn br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Both are preposterously rich, but good. It's hard to believe the same kitchen that makes these would send out sunchokes roasted to a flavorless, baby-food mush inside deflated skins, little pantyhose-colored bags of regret. Distinguishing between entertaining ideas and silly ones is not Quality Italian's strength. Serving gelati in a paper cup has a Dairy Queen charm, but stamping those cups with the red Safe Handling Instructions label found on meat packages is just bizarre, unless the Stillmans want to educate the public about the risks of E. coli in ice cream. And dressing the female servers in modified French maid outfits may not be the most forward-thinking policy for a restaurant catering to Midtown professionals of both sexes. (Maybe the Stillmans nabbed the idea from Le Relais de Venise , the steakhouse chain, which seems to get away with it by being French.) I wanted to believe there was more than kitsch to the chicken parmigiana that looked and acted like a 13-inch pizza. But its shroud of browned cheese was more like Tombstone than Totonno's ; its fried breading was limp, and after our server had sliced the pizza into wedges with a wheel, the chicken turned out to be spongy ground breast and thigh meat almost completely free of seasoning. Other diners report tasting herbs and salt in the patty, but even that, and a serving that easily feeds two with leftovers (in a pizza box, of course), wouldn't persuade me to pay $58. Luckily, a fair number of dishes don't do anything but sit there and taste good. Oysters baked under sea urchin butter and bread crumbs are a briny thrill. Nearly as good are the baked clams, with their doubly crunchy topping of bread crumbs and crisp angel-hair pasta. Both a filet mignon, tall and proudly alone on an empty white plate, and a sirloin, served on the bone, hit all the classic steakhouse marks, from the glossy, fleshy interior to the matter-of-fact sear. A medium-rare rib chop, though, was inexplicably lean, chewy and dry; almost all the flavor was in the crunchy trimmings left on the bone. Help was not going to come from the steak sauce, drowning in sweetness and clogged with oregano. It could have used some of the energy that a sensational sour-cherry mostarda with fried sage brought to a Berkshire pork chop. Pasta dishes have nothing like the finesse they get at Michael White's steakhouse, Costata , but the porterhouse agnolotti in brown butter and vincotto had the transfixing depth of dry-aged beef, and the sickle-shaped creste with shrimp in spicy tomato sauce were bright and appealing. Finesse may be beside the point at a place where servers proudly tell you that the Quality Burger on the lunch menu is \"served with Quality cheese.\" The kitchen needs to work on the first half of the restaurant's name. But judging by the crowds and the number of times I heard \"Happy Birthday to You,\" the Stillmans seem to have figured out that some people would still rather eat in a theater than a church.

The critic at the time, Amanda Hesser, observed that one-word names had become fashionable, and gave recent examples: Ilo. Tappo. Beppe. Gonzo. Pazo. Pico. Salt. Fresh. Supper. Canteen. Commune. District. Town. These establishments, more than half of Ms. Hesser's roll call, didn't last. Hearth did. It thrived not because it cruised along in the tail winds of a nomenclature fad, but because it diligently looked the other way as fads came and went. The same potato gnocchi wallowing in a wading pool of melted butter that Ms. Hesser praised will be on every second table tonight. Everybody else will get the same rich but not filthy-rich polenta, although the ground corn is now typically grown in upstate New York, not South Carolina. Returning again this fall are the same improbably long bands of handmade pappardelle that drink the braising juices of a fine duck rag\u00f9. If you woke up shivering because you went to sleep with a window open and the temperature dropped 30 degrees overnight, this is the bowl of noodles you want. From the start, Marco Canora, Hearth's chef and, with Paul Grieco, its owner, set out to adapt the transparency of Tuscan cooking to his own region and time of year. He gets few points for the originality of his vision. But for his fidelity to it, Mr. Canora's score is off the charts. By all accounts he is in the kitchen on East 12th Street almost every night, even as he and Mr. Grieco have replicated their wine bar next door, Terroir , in four other neighborhoods. As Hearth approaches its 10th anniversary next month, you can tell the kitchen is paying attention most of the time. Not always: one night the gnocchi would have had no flavor if not for the melted butter and grated cheese on top. Dry, stringy salt cod mantecato needed more richness, and it was stuffed in a bitter roasted yellow Hungarian pepper that needed more sweetness. Siobhan DeCarlo's desserts were variable, too. I had a nearly perfect cardamom panna cotta with a coffee-caramel sauce one night, and a dry, drab pear spice cake with almost no hint of spices on another. I noticed the lapses because they were so out of character, like John Boehner vaping on an e-cigarette. In the dining room, though, inattention was closer to normal. The servers seem friendly enough, smiling in their plaid shirts and bluejeans with napkins peeking out of the back pocket. But all my meals could easily have been finished 45 minutes sooner, without rushing. While I waited for somebody to take an order, or bring the main course, or clear dirty dishes, there were pauses long enough for several species of Amazonian frogs to go extinct. Ordering wine wasn't always simple, either. Once when I asked a server about a wine, she admitted she didn't know much about it but promised to find out. Instead she came back 10 minutes later with the bottle; we were halfway through our main courses by then, so we didn't stop her from opening it. Any restaurant can get into the weeds, but the weeds at Hearth seem especially fast-growing and luxuriant. If I had been alone, I would have passed the time reading Mr. Grieco's wine list . This passionate, garrulous, name-checking manifesto exhorts us to drink mead (\"a true symbiosis between insect, nature and man\"), urges us to drink riesling (\"To say that Riesling is great is as obvious as saying Vladimir Putin is the Michael Corleone of Russia\"), pleads with us to drink sherry (\"the most underrated beverage on the planet earth\") and revises the lyrics to a Justin Timberlake song (\"It's my wine in a box, my wine in a box babe\"), twice. The tension between Mr. Grieco's confrontational wine list and Mr. Canora's soothing menu is one of the springs that keeps Hearth in motion. Another is Mr. Canora's understanding of the seasons. Once a vanguard notion in the United States, cooking with seasonal ingredients is so mainstream that chefs of all stripes practice it, from the modernist gear heads to the New Nordic foragers who can tell you exactly when to pick toothwort roots. But chefs who plug this week's ingredients into a style of cooking that stays the same all year long, who incorporate pumpkin and pheasant into their gels and streusels and cantilevered fronds asymmetrically disposed on just one side of the plate, seem to forget that it isn't just the farmers' market that changes with the seasons. Our appetites change, too. One night in June, when restaurants in the East Village had their doors thrown open and the neighborhood took on a relaxed, unhurried mood, I ate a salad that put me in the same kind of mood: sweet, firm, bright-green favas and bits of soft young pecorino, dressed with vinaigrette and chopped parsley. In early fall, I ate just-cooked canestri, like bent rigatoni, tossed with braised cauliflower and wilted Tuscan kale; on top were toasted bread crumbs that stayed crisp until the pasta was gone, which bread crumbs never do when I make them. What made the crunch of the crumbs, the chew of the noodles, the long, mellow flavors of the vegetables so satisfying was the way they filled a hunger I wouldn't have felt a month earlier. Even though Mr. Canora rarely has more than two pastas on the menu, that's what comes to mind when I think of Hearth. I also picture the platters for two. The spatchcocked chicken with flavor in every scrap of its flesh and golden skin, the whole roasted fish stuffed with lemon and rosemary, and the c\u00f4te de boeuf are all treated like the classics they are. Unlike other restaurants, where trendy platters for two are an old-fashioned opportunity for price gouging, Hearth sells the chicken and fish for about as much as two regular main courses. For the beef, which could probably feed three, $125 isn't out of line. Hearth received two stars from Ms. Hesser, who praised it for what she called \"good, familiar food given a little luster.\" After 10 years it's easier to see that familiarity as Hearth's path to timelessness.

When thrill-seeking diners book long-distance travel to taste some pathbreaking chef's strange new inventions, their planes land in places like Barcelona or Copenhagen, not Leipzig or Dresden. Although the 2013 Michelin Guide paid lavish attention to Germany, awarding 3 stars to 10 restaurants there, neither those restaurants nor their chefs are household names in any country but their own. When Germany flexes its economic muscle, other countries jump to attention. When it shows off its gastronomic power, they shrug. Anytime the world seems to have made a secret pact to ignore a subject, curious minds grow even more curious. So off I went last month on a brief but industrious eating tour of Germany. I traveled to three of the cities foreigners are most likely to visit, Munich, Frankfurt and Berlin, making reservations in relatively new restaurants. None of them were especially luxurious or expensive compared with the rarefied dining rooms that are catnip to the Michelin Guide. German chefs tend to play a long game, honing their craft in the same kitchen for decades. Coming from New York, where chefs will put a restaurant on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s after working there free for a few weeks, I was deeply impressed by the German dedication to putting down roots. But I was especially interested in seeing where the country's restaurant scene may be going next, so I restricted myself to places that had opened since the start of this decade. Around the same time, my colleague Frank Bruni was pursuing a similar assignment in China , following similar rules. Unlike me, he stuck to the rules. I bent them to write about a very good meal I had in Frankfurt at Weinsinn , which opened at the end of 2009. My rationale: In its first months, Weinsinn was a wine bar, and didn't begin to evolve into a restaurant until it hired its current chef, Andr\u00e9 Rickert, the following year. All the Action Is on the Plate Mr. Rickert has a modernist's skill set and a modernist's talent for combining the serious and the playful. Look what he does to ratatouille. Even its fans have to admit that the dish, a lump of stewed vegetables mired in a tar pit of olive oil, is usually no great beauty. Mr. Rickert's version is a colorful, bright, edible garden, a field of couscous across which he plants black olives, shards of feta, a bright green mound of basil ice cream and warm cherry tomatoes that dissolved into sweet pulp on my tongue like berries in a pie. The ingredients were strewn all across the plate, but the flavors were firmly rooted. That was the case, too, with a dessert of late-summer damson plums that appeared in three guises: stuffed into a tender dumpling, frozen into sorbet and poached with cinnamon syrup. Weinsinn is compact, with only 35 seats in two small dining rooms. So is Mr. Rickert's menu of three appetizers, three main courses and three desserts. The wine list, on the other hand, goes on for page after page, although there is a simpler way. We asked the sommelier, Jens Gabelmann, to choose for us. He sized up our table at a glance and brought us just the wine we might have asked for if we had been able to put our wishes into words. Weinsinn is perpetually full but not a scene; all the action is on the plates and in the glasses. The owners, Matthias Scheiber and Milica Trajkovska, his wife, say they borrowed the idea of serving serious food and drink for reasonable prices in a lively, informal room from French places like La R\u00e9galade. \"The bistronomy movement does not exist in Germany,\" Mr. Scheiber said. Traditionally, he continued, restaurant cooking in his country isn't taken seriously unless it \"comes out of hotels\" with highly formal dining rooms. The Best of a Long-Ago Empire Across the city is the current headquarters of Mario Lohninger, a chef who has cooked at restaurants formal (he ran the kitchen at the greatly missed Danube, in Manhattan, when it won three stars from The New York Times ) and informal (after Danube closed, he founded Silk, a \"bed-restaurant\" in a Frankfurt nightclub where patrons wore slippers and ate lying down). Three years ago he opened Lohninger in an elbow-shaped, salmon-colored building on the south bank of the Main River. The name is not egotism. This is a Lohninger family production, where Mr. Lohninger's father works by his side in the kitchen and his mother patrols the dining room with a protective eye. When she spotted a runaway squiggle of spaetzle on my white tablecloth, she clucked softly and scurried off to get a crumb sweeper. Mr. Lohninger has an instinct for locating the most pleasurable component of a dish and then intensifying it. Schmaltz piled onto brown bread is good, and so Mr. Lohninger's schmaltz, sweet with pur\u00e9ed pumpkin and crunchy with flakes of crisp chicken skin, must be very, very good. It is. It arrives once you have chosen from the menu, which is split into parts that mirror Mr. Lohninger's life. One side is called The World. On it, far-flung ingredients turn up like souvenirs from his time abroad. This is where you will find his interpretation of the black cod that he first ate in New York, served in a smoky broth with radish cannelloni. The other side of the menu is called Childhood. These are dishes from his native Austria, like the supple ravioli filled with creamy melted cheese and the beef-cheek goulash, a deeply aromatic stew made with sweet and hot paprika. The Austro-Hungarian Empire fell apart about 55 years before Mr. Lohninger was born, but his goulash may be its crowning achievement. A Safe Choice or a Dizzying Gamble In Munich, I ran into another split-personality menu at a restaurant called Geisels Werneckhof. In this case, the division results from the restaurant's, and perhaps the city's, cautious approach to change. For years the place served traditional food to residents of its snug neighborhood close to the English Garden. Two years ago, it was taken over by the Geisel family, but the landlady made them promise not to touch the leaded-glass windows, the chandeliers that still burn candles or any of the other classic German details in the dining room. She gave them free rein to change the kitchen, though. Tohru Nakamura took her up on it. The chef since April, Mr. Nakamura was born in Munich and learned to cook there before going off to study new techniques at restaurants in Japan and the Netherlands. To get the effects he had learned abroad, he had the kitchen outfitted with induction cooktops, a teppanyaki griddle, liquid nitrogen tanks and a Big Green Egg ceramic grill. Now he was ready for the new international style of cooking. The Werneckhof's regulars weren't, though -- not all of them. For them, Mr. Nakamura devotes one-half of his menu to fairly uncomplicated, if refined, dishes in which a single, familiar ingredient carries the tune. His lean and precise artichoke barigoule, rounded out with a classically thick artichoke velout\u00e9 and a fat poached oyster, won't scare anybody except those who fear harmonious flavors and luxurious textures. The other half of the menu can get pretty far out there, at least by Munich standards. I was deeply impressed by an elaborate composition of tender octopus, ginger-marinated squid, potatoes boiled with onions and bacon, and strips of daikon smoked in the Big Green Egg. Nothing too outrageous about this, but things got complicated in the sauce department: there was a Parmesan cream, a jelly of bone marrow, a miso gel, a garlicky aioli, a drizzle of browned butter, and a rustic vinaigrette with capers and anchovies. When Mr. Nakamura later detailed the dish for me, I felt as dizzy as if I had stepped out onto an airplane wing. At the time, though, I mostly noticed that every last thing on the plate was delicious. Keeping the Joy on the Menu The half-old, half-new menu at Geisels Werneckhof reminded me of something Justin Leone, an American sommelier working at a very good Munich restaurant called Tantris , had written to me in an e-mail. Compared with fad-chasing Americans, he wrote, Bavarians have \"a tremendous appreciation for consistency and longevity.\" To see a city that was crazy for a taste of the new, he advised me to hit Berlin. Perhaps the most dynamic chef in Berlin is Tim Raue, who as a teenager ran with a street gang in the Kreuzberg neighborhood and then found his home in restaurant kitchens. By 2010, he had opened a place of his own around the corner from Checkpoint Charlie, Restaurant Tim Raue, but he wanted it to be different from the formal, classical, French-influenced dining rooms that he believed were draining the joy out of German fine dining. \"I wanted to have a restaurant in Germany where people could be happy,\" he said. His menu was built around bright, exciting flavors from China, Vietnam and Thailand. To let customers know that fun was not forbidden, he dressed his dining room staff in Chuck Taylor high-tops. The sneakers put a spring in their steps, although when my server pulled on a single white glove to set down clean silverware, I couldn't stop humming \"Thriller.\" And I was almost ready to moonwalk when I tasted the restaurant's Chinese-style suckling pig. A fold of pork belly had been red-cooked and then deep-fried, giving it a gentle sweetness under a terrifically crunchy layer of skin. I couldn't make up my mind whether I liked it better dipped in the little pile of salt and Sichuan peppercorns, or dredged in a reduction made from pigs' feet and dried tangerine peel. At times, the kitchen's palate skewed a bit sweeter than mine, but the suckling pig was supported by a refreshingly tart sour salad of spiral lily buds, tangerine sections and marinated endive. And a jellied veal terrine at lunch was showered with a riotous Vietnamese-inflected salad of lettuce, mint, green apples and pickled shallots. Mr. Raue, who has opened two more restaurants this year, seems to get Berlin's young, international spirit. About a third of Berlin's 3 million or so people arrived within the last decade or so. Of the recent arrivals, those from the United States are the most visible, or at least the most audible. I heard English almost everywhere I went in Berlin, starting in the taxi from the airport when a radio disc jockey interrupted his German patter with four words I understood perfectly: \"American-style food carts.\" What They'll Do for Good Pastrami Like Brooklyn or Portland, Ore., Berlin is now full of cooks trying to make a living out of barbecue, bao and other populist staples. For sheer determination and stubbornness, I doubt many of them can match Paul Mogg and Oskar Melzer, who opened a New York-style deli because they couldn't find an easier way to get a good pastrami sandwich. They sampled pastrami imports, hoping for greatness. \"These packages were showing up with the Statue of Liberty on the package, and the pastrami was so dry and sweet it was like a candy cane,\" said Mogg & Melzer's chef, Joey Passarella. A native of Nyack, N.Y., Mr. Passarella met his partners while cooking in Berlin restaurants. After some arm-twisting, he agreed to take on the task of brining briskets in the restaurant's basement and smoking them in the backyard. His pastrami is quietly smoky, noticeably peppery, not too salty, flagrantly pink. Sliced and layered on excellent, fresh, un-spongy rye modeled on the bread from Schwartz's deli in Montreal and spread with a close approximation of brown deli mustard from D\u00fcsseldorf, it adds up to a pastrami on rye that only a handful of delis in New York can match. Mogg & Melzer stretches a short distance outside the deli genre. There is a br\u00fbl\u00e9ed chicken liver mousse, for instance, and a compact but thoughtful wine list. If you come in the morning, you can ask your server for lox dusted with fresh horseradish and chives on a chewy, unsweetened hand-rolled bagel, which you can't do at Katz's in Manhattan , and watch the cooks working behind glass shelves lined with house-made beet pickles bob their heads to rap while steam rises from superbly light and jiggly cheesecakes resting on the window ledge. In a hall outside their deli is a small exhibition on the history of the building. It housed a school for Jewish girls built in 1930, when the neighborhood was one of Berlin's Jewish quarters. The Nazi government closed the school in 1942, and most of the students and teachers were deported and killed. Through the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, the building was handed over to the Jewish community in 2009. It now houses art galleries, a museum dedicated to the Kennedy family and restaurants, including Mogg & Melzer. That Jewish food is now cooked and eaten there certainly resonates in many directions. And I would like the building's story to have a happy ending. But I can't honestly write that the pastrami and bagels and cheesecake have any meaning that is deeper than their own quality. They are simply very good.

The restaurant under my microscope today is in a basement. It is closed four nights out of seven. Its sole offering is a $100 tasting menu that is not posted in advance. Substitutions are not allowed. And the name is impossible to say with a straight face: Le Restaurant. Now the good news. The basement, under a food market in TriBeCa called All Good Things , is a cozy place. The blond furniture, the pair of white candles suspended from a long row of wooden coat pegs, and the smell of wood smoke all transport you out of New York to some other place -- maybe a soothing, if somber, cabin by a Swedish lake. In the coming weeks, the narrow window of dinner service will be thrown open to five nights. Finally, if you are an omnivore, if you dream about uncommon ingredients and pure, focused flavors, then Ryan Tate's tasting menus are absolutely worth it. A dinner in April began with salmon mousse sandwiched between airy fennel-seed meringues. The flavors were gentle, but they got my attention, and the next course drew me in deeper. Here were gooseneck barnacles, long tubes ending in multifaceted beaks; they looked like the sawed-off legs of a Victorian piano. Swiped in melted butter and chopped spring garlic, the barnacles tasted a bit like the necks of steamer clams, but they were far more tender and much sweeter. Half of a roasted bird showed up next, its one leg stretched out, its foot curled in. It was a woodcock, one of the most prized game birds. That foot was weird but the meat was good, ruddy, juicy and strong. Just before dessert, I had my first bite of water buffalo. The soft and mild roasted loin wasn't as deeply satisfying as beef or bison, but still I went home wondering why we Americans eat the same three or four species almost every night and then complain that the main course wasn't as interesting as the appetizer. Mr. Tate, Le Restaurant's chef and a partner, wonders, too. \"I'm always looking for alternatives to the status quo of beef, chicken, lamb,\" he said in a phone interview. \"These are things we've all tasted hundreds of times if we're carnivores.\" In his last job, he got a glimpse of the status quo repeated indefinitely. He was the chef de cuisine of Savoy , in SoHo, when Ed Levine proclaimed on the Serious Eats blog that Savoy's cheeseburger \"deserves a place in New York's burger pantheon.\" Suddenly almost every customer wanted dinner on a bun. At Le Restaurant, which he opened in March, variety reigns. Mr. Tate aims to revise at least half the menu every day. He has a second job that helps him do this, as the food buyer of All Good Things, ordering sea creatures, meats and odd lettuces that often end up in his kitchen. Tasting menus ask a lot of customers, but at Le Restaurant, we are rewarded with ingredients that would be hard to sell \u00e0 la carte. Mr. Tate works in a contemporary mode, mixing new techniques with very old ones. Vegetables are at least as prominent as meat and fish. Flavor is pulled from within far more often than it is applied to the surface by, say, spices and herbs. Chefs who study enough photographs of this cooking style can imitate the look, but not the taste, which ought to seem as if it comes from a time when flavors were more pure. That requires determination and, maybe, secret knowledge. A few weeks ago at Le Restaurant, I ate skate so rich and tender I thought Mr. Tate had found a part of the piscine anatomy that nobody had noticed before. A soft fennel broth and bursting sections of pink grapefruit made fine partners for the skate, but the important alchemy had happened in the pan, when the fish was stewed in olive oil blended with dried, air-cured black olives. The sweet, tangy ingredient that made a bowl of long agnolotti with peas and a warm, nearly liquid egg so seductive? House-made cheese, slowly evaporated until it had shrunk to a dense, caramelized brick that was shaved over the pasta. In the style made famous by Noma in Copenhagen , some courses are served by the cooks who made them. When the man at the end of the plate is Amadou Ly, the pastry chef and a veteran of Mas and Tocqueville , it's a sure bet that something delicious is in store. It might be as plain as a candied chestnut and a spoonful of pur\u00e9ed, maple-spiked sweet potatoes with a little brown butter, or a more complex grouping of sweet strawberries, oil of mint, little beads filled with liquefied chocolate and panna cotta infused with lemon verbena. Whatever it is, Mr. Ly's desserts have a gentle, natural spirit that feels right after Mr. Tate's savory courses. There is a little more bad news. (There always is.) The greeting and the first few minutes of my meals were so rocky that I wasn't completely sure I was in a restaurant, let alone Le Restaurant. One night, I showed up without a reservation. The Web site had said walk-ins were welcome at the counter, but nobody seemed to know what to do with me. An employee in the market asked what I wanted and told me to wait at the top of the stairs. Five minutes went by. Finally, I started down on my own and was met halfway by a host. He seemed surprised and not entirely pleased to see me there. \"Do you have any seats at the counter?\" I asked. He gave me the same look that a butler answering the door in a dark old mansion on a hill gives a solitary traveler whose car has broken down. \"I'm not sure we can accommodate you,\" he said. Silently, he turned and descended the stairs. He really should have been carrying a torch, but I followed him anyway. Eight stools were lined up at the counter. Seven were empty. Still without speaking, he pointed at one and walked away. Somewhere in the night, a wolf howled. But there is more good news: once I was settled in, service was unfailingly smooth and professional. I received sound advice on wines, which I appreciated because at Le Restaurant you never know what's coming next. Menus, handwritten on construction paper, don't arrive until dinner is over. As for the name, Mr. Tate said that he and Kyle Wittels, who owns All Good Things, called the place Le Restaurant \"to be somewhat funny.\" So if you laugh, at least you'll be laughing with them.

The snouts and I were in Whiskey Soda Lounge Ny, which the chef Andy Ricker opened in August. It serves as a way station where people can nosh and drink and watch Muay Thai highlight reels while waiting for a table at Mr. Ricker's Pok Pok Ny down the street. Whiskey Soda Lounge is more than that, though. It's also a gallery of Thailand's bar snacks, which you almost never see in the United States except at Mr. Ricker's other Whiskey Soda Lounge, in Portland, Ore. Along with Khe-Yo, a new Laotian-inspired restaurant in TriBeCa, Whiskey Soda Lounge joins a busy crowd of kitchens turning New Yorkers on to Asian dishes that we might have treated with extreme caution not long ago. New Yorkers will pinch raw tripe in miso between chopsticks at Takashi in the West Village, rip crisp folds of grilled chicken skin from skewers at Hanjan in Chelsea, and line up for the softer morsels of a lamb's head at the scattered outposts of Xi'an Famous Foods . Our pain threshold for spice is rapidly climbing, too. Blistering Isan cuisine has been taking over the Thai scene, and incendiary Sichuan food is turning up all over, riding a great orange tide of chile oil. Whiskey Soda Lounge, in the Columbia Street Waterfront District in Brooklyn, feeds the city's appetites for both spice and novelty. To tell the truth, that pig snout was so leathery that chewing on it was like getting nourishment from an old football. But I dug into the crunchy pig tails and invitingly tender pork tongue beside it on the plate, a constant special, dipping them into a dark and intense sauce called jaew, made from soy, dried chilies and toasted ground rice. Jaew turned up again with deep-fried strips of marinated pork called muu sawan, a sweet, crunchy and irresistible species of jerky. Offal anchors the tom saep muu, a clay-pot soup in which a vivid hot-and-sour pork broth elevates the blunt flavors of chopped heart, liver and tripe. One spoonful reminds you that the first cook who combined chilies, lemon grass, Kaffir lime, galangal and lime juice deserved a Nobel Prize for aromatic sciences. The soup and some other spicy dishes are not murderously hot, but they are not meek, either. The dressings on two excellent salads -- yam plaa meuk, or squid with tomatoes and celery, and yam het huu nuu khao, tomatoes and scallions with ruffled white mouse-ear mushrooms -- had the kind of warmth you feel in your joints, not the kind that makes you want a tongue transplant. There are gentler dishes, too. A deep-fried Thai analogue to Scotch eggs, khai luuk khoei, comes with a relatively nonincendiary tamarind dipping sauce, although you can crank up the heat with bits of toasted dried chilies. One of Mr. Ricker's most lovable hits, the Vietnamese-style chicken wings marinated in fish sauce and garlic, can be ordered spicy or less spicy, and neither version is as fierce as the kind you'd find in a sports bar. Drink a cocktail if spiciness becomes an issue. Drink a cocktail in any case, because the ones at Whiskey Soda Lounge, like Pok Pok Ny, are fun and refreshing, and because the food almost demands it. Few items, except for maybe the wings, are substantial enough to be main courses. Still, you can easily put together a satisfying meal out of a few snacks, a salad and divots of sticky rice. It isn't a going-out-to-dinner kind of night, but it makes a great field trip with one or two other bar-stool travelers. Khe-Yo, opened in July by the chef Marc Forgione and Soulayphet Schwader, one of his longtime cooks, works the other way around. It's easy to navigate the menu, with appetizers and main courses heavy on animal protein serving as recognizable landmarks. But while much of the food is very appealing, not all of it makes you feel as if you've left home. The most intriguing flavors hide out in Khe-Yo's sauces. Grilled black bass that comes to the table with its blackened head staring up like a totem is ordinary until you wrap it in lettuce with a funky, salty jam of tamarind and peanuts. This makes it great. A similar transformation happens when you dip the sesame beef jerky in a thick paste of assorted dried smoked chilies pounded with galangal. The condiment is as dark and glossy as shoe polish, and the peppers contribute both fruitiness and spice that make it wonderfully complex. Meals at Khe-Yo always begin with sticky rice in a bamboo basket, along with two sauces. One is an eggplant mash, with the funky, salty taste of fish sauce. The other is called bang-bang sauce, fresh red chilies and cilantro pounded in a mortar with lime juice and fish sauce. Its genuine heat can improve some of the underspiced dishes you might run into later on, like the excessively mild-mannered laap salads (the one with sliced duck breast and braised and fried tongues is the most compelling) and the lackluster grilled chicken. It doesn't help the meek papaya salad, though, which needs more chilies before it leaves the kitchen. Servers invariably described the sticky rice and sauce combo as \"our bread and butter service.\" This hand-holding feels superfluous for New York in 2013, as does the repeated instruction to wrap food and herbs in lettuce to \"create your own perfect bite.\" The cooking of Laos is rare in the city, to be sure, but certain dishes and ingredients overlap with those of northern Thailand next door, and at this late date the lettuce wrap probably needs no introduction. A highly skilled cook with a sharp eye for ingredients, Mr. Schwader was born in Laos and moved to Kansas with his family when he was 3 years old. Right now his menu is a little more timidly westernized than it needs to be, but his kitchen may become bolder as he gets a sense of how far New Yorkers are willing to go. Meanwhile, diners hungry to try a few Lao dishes in unreconstructed form can go a few blocks south to Mangez Avec Moi at 71-73 West Broadway, (212) 385-0008. Its name isn't promising, nor is its \"authentic pan-Asian cuisine\" tagline. But after 4 p.m., the chef, Jeannie Ongkeo, sends out a short Lao menu. Her papaya salad hummed with fresh chilies and fermented seafood, and her nam kao, a crispy rice salad with shredded coconut, had a taut balance of hot, sour, salty and sweet. My favorite was \"or stew,\" a murky bowl of slippery mushrooms and eggplant cooked with Kaffir lime, lemon grass and branches of fresh dill. It was the first time I've tasted flavors quite like it, but I hope not the last.

Paul Liebrandt 's cooking challenged you to pay attention. The precisely calibrated flavors might be contained in a single mouthful, or might unscroll themselves as you ate your way across several plates. The harmonies were multilayered, and so were the rewards. Corton earned three stars from The New York Times and two from Michelin, yet the acclaim didn't translate into the kind of love that fills dining rooms. While other restaurants serving far less compelling food at similar prices were booked weeks ahead, tables at Corton could often be found with just a few hours' notice. This seemed wrong to me, and it must have seemed wrong to Mr. Liebrandt, too. This summer, he opened the Elm in a new hotel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, extricating himself from Corton weeks later. \"Honestly, I wanted to do a restaurant that would reach a clientele that would never, ever have come to Corton,\" he told the blog Grub Street . Corton was hushed; the Elm plays music. Corton's tiny bar seemed like a waiting room; the Elm's is a hangout. Corton's menu offered two tasting menus, one long and the other longer; the Elm's lets you drop in for a bite, a meal or something in between. You can study the food or just eat it while in the background Jarvis Cocker sings, \"I want to live like common people, I want to do whatever common people do.\" The Elm, in other words, would be just like a hundred other restaurants if not for Mr. Liebrandt. He has ratcheted down the complexity and the number of surprises in his cooking. This could have dumbed down the cuisine, but it has focused its pleasures instead. He has tied one hand behind his back and made that seem like an advantage. A dish called Flavors of Bouillabaisse, in quotation marks, sounds ominous, as if the Proven\u00e7al classic has been turned into edible powders. It is lovely. Mr. Liebrandt has kept it in seafood-stew form but rearranged the emphasis. He leans strongly on the sweet perfume of fennel and orange peel in the luxurious, halfway-sweet emulsion that swirls around razor clams, oysters, bits of lobster and a brick of meaty tilefish. How do you eat something called Summer Garden? When a black Dutch oven arrived at the table, filled with what our server called \"literally around 50 different vegetables and fruits\" bobbing in a green herb sauce, we plunged into the chaos. Some of those vegetables were raw, some were pickled, some were roasted, some were braised; all tasted extremely fresh and delicious. Instead of appetizers and main courses, Mr. Liebrandt's menu puts forth mix-and-match categories called Raw, Sea, Land and Share, with so much overlap that the point is hard to follow. Foie gras torchon, listed under Raw, was of course cooked before it was topped, thrillingly, with pickled strawberry jelly and pungent cracked long pepper. More confounding is the Share category, where Mr. Liebrandt seems to be trying to catch the large-format wave without changing the way he composes his plates. Except for the Summer Garden, these consist of two main-course servings of one dish arranged inside a casserole or pan that played no apparent role in its preparation. It's your job to transfer each element to a plate. So, for example, turbot stuffed with a pale green vein of leek mousse has to be fished out with two spoons and dropped unsteadily upon a bowl of summer beans. There is no reason not to do all this work in the kitchen. My turbot certainly lost something in the journey, including whatever warmth it once had. The chicken Kiev had less to lose. Mr. Liebrandt prepares the log of white meat without the traditional bark of fried bread crumbs that makes it crunchy fun to eat. Once you've stabbed the skin and watched the melted butter gush out, the show is over. From his days at Atlas and Papillon in the early 2000s, Mr. Liebrandt has had a fearless palate that didn't try to please everybody. So it's a little surprising that the few disappointments at the Elm err on the side of dullness. Blobs of Mr. Liebrandt's swell homage to HP sauce couldn't salvage one of the Land courses, a long-cooked short rib that was dry and dull and, on one of the two nights I tried it, almost as gray as pot roast. But while you can find a couple of sleepwalkers on nearly any menu, you'd be lucky to find just one dish as good as Flavors of Bouillabaisse. The Elm has at least a half-dozen that equal or surpass it, and none of them is more than $30. I stopped noticing bacon in restaurant cooking a long time ago, but I was almost knocked on my back by the intensity of the spicy, smoky bacon XO sauce that lifts a beet salad to a higher plane of awesomeness. The gnudi splayed around a browned sea scallop were a little sticky, but I forgot that, once I tasted their wildly rich coconut-milk sauce, lush with Kaffir lime and galangal. And there is nothing safe or dull about the charred eggplant pur\u00e9e beside the lamb neck. Terrifyingly black and shiny, like nothing that humans are meant to eat, it has a deep and enduring flavor that goes on even longer than the taste of the gorgeously sticky lamb, and that is saying something. My reservations about the shared plates definitely do not extend to the fruit tart for two, a conglomeration of meringue chips, berries, lemon grass marshmallows and flowers that shows up under a glass cloche looking like a prom corsage. In fact, I had no reservations about any of Jeffrey Sytsma's desserts, or about the wedge of aged goat cheese from Vermont Creamery that the Elm serves with pistachio croutons and a twisted band of apricot. I could complain that the dining room, in the open basement of the King & Grove Williamsburg hotel , isn't as fixated on the details as the kitchen is. The servers were amiable, but apt to say things like \"How's that lamb working out for you?\" when not mangling the pronunciation of \"Eton mess\" in a way that Eton's headmasters would have once rewarded with a caning. When a fork clattered to the concrete floor, nobody noticed. And the phrase that runs through my mind each time I look at the bulbous glass lamps on the ends of long, thin, bent rods is \"alien probes.\" Building a restaurant that can keep company with Mr. Liebrandt is no easy job, however. \"You'll never live like common people,\" Jarvis Cocker is singing now. \"You'll never do what common people do.\" ", "rec_dishes": ["Foie gras", "Flavors of Bouillabaisse", "gnudi", "Atlantic skate", "Elysian Fields lamb", "duck", "Summer Garden", "fruit tart for two", "milk chocolate palet."]}, {"id": 140, "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-lake-pavilion-in-flushing-queens.html", "review_text": " \"Uh-oh,\" I said under my breath. \"Is there a wedding here tonight?\" I tried not to sound nervous. I'd talked seven people from three boroughs into traveling to this Cantonese restaurant in Flushing, Queens, about a mile south of the Flushing stops on the 7 train and the Long Island Rail Road. But I hadn't made a reservation. The dining room seats slightly fewer people than Citi Field. The only way we might have trouble getting a table would be if the entire place had been rented out by a couple about to walk hand in hand into marital bliss. And that's exactly how it looked. A classical white arbor stood at the entrance, threaded with silk rosebuds. Lavender swags had been draped from the rafters, and lavender napkins were propped up in the water goblets. Shiny gold curtains hung in the windows, and enormous bows in pink or burgundy flopped from the back of every chair. Servers were buzzing around, immaculately dressed in black suits with red bow ties or striped neckties. But no, there was no wedding. Lake Pavilion looks like that every night. It is almost certainly New York's snazziest banquet-style Cantonese restaurant located in a former diner. Since its opening last year, it has shimmered above the Main Street exit on the Long Island Expressway in a squiggle of blue neon. Off the main dining room, in a string of private rooms marked by varieties of tea spelled out in red LEDs, Chinese families salute birthdays and other milestones with lobsters the size of single-engine planes. For the rest of us, finding a Cantonese seafood restaurant as good as Lake Pavilion is a reason to get a group together. By day, dim sum trolleys cruise the dining room like a fleet of dumpling-laden Zambonis. The real interest, though, is in the menu, which goes on for about a dozen pages and does not waste any of them on Chinese-American silliness. This kitchen is as serious as any in the city about Cantonese classics, along with a few more recent notions from Hong Kong. If Dungeness crabs are in season and you do not have a life-threatening allergy, please order them. Get them stir-fried with ginger and scallions, their cracked legs and deep-dish bodies sticky with a sauce that will end up everywhere while you pull the meat from the shells: on your lips and nose and thumbs and probably your earlobes. At least as delicious and certainly less gooey is the house special, a casserole of Dungeness crab stacked up on sticky rice that's been lightly browned while being turned and tossed with roasted peanuts, garlic chives, ham, onion and liberal strafings of fried garlic. When the crabs scuttle offstage between seasons, you could bide your time with clams in \"hot spicy XO sauce.\" It looks like soup, the clams submerged in sauce that is not just hot and spicy but also sour, salty and really deeply funky. The sauce gets aromatic depth from onions and bell peppers and a lovely lift from lemon peel, and it's so intense that the clams taste as if they've been stewing in it for hours, yet they're barely cooked. Stringy, yellowing water spinach and \"crispy fried chicken\" with garlic, which was neither crisp nor garlicky, were the only cases in which I wasn't rewarded for testing my luck with the menu. Sometimes I pointed at a photo of something I wouldn't have ordered otherwise. This is how I came to try the bizarrely compelling sea scallops in a black pepper sauce that seemed to belong on a TV dinner steak. When nobody was looking, I kept stealing another scallop from inside the circular green hedge of broccoli, convinced that what I was doing was somehow wrong, and not caring. Menu pictures also helped me give mayonnaise prawns another chance. In other restaurants I'd been left cold, not to mention bewildered, by the combination of fried shrimp, candied walnuts and lemony, MSG-laced mayonnaise. Lake Pavilion adds deep-fried pillows of thickened condensed milk. I am not sure why I loved this particular version. I'm not even sure why the dish exists, but I am glad it does. Should you want to drive deeper into unusual terrain, I can recommend the goose webs in a casserole with bok choi and Chinese black mushrooms. The thick, floppy webs, which you suck from the goose's bony toes, had a fascinatingly earthy flavor that reminded me a little of fresh pork belly. If that doesn't fully scratch your itch for adventure, do try the screw clams. Stir-fried with snow peas and yellow chives, they look a bit like squid, crunch slightly between your teeth and have a faint, delicate flavor. Screw clams are not clams. They are often called osmanthus mussels, although they are not mussels, either. They're organs extracted from sea cucumbers, which are not, of course, vegetables. But there is no shame in having something as simple as the excellent stir-fried lamb chops, whose only sauce is a little oil deeply flavored with browned garlic and shallots, or something as old-school as Peking duck. Lake Pavilion does the dish beautifully, shearing off rectangles of skin with a cleaver and tucking them inside yeasty steamed buns dabbed with a little hoisin. The soft buns make a much more satisfying foil for the crisp skin than the pancakes you usually see in New York, and by the time the rest of the duck had been carved, our table was still passing around the platter of little sandwiches, going back for just one more. A group of six or eight is about right for the duck, and for Lake Pavilion. But look out for the gentle upsell. Order one lobster or Dungeness crab, and your server may ask if your gang wouldn't be better off with two. If you want a fish netted in a splash from the tanks by the door, you may at first be shown the species that cost $35 a pound, $75, or more. Ask for cheaper options, like a speckled grouper from Mexico that emerged dense and moist from the steamer, and cost less than $20 a pound. Your server may not push a $110 bowl of shark fin soup, still legal until next summer, but may suggest an off-menu soup served in a hollowed-out winter melon for around $50. Politely decline in favor of the more humble winter melon soup that's on the menu, its homespun chicken broth full of sweet seafood and ginger slivers. A pot that serves the whole table is $12.95. I can happily report that when I ordered a drink, nobody tried to upgrade me to the 2009 Opus One for $350. I got a Tsingtao, no questions asked.

Anyone can slap burrata on a plate and wait for the moaning to start. But order it anyway, so you can see what happens when Mr. Mattos puts this louche, voluptuous cheese on a juice cleanse. The burrata sits like whipped cream on charred bread. Soaking into the bread and pooling around it is a brooding green liquid pressed from lovage, sorrel, celery and other foliage. It looks like something you would force yourself to drink after doing very bad things to your body. Ingesting it with burrata must be some kind of preventive medicine, the after-midnight ibuprofen with a bourbon chaser. That's not what it feels like, though. When this fatty sprawl of dairy is brought to heel with fresh and grassy vegetable juice, it becomes something you taste, not something that washes over you in a big creamy wave. It's strange but it's right. Strange food is often born from a need to kill boredom, ours or the cook's. It can keep kitchen and dining room awake through what would otherwise be another night of spaghetti and salad. Mr. Mattos's cooking at Estela has a mild case of weirdness. It is just unfamiliar enough that I had eaten about a meal and a half there before it dawned on me that nearly everything is Mediterranean, more or less. I should have seen that one coming, given that Mr. Mattos, who grew up in Uruguay , cooked at Chez Panisse for a year and Il Buco for five. The cooking is almost familiar, but not quite, and it's the little differences that get under your skin. The flatbread served with an excellent potato-thickened mash of salt cod is a rye matzo. And a whole squid and a spring onion, both griddled on a plancha and served with a reasonably traditional Romesco of red peppers and hazelnuts, look like a leathery, podlike alien creature alongside a blackened stem that snakes down the plate. The mild strangeness drew my attention to how deep and elemental the flavors of both dishes were. Mild strangeness hasn't always been Mr. Mattos's preferred line of attack. When he was the chef at Isa , in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, he reveled in deep, surrealist weirdness. His best-known dish there was fried sardine skeleton, which looked as if it belonged behind glass at a museum of natural oddities. I remember rattling my jaw on nearly raw grains and getting my first taste of sweet potato leaves, which until then I had thought were poisonous. Estela, which Mr. Mattos opened with two partners, Mark Connell and a wine-guy-slash-general-manager named Thomas Carter, is far less confrontational in ways that go beyond the kitchen. Within two seconds of climbing the steps to this spare and intimate little dining room, you know that there will be a speech on how the menu works, that most of the dishes will be small, that sharing will be encouraged, that the noise level will climb steeply, that the meal will cost more than the menu prices lead you to believe. (This is a particular danger if you aren't careful with wines, because Mr. Carter leads us into three-digit temptation much more often than you'd expect from a list that's relatively compact.) The dishes aren't composed of pixel-size bits of food that have to be divided by laser surgery; they generally share well. This is a good start, but then Estela, like many small-plates restaurants, neglects the so-called share plates that you actually eat from if you treat each new creation from the kitchen as a serving platter. The share plates at Estela are no bigger than tea saucers, and are rarely swapped out. One night assorted juices and sauces from eight recipes swirled together before a fresh plate came along. It was like seeing eight movies projected on the same screen at once. New or bigger plates would help you to focus on the energetic crackle Mr. Mattos gives beef tartare by folding fried sunchoke chips into the raw meat, or the low growl of spice he lends to a fried egg and gigante beans by pairing them with bread cubes dunked in harissa. Ingredients that don't appear to have been tampered with often have a depth of flavor that takes you by surprise. There's the invisible pop of yuzu and grapefruit hiding inside wheels of uncooked summer squash arranged like scales over intensely sweet raw scallops and pur\u00e9ed avocado. There's the lemon that perks up white rounds of kohlrabi dressed, simply and wonderfully, with shards of fossa cheese, mint and crushed, toasted hazelnuts. There are usually only four large plates (what we once quaintly called main courses), but Mr. Mattos makes them count. Cod is briefly salt-cured and slowly pan-seared until it surrenders into soft, meaty flakes. Pork shoulder is as juicy and red as steak, and the steak is something else again. As he does in other dishes, Mr. Mattos uses flecks of char almost as a spice. With the pulse-quickening slices of beef, the blackened edges from charred eggplant get together with the oily intensity of anchovies for an irresistible roughness and force. Desserts look simple. O.K., they are simple (there is a panna cotta and three low-key sundaes based on grapefruit, chocolate or blueberry sorbet). But Estela's consulting pastry wizard, Alex Grunert, gives each one a little snap, crackle and pop, and they end up being more satisfying than some high-end sugar landscapes. Early on, it's true, there was a sardine dish that was like a public repudiation of the one at Isa, replacing weirdness with dullness. And the night I found that the matzo was being served with drably spiced egg salad instead of that great whipped cod, I felt as if I had traded a classic six for a studio. It doesn't matter. Mr. Mattos is not trying to shock us, but he is not trying to pacify us with the tried and true, either. It's a thin line he's walking, and if he didn't wobble occasionally, that would be truly strange.

The rest of the city looked up from a collective hangover at their flashy outfits and expectant smiles and said, \"Um, the party's kind of over, dude.\" Armani Ristorante, inside the Armani store on Fifth Avenue in Midtown, was one of those late arrivals. The mood in the city was humbled, downsized, frightened, and here was an expensive restaurant reached by a private elevator from the street or, better, a sinuous white ramp that twisted past two floors of gowns and luxury leather goods like a floating catwalk. After a lunch there in early 2009, Frank Bruni, then the New York Times restaurant critic, wrote a blog post noting that \"the whole thing just feels sort of tone-deaf and odd.\" He never reviewed the restaurant, which seemed likely to end up in the same landfill where they'd deposited the carcass of Lehman Brothers. Some people's money is more durable than others', though. Giorgio Armani apparently kept pumping his into the restaurant, his first in New York. Here it is today, as another New York Fashion Week sashays to a close. The restaurant's kitchen is now under Sandro Romano, who arrived last spring after seven years as chef de cuisine at the Modern . The catwalk is intact, and tiny blue and purple lights still twinkle in the windows over Fifth Avenue. The white circular booths with black leather tops are still there, too, looking like the Mad Tea Party ride at Disney World, transported to Armani World. Dolled up like that, Armani Ristorante will always be somewhat odd. But since the stock indexes hit record highs in August, it hasn't seemed quite as tone deaf. With main courses averaging around $35, it is cheaper than (don't laugh) Carbone , and in the same range as some Upper East Side Italian stalwarts where the cooking and service aren't as refined. If the prices are out of touch, then so are large patches of Manhattan. Yes, if you ask for sparkling water, you will get Acqua Armani. Does the bottle, skinny as a fashion editor and stamped with a big block A, justify $11? I'd say no, but I'd say yes to the wine list, which has a surprisingly generous number of wines under $50. One night while I was scanning the Southern Italian whites, a sommelier materialized at my elbow and pointed right away to a crisp and sunny Sicilian grillo for $39. You'd have trouble matching that price at some downtown joints that pass as inexpensive. The sommelier did this without making me feel like a cheapskate. Another server showed similar discretion one night when a woman at my table immediately peeled back the glittering silver skin from a branzino fillet. \"Ah, but that's where all the flavor is,\" he protested briefly, then flashed a wide smile that beamed understanding. He was right about the skin. It was the best part of a lovely dish, its slight fattiness offset by cracked pink peppercorns and sage. Mr. Romano sets the fish on a green circle of Italian salsa verde made from arugula and fresh herbs blended with olive oil. The bright taste of the raw greens is just what this mild but meaty fish needs. Mr. Romano has a sensitive hand with seafood. It was on display on a long plate that held five raw tastes of the ocean, like branzino dyed purple by a bath in beet juice, and a sweet, firm langoustine with tart little bits of green apple. He mimics the look of seared sea scallops with short stacks of meltingly rich potato gratin. Shaved black truffles looked dramatic but didn't follow through with the expected flavor; all the pleasure was in the gentle interplay of the potatoes and scallops. The only seafood letdown was baby octopus, which had even less flavor than the truffles. Remarkably good polenta was wasted on those bland little legs. Pasta was a trickier proposition. Lasagnetta, a tower of roasted eggplant slices layered with tomato sauce, smoked scamorza and fresh pasta rolled very thin, was a little like eggplant Parmesan and a little like lasagna, but more delicate than either, getting restrained richness from basil oil and a Parmigiano-Reggiano sauce. Spaghetti and shaved dried tuna roe, on the other hand, got no help from slabs of tuna belly that were as mushy as a black banana. And green tagliolini was overdressed with a muddle of mushrooms and truffles and two whole langoustines dropped in the center of the bowl. Removing one accessory, Coco Chanel-style, would have focused the flavors and helped lower the ridiculous $38 price tag. I chalked both misfires up to an off night. They and other dishes didn't have the same sparkle I'd seen on my other two visits, making me wonder if Mr. Romano is still consolidating control over the kitchen. His menu is at its best when it takes its cues from the understated style of Milan, Mr. Armani's base of power. The rice in black risotto with speck-wrapped cuttlefish had precisely the firm but creamy texture it should. And when the bone-in veal chop Milanese showed up, I just sat there smiling for a minute because I could tell from the gorgeous, tanned crust how much fun I was going to have eating it. Apart from gravity-bound bomboloni, the desserts were worth giving up any dreams I might have of fitting into something sold by Armani other than a sofa . There is a fine molten chocolate cake, called a fondente, with an espresso gelato that has the licorice kick of Sambuca. A puff of raspberry mousse and tongues of meringue topped a barely set panna cotta. My favorite was the least traditional: an after-dinner salad of strawberries, and inky balsamic vinegar with micro-wedges of tomato and a refreshing basil gelato. While the prices aren't quite so out of step with the times, nobody would describe Armani Ristorante as of the moment. The tiny colored lights and view above the sidewalks always reminded me of two places from an earlier era: Windows on the World and the revolving lounge at the top of the Marriott Marquis in Times Square. I miss the first one and still like the second one, so maybe I'm the one who's late to Mr. Armani's party.

If you have, you've probably forgotten it, because it is just a gracefully tapering triangle of meat with golden skin. A purple-stemmed dandelion leaf lies on top of it, chanterelles and Hakurei turnips huddle at its side, a pool of jus gathers around it on a bone-white plate. In the race to become the most photographed cooked bird in the history of New York, it is no threat to the one at the NoMad. Once you taste Betony's, though, you aren't likely to forget it. None of the things that are supposed to taste like chicken do. Neither does most chicken, for that matter. This does, in a way that seems pure and undoctored. We taste flavors this clear when we're in the hands of a chef who obsesses over a dozen details of the kind that don't show up in a photograph. The chef at Betony is Bryce Shuman. Chances are you haven't seen much of his name yet, either, but you will. Mr. Shuman worked under Daniel Humm at Eleven Madison Park for almost six years, rising to executive sous-chef. For Betony, which opened on West 57th Street in Midtown this spring, he teamed up with a former captain from Eleven Madison Park, Eamon Rockey, now Betony's general manager. The wine director, Luke Wohlers, is another veteran. As you'd imagine, the two restaurants bear a family resemblance. The dining room staff, in crisp black and white, has the same military posture, which makes it that much more gratifying when they smile. Some of the E.M.P. ESP has made its way uptown, too. Servers often seemed to know what I needed before I did, although I'm not sure that my copy of The New Yorker required its own purse stool. Traces of Mr. Humm's style, minus the party tricks, show up in Mr. Shuman's cooking, especially in the way that the signs of hard work have been tucked out of sight. Betony's food has been fussed over, but it isn't fussy. The greatest appetizer, and this is a hard call, is a slice of seared foie gras under a crisp kale leaf. Plugged into the middle of the foie gras like a pink bullet is a circle of smoked pork hocks. A server pours a consomm\u00e9 made from the hocks over the top. That's it: liver, kale, ham broth, ham and some pickled black garlic. It is the most soulful foie gras I've ever tasted. Mr. Shuman makes a prettier, more conventional foie gras terrine and serves it with ripe berries, but I won't remember it as long as the hot foie gras dish, or even the chicken liver mousse. The mousse makes an unseductive entrance as a satiny ball that is a disquieting, back-of-the-refrigerator shade of green. Under the surface, which gets its color from parsley and its sheen from schmaltz, is a big scoop of whipped chicken liver that is almost as smooth and luxurious as the foie gras. It came with toast that I kept forgetting to use; I got all the crunch I needed by dragging the liver mousse through a trail of fried chicken skin and caraway-rye crumbs, and all the sweetness from a bright pur\u00e9e of green apples and chervil. Chicken liver spread, schmaltz, gribenes, seeded rye, apples, parsley: Is it Rosh Hashana already? Many of Mr. Shuman's dishes have familiar echoes like this. The pleasure they give you isn't exactly discovery. It's more like rediscovery. You already know that shellfish gets along with dill, but do you know that when you take impossibly tender and fresh lobster and cover it with a sauce that's been poured through tied bunches of fresh dill until the scent of the herb fills your lungs, you get something really wonderful? And, of course, you know that the browned hunks of fat on the edge of dry-aged beef can be a treat. But do you know what happens if you melt that fat and stew a short rib in it for two days, then sear the rib over white-hot charcoal? Mr. Shuman knows, and I'll bet that a year from now other chefs will know, too. Accessorized with grilled romaine and one perfectly fried sweetbread, it's a dish worth stealing. Betony's desserts, a collaboration between Mr. Shuman and Rebecca Isbell, the pastry sous-chef, don't land with the same force that the appetizers and main courses do. They're more scattered, although that complaint seems academic when you're eating a chocolate cr\u00e9meux whose flavors build and subside like a red wine, or chasing a red plum with a mouthful of spongecake drenched in perilla-plum syrup. My misgivings about the rest of the menu are mild ones. Warm tomatillo juice with a poached black bass fillet needed a sharper edge. And a cucumber salad with a last-minute application of pulverized frozen buttermilk that sent puffs of fog into the air and made the table look like a M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce video was fun for a minute, but the flavors weren't deep enough for the long haul. With almost every other dish, though, Mr. Shuman builds tastes that you want to keep going back to as long as you can. A dissident faction of eaters never bought the idea that all dishes larger than three or four bites become boring. When these people taste something they love, they don't feel boredom. They just want more. I suspect these people will descend on Betony with ravenous relief. Other diners may go once and never return because the elegance of the food and service are seriously out of joint with the space. The restaurant was originally built by its owner, Andrey Dellos, as Brasserie Pushkin, a Russian cafe with deliriously gaudy d\u00e9cor and food that seemed intended to remind wealthy expatriates why they had left the old country. When that concept failed, Mr. Dellos turned it into Betony, carting off the busty gilded caryatids and the murals of celestial nudes that seemed to be painted with pink cupcake frosting. But he left the ornate molded panels that almost look like real wood. And he left the cafe's basic layout, with a soaring bar so dramatic it manages to make both of the dining rooms, one upstairs and one down, feel like Siberia. The bar, with first-rate cocktails and clever if insubstantial snacks, hasn't completely caught on yet. If it does, it could make the diners in back feel even more cut off. It's a nontrivial problem, but it is treatable under an architect's care. But what would most help that dining room right now is a crowd. Betony deserves it.

Some restaurants are like that. Even if they don't have the mechanics down yet, their glimmers of originality can keep drawing you back. None of my five meals at the Pines since its opening late last summer in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn has been in the \"just awful\" category, but two were so frustrating I swore I'd never return. The opening line of my notes on one dinner reads, \"I am done with giving this place a chance.\" Three months later, I was back. That night, the Pines and its chef, Angelo Romano, were in control of their chords and the tempo from start to finish. Dinner began with a short glass of chilled soup, or maybe it was a virgin cocktail: tofu whipped with mint into a frothy green drink. Lolling at the bottom were juicy little Champagne grapes, a burst of sweetness lightening the intensity of the mint. Next was a salad. Wheels of yellow cucumber had been marinated with a yuzu green-chile paste to give them a citric tang and a low burn. They were set beside a pool of almond milk and stacked with thin medallions of more almond milk, this batch thickened to the texture of silken tofu. It was very good, and the next course was simply great: razor clams and trout roe with pinched squares of fresh pasta that Mr. Romano calls borsa vuota, or empty purses. The pasta seemed undercooked and under-clammed until I gave it a stir, sending the purses down to soften in the spicy miso-butter sauce, and bringing up a dividend of extra shellfish and slices of tiny hot red chiles. There had been flashes of excellence before that night, but they had been obscured by hospitality issues, strange kitchen decisions and checks whose totals had a way of ambushing me. The Pines, about a five-minute walk from the Gowanus Canal past windowless industrial buildings and stubby little houses, looks like an indie band sounds. Beat-up pressed tin ceilings have been nailed across some patches of wall, and others are covered in bare wood slats. Spooky dried flowers and herbs hang over the bar, evoking not a Tuscan farmhouse but an abandoned cabin being used for Wiccan rituals. Next to the kitchen is a signboard with cryptic handlettered slogans: Fugazi. Rainbows and Unicorns. Pray 4 Weezy. Beards: They Grow on You. Despite the untucked appearance of the Pines, it is surprisingly easy to spend what you would in a slick Manhattan restaurant. One night I'd rolled in like a drug dealer, hundreds of dollars stuffed in my pocket because I knew the Pines didn't take credit cards. Service was vague and distant. We waited interminably for food, cocktails, even glasses of wine. To settle the check at the end of a long, slow night, I needed about $100 more than I had brought. I knew from the Web site that there was an A.T.M. in the restaurant. It was broken. Lots of businesses are opening on Third Avenue around President Street, but the area is not yet one of the world's banking capitals. After a 10-minute search on foot, I got into my car and drove until I found a cash machine. On other nights, the food was perplexing. Mr. Romano, who cooked at Roberta's before striking out on his own at a short-lived Williamsburg restaurant called Masten Lake , has a discerning eye for prime ingredients, but isn't always as discerning about his ideas. Cappellacci that looked like bishop's miters were filled with a giddily tender and rich oxtail rag\u00f9, but the pasta was as thick as shoe box cardboard and nearly as stiff. The cappellacci were undercooked at other meals, too; apparently it's a feature. Coating sea urchin with crunchy BBs of toasted amaranth grains and serving it with tart, astringent sea buckthorn juice struck me as a mean thing to do to a nice, gentle ingredient. Most memorable was the squab -- dry-aged and roasted with its feet on -- that made the bird look as if it were running. It may have been running away from the oven, because one breast was still bloody. The raw-pigeon incident nearly ended my fascination with the Pines. Luckily, though, I remembered eating other things that were distinctive and skillfully prepared. On recent visits, such dishes have become the rule, not the exception. In the spring, Mr. Romano made the smart decision to treat ramp greens like spinach, saut\u00e9ing them to softness and surrounding them with a concentrated tart-sweet late-harvest vinegar. A fried duck egg and Marcona almonds balanced their garlicky bitterness. This summer, he dressed tender young purslane with a vibrant emulsion of mint and garlic. A savory foam of warmed egg yolks had been shot between the purslane branches, a lovely way of adding creaminess to the crisp greens. Mr. Romano is fond of esoteric ingredients like sea blight and Japanese knotweed, but he can wring terrific results out of more-common ones. Lightly cooked corn juice under slices of roasted pork shoulder offered profound, summery pleasure, and cabbage cooked with fish sauce, sambal and smoked pork jowl layered Asian flavors in an unexpected and very welcome way. And his choice of melted aged beef fat with chunks of bone marrow as a sauce doubled down on the beefy intensity of a Wagyu culotte steak. As my meals have been getting better, the restaurant has been growing up. The no-reservations policy was dropped. The service has become more polished and knowledgeable, ready to tell you what that glass of Slovenian refosco or other wines on Mr. Romano's willfully obscure list will taste like. And as of last week, the Pines accepts some credit cards. These civilities make it easier to take a chance on a night that costs a bit more than the cover charge and a beer at CBGB in 1975.

The year was 2002, the restaurant was called Fiamma , and he was just another hungry 29-year-old chef from the Midwest. We didn't know yet that his name was Michael White. We just knew that when he cooked Italian food, he could make us forget about all the others for a while. Now he has bought the place and renamed it Costata. This time around it's a steakhouse. He is credited as the chef and owner, with PJ Calapa as the executive chef and Robert Truitt in charge of the dessert menu. But he definitely wants us to remember the early days here, and maybe reassure us that even though he's been spending a lot of time on the road lately, we still mean something to him. All those Foreigner and Stone Temple Pilots songs aren't helping to set the mood. And those huge white cotton chandeliers with accordion folds are distracting. They look like air filters for monster-truck engines. The votives are a nice romantic touch. Except those aren't candles; they're flame-shaped light bulbs programmed to flicker on and off. They fit right in with the jokey space-age d\u00e9cor at the Butterfly , his new bar in TriBeCa. But on Costata's white tablecloths, they look cheap. And these teapots are sleek and shiny, but he's sending them out two at a time, one with a tea bag and hot water, the other with just hot water, because a single pot won't fill a teacup. He wouldn't buy us teapots just because they were on sale, would he? Or is this ... a regift? But tonight let's stay focused on the good times. To remind us, he's making the garganelli he used to do at Fiamma, those ridged quills with peas, pancetta and, oh, that truffle cream. Wow. As indecently rich as we remembered it. This spaghetti with clams almost eats like carbonara, with its sticky yellow-tinged sauce that clings to the noodles. The casarecci, bent scrolls blackened with squid ink, have a powerful oceanic undertow that pulls the sweet shrimp and sepia along in the current. For a minute, we're wondering if he's laying it on a bit thick, showering shredded fontina over the oxtail rag\u00f9 with cavatelli. Then we take another bite and decide that when somebody makes pasta as wonderful as this, there are some questions you just don't ask. Though we do want to know how many people take the menu's advice and order pasta as a side dish with steak. Costata's pasta shouldn't have to compete with anything. We should know. We're never sure we're getting his full attention anymore. He's a blur, opening three restaurants since May. He didn't seem to be trying very hard to make us happy with his last one in New York, Nicoletta . Now he's got something going on in Hong Kong , and in London . And who knows what he does at those two places in New Jersey. If he wants to persuade us he's not spread too thin, some of the cooking at Costata isn't helping his case. Raw branzino is obliterated under a black mash of salty taggiasca olives, although what little of the fish's flavor comes through suggests that obliteration may be the right call. Potatoes pur\u00e9ed with barrels of melted butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano taste great, but they are gluey and oafish. The brilliant-red coral butter painted on a split and roasted lobster the size of a dachshund looks stunning, but it's irretrievably salty. And the generic red-meat flavor of lamb chops is a $49 shock. Some of these dishes have a coarseness that wasn't there when we first met, or even later on, when he took us to Convivio and Alto and Marea . And the relationship feels a little one-sided now. If we had given him $59 for a bone-in rib-eye back when he was so eager to impress, would he have turned around and asked for another $3 for compound butter and $4 for sauce? Or maybe our memories have gone all misty and watercolored. Oh, now he's going to try to sweep us off our feet again with crudo, the way he did at Marea. We've seen this move before. And you know what? Apart from that sad branzino, the old moves still work. Those beautiful red prawns with lemon, olive oil and a prawn-head stock are extraordinarily fine. So is the fluke, sparkling beside the green divots of Castelvetrano olives and slow-roasted grape tomatoes. And these thin disks of sea scallop, so sweet and pure on a blanket of pur\u00e9ed celeriac, with diced celeriac pickle and fresh, herbal celery leaves -- they'd destroy our resistance even without the head-filling taste of black truffles in the vinaigrette. All right, the guy's a magician with seafood, too. Roasted langoustines had better be exceptional at $19 apiece. They are. We'd come back for a second taste of the chilled lumps of tender lobster with strips of honey-coated guanciale cooked like bacon and a thick cocktail sauce that delivers a Bloody Mary's loving slap to the head. The truth is that we always loved his gut instinct for richness and fresh, bright flavors. We don't really need him to cook us a steak. But by now we're ready to be won over. The filet mignon delivers all the tenderness we want and more flavor than we expect. Pink within and a rich caramel brown on top, the veal chop is everything we ask from that cut. The pancetta-black pepper sauce takes to it the way a cat takes to an empty lap. The bone-in strip is a very good piece of beef, though it doesn't have the intensity of the best dry-aged meat. Neither does the 40-ounce porterhouse, though big enough for at least two people, for $116. Called the Fiorentina, it's a handsome carnation-pink all the way through, but it has no crust to speak of and is lukewarm on arrival. It's all steak and no sizzle. For sizzle, we'll spend $2 more to get the Costata, a 44-ounce rib-eye on the end of a theatrical curve of roasted bone. Bathed in mouth-coating melted fat, the meat is so tender beneath its dark crust that slicing it makes you feel like a bully. This steak alone is a reason for the restaurant that it's named after to exist. When the meal ends, Mr. Truitt is a master of extending the good feelings and then building on them, with desserts that are quietly sophisticated without flaunting their cleverness.

Tweezers are definitely not asked to airlift feathery microgreens onto plates that endeavor to be meditations on negative space. The kind of tool that might be used to put together a bowl of MP Taverna's marvelous ricotta dumplings would be something like a large ice cream scoop. The soft, round gnudi, the ricotta's young milkiness given depth by gratings of aged graviera from Crete, are piled around and around with pine nuts, crumbled feta, heaps of spinach and sun-dried tomatoes. There are spicy bites of lamb sausage everywhere, and a garlicky tomato sauce with white wine. It isn't a dish you meditate on. It's one you demolish, forkful by forkful. The same goes for the grilled octopus appetizer, many tender sticks of it, lightly charred and piled all around with chickpeas, black-eyed peas, red peppers and parsley above a small lake of yogurt and golden olive oil. Golden fillets of lightly cured and deep-fried cod get two sauces, a glossy bed of garlicky skordalia and a blanket of tomato sauce that's half sweet and half sharp. Then they're shingled over with a roof of grilled bread sprinkled with lemon juice and tomato water. The only delicate thing about the restaurant's abundant, lusty plates is the prices: $8.50 for the cod, $11 for the octopus and $15 for the dumplings, a main course that I couldn't finish, though I wanted to. The MP of this crowded, unrestrained take on a Greek taverna is the chef Michael Psilakis. Those who remember his earlier odes to Greece -- sung elegantly at Anthos , soulfully at Onera -- may wish more of his old finesse had survived the trip from Manhattan to Queens. But MP Taverna broadcasts its intentions from the minute the host walks you past the bar, where TVs embedded in the wall are playing the Mets, and hands you a poster-size menu in a plastic sheath, diner style. (An upstairs dining room is quieter and more comfortable.) Unlike a diner, though, MP Taverna turns over the back of its menu to a list of about six dozen wines by the half glass, full glass, half bottle and full bottle, and about as many beers, nearly all from craft breweries. A hefty share of the wines shows off the skill of Greek winemakers, including a 2011 Ritinitis Nobilis from Gaia Estate, the first retsina I've ever made peace with. That list gives space to France, Italy, Austria and the United States, too. This isn't unusual on its own, but it reflects one of Mr. Psilakis's aims for MP Taverna. The son of Greek immigrants, he has battled his whole career to win respect for the food of his family. His early Manhattan restaurants were sophisticated, elite campaigns. With his MP Taverna, a high-volume proposition with branches outside the city in Roslyn and Irvington, N.Y., he takes the struggle to the streets. MP Taverna offers a second-generation, melting-pot vision of an America where Greek flavors have been woven into the fabric of American cooking so thoroughly that they're taken for granted. If yogurt companies can do it, why not chefs? In this America, dense white cubes of feta pickled in wood barrels are widely recognized as an appetizer that can hold its own with burrata. Tender gigantes are a natural addition to mussels neatly arranged in a skillet. And cooks who rely on the salty, porky charms of sausage are apt to round out a dish with caul-wrapped sheftalia, which is a favorite in Cyprus, or loukaniko, made at MP Taverna with leeks and orange peel. Those sausages, along with merguez, lend terrific flavor wherever they turn up at MP Taverna, and they turn up a lot, though not under those names. (At times they run circles around their companions; the hanger steak served with loukaniko and the pork tenderloin in a mixed grill can't quite keep up.) Even the great beef sliders, pressed into gyro spice mix before they're griddled, and the lamb burger, seasoned with onion, scallion and garlic and then wrapped in caul and grilled, have strong sausagelike tendencies. The flavors are so robust and the prices so unassuming that I was ready to overlook moments when a little more finesse wouldn't have been out of place: the acrid garlic cloves riding on the coattails of the roast chicken with a rich lemon-dill sauce; the fried squid that had no flavor at all; the hopelessly underseasoned pilaf with head-on prawns; the grilled watermelon that tasted as if it had been slapped down on the same part of the grate where fish is cooked. One night, servers kept fumbling the simple mechanics of who gets what when. Food and drinks landed in front of the wrong person, and the main courses came while we still had our appetizers. Without asking if we were finished, the servers cleared one plate at a time to make space for a main course. For a few messy minutes half-eaten dishes and fresh new ones sat side by side. But the servers were eager and cheerful, as they were on more-coordinated nights. And a few off dishes were never enough to threaten the overall impression that MP Taverna is Mr. Psilakis's best restaurant in the city, at least for now. On the Upper West Side, Kefi has been closed since a ruptured water main flooded it in February. Mr. Psilakis hopes to open it in three months. A few blocks away is his other surviving Manhattan restaurant, Fishtag. Yes, Fishtag survives. Sam Sifton gave it a Fair rating in a New York Times review in 2011. Not long after, the restaurant lost its chef, Ryan Skeen, who has left so many kitchens so rapidly he has to be considered a flight risk. Two years on, Fishtag is often full at 8, and everybody looks content. On an initial visit, I was, too. I loved raw kale with smoked trout, some of it flaked to coat the raw greens and some left in big meaty pieces. Sheep-milk dumplings, close cousins of the ricotta ones at MP Taverna, were just as seductive at Fishtag with crab meat and peppery speck. But at a second meal, the kitchen seemed to have the summertime blues. Scallops in a ceviche were a flavorless nonentity, very good smoked octopus suffered from an olive-date pur\u00e9e that ran far too sweet, and grilled striped bass looked as if it had been on the wrong end of a bar fight. I wouldn't travel more than a block or two for a meal like that. But I'd go back to Astoria.

I'd like to direct their attention to this text from the ABC Cocina Web site : \"abc cocina & michelin star chef jean-georges vongerichten welcome you to our modern global exchange celebrating local craft and international culture, a fusion of tradition and innovation uniting yesterday and tomorrow.\" Got that? There's more: \"experience the vision of abc home curation, a romantic and mystical atmosphere and succumb to a dynamic love affair with an eclectic and enchanting cuisine.\" If that gives you a vivid picture of what is in store for you at this three-month-old establishment, stop reading and use the free time that now stretches out before you to do something nice for a stranger. If, on the other hand, you found a few passages somewhat hazy, I'll be happy to do my job. This \"modern global exchange\" is what we critics like to call a \"restaurant.\" By and large it is a very good one, with a few odd touches. It is overseen by Mr. Vongerichten, who collaborates on the food with Dan Kluger, the executive chef here and next door at ABC Kitchen . \"International culture\" must refer to the menu, which rummages through the cupboards of Spanish-speaking countries in Europe (that would be Spain), Mexico, Central America and South America (although you don't need to go to Argentina these days to find chimichurri). This attempt to reassemble the Spanish Empire does not shed new light on any of these cuisines. Intellectually and culturally, it borders on incoherence. But in the kitchen it has inspired a large number of smart, exciting dishes along with a small handful of slightly peculiar ones. You can get along just fine without intellectual coherence when the flavors are as clear and harmonious as they are in a ceviche of white shrimp bathed in a vivid citrus sauce. Just as the throb of habaneros begins to build up, a bite of soft banana or a crisp Marcona almond breaks the tension. And sure, maybe the first person to put cucumber, dill and yogurt together with cured salmon wasn't all that fluent in Spanish. Fine. ABC Cocina's version is still great, with dried chiles powdering the edges of the sweet and smoky fish, and an unexpectedly bright acidity in the cucumber, which is zippy where you expect it to be soothing. There's an alchemy at work at ABC Cocina, the kind that can turn the last thing you'd want to order into the first thing you'll ask for next time around. For me, it was the vegetables with brown rice, which I expected would taste like a tea made by steeping the yellowed pages of the \"Moosewood Cookbook\" in warm kombucha and straining it through Pigpen's bandanna. It was, in fact, one of the freshest, cleanest vegetable dishes I've tasted all summer. The rice was fluffy, not gluey, and each vegetable -- baby fennel, tender carrots, skinny asparagus -- spoke out clearly. The rice was dressed with a salsa verde that came across as more of an herb vinaigrette with a citrus rasp and a little spice. The vegetables were so tender and seasonal, you could call this a farm-to-table dish, but it's almost too light on its feet for that. The \"michelin star chef\" (Mr. Vongerichten has done all right by this newspaper, too) and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 are both minimalists, but in different ways. Mr. Kluger has a gift for making his ingredients, especially the vegetables, taste a little purer than almost anyone else's. With the best of Mr. Vongerichten's dishes, on the other hand, it's not the main ingredient you remember as much what he has done to it: a three-ingredient sauce or marinade whose ingredients are suspended in a tense standoff. Once in a great while, the two approaches -- one interventionist, the other more conservative -- are at war. I loved the deep, meaty flavors of roasted maitake mushroom chunks pieced together around a core of warm goat cheese, but couldn't understand what either ingredient was supposed to get out of a sharply acidic Fresno pepper vinaigrette. And I'd skip the sweet barbecue sauce with black sea bass; the interplay of thyme and tamarind in the marinade was enough to carry the fish. More often, the team of Vongerichten and Kluger puts you in the excellent dilemma of not knowing which you like better, the food or its sauce. Should more restaurants have fried squid this sweet and fresh, or should more of them look beyond lemon wedges and marinara to find something with the rounded sweet-and-sour depth of ABC Cocina's ancho glaze? I hope this kind of dish is what \"fusion of tradition and innovation uniting yesterday and tomorrow\" means, and not the drippy, messy burger going around in taco drag. The warm, slightly shiny tortillas have a depth of masa flavor that is shown off better by roasted mushrooms with a peanut-based mole. Or by the one big piece of tempura-fried fish with spicy mayonnaise and citrus-dressed cabbage. Or by the BLT taco, which translates each element of a classic Mexican pork-based taco into idiomatic American English, with roasted pork belly and a red-and-yellow jumble of tiny, juicy heirloom tomatoes. I know what you're thinking: enough with the eclectic, enchanting cuisine already -- let's hear about the romantic, mystical atmosphere! I am sorry to disappoint you, but ABC Cocina didn't seem very romantic to me, or especially mystical, either. It looked to me like a fairly simple cafe, with metal chairs and bare tables, located inside a lighting showroom. That is essentially what it is. The restaurant, like ABC Kitchen, is inside ABC Carpet & Home, and nearly every object is for sale: lighting fixtures, chairs, plates, pyrite rocks, fragments of wasps' nests and water bottles that come with a stick of charcoal (\"the vision of abc home curation\"). A surprising number of those lighting fixtures have tiny bulbs embedded in long tentacles that dangle over the dining room like jellyfish. I could see how it might be romantic and mystical if you are sexually attracted to gelatinous sea creatures. As for \"dynamic love affair,\" you are going to have to ask Google. I have absolutely no idea.

You may have been up at 2 that morning drafting a better ending for a long-ago memory. But certain restaurants, if you can afford them, can knock down the barriers between you and happiness for a few hours. Every taste seems to transport you to another world, while every gesture of the staff convinces you that you live in the privileged center of this one. Daniel , which turned 20 this year, can make you feel that way. Does chilled pea soup sound like the stuff of privilege? It is when it comes from this kitchen, where Jean Fran\u00e7ois Bruel has been the executive chef since 2003, and which Daniel Boulud, the proprietor, watches over from a windowed perch above the saucepans and sieves. Those sieves got a workout on this soup, straining it to a gliding smoothness. It had the clear, refreshing sweetness of the smallest peas eaten straight from the pod. Salty diamonds of smoked sable and a white ring of rosemary-infused cream helped the soup's purity shine more clearly. This kind of exquisitely sensitive, profoundly seasonal, fundamentally French cooking helped lift Daniel to several four-star reviews in The New York Times, the most recent one by Frank Bruni in 2009. Again and again, I have been startled by the excellence of Mr. Bruel's ingredients and his talent for unlocking all they had to offer. I have never tasted more calmly flavorful veal tenderloin, or fresher and more gently handled swordfish, or a more skillfully roasted breast of guinea hen. But some of these star ingredients were embedded in elaborate, multipart compositions that didn't fully reward the attention they demanded. At times, the restaurant gave the impression that it was trying to garnish its way to greatness. And while the service can be among the best in the city, with a supreme attentiveness softened by a surprising warmth and even chattiness, it is not always that way for everyone. When people who are known at the restaurant tell me about their meals, they look blissful. Others look disappointed or resentful as they tell me about cramped tables in the neoclassical arcades around the grand sunken dining room and hasty, perfunctory service. One night I had a reservation 15 minutes apart from a colleague who wasn't likely to be recognized, as I repeatedly was. We both ordered the six-course $195 tasting menu. (A three-course prix fixe dinner is $116.) Our meals were virtually identical. Our experiences were not. The kitchen sent two amuse courses to my table. His got one. A few remaining sips of my wine, ordered by the glass, were topped off. His glass sat empty at times while he waited to be offered another. We both ate extraordinary fried lollipops of filleted frogs' legs on a long stick of bone, but only I was then brought a napkin-covered bowl of rosemary- and lemon-scented water for rinsing my fingers. My servers were solicitous: Was this course, or that one, or that one, prepared to your liking? Was the pacing of the meal satisfactory? Could we interest you in a cheese course? Would you like your espresso with dessert, or after? Finally, as I neared the revolving door on East 65th Street: Can we help you find a cab tonight? My colleague wasn't asked any of those questions. Still, the next morning, he reported feeling very well taken care of. And a restaurant can't be blamed for trying to impress a critic. It can be faulted, though, for turning its best face away from the unknowns, the first-timers, the birthday splurgers, the tourists. They are precisely the people who would remember a little coddling at a place like Daniel for years. And while a missing finger bowl won't seriously mar anyone's evening, missing Daniel's cheese cart might. It is one of the finest four-wheeled vehicles in New York. Whenever I wondered if I really wanted cheese, a server would lay his knife on a soft wheel, pressing gently. The mounded top would fall for a moment then rise up again, gracefully and almost willingly. After that, the question was not if I should have some, but how many kinds could fit on one plate. It was just as pointless to try to wave away the basket of Mark Fiorentino's gorgeous breads, like a garlic focaccia, round and dimpled in the center. Rajeev Vaidya, the head sommelier, shepherded me past the many bottles that could land a weak wine lover in debt to more affordable ones. He has a 2007 halbtrocken from the German riesling maker Georg Breuer. Some buyers scoffed at the vintage, pushing prices down, but not Mr. Vaidya. A bottle can be yours for the princely sum of $25. Recently, the title of executive pastry chef passed from Sandro Micheli to Ghaya Oliveira, and the dessert course, already exciting, has a little more energy. Ms. Oliveira's approach is more modern and wide-ranging, embracing unusual spices and exuberant swipes of color. Her mint-scented strawberries are a giddy, flagrant essay in pink, with triangles of watermelon, columns of half-frozen strawberry mousse and ladyfingers tinted with powdered strawberry skin. It was a soft, lilting summer tune I won't get out of my head before Labor Day. The courses before dessert could be just as wonderfully haunting. I'd give a lot to recapture the happiness I got from slow-baked abalone, rich with creamed avocado and slightly tart with heart-shaped wood sorrel. I'm still transfixed by a peekytoe crab salad's bravura variations on apple and celery, carried through to the juices in a walnut-oil vinaigrette. And nothing quite prepared me for the untamed whoosh of intense green herbs in a bowl of olive-oil-poached cod teased into big, glistening flakes, then seasoned with za'atar and a bright cilantro sauce. But the kitchen's compulsion toward complexity could also result in a proliferation of dollhouse garnishes. Grilled sweet shrimp were outfitted with a heart of palm pur\u00e9e, microcubes of mango and cucumber, bok choy, tiny tapioca crackers, curls of shaved hearts of palm, among other things. The parts never quite gathered into a rush of flavor. A variation on Mr. Boulud's classic roasted sea bass with syrah sauce came with radicchio so bitter I wanted to slap it. A drum of sweet potato pur\u00e9e with a candylike crust of marrow on top only made the next bite of radicchio harder to take. The kitchen loves to put two or three treatments of an ingredient side by side, when it might do better to focus on the one that works best. In a triptych of striped jack, a poached piece on a salad of mustard seeds with cubes of riesling gel\u00e9e tasted as if the components were destined to be together. But there wasn't the same inevitability about the lettuce-wrapped dumpling of striped jack tartare topped with caviar, or the smoky rillettes surrounded by crunchy carrot and asparagus. Daniel built its fame on Mr. Boulud's exquisite refinements on French peasant food. Over the years, the refinements have multiplied while the peasant food has been sent away to his many spinoff bistros. Traces of it are still around, as in the short rib braised in red wine, half of a beef duo. The last time I tasted it, I was sure it was the finest French beef stew in existence. I knew my servers were trying to make my night one I'd recall with a smile. And I wished everyone could be so lucky.

She was kind and patient as she delivered the explanatory lecture that begins so many restaurant meals these days. The cooking, she said, reflected the Italian families and Southern childhoods of the two chefs who opened Hog & Hominy last year, Michael Hudman and Andrew Ticer. Many ingredients, including the pork whose leading role on the menu was foretold by the restaurant's name, came from farms within 200 miles of Memphis. The plates were small and meant to be shared, but one pizza plus two other dishes would be plenty for me and my guest, she said. At first we simply padded out her suggestion with two more dishes. Thirty minutes later, we augmented that with three more items. By dessert, when we each put away an entire slice of pie, it appeared that either we couldn't do simple math or didn't know how to listen. She meant no harm, but we had other ideas. If we'd taken her advice I might have missed the way plump hominy kernels rounded out the smoky bacon, smokier 'nduja and the pepper vinegar in a bowl of long-cooked collard greens. I wouldn't have known that a melting scoop of extra-sharp pimento cheese could make a strangely wonderful sauce for grilled asparagus with bits of chopped preserved lemon. I wouldn't be sitting here now daydreaming about Hog & Hominy's fryer rabbit, dredged twice in buttermilk and flour and deep-fried. The meat dripped with juices that had an undercurrent of spice and a citrus bite imparted by a brine made with sour oranges and Calabrian chiles. I might have left Memphis without knowing the blissful burn of Hog & Hominy's fried sweetbreads. They were bathed in a crunchy rust-colored hot sauce made from deeply roasted peanuts pur\u00e9ed with balsamic and honey vinegars, lime juice, roasted garlic and a pile of chile peppers. Like Nashville's hot chicken, these sweetbreads were more fiery with every bite. Seeking relief, I turned to the white aioli splashed on the plate. It didn't cool things down at all. There was jalape\u00f1o in that aioli. It was a lowdown, sneaky move, and I admired Mr. Hudman and Mr. Ticer immensely for it. The two men bonded in sixth grade while guarding each other on the basketball court. Talking outside the gym, Mr. Hudman said, each realized for the first time that he was not the only boy in Memphis who spent \"crazy Italian Sundays\" at his grandmother's house eating pasta with what each was convinced had to be the world's best sauce. By the time they were out of college they were cooking together in a \"turn and burn\" Italian restaurant while dreaming of their own place. It would be grand. Its centerpiece would be a long, white-neon bar shaped like Italy. The pair traveled to Italy, killing and butchering a pig together and learning how to adapt their cooking to each week's new ingredients. \"Our whole outlook changed immediately,\" Mr. Hudman said. So did their taste in restaurant design, apparently, because when they got back home, they signed a lease on a converted East Memphis ranch house and outfitted its series of dining rooms with painted-wood fireplace mantels, small wrought-iron wall sconces and curtains in natural linen. They would let the ingredients speak the way they had heard them speak in Italy, but they would also let the South get in a word or two. They called it Andrew Michael Italian Kitchen . (The house has a history. Raji Jallepalli-Reiss, who would later become the first executive chef of Tamarind on East 22nd Street in Manhattan, opened Restaurant Raji here, winning national fame for her modern and influential Indian cuisine. She died in 2002.) Andrew Michael Italian Kitchen, which opened in 2008, is the dutiful and responsible first born. Hog & Hominy, which they built in another ranch house across the street four years later, is the scrappy younger sibling who stays up later, keeps rowdier company and gets away with things the older brother can't. Reservations are not taken. There is a bocce court on one side of the building and a porch out back that turns into a dive bar on weekends, serving things like boiled peanuts from a crockpot and an Oklahoma City-style cheeseburger smashed on a griddle. No doubt this assessment will make the older son furious, but Hog & Hominy is a more relevant and original restaurant. The cooking is more freewheeling, yet it also feels more focused. This may be partly due to the small-plates form, which, like Twitter, can impose discipline through arbitrary space limitations. Some main courses at Andrew Michael seemed to sprawl with garnishes as if to fill the available surface area. Certain appetizers felt slack, too, though not the AM Breakfast, a delicious refinement on a Southern morning meal with cured pork belly, a slow-cooked egg, creamy grits and fried pork skins pulled from the oil so recently, they were still popping. But a bird's nest of fried spaghetti was laden with a redundant starch, smoked potatoes, and a protein that felt starchy, octopus; under it all was a puddle of sea urchin, which was rich enough without the addition of cured egg yolk. The kitchen at Hog & Hominy can trip itself up, too. House-made boudin disappeared in the melted fontina and scrambled egg of a pizza called the Prewitt. A dry and crumbly chicken tamale needed either more lard in the masa or a long bath in spicy tomato sauce, Mississippi Delta style. But most dishes knew exactly what they were about, none more so than the beef and Cheddar hot dog. One day Mr. Ticer was talking to the head charcutier for both restaurants, Aaron Winters, about being a kid, and splitting a hot dog down the middle, and arranging cheese in the crease, and then blasting it in the microwave until it puffed up and bubbled. \"I got you,\" Mr. Winters said, and went off to grind spiced beef with Cheddar. The dog comes on a fresh, hot pretzel bun with yellow mustard, and it's as good an example as you'll find of an American restaurant vastly improving something lowbrow without falling into the trap of making it highbrow. What I liked best of all, though, was the pie. I suppose I should say \"pies\" because I ate three different slices before I left town. One was a banana pudding variation with a Nilla wafer crust and whipped cream on top. Mysteriously, and magnificently, a half-inch of peanut butter blended with mascarpone had inserted itself just below the whipped cream. Another, called Carol's Delightful Smile, set a filling of malted chocolate pudding on a black foundation of pulverized Oreos. The top was showered with crushed Whoppers. \"I think Carol was smiling because she was stoned,\" my guest said. (According to Mr. Hudman, Carol is a line cook at Andrew Michael whose last name is Johnson, and she comes by her smile naturally.) The third pie, on a hazelnut crust, has a profoundly purple filling of blueberry curd spread with orange marmalade. It is called the Beauregarde, after the Roald Dahl character who turned into a blueberry. It is as appealing as Violet was obnoxious. The three pies had been fancied up a little, as things that pass through the mind of a chef tend to be, but they all retained the sense of fun that is at the heart of pie-ness. This is what I liked best about Hog & Hominy, too: Mr. Hudman and Mr. Ticer aren't always trying to make a grand statement about Southern or Italian food. With their second place, they have given themselves permission to play. As you'd expect of two former kids who spent a lot of time throwing a ball around, they're very good at it.

The obvious answer is that he's a mad chemist, weighing out colloids and starches and sugars by the gram. That's what has helped him win international acclaim at WD-50 . And so far, that's how people have seen the menu at Alder , his new, more casual place in the East Village where you can build a meal out of three to five smallish plates, or just check into the bar with a slightly twisted Cheddar spread and a fully twisted mai tai. Of course, there's also a case that Mr. Dufresne is a mad zoologist. With an enzyme known in the trade as meat glue, he creates such unnatural species as the cylindrical quail. This boneless, beakless pink column of poultry doesn't cluck or walk. Its sole purpose is to be deep-fried in panko in Alder's kitchen and stretched out across ripe bananas and broccoli leaves in a sweet and easygoing curry. Sliced, it looks like a cross section of an unpeeled red banana, suggesting that maybe Mr. Dufresne is a mad botanist, too. Or a mad marine biologist. Alder's excellent fish and chips is made from spiny dogfish, which looks like a small, dimwitted shark who's lost his dentures. As any ocean scientist knows, though, it is one of the region's most abundant edible saltwater fish, with fine-grained and mild white flesh that fries up beautifully. As only a mad ocean scientist knows, fried dogfish is even better with powdered malt vinegar, which solves the problem of soggy fish and chips that plagues New Englanders and Britons. But if you ask me, these are all hobbies that Mr. Dufresne picked up while pursuing his true vocation as mad neurologist. He and his colleagues at Alder (Jon Bignelli is the executive chef, leading an intensely collaborative kitchen with heavy input from Mr. Dufresne) get into your brain and rewire its pathways until you find yourself looking at one thing and tasting something else. They are like Oliver Sacks in reverse. Some of the madness and a fair amount of the neurology can be traced back to Mr. Dufresne's early encounter with Ferran Adri\u00e0's mock olives and the like at El Bulli , in Spain. People tended to focus on the chemicals and laboratory equipment in Mr. Adri\u00e0's kitchen, a shame because he mainly used those things so that his cooking could make us see the world differently. At Alder, you will probably not mistake your wife for a hat, but you may mistake your rye pasta for a sandwich. This is a nice, normal plate of fettuccine, except that it tastes exactly like a Katz's pastrami on rye with mustard. They can't be right, these signals your neurons are firing off. But they are, and the noodle sandwich is a lot of fun to eat, right down to the shaved pastrami jerky, chopped pickled green tomatoes and mustard sauce. You won't mistake the clam chowder in a red enamel camping mug for anything but clam chowder. Very little about the soup of smoked bacon, cream and shellfish would be out of place in Hyannis or Kennebunkport, although this version is more seductively smooth than usual. The oyster crackers, though, may cause some cognitive dissonance. After the first crunch, they dissolve, leaving nothing but a ghostly flicker of oyster flavor on your tongue. Sometimes all the mad neurologists at Alder need to do is hit you with an ingredient you weren't expecting. The ricotta next to beets pickled in rice vinegar isn't ricotta at all but crumbled coconut milk gel. The flavor is wonderfully refreshing, especially when you eat it with the green shards that taste of tender, minty Thai basil. Did that bite of foie gras terrine, topped with a shiso leaf and a semicircle of yuzu-infused watermelon, really sit on a Ritz? Yes. Yes it did, and it was delightful beyond all reason. Good cracker . Great snack. True, there are moments when you wonder if your synapses are experiencing side effects. Slabs of raw yellowtail were overwhelmed by Parmesan-dressed leaves of romaine; the dish, called Caesar salad nigiri, seemed to call for an oilier, more forceful fish, like the mackerel that is sometimes on the menu. I was fascinated by the banana curry, but wished the quail had been juicier and the breading crisper. Fresh cherries in a disassembled cheesecake tasted like a manhattan, which was the intended effect, but the waxy lumps of cake brought to mind only cheese-scented candles. I've had at least one dish I could not unravel each time I've eaten at WD-50, but the next thing I tasted would bring redemptive manipulations of flavor, texture, temperature and shape. At Alder, redemption often takes a simpler form. After the nigiri, you can lean back and smile as you eat airy scrambled eggs with smoked trout and skinny twigs of grilled asparagus. You can have octopus that's just chewy enough with an unexpectedly charming pesto of watercress and cashews. Mr. Dufresne hasn't put this many relaxed and accessible dishes on a menu since he left 71 Clinton Fresh Food in 2002. The dining room isn't intimidating, either. It even dabbles in a bit of downtown farm-to-table clich\u00e9, with slats of weathered wood salvaged from an old fence. Not everything is rustic, though: note the black rubber tops on the tables and the elastic bands stretched around the water carafes like dog collars. Green is for filtered, carbonated tap; white means straight from the faucet. The angle of those slats looks as if they would blunt noise. This is an illusion. The conversational racket is ferocious when Alder is full, which it almost always is these days. If you are losing both hearing and eyesight, the restaurant will be a double ordeal, because the type on the menu is pill-bottle tiny. Buy reading glasses if you need to, because Alder, even with a few misfires, is an exciting restaurant. Now that WD-50 serves only tasting menus, it belongs as much to the global foodie circuit as it does to the Lower East Side. Alder feels the way WD-50 used to. Some customers are there to write blog posts on the food, and some are just there to talk or flirt or drink one mai tai too many or look around and once in a while say, \"Wow, that was cool.\" With such ordinary tactics as small plates and reasonable prices, Alder has done something out of the ordinary, planting avant-garde cooking in what's left of downtown alternative culture. It belongs to anybody who wants to see things differently.

Almost every foot of wall space is covered with pictures that might have been picked up at a Bangkok flea market: portraits of Thailand's kings, thrift-store paintings, prints of jungle beasts, a monster-movie poster in Thai and semi-English (\"Once again dinosaur shake the erath!\"). But staging a Southeast Asian power failure seemed to be taking the conceit a bit far. We didn't stop eating, though. I would bring my own generator if that's what it took to finish the mee krob with fried sweetbreads. In many Thai restaurants in the United States, the fried noodles in mee krob are dispatched into dissolved brown sugar with trace amounts of fish sauce and lime juice. The result is as interesting as spaghetti in pancake syrup. The sauce at Uncle Boons, which starts with tamarind pulp and palm sugar, was rounded and rich and deeply engaging. And a little thing like iffy wiring wouldn't keep me away from the yum kai hua pli, a salad of warm roasted chicken torn and tossed with crunchy threads of sliced banana blossoms. The chicken would have been great by itself, but it was the dressing that helped it shine through the power failure: warm coconut milk soured with lime juice and spiced with dried chiles to an intensity that I think of as handkerchief-hot. Uncle Boons must have fixed its electrical troubles, because they did not recur. What did return was my excitement at tasting Thai flavors so fresh and dynamic. The restaurant has less in common with Queens Thai dynamos like Ayada , Sripraphai , tiny Chao Thai or its roomier spinoff Chao Thai Too than it does with Pok Pok Ny , Andy Ricker's place on the Brooklyn waterfront. A few of its tricks might have been lifted from Mr. Ricker's backpack. There is the charcoal grill, visible behind a glass wall at the end of the bar. There is the tight menu that doesn't give you the choice of chicken, beef, pork, shrimp or squid with almost every curry, a concession that holds back some of the best Thai restaurants. Both places look like dark, woody Thai pubs, right down to their motorized ice buckets that shake bottles of Singha until they turn into alcoholic slush that you drink through a straw. (It won't be the best beer you've ever had, but it may be the coldest.) Pok Pok Ny follows through with many other wacky and excellent Thai beverages, while the drinks are Uncle Boons's prime blind spot. Neither of the two cocktails is a complete triumph, and even the iced tea with sweetened condensed milk tastes watery. But Uncle Boons has many charms all its own. The owners and chefs, Ann Redding and her husband, Matt Danzer, met while working as cooks at Per Se , and the marks of Thomas Keller's ballet academy are far more visible than you'd expect at a place that plays warbly Thai covers of \"Another Brick in the Wall\" and \"Hang On, Sloopy.\" The tables are set with folded cotton napkins and traditional brass forks and spoons from Thailand. Three months after the restaurant opened, the dining room staff is already quite polished, poised and welcoming. The third time the lights went out, a server brought every table an unnecessary but delicious little apology, a plate of mieng kum, little one-bite snacks. Mounded on a soft, fresh betel leaf are fresh ginger, coconut, dried shrimp, peanuts and very hot chiles. You dab on some shrimp-paste sauce, fold the leaf over and pop it into your mouth, and right away your taste buds spring to attention. It's a preview of the flavors that will become major themes of the meal. Coconut milk is the foundation of the remarkably aromatic curry of chicken livers and fresh pineapple called dup kai kaeng supalot, and of an amazing massaman curry with shredded potato and braised beef cheeks that break up the minute you dip a spoon into the bowl. In place of the gloppy peanut-butter sweetness found in many American massamans, Uncle Boons makes a drier sauce with the exotic muskiness of a walk through a spice shop, punctuated by the crisp pungency of green peppercorns. Over four meals, Uncle Boons appeared to be working its way toward consistent excellence. Still, there was one night when the green mango salad tilted too far into sourness, and another when damp, clumpy fried rice with crab suggested that the wok had been a few degrees shy of the smoking fury that leads to great fried rice. Spice levels could waver, too. But with only one or two exceptions, Uncle Boons came through with searing heat when it was called for, especially in that chicken salad or with a laab of minced lamb wok-fried to a deep mahogany and served warm; fresh mint and cilantro temper the spice but in no way tame it. Subtle flavors have a place in Thai cooking, too. There's a hint of a 1970s suburban party dip to the lon pu kem, which offers raw snap peas, radishes, crisp green mango and Thai eggplant to be dunked into a bowl of creamy, coconut-rich crab dip. And there is just enough fresh green chile in a thin nam prik sauce to bring out the sweetness in charcoal-grilled blowfish tails or baby octopus that would fit in your palm if you were silly enough to place them there and not between your teeth, where they belong. A coconut-milk-based curry yellow with fresh turmeric is one key to the greatness of Uncle Boons's khao soi. But really, everything in the bowl plays a part: the chicken leg stewed to irresistible tenderness, the pickled mustard greens, the big frizz of fried cilantro-flecked egg noodles on top and the same noodles boiled in the curry. I wouldn't scream if Ms. Redding and Mr. Danzer threw a few more dried chiles into the pot, but this is still the best khao soi I've eaten in New York. Ms. Redding was born in northeastern Thailand, but before opening Uncle Boons she and Mr. Danzer roamed the country, and their cooking does, too. The couple may be in the market for a better electrician. But where it counts, in the kitchen, they have all the power any lover of Thai food could ask for.

Some of this was because of Mr. Carmellini's record as a chef and restaurateur. His first two places, Locanda Verde and the Dutch , are so well loved that he would probably draw a crowd if he sold nothing but Lorna Doones and ginger ale. But Lafayette serves French food, now getting a second wind in New York after years of running on steak-frites-scented fumes. Apart, perhaps, from Daniel Boulud, no chef in town is better equipped to make that cuisine relevant and exciting again than Mr. Carmellini. A walking Larousse Gastronomique, he spent six years at Caf\u00e9 Boulud working within the traditions of France as gracefully as he danced around them. Given a NoHo corner lot with miles of windows, the restaurant Mr. Carmellini came up with is like a junior Eataly for Francophiles. There is a pastry shop and bakery, a cocktail bar and an all-French wine list. Damon Wise, an ace technician from Craft and the Monkey Bar hired by Mr. Carmellini as chef de cuisine, wears a toque as he oversees an open kitchen where chickens on spits slowly give up their melting fat. All of this is packed inside the brass-and-mirrors skin of a brasserie that stays open from morning to midnight or thereabouts. As for the food, there are salads and charcuterie and oysters and shoestring fries. Almost all of it is worthy, but very little seduces you. Lafayette wants you to fall in love with it, but it tries too hard in some ways and not hard enough in others. It's a restaurant that is a little too easy to place in the friend zone. The nonromance starts at the door. One night when a private party had taken over the basement, Lafayette let large, unfunny security men with earpieces stop diners on the sidewalk for questioning. One prospective guest with a reservation said he was on his way inside to meet somebody. \"For what?\" came the reply. When Lafayette's staff members were handling first impressions themselves, the greeting was not always warmer. One night I was briskly packed off to the bar and ordered to come back and tell the hosts when the rest of my party had arrived, even though my other guests were sure to check in before searching for me. Nobody seems to have helped the servers pronounce simple French words on the menu. Specials weren't mentioned until I asked, and a menu change (trout in place of dorade) wasn't disclosed until I ordered it. A basket of country bread was placed directly in front of the only woman at the table, as if she were supposed to eat the whole thing herself. This wouldn't be such a bad fate; baked by James Belisle, the bread is outstanding, with a dense, mildly tangy rye and whole wheat crumb beneath a thick band of crust that shatters with a noise like a motorcycle boot stepping on a bag of potato chips. But the service at a restaurant as busy as Lafayette needs a brisk professionalism leavened with charm, or else you start to feel as if you are eating in the largest and most elegant Pain Quotidien in the five boroughs. The details matter. Luckily Mr. Wise and Jennifer Yee, the pastry chef, are as detail-oriented as they come. Ms. Yee is a master of classic tarts (both a cherry-almond frangipane tart and figs baked on a wheel of puff pastry were high points not just of the meal but of the month); modern French desserts (her charred mango with toasted coconut and lime parfait is a sunny and sophisticated tropical holiday); and, for good measure, all-American classics (she makes a great whole-wheat carrot muffin, which should be an oxymoron. The muffins are sold at the bakery counter alongside my favorite almond croissant in the city and other viennoiseries baked by Mr. Belisle). My meals leading up to dessert were often very good, even if they didn't always reach the same highs. The red-wine sauce in tripe bourguignon is a terrific achievement: fruity but not sharp or winy, it has a bittersweet richness like good dark chocolate. The pastas, too, were reliably impressive, like the little postage stamps of ravioli filled with goat cheese and squirted with a pesto that had a just-picked freshness, or the fleur de soleil, tender and silky little flowers tossed with snap peas, pancetta and mint. The eggs Lafayette, hard cooked with smoked sable heaped into the yolk hollows and trout roe gleaming on top, tasted like three or four great brunch dishes in one small, luxurious package. Duck breast au poivre under pinwheels of candied kumquat had a more concentrated and meatier flavor than some steaks, although the watery disks of braised radish remained on my plate. Sometimes a modern tidiness goes too far, though. The seasoning on a neat patty of beef tartare was too polite and the fris\u00e9e salad was too prim, with dainty bits of house-made bacon and an egg cooked too long to melt into the vinaigrette. A bouillabaisse that could have been the best in town was undercut by its serving dish, photogenic but impractical. The lobster tail, langoustine, mussels and monkfish were all handsomely cooked, and the shellfish broth was wonderfully aromatic with saffron and pastis. But spreading it all out in a shallow copper braising pan meant that both seafood and sauce were tepid within minutes. It's now off the menu. I hope it's simply gone to Williams-Sonoma to buy itself a deep porcelain bowl, because a spectacular bouillabaisse could help Lafayette get out of the friend zone. The by-the-book pork p\u00e2t\u00e9 won't do it. Neither will the rotisserie chicken. Tender and flavorful as it is, it still puts you in mind of Fairway , not Chez l'Ami Louis . Profoundly sweet and fresh scallops won't do it, either, not if they are languishing in a nondescript pea pur\u00e9e surrounded by a meek spoonful of morel jus. Another chef-engineered burger won't do it, even if this one, served at lunch, gets its terrific flavor from ground brisket, and neither will a soft-shell crab on a toasted brioche. The crab is faultless, but the sandwich belongs in another restaurant. The name of that restaurant is the Dutch. Dishes that would be equally at home there, or at Locanda Verde, are everywhere. This may make fans of those restaurants feel welcome. It may also help Mr. Carmellini move cooks from one kitchen to another. But it doesn't give Lafayette the strong point of view that would make it feel like something more than a good choice in the neighborhood of the Public Theater. Of all the adjectives that might describe a French restaurant built by Andrew Carmellini, Lafayette brings to mind the last one I would have expected: optional.

When the Japanese have been working on an idea for hundreds of years, they tend to figure out a few things. To express wonder that Kajitsu's chef, Ryota Ueshima, can fashion a delicious multicourse meal out of nothing but plants and mushrooms is like being astonished when a French baker makes dessert from flour, butter, sugar and eggs. But each time I go to Kajitsu , which recently moved from the East Village to a tranquil and luminous new home in Murray Hill, I am still surprised by the variety of flavors that Mr. Ueshima coaxes out of meals that Westerners would call vegan. Before reaching across the chef's counter with porcini and morels cooked in steaming mushroom broth just until they have lost their raw crunch, he adds a ladleful of green sansho buds and blossoms to the bowl. They look like tiny grape clusters, taste a little lemony and make your mouth tingle in a way that intensifies as you eat. The sansho also seems to deepen and change the flavor of the mushrooms until they start to remind you of cured meat. On a blanket of Japanese maple leaves, next to a tall cup of spindly enoki mushrooms and a single boiled pearl onion with a red beak of miso, he places a little fried sandwich: two pieces of lotus root filled with house-made fermented tofu. Kajitsu is known for its fermented tofu, and if this strikes you as a sketchy claim to fame, then I urge you to eat some as soon as you can. It has something like the pungent, funky, very deep and long-lasting flavor of blue cheese, with a smoothness of its own. Even Mr. Ueshima's simpler dishes have unexpected depth. A chilled pea soup with a welcome sweetness was underlined by the slight savoriness of white miso. Chopped pine nuts, grated daikon and tender stems of wild parsley scattered over a soupy bowl of rice gave it a fresh, gentle flavor that was like the coming of spring. Shojin ryori was developed in Zen Buddhist monasteries after the religion arrived in Japan. The monks did not believe in taking life. They did believe in drinking tea. The frugal meal that preceded their tea ceremony grew into shojin ryori , which grew into the formal multicourse kaiseki tradition. That shojin ryori was vegetarian made it a devotional practice. That it was seasonal went without saying. At its original address , Kajitsu may have taken the monastic aesthetic to a fault. The plain walls and chilly stone floors of the dining room were so austere, they felt slightly punitive. The new place (above a shop selling expensive tea and even more expensive teapots) shimmers, although it has not quite gone Vegas. In the back is the chef's counter, carved from a single block of keyaki wood and sitting beneath a gently sloped cedar arch. The front dining room has a bay window and a ceiling that seems to hang in midair. Between the two, casually resting on one side just off the floor, is an 1,800-year-old ceramic pot. The service ware at Kajitsu is worth studying. Most pieces are handmade, like the carved wood trays and the hammered metal chopstick rests and sake pitchers. Vintage ceramics with small chips show signs of repair, and their age underlines transience of the seasons that is a major theme of shojin ryori. You could design a calendar simply by eating at Kajitsu every four weeks and taking pictures. Mr. Ueshima changes his menus on the first of the month, adding some plants that are at their peak and some that are on the rise. His dishes -- four of them in a $55 tasting, eight in an $85 or $100 menu that ends with a bowl of matcha, green tea as thick and frothy as espresso -- are drawn from the season, but they are also drawings of the season. In June, he used a glossy dark magnolia leaf as the lid for a soup of slippery wakame seaweed and sesame tofu fried to a satisfying crunch. Last month, he lay pointy lily blades across a bowl that held a kind of vegan Jell-O salad, a clear gelatin dome studded with slices of raw baby okra, cooked bell peppers and mountain yam. To garnish that pea soup, the first dish on his April menu, he had made tiny replicas of pink-streaked cherry blossoms out of thin sheets of wheat gluten and rice flour, then decorated the bowl with a cherry branch whose flowers were so exquisitely small and delicate that they made other cherry blossoms look like the centerpiece at the wedding of a mobster's daughter. Anticipating the season and showing off local ingredients are both old kaiseki traditions, but I found that the things I enjoyed least at Kajitsu were Western vegetables that had not come into their own yet. Neither grape tomatoes with a vinegar jelly in April nor corn kernels in a golden fritter in June were as lush as they will be in July. And while Mr. Ueshima seems to reach for stronger, meatier flavors than Kajitsu's first chef, Masato Nishihara, he doesn't always have his predecessor's delicacy. The chef's artistry, though, can make up for some of the flavor his ingredients might be missing on their own. His simmered tomato would still be very good in August; it is exceptional in June, a chilled poached plum tomato with slivers of juicy and spicy spring ginger set on shimmering tomato jelly that took its layers of depth from kelp and shiitakes. Although the buckwheat flavor of the soba noodles made fresh each day could be a little more full-throated, they are as tender as they could be and still hold together. Rice, the last course before dessert, is a treat that can appear in many forms. Warm and fragrant, sharpened with vinegar, it made a bed for two rows of tender, cooked king oyster mushroom stems carved to look like slices of raw fish. Dab the mushrooms with nori paste and freshly grated wasabi, pinch some rice between chopsticks, and you have a deeply rewarding take on sushi. Whether or not it is on your menu, you should drink matcha at the chef's counter at least once. Mr. Ueshima will froth it with a bamboo whisk before giving the bowl three small turns. Then he sets it in front of you and gives a deep bow that brings you back to the roots of a meal that is more than a meal.

Montmartre. Gabriel Stulman, owner; Tien Ho, chef. Prizes seemed unlikely after I ate there in April, when the restaurant was six weeks old. Wonderfully tender veal blanquette went to waste in a sauce that looked and tasted like salted milk. Thick breading on a skate wing vacuumed up any flavor that the fish, already underseasoned, might have offered. A mystifying upside-down tart inverted a slightly sweet pastry shell over a raw kale salad whose anchovy dressing made no impact to speak of. The outlook was not completely bleak. I liked the small wild snails around a pink raft of garlic sausage, and there was a fine brandade spiced with chile paste. The general trend, though, looked bad for Mr. Ho's desire to interpret \"super old-school\" French cuisine in Chelsea. That week, Mr. Stulman sent word to restaurant blogs that the spirit of the menu was about to change \"to better showcase the diversity of ingredients and flavors that Tien is known for.\" Mr. Ho made his name as the chef in the crazy early days of bo ssam delirium at Momofuku Ssam Bar, and then, to more restrained applause, at M\u00e1 P\u00eache. The second restaurant was itself meant to be a French-Vietnamese mash-up, which is what he now had in mind for Montmartre. Considering that his Asian roots were showing right from the start, though, and that snails with sausage had been on the opening menu at M\u00e1 P\u00eache, the shift in emphasis sounded fairly incremental. But the effect was transformative, as if National Grid had finally turned on the gas. When I returned to Montmartre in May, Mr. Ho was tilting an impressive French boudin toward China by blending it with five-spice powder and surrounding it with a black vinegar reduction and a spicy-tingly oil of dried chiles and Sichuan peppercorns. Boudin's livery richness can start to taste flat over the long haul, but the Asian trick of playing blood against fire made each new bite as powerful as the first. As a sauce for grilled branzino fillets whose skin had been firmly seared, Mr. Ho had in mind some pickled lemons and a thick, dark vinaigrette of pine nuts and black garlic that was like pesto's moody and more daring sister. Where the menu once had a boxed list of daily specials, or plats du jour, it now highlighted elaborate platters for two, like a whole duck. Long slices of breast had an edge of golden skin sweetened with kumquat glaze, while the legs had been braised with vadouvan, the subtle and focused curry powder. The idea was to fold the meat and some cabbage braised with duck fat and smoked duck confit inside one of the buckwheat-scallion crepes, moo-shu style, but the crepes fell apart. At $78, the dish should have been flawless; eaten with a fork and a dash of regret, it was still extraordinarily good. The cleverest and most dramatic Eurasian marriage is the pot au pho, a far less expensive plate for two, at $44. Mr. Ho takes the rich brown beef bouillon; the tender potatoes, carrots and leeks; and the mighty braised and grilled short rib on the bone from France. From Vietnam come the star anise and sprigs of Thai basil and cilantro that season the broth, the thin slices of raw sirloin that slowly cook in it, and the sriracha-enhanced hoisin sauce that you stir into it. For a moment, Montmartre's rekindled fire seemed to help one recipe that hadn't changed, a rice pudding with jackfruit and bananas. On the first encounter it was bland and not very creamy, with hard grains of underdone rice. Another time, those flaws had vanished; on a third try, it was the rice that vanished, leaving something like whipped cream with fruit. Another dessert, a mille-feuille with milk-chocolate mousse between planks of puff pastry, has been a pleasure from the start. Once in a while, Montmartre still gets a case of the blahs. The dressing on a wax bean salad, allegedly a tahini-soy vinaigrette, made no impression, and curls of raw hamachi with diced apples didn't rise above routine. The plating can be slightly untidy and the flavors a bit reticent even now. But Montmartre's French fusion has more conviction than the straight-up French food of many other New York chefs. Mr. Stulman is the downtown restaurant scene's leading miniaturist, able to get full-scale scenes into cramped rooms. His last place was called Chez Sardine , but Montmartre is the one where you sometimes feel like a canned fish. Seats in the two dining rooms (a tiny one downstairs, a slightly less tiny one upstairs) are so close together that you can find yourself playing Twister with servers who are simply trying to clear your plate. Montmartre's wine list, divided between France and the United States, encourages a more restrained drinking style, in part because your dollar won't go as far here as it will elsewhere. As in his other places, Mr. Stulman has very high wine markups, about three times retail. Wines by the glass hover around $10, which sounds reasonable until you are poured four ounces of Bourgueil in a tumbler the size of a juice glass. It looks, and is, ungenerous. But I've certainly paid more than $13 for cocktails that are not nearly as tightly assembled as Montmartre's, devised by Mr. Stulman's director of bar operations, Brian Bartels. There's also an elegantly disassembled Campari and soda on a silver tray, inspired by the Caf\u00e9 de Flore in Paris: hefty ice cubes, a bottle of Perrier and a highball glass of the cherry-red aperitif spritzed with grapefruit bitters, to mix as you like. As he has done before, Mr. Stulman reserves a large number of tables for walk-ins. Prime-time reservations are snatched up quickly, but it is, in fact, possible to drop by and be seated right away. And once again, he has hung the walls with photographs. Some, like the Vogue fashion shoots or a nattily dressed Joe Louis walking arm in arm with his wife, have a cool elegance. Some are rowdy, like the men in a saloon celebrating the end of Prohibition by guzzling straight from a keg. Many were shot in Paris, and others in New York. The images don't seem to belong together, but they talk to one another intercontinentally. This may have been the idea of Montmartre all along, but now the kitchen is in on the conversation, too.

Even if you haven't, the answer would still be yes. This is supposed to be the Italian restaurant where you celebrated your birthday before anyone told you that chicken scarpariello isn't Italian. This being 2013, and the two chefs, Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone , being former lieutenants of Mario Batali and Daniel Boulud , Carbone is infinitely more self-conscious than those old restaurants. It is a fancy red-sauce joint in Greenwich Village as directed by Quentin Tarantino, bringing back the punch-in-the-guts thrills of a genre that everybody else sees as uncultured and a little embarrassing, while exposing the sophistication that was always lurking there. Carbone has a technical prowess that can make you giddy; a lust for excess that can, at times, make you a little queasy; and an instinct for sheer entertainment that makes a lot of other restaurants seem like earnest, unimaginative drones. There are, in the Tarantino style, fanboy film allusions: the tile floor from \"The Godfather,\" the narrow passageway into the back dining room that makes you feel like Ray Liotta handshake-tipping his way into the Copacabana. There are the songs that make you think, \"Oh, no,\" followed by \"I forgot how great this is,\" as people with open bottles of Gaja on the table drum their fingers to \"We Open in Venice.\" Like Tarantino's love letters to pulpy exploitation films, Carbone affectionately picks up the clich\u00e9s of its genre, twirls them, then hurls them at your head. Our captain wears a B-movie smile and a tuxedo in a shade of maroon last seen at Liberace's estate sale. Bearing a hollowed-out wheel of Parmesan, he stabs a nugget of cheese and slides it on to my plate. It tastes young, milky and uninteresting, but next come papery slices of smoky and complex aged country ham, Kentucky serving as a stunt double for Parma, and a stack of \"grandma bread,\" a no-cheese Sicilian pizza with oregano and a shadowy, sweet pulp of tomato sauce. Both make me smile. More unbidden genre tropes are on the way: tart giardiniera in oil, amazing garlic bread, fried ribbons of dough under powdered sugar, suave fig grappa, and delicate house-made limoncello in a bottle furry with frost. I don't love every one of these extras, but I love the way they make me abandon any hope of quiet moderation. Nearly the entire menu at Carbone is a quotation, starting with the $50 veal parm, which is larger than some fancy brick-oven pizzas and looks like one, too, with ovals of browned buffalo mozzarella and a bright red, summer-fresh, barely cooked tomato sauce. Served with a fried shaft of bone, it's a shock-and-awe dish, and the most shocking thing about it is that there is no real revisionism here; it is a veal parm, the way you always hoped it would be. More often, the old tropes get an injection of technique that acts like a syringe of epinephrine plunged into the heart. The two-and-a-half pound lobster fra diavolo is both brash and polished, the huge portion galvanized by Calabrian chiles and soothed by Cognac. No shrimp scampi has been handled as gently or luxuriously as Carbone's chorus line of langoustines, claws extended, bodies split and slick with butter that implies garlic without coming right out and saying it. Concentrated shellfish stock is the foundation a zuppa di pesce so deeply fragrant, you know it's coming before it's on the table. I wish the clam broth that infuses linguine vongole had the same intensity. But other plates of what Carbone calls \"macaroni\" are remarkable. Knuckles of tortellini stuffed with whipped sheep's milk ricotta are a show of zero-gravity delicacy while elbows of rigatoni are forceful and substantial, their tomato sauce unabashedly spicy and slyly buttery. There are also, in this movie, some lapses in taste and judgment. Fried broccoli rabe is locked inside some of the heaviest, greasiest batter I've ever tasted. Carbone's tiramis\u00f9, a wedge of layer cake with mascarpone between Marsala-soaked spongecake, is too wet and too boozy, a case where the middlebrow original is better than the highbrow makeover. Strangest of all is something called Chinese chicken, which tastes as if Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Carbone were trying to recreate something from Chinatown Night at their college cafeterias. But old Italian-American restaurants generally have at least one dish on the menu that nobody orders. Maybe this soy-and-sesame-seed nonentity is supposed to be another in-joke, although it would be funnier if, when you ordered it, your captain said, \"We just sold out.\" They could get a laugh out of it, too. Carbone's captains are character actors who have mastered the jokey, swaggering, slightly bossy style that was a New York specialty before waiters began to have the blandly pleasant manners of the young people who carry Bibles and ring doorbells on Saturday mornings. There is a flash of three-card monte below the surface, as these men sell you on meatballs with your pasta or promise that the lemon cheesecake is \"the best you'll ever have in your life.\" They aren't lying about the cheesecake, though. And the most talented among them can improvise dialogue while grating creamy ricotta salata over a Caesar salad that is just as sharp with anchovies as you could wish. One night a star of romantic comedies was sharing one appetizer and one main course with her male date. When the date left the table, the captain leaned in. Captain: Nice catch. Star: Excuse me? Captain: I said that's a good-looking young man you're with. Star: (Raucous laughter.) This kind of thing is funny only if you agree to play along. And I'm not ready to play along with all of Carbone's casting decisions: currently all the captains, typically the most highly tipped employees, are men. But I admire nearly all the other choices that Mr. Torrisi, Mr. Carbone and their business partner, Jeff Zalaznick, have made. Many American restaurants are trying to reinvent fine dining by looking abroad. Carbone is mining the best elements of homegrown American style of service and cuisine that flourished when men in ties and women in heels, woozy from a final shot of sambuca, wobbled to the sidewalk clutching doggy bags. We didn't know how good we had it. Carbone is here to remind us.

It was hard to know what to expect when April Bloomfield, the British-born chef who has been New York's chief importer of the gastro-pub ethos since she opened the Spotted Pig , announced that her latest project would be called Salvation Taco. Although she consulted with the chef of two local Mexican restaurants, Roberto Santiba\u00f1ez, it seemed likely that Mexican tradition would not be treated as law. But when a restaurant has two words in its name and one of them is taco, you might think the star attraction will be a fat bundle of something hot and tasty folded inside a warm tortilla with a sauce that adds intrigue and excitement. That describes almost none of the tacos I ate at this jammed and noisy five-month-old restaurant inside the Pod 39 hotel in Murray Hill. The tortillas were a little bigger than an English muffin. A small taco can be a great taco, but these were topped so minimally and sauced so timidly that masa was virtually all I could taste. A swipe of curried crema was not enough to bring four tiny and stubbornly bland cauliflower florets to life. A relish of charred onions and pomegranate molasses might have lifted two little fried sweetbreads out of dullness if there had been more than a small blotch of it. Those tiny portions cooled quickly. Often the fillings were cold, the tortillas going stiff, a shame because they are freshly pressed and griddled. Even the miniature naan that stood in for a tortilla in one taco was so firm one day that it was unbendable, although on another it folded obediently around chunks of spiced lamb. Stacked in a covered basket, though, Salvation's masa tortillas are tender, warm and seductively fragrant. This is how they are served if you order one of the \"family-style feasts,\" impressive platters of protein that you tear apart and pile into tacos yourself. Two of these were spectacular: the ham hock, with a fruity and tart chile-tamarind glaze; and the cumin and pepper-rubbed lamb shoulder, so intensely flavorful it was as if three lambs had been distilled down to a single super-lamb. Rolling your own will get you a terrific taco, but some of the tables are so narrow it's a bit like performing surgery on an airplane seatback tray. Ken Friedman, Ms. Bloomfield's business partner in Salvation Taco (as well as the Spotted Pig, the John Dory Oyster Bar and the Breslin ), has gone for a psychedelic, polytheistic thrift-store look, filling two rooms with Japanese lanterns, glass Buddhas, Hindu gods, Christian saints and a painting of a cowboy angel by the Rev. Howard Finster. At least it supplied some visual distractions on a Friday night when a promised 90-minute wait for a table stretched to two hours. Dishes that seemed out of place in a taqueria often had a good reason for being there, including the fried pig ears sprinkled with ground chiles; a soup of kimchi, pork and hominy with the hot-and-sour potency of some Sichuan stews; and the dark, terrifically complex beef chili, long on the fruity flavor of dried chile peppers if somewhat short on meat. But the things you'd hope any taqueria would nail could be dispiriting. Guacamole was sensationally well seasoned with lime and serranos, but always arrived cold. Margaritas were strangely flat, a mariachi band without trumpets. An al pastor quesadilla needed more heat, more cheese and, crucially, any amount of pineapple, which was missing entirely. At least two-thirds of the white cubes in a ceviche turned out to be not fish but apples. There is also a lamb tongue sandwich that the menu calls a torta. It had the bread you'd expect, a bulkie roll dabbed with refried beans, but none of the trimmings: no lettuce, tomatoes, onions or mayonnaise. The tongue, poached and grilled, was wonderfully done, and so was the chimichurri of raw herbs, lime and olive oil. The only thing the sandwich needed was the crusty Italian roll that Ms. Bloomfield might have chosen if Salvation Taco was not supposed to be a Mexican restaurant. To redraw my taco baseline, I went to the Bronx. At Taqueria Tlaxcalli in the Parkchester neighborhood, I found golden gorditas, flying saucers of fried masa filled with a crunchy mash of chicharrones. These little pork puffs make impressively complex snacks with the addition of a cooked tomato salsa that had almost as much smoke as heat. I found hand-pinched sopes filled with refried beans and crumbled chorizo browned to a heavy-duty crackle that was softened by cilantro, onions, fresh cheese and crema. I found a crisp, citrusy and spicy cactus salad that was a model of unpretentious salad craftsmanship, and a torta constructed to maximize the collisions of warm and cool, crunchy and soft that are the source of the sandwich's charms. I found juicy fajitas and even juicier alambres, a stir-fry of meat, green peppers and onions under a poof of melted queso Oaxaca and four folded tortillas. And I found tacos that filled out their warm corn tortillas the way a fat man fills out a hammock. The meats were canonical: al pastor bright red with chiles and topped with pineapple; tender barbacoa to make a convert out of goat skeptics; and deeply savory carnitas that were somehow both creamy and crunchy. The exterior of Taqueria Tlaxcalli (pronounced TLOSH-collie), with a neon Corona sign under an awning in a shade of pink that looks like lipstick at the end of a long night, tells you to move on. The interior, with mango-colored walls, lime-green ceramic pitchers and marbled blue pendant lights, tells you to stay. You may be here for a while if you come during the dinner rush, when the cooks working at slapstick speed become mired in delivery orders. And some larger plates, like knife-resistant pounded steak in a thin guajillo sauce or the chicken enchiladas in a soupy and droningly bitter mole poblano, were not worth the delay. But the guacamole, freshly mashed in a molcajete, the traditional rough stone mortar, always appeared within minutes. Taqueria Tlaxcalli also makes a stew of cactus, onions and strips of chicken or steak in an angry red sauce or, my favorite, a tangy cooked tomatillo sauce. All versions are served, seething, inside a hot molcajete -- the name of the stew. Mauricio G\u00f3mez founded Taqueria Tlaxcalli seven years ago because he was homesick for the food he had grown up with in Mexico City. For new immigrants, a little homesickness is to be expected, but a restaurant as solidly good as Mr. G\u00f3mez's is always a happy surprise.

We start to miss the days when you could go out to dinner without all the food talk: the \"have you been there yet?\" interrogations, the name-dropping of pop-up ramen stands and celebrity milkweed foragers, the tableside decipherings of what is on your plate, moving counterclockwise from the cod milt gelatin resting in a pickled starling's nest. A yearning for simpler times may explain the Beatrice Inn in the West Village, which has been packed to its low rafters since it opened in November. Graydon Carter said that he and his partners in the restaurant, Emil Varda and Brett Rasinski, wanted it to be \"a classic chophouse,\" a term so dusty that one of the city's few remaining chophouses, Keens, now calls itself a steakhouse. Everything about the place -- the burnished paneling; the leather banquettes in law-firm green; the men waiting tables in white shirts and black neckties; the short and to-the-point menu of Hillary Sterling, the chef since February -- broadcasts a return to the days when dinner required no explanation. Sorry, Instagrammers, but you will not be posting shots of your steak or salad, because a footnote on the menu reads \"Photography is not permitted.\" It might have added, \"Please refrain from talking about your food,\" but there's little danger of that. After eating squishy goat-cheese gnudi that were bursting with the flavor of warm New York City tap water and were buried under slices of prosciutto almost too thick to cut with a fork, only one remark came to mind: \"How's your steak?\" The steak was no conversation piece itself. A New York strip, it had a chewy band of fat at its edge, as if the meat were wearing a protective latex sheath, and the meat was shot through with gristle. My dinner companion and I stared and chewed and thought for a long time. Finally, one of us said, \"Well, it is medium-rare.\" There was nothing to say about a stack of carrots that came with a braised and roasted veal breast except that it shouldn't be possible for vegetables to be both charred and raw. Apparently it is, though, because a steak turned up in the company of blackened and crunchy hen-of-the-woods mushrooms. The desperately undercooked sunchokes with saut\u00e9ed trout were something of a relief. They were awful, but they were not even a little bit burned. For dessert there was cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e studded with dried-out apple fragments that might have come from an envelope of instant oatmeal, and an uncreamy scoop of ricotta gelato on a stiff pool of ice-cold honey caramel with chopped walnuts. This time words came easily. We asked for the check. Other dishes were unremarkable in a more benign way. Flattened chicken with crunchy, golden skin and a kind of dirty-blond gravy was easy enough to eat. Kale dressed with lemons, chiles and fried garlic was better than that, and so was a salad of watercress and other greens with shaved radish. The strip steak on a later visit was juicier and more tender. Lamb porterhouse showered with roasted artichoke leaves was very satisfying once I ignored the grainy, salty sauce of dried black olives around it. So were crisp and fresh fried oysters with smoked char roe, as long as I didn't focus too much on a bitter and blandly sweet citrus pur\u00e9e. A dessert with fresh grapefruit and whipped cream on top of lemon curd was refreshing and soothing. But there I go, talking about the food. The thing to do at the Beatrice Inn is to look and listen. Two longtime staff members at Vanity Fair, which Mr. Carter has edited since 1992, are huddled at a cozy round table. They nod to me because I used to work as a fact-checker at the magazine, drifting away around 1994. \"Everybody is obsessed with Jennifer Lawrence,\" the man next to me is shouting. Speaking only for myself, I am more interested in Candice Bergen, who left a few minutes ago. And over there is Charlie Rose and his posse. He seems about to doze off, but he looked that way before he started eating. Sleep would be challenging. Those ceilings multiply the roar. On the plus side, they make short people look like models and models look like church steeples. Everybody is roughly twice as attractive inside these walls. This might explain why, when the Beatrice Inn was a nightclub known for youthful high jinks, the previous owners had to put up signs reminding patrons that it was not all right to have sex in the bathrooms. Mr. Varda and his partners put a stop to all that. The drug of choice at the Beatrice Inn is now wine, most of it rather expensive, served with laconic grace by Aaron Zebrook. One night he recommended a pinot noir that took me over some rough patches in my meal, and he also led me to a bottle I drank during the one good dinner I had at the Beatrice Inn. This was back in January, when the chef was Brian Nasworthy, previously a sous-chef at Per Se. Mr. Nasworthy's interpretation of chophouse cuisine was careful, smart and refined, although the desserts were still a punt. His shrimp cocktail played gently poached shrimp against a horseradish-chile gastrique that had the lively hot-sweet-sour-salty tension of a Southeast Asian sauce. He baked oyster mushrooms, salsify and spinach under a textbook hollandaise for a clever take on oysters Rockefeller. It was meant to be a sideshow to an over-the-top-rich Wagyu rib-eye for $150, but came close to upstaging it. Mr. Nasworthy was dismissed a few weeks later and is now the chef de cuisine at Picholine. Mr. Varda praised his talent but said, \"his culinary philosophy did not agree with ours.\" Evidently not. The four of us at the table that night had talked about the food on the way home.

The book is a classic, its insights and prose recipes still tantalizing four decades later, but it contains a major oversight. Mr. Root says nothing at all about the Italian Upper East Side. In this chunk of the earth that broke off from the boot and drifted 4,300 miles across the ocean before colliding with Manhattan, the restaurant menus resemble one another more than they do the menus of Emilia-Romagna, Campania or Umbria. Ligurian pesto, Tuscan steak, Roman pasta all'amatriciana and Sicilian cannoli live together in harmony. Salad is an antipasto, truffles never go out of season, and beets with goat cheese is a combination as time-honored as tomatoes and olive oil. Caravaggio, which opened in 2009 around the corner from the Whitney Museum of American Art, makes a strong bid to win respect in its wayward region. Owned by Giuseppe, Antonio, Cosimo and Geraldo Bruno, the four brothers who also run Sistina and San Pietro not far away, it is one of the most civilized Italian restaurants to turn up anywhere in the city in the last few years. Plumes of fresh flowers (cherry blossoms in early April, calla lilies later in the month) line one side of the hallway to the dining room; on the other is a framed print by -- oh, hello, signed Matisse lithograph. Inside are more flowers, and much more art: a pair of Ellsworth Kelly prints, a pair of Frank Stella paintings, all four bought from the widow of William Rubin, the former curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art. On a commission from the Brunos, the painter Donald Baechler has covered the entire back wall with a crowd of the eeriest children in the world. With their terrified eyes and gaping red mouths, they look as if they might be friends of Dick and Jane's who have just watched Spot eat Puff. The mural is unsettling, but it has the hovering, electric presence of real art. Caravaggio is defiantly elegant in an age that sees white tablecloths as a medieval relic whose sadistic power to stand in the way of a good time is second only to that of the chastity belt. The tables are draped with linens, ceiling baffles keep the noise to a low burble, and streamlined chocolate-leather chairs offer a quaint amenity known as lumbar support. Another anachronism: a dress code. Jeans, shorts and sneakers are not permitted, the Web site says, although in practice only the ban on shorts is enforced. Jackets and ties are not required, but nearly all the men wear them, along with haircuts that seem to have been tidied up at Paul Mol\u00e9 a day or two ago. The women seem to have had their hair done even more recently. Caravaggio's loyalists are so well groomed, it is humbling. \"We are among our betters,\" a companion said one night. The plates are just as carefully put together, assembled with a sharp eye for color and shape. Caravaggio has a roasted swordfish that is an Italian flag in seafood form, the white fillet sitting between a red pond of pur\u00e9ed tomato sauce and a frothy green sea of oregano sauce. And it served me one of the prettiest veal chops I've ever seen, trimmed into a thick, nearly perfect circle and evenly, handsomely browned. Osso buco with saffron risotto, which may be the official dish of the Italian Upper East Side, looked better than ever and was almost ideally cooked, the meat tender and rose-tinted, the rice firm and creamy. But Caravaggio, for all its civility, is haunted by inconsistency more than three years into its run. Some of my meals there were very good; in others, I couldn't find a single dish to get excited about, and there were a few that were just not right at all. The same kitchen that dressed perfectly al dente spaghetti with a wonderfully balanced pesto of dried nuts and tomatoes put too many tomatoes in a Sicilian sardine and fennel sauce and tossed the result with bucatini that were crunchy and hard at one end. Dover sole was cooked to show off the firm delicacy that makes it such a treat, but the swordfish wrapped in the Italian flag should have come out of the oven at least two minutes sooner. Scallops, shrimp and tiny squid rings were sweet and tender, and while serving them warm over braised leeks with a lobster reduction may have stretched the definition of a seafood salad, it was so good nobody would ever complain. But in another appetizer, octopus tentacles had no flavor at all; they were nothingness with suction cups. Caravaggio's bomboloni, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and served hot in a figure-8 dish with vanilla sauce and caramel, were light enough to achieve liftoff. But the floury, dry torta di ricotta remained depressingly earthbound. First-time travelers should be warned: no matter what the euro is trading at, the exchange rate on the Italian Upper East Side is always awful. It is especially unfavorable at Caravaggio, where salads begin at $18, and most of the pastas hover around $25. This ought to be enough to buy bucatini that is cooked on both ends. Service, slightly formal but relaxed enough to crack a smile, often lived up to Caravaggio's aspirations. But there could be unscheduled leaves of absence after main courses were cleared, and one night one server after another tried to take our order before anyone had told us about the specials. When someone finally did, the recitation went on for almost five minutes, covering at least a dozen dishes. It felt like a memory quiz, one I always flunked until I started writing the correct answer on my palm: just get the chicken meatballs. They are made from white meat mixed with capers, sun-dried tomatoes, thyme and enough milk-soaked bread to give them some loft, and they are braised in tomato sauce, but none of this quite accounts for their appeal. The appeal of fickle and expensive Caravaggio is easier to explain. For great Italian cooking, much of the action is in thunderous and flashy downtown dining rooms. The civilized style of a place like Caravaggio feels as rare and impressive as a blue whale. That would draw me back, along with the chicken meatballs, the bomboloni, those spooky kids and the chance that one day the restaurant will put the Italian Upper East Side on the map.

Let's drink some wine. Going to Pearl & Ash without opening a bottle or two is like buying a chocolate bar and not unwrapping it. Since it opened in February, the restaurant has become the city's most exciting place to drink wine. Some nights the dining room is so packed with grape chasers, it's as if a Bat Signal in the shape of a corkscrew were shining over the Bowery. Michel Couvreux from Per Se and other sommeliers will be hunched on a backless bench, and Mike D will be weighing the merits of a Bordeaux that was fermented around the same time he was recording the first Beastie Boys album. Here, have a look at the list . It was compiled by that dude in the Black Flag T-shirt under an untucked, unsnapped cowboy shirt. His name is Patrick Cappiello , and he didn't dress that way when he was the wine director at Gilt, but he's a partner at Pearl & Ash, and I guess he gets to set his own dress code. Check out how many of his bottles have a little age on them. At other restaurants with wines like that, the prices are almost always deal-breakers. An amazingly vibrant 11-year old Mosel sp\u00e4tlese riesling from Karth\u00e4userhof is $59. We could splash around in Burgundy's kiddie pool, with a 2007 premier cru Nuits-St.-Georges from Jacques-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mugnier, whose wines induce spasms of mysticism in pinot noir fanatics. It's a relative steal at $130, but the waters get deeper as you move into older vintages, some of them drawn from the cellar of a serious collector Mr. Cappiello knows. If you know how much these bottles usually cost, you'll notice that Pearl & Ash has very humane markups. If you don't, you'll just notice that you are drinking at a higher level than your budget usually permits. Now let's eat. That riesling will get along wonderfully with the raw sea scallops under a dusky sprinkle of berbere, the complex Ethiopian spice blend that throbs with chiles and dried ginger. Those lightly charred curls of lily bulb around the plate have a floral sweetness that reminds me of pears; that pale green tangle under the scallops is a bit of tartly dressed fennel salad. It's a terrific appetizer. We should definitely get that thing called \"hanger, egg, cocoa, melba,\" because it's a really good spin on steak tartare. Harissa turns the chopped beef rust-colored and resolutely spicy; cracked nibs of cocoa give it a little depth; those shards of Melba toast sticking out like plates on the back of a stegosaurus are convenient scoops; and that yellow creek of lightly cooked yolk smooths out everything. Try smearing some \"chicken butter,\" maple-sweetened schmaltz with cow's milk butter, on this warm, tender, smoky whole-wheat bread. Kind of tastes like bacon, somehow, right? I know, I don't like paying for bread, either, but it's only $3. And we have to get these tender and supernaturally creamy fried sweetbreads with a pur\u00e9e of hearts of palm and tiny pickled beech mushrooms. The croquettes of duck confit sound good and look crunchy, but we'll skip them. They are about as crisp as frozen Tater Tots warmed up in a toaster oven, and the shredded duck inside is a little mushy. And I know the veal cheek with forbidden rice sounds great, but let's not. The rice comes in these oyster-size dehydrated clumps, which are so hard you can barely cut them. It's like eating moon rocks. We'll be much better off with the skirt steak, poached with hay in extreme slow motion for two days. It's wildly tender but not so soft you can't chew it, which brings out the herbal, woodsy flavor donated by the hay. Great, right? The man in white who's standing at the pass with his back to us is the chef, Richard Kuo. He was born in Taiwan and later moved to Australia. He got his early training there, which may be why he is so fluent with spices and Asian flavors. Here, try this octopus. Not everybody likes it, but I think it's fantastic. Looks burned, right? But it's just the togarashi spice blend that makes it so dark -- that and a blast in searing oil. But even though it's crunchy as a corn flake outside, it's still tender on the inside. That pale, sand-colored sauce is a kind of tahini made of sunflower seeds. I like it as a foil for the heat of the togarashi. In New York, Mr. Kuo studied the modernist tool kits at WD-50 and Corton. His cooking at Pearl & Ash isn't aggressively avant-garde, but if you pay attention, you catch glimmers of it in that slow-poached steak or the supremely smooth pur\u00e9e of cauliflower with pan-fried skate. (I'm not sure we should order the skate, though, unless he has dialed back the black pepper, chiles and paprika in the chermoula marinade; it walked all over the sweetness of the fish.) The last time I saw Mr. Kuo, he was sharing the kitchen with Fredrik Berselius at Frej , a pop-up in Williamsburg that was open three nights a week for about seven months. The cooking there was delicate and lovely, but its rather narrow band of Scandinavian flavors didn't suggest the exuberant range of tastes he has wheeled out at Pearl & Ash. Some people who've gone to Pearl & Ash seem confused about what kind of restaurant it is. The menu is heavy on small plates, but then the dishes under the meat and fish headings can also be prepared in main-course sizes. You can cover the table with a carnival of little dishes, or start with an appetizer and proceed to an entree. Whatever. Let's just call it a very high-functioning wine bar that offers one of the best values in the city, and move on. Speaking of moving on, there are a couple of ways we can go with dessert. There's the composed plate with some dense lemon poundcake scattered around rings of very pure-tasting, half-frozen coffee parfait that look like miniature doughnuts. Then there's a Fernet-Branca ice cream sandwich, a dish that's as polarizing as Fernet-Branca itself. The ice cream plays down the bitterness of the liqueur and brings out its herbal and minty flavors, but you might be one of the people who thinks that the smiley face drawn on the sandwich's paper wrapper is an ironic joke. Either way, let's call over Mr. Cappiello to ask about one of the three Madeiras he pours by the glass. Or, if you're feeling kind of YOLO about that $150 in your pocket, we can get a half bottle of Sauternes, like the Ch\u00e2teau Suduiraut, stunningly fresh for a wine from 1975. Right.

About a year ago, I had one of the most maddening meals in my career, also at Saison. Both times, I found myself asking a question that comes up increasingly often at the high end of American dining: How much are we willing to pay for an extraordinary dinner? We are not talking solely about money here, although the tab for a tasting menu at Saison, which starts at $298 before drinks, tax or tip, is not pocket change. There is the price of being late: the meal will start without you, and, as the Web site puts it, \"any missed courses cannot be made up.\" The price of changing your plans: Saison charges the full $298 if you cancel with less than three days' notice. The price of dietary restrictions: Saison accommodates few of them. The price in time and control: dinner lasts more than three hours, and menus are not posted in advance. The issue is whether Saison, which has won two Michelin stars along with its share of mixed reviews , delivers enough pleasure to justify the pain. After my latest meal, in the restaurant's new and costly concrete-chic space south of Market Street, near the ball field where the Giants play, my answer has gone from a reluctant no to a definite yes. Saison brings together some of the best and the worst things about tasting menus, but now, I believe, the good has the upper hand. Facing down more than 15 courses, I wasn't bored once, and several times I was on the edge of my seat. Part of the fun was not knowing where the next thrill would come from. Seeing a plate of grilled asparagus with cured sea urchin and tuna did not prepare me for the intensity of what I was about to eat. The soft, salty cured tuna was like prosciutto from the ocean. The sea urchin tasted like bottarga but with an added suggestion of decadence. The asparagus tasted the way it does in my imagination during the long wait from the end of one year's season to the start of the next. It was like a heightened version of itself, hyper-asparagus. Joshua Skenes , the executive chef and an owner, has other hyper-foods in his kitchen. There was the trout roe, served on a potato crisp with a dab of vichyssoise. Some trout roe tastes like capsules of fish-flavored salt, but this roe, cured in a house-made fish sauce, was deeply nuanced. Crisp green peas on top of Parmesan custard were accentuated versions of themselves, a little fresher, a little brighter. They had been grilled for a moment or two, and the combination of their smoky sweetness with the magically smooth, just-set custard made me want to tell the world to slow down. During my earlier meal, I would have given anything to speed things up. At the time, Saison was operating out of an improvised shed in the city's Mission District. The wood-burning hearth was out in a courtyard. So were the restrooms, and cooks and customers kept opening and closing the door all night. A few dishes had a rough, unfinished quality, and some felt repetitive, but others were like nothing I'd seen before. It was like having dinner in a drafty but luxurious cave owned by an extremely sophisticated hunter-gatherer -- too much for some people, but I got a kick out of it. I was less thrilled by the attitude of the servers. They would strut around the room, every few minutes bearing a plate to my table as if it had come straight from God's workshop, and God couldn't quite remember who I was. I don't believe anybody looked at me long enough to have picked me out of a police lineup; I know nobody asked if I was having a good time, because there were two long stretches when I wanted the whole thing to stop. One of them began around the second time the restaurant played Phil Collins. At Saison, if you don't share the chef's taste for '80s pop, you are out of luck. And that, combined with the length and cost of the meal, the occasional self-indulgence of the menu and the obliviousness of the servers, made the restaurant feel arrogant in a way that few places these days do. I've thought about that meal often over the last year, usually while I was at the mercy of a chef who seemed to be grasping at the same effects Saison had delivered. Mr. Skenes fashions dishes that are at once primitive and refined, but in other hands the same approach can be drab and weird, and soon I was looking forward to tasting the real thing again. It may be the new address or a year's added experience, but the staff this time was kinder and less cocky. For customers who aren't ready or able to pay full freight, Saison now offers an \u00e0 la carte menu in a lounge by the door, a suggestion that Mr. Skenes is trying to make some accommodation for his restaurant's extraordinary demands. I encountered only one remnant of the old condescension. I typed a few notes, starting with the first wine of the night, a Champagne that my phone's autocorrect feature did not recognize. Later, a server who had evidently been reading over my shoulder said: \"I couldn't help noticing that you wrote \u2018Kruger.' It's actually \u2018Krug.' \" The rest of the night was marked by solicitousness and was punctuated by one dish after another in which the flavors were as deep and long as any I've ever tasted. It was carried along by wines chosen by Mark Bright, the sommelier and Mr. Skenes's partner in the restaurant, and it ended with a flurry of classically inclined desserts from the pastry chef, Shawn Gawle, who hand-delivered a heart-stopping white-sesame souffl\u00e9 and gently parted the surface to drop in a spoonful of black-sesame ice cream. Mr. Skenes is one of several chefs who are venturing beyond the rustic French and Italian roots set down by Alice Waters and other pioneers to forge a modern identity for California cuisine. The group includes David Kinch , at Manresa in Los Gatos; Christopher Kostow , of the Restaurant at Meadowood in Napa; and Daniel Patterson , of Coi in San Francisco, among others. They share a naturalistic visual aesthetic, a profound attentiveness to seasonality, a commitment to exploring the region's resources and an undogmatic embrace of both new and old kitchen tricks. At Saison, the most important kitchen tool is the oldest of all: fire. Mr. Skenes calls it \"the heart of the restaurant.\" Nearly every dish at Saison contains something that was smoked, grilled or roasted by a wood fire. \"We wanted to find a more honest connection with cooking,\" he said. \"That's where the fire came about: how little salt, how much seasoning can we pull back, when you really begin to taste the inherent flavor of an ingredient?\" Some chefs are like matchmakers to their ingredients, always trying to set them up on dates. Mr. Skenes approaches his ingredients like a psychoanalyst: he makes them look inward, encouraging them to unlock their hidden potential before meeting anybody new. Saison served me black cod in a yogurt and Rangpur lime broth and topped it with plantain chips given an orange dusting of Indonesian curry powder. The deployment of Asian flavors was sensational, but what was most remarkable about the dish was the black cod itself, not just sweet and rich but also a little tangy, with an almost creamy consistency that came from a slow poaching in seawater. Mr. Skenes has been buying most of his raw fish from Japan because he believes it is caught and handled more carefully there. A slice of imported blue-wing sea robin, cured in kelp for several days and then instantaneously seared with a hot ember along one edge, might be the most memorable thing I ate at Saison. Recently, though, Mr. Skenes began to work with a Bay Area fishing captain who reels in all kinds of species, monkey eels and idiot fish, and delivers them live to the restaurant. \"We're going to try to wean ourselves off Japan, so we're more representative of the Bay Area,\" he said. Subsidizing a boat to custom-catch fish for Saison is an expensive proposition. There is also the cost of the seaweed forager and the poultry ranchers who raise pigeons to Saison's exact specifications. Mr. Skenes said that his ingredient costs are barely covered by the menu price, and that a cancellation can put the restaurant in the red. Thus, the fees for changing plans within 72 hours. Short of calling in a team of accountants, I don't know how to verify this. I do know that, for all of the extraordinary demands it makes on diners, Saison delivers a meal that is at least as extraordinary.

I was still learning the ropes, though, so I invited suggestions. My server's advice was quick and definitive. \"Get the calama',\" she said. \"That's why you're here.\" Strictly speaking, the fried calamari was not the reason I had driven down Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn until it dead-ended at the white row of fishing ships and booze-cruise leviathans on Sheepshead Bay, then parked in front of the neon lobster with the name Randazzo's pinched between its upheld claws. No, it was the Sauce. Randazzo's makes any number of tomato sauces, but only one Sauce. It has two speeds, spicy and medium, but the dark, intense, concentrated, oregano-accented essence is the same. The tomatoes cook down for an eternity and then some, until they are as deeply caramelized as a pan of fried sausage and onions. The Sauce can be ladled on hot or chilled lobster, on fried shrimp, on steamed mussels or on chopped scungilli, where it works a particularly satisfying alchemy. And of course, it is poured over floured and fried calamari. A pure distillation of Italian-American cuisine, the Sauce tastes as if a chemical analysis would reveal the blueprint for every great dish in every red-sauce joint in the country. I found many other things to like at Randazzo's, but yes, the Sauce was the reason I was there. It is the reason many people were devastated when the restaurant was destroyed by Hurricane Sandy last October, and the reason they cheered when it reopened just before Christmas. And, in a sense, the Sauce is the reason Randazzo's is there in the first place. Decades ago, when the boats leaving Sheepshead Bay each morning carried men who fished for their living, the Randazzo family owned a seafood shop and a bar on Emmons Avenue. As a cheap bar snack, they handed out fried squid, which back then was more likely to be found on the end of a hook than the end of a fork, along with Helen Randazzo's long-simmered Sauce. \"They would cut the bar down a little every year and put in tables, because more people would be sitting down,\" said Helen's oldest grandson, Paul Randazzo. In 1964, the bar graduated to a clam bar with a menu of six items, not counting the Sauce. As the mounds of cherrystone shells grew, so did the family business , adding on a formal Italian restaurant that served pasta, broiled seafood and other Helen Randazzo recipes. When it closed in 1994, it bequeathed those dishes to the clam bar. They are still on the menu today for customers who look beyond the Sauce. Marcella Hazan may rap me on the knuckles with her cheese grater for this, but I am crazy about Randazzo's shrimp parmigiana. The restaurant buys wild shrimp netted in the Gulf of Mexico, and their substantial flavor comes through even after they have been breaded, fried, doused with marinara and blanketed with browned fresh mozzarella. That flavor comes through just as clearly in the shrimp fra diavolo, with a heap of pasta under spicy tomato sauce and, just so you don't forget where you are, a few clams. As a parade of marine life, though, the dish has nothing on the lobster fra diavolo, which supplements clams and shrimp with mussels and an entire Canadian lobster, ideally tender and sweet the night I had it. A different lobster dish on another night was problematic. The stuffing was an unexciting blend of baby shrimp, bread crumbs and, supposedly, crab meat. The claws were overdone to a rubbery dryness, but the tail, cooked more gently, had its quality intact. Randazzo's pasta with clams is a lesson in the meaning of generous portions: about a quarter-acre of linguine or spaghetti weighed down who knows how many chopped clams, very sweet and very fresh, and untold cloves of sliced garlic. The pasta is exactly the kind that Italian restaurants in this country served 40 years ago, before the phrase \"al dente\" got its green card. It is boiled in water with little if any salt, which is less of a drawback when the sauce piled on top is a hearty one like fra diavolo rather than a thin one like the marechiara. Very simple seafood dishes found at shacks up and down the East Coast can be quite good at Randazzo's: the raw Long Island oysters, littlenecks and cherrystones shucked at the counter; the steamers, free of grit once they are rinsed in their broth and dunked in drawn butter; the fat crab cakes wrapped in a spicy bread-crumb coating but otherwise light on the filler; the Manhattan chowder and, even though it is slightly thickened with cornstarch, the New England, both weighty with potatoes and clams. Less enticing are the lobster bisque and the corn-and-crab chowder, neither of which tastes much like its namesake shellfish. And given how pure most of the seafood is, I wish the fried clams were the squishy whole-belly variety, not chewy frozen strips in a sarcophagus of breading. This is one food that is beyond the help of the Sauce. Another is the slice of bread, slightly less hard than granite, that waits on each platter of calamari to traumatize the loose molars of neophytes. Simultaneously soggy and dry, hot and cold, it is too bizarre and unfathomable to be called awful; it is simply one of the world's mysteries, to be discussed while eating all the squid around it. Helen Randazzo was, according to her grandson, a virtual pescetarian. Still, her recipe for cut-up chicken marinated in lemon, olive oil, garlic and oregano, then roasted and charred under the broiler, is very good. Perhaps out of her distaste for land animals, she gave the dish the unalluring name \"burnt chicken.\" Paul Randazzo, who owns the place now, eats fish nearly every day, but he gave it up for the two months that his restaurant was closed after the hurricane. It was a form of protest, I imagine. The night of the storm, he was inside Randazzo's, standing on chairs and then on the counter when the bay refused to stay outside the doors. When he wanted company, he said, he got on a raft and paddled down what, just that afternoon, had been Emmons Avenue to visit a friend who was holed up on the second floor of Loehmann's. Did anything in the restaurant survive the flood? \"Me.\" Today the pink-granite floor tiles, the mirrored wall painted with a scene of the marina, the tables, the chairs and the restrooms are new. The faces are not. Mr. Randazzo, his wife and his four children still tend to customers, who come in all shapes, sizes, colors and ages. Randazzo's prices are not intimidating, especially for fresh seafood, and the welcome at the door is heartfelt. Had I grown up eating at Randazzo's, the emotion I felt tasting the Sauce might be love. But as a relative newcomer, I'll have to settle for gratitude.

In about three weeks he would open another restaurant of his own, but he had given himself a night off to check out somebody else's, Manzanilla. Its chef and owner is Dani Garc\u00eda, a big deal in Andalusia and, as the first guy to bring liquid nitrogen into the kitchen, a member in good standing of the modernist sorcerers' club. At his flagship restaurant, Calima in Marbella, Mr. Garc\u00eda makes trompe l'oeil tomatoes and fashions chocolate butterflies with mango wings. Simply by opening Manzanilla, his first restaurant outside Spain, on East 26th Street, he has drastically increased the number of chefs in town with whom Mr. Dufresne might conceivably swap recipes. Manzanilla looks like a grand entrance for Mr. Garc\u00eda. For one thing, he and his co-owner, Yann de Rochefort, acquired some serious real estate. Their dining room is as big as a barn, roomy enough that you can walk to your table without turning sideways and holding your breath, although this barn has that overdressed look that is achieved by handing over money to a Manhattan design firm (in this case, Meyer Davis Studio ) and asking for something rustic. Quibble about the d\u00e9cor if you like, but it is not every day that downtown gets a major restaurant from a serious chef with enough seats that 8 p.m. reservations are not out of the question. As Mr. Garc\u00eda's introduction to New Yorkers, though, Manzanilla extends something less than a firm handshake. Apart from some terrific, how-did-he-do-it desserts, it does not show off the kinds of techniques that might intrigue Mr. Dufresne. That is not a problem in itself; dining on the cutting edge carries the danger of cuts and scratches. But some dishes that ought to be free of risks are not, and the strain of running a kitchen in an unfamiliar city occasionally shows. At its best, which is about half the time, Manzanilla offers some very welcome takes on Spanish tradition. Here are six strong arguments for taking a seat at the bar, or a table. One: the tortillita gaditana, an amazingly airy wafer with tiny shrimp in their shells embedded in a batter made with powdered dried shrimp, which gives it the intense shellfish flavor better known from Southeast Asia. The snack is a specialty of C\u00e1diz, although Mr. Garc\u00eda smartly bends Andalusian tradition by pairing it with a kimchi mayonnaise. Two: the cuttlefish croquettes, breaded globes of seafood stew that are black with squid ink and preposterously rich with b\u00e9chamel. The center should not hold; it is too liquid and soft. But it does, bound by a crunchy, golden crust. Three: tomato tartare, toast spread with a deep red pulp made from fresh, canned and sun-dried tomatoes; the top is beaded with the fresh, bright interior jelly that holds the seeds. If you've been avoiding tomatoes since the summer, this is a reason to close your eyes and remember how delicious they can be, even in springtime. Four and five: the two main courses made with creamy, short-grained bomba rice. One is called black rice, a more substantial remix of the cuttlefish croquettes, and the other is vegetarian, with zucchini and squash blossoms bringing a springlike freshness to meaty wild mushrooms that are cooked with al dente rice. Six: the top loin of sweet Ib\u00e9rico pork given a Japanese marinade of sake, mirin and miso; it is sliced like steak and just as satisfyingly meaty, maybe more so. Oh, all right, seven: except for the gray and underseasoned testa, the Ib\u00e9rico charcuterie plate is a joy, with two kinds of cured loin, lean and marbled; strips of seductive lardo; and best of all, marvelous ham with a border of fat that really does melt on your tongue. All of these are exceptional additions to the growing catalog of great Spanish tastes in New York. But Manzanilla had nearly as many dishes that were not in the same league. The whites of quail eggs, cold and runny, made a promising kale salad deeply unappealing. The sharp tang and tiny curds of a layer of goat cheese canceled out the smooth sweetness of a foie gras terrine. Beet-orange sauce and tomatillo gazpacho were lost on a platter of two varieties of raw oysters, neither very flavorful. If the menu hadn't said so, I'm not sure I would know that the bland log of white meat that broke into wet splinters was chicken. There was nothing wrong with a tender braised lamb shank in a sticky reduction, but little about it pointed to a chef of Mr. Garc\u00eda's skills. And the best thing about a thin plank of New York strip cooked on a plancha were the flakes of sea salt on top. On top of other dishes: spheres. Here a sphere, there a sphere, everywhere a sphere. Spherification, a process developed at El Bulli , captures a liquid inside a thin membrane that bursts open on the tongue. Mr. Garc\u00eda spherifies so many things that his restaurant is in danger of becoming a theme park of modern Spanish gastronomy. Spheres of olive juice brought a superfluous brininess to the charcuterie, which was salty enough on its own. Little spheres of mignonette sat on two of the oysters, and big spheres of citrus dressing swamped raw slices of sea bass. Mr. Garc\u00eda's chops are put to far more compelling and delicious use in the dessert course. A stunningly good and custardy rice pudding is dotted with kernels of freeze-dried raspberry, yogurt and white chocolate, the kind of surprise you wish you could still get out of children's cereal. A whole bag of tricks is applied to a barely frozen dessert Mr. Garc\u00eda calls a pineapple iceberg but which looks more like a tall slice of yellow meringue in a pool of passion-fruit and yogurt custard. Close your mouth and the iceberg collapses into a contented swoon of cool tropical froth. There's also this silver egg -- not a sphere, an egg -- called Marbella's Full Moon. A white chocolate shell filled with white chocolate mousse and a yolk-colored citrus jelly, it is at once a technical wonder, a visual gem and a very good thing to eat. Maybe Manzanilla is underestimating New Yorkers' appetite for the best of current Spanish cooking. That might account for the kitchen's occasional lack of conviction and the proliferating spheres. The moon may be full in Marbella. It would be wonderful to see it shine in Manhattan, too.

I want to talk about the turkey. Most of the year, turkey is the iceberg lettuce of the animal kingdom -- banished from decent restaurants, it serves as anonymous sandwich filler. In February, Mr. Yu got his hands on some turkey that a farmer outside this city had raised from a heritage breed called broad-breasted bronze. The drumsticks and thighs he braised, pulled and dressed with sour cream and oregano. Together with crisp skin and cooked radishes, the meat was rolled up in a wrapper made of thinly shaved turnips. It looked a little like a Vietnamese summer roll. Next to it was a slab of white meat, poached in turkey broth and still glossy with it. In its simplicity, the breast was as compelling as the elaborately styled dark meat, and both were good enough to make me wonder why Americans don't see more of this bird we supposedly revere. Turkey may be an unconventional choice for a seven-course $79 tasting menu in a restaurant that the Houston Chronicle critic Alison Cook gave four stars after it opened last year. But Oxheart is one of the growing number of places around the country that are rearranging our notions of what fine dining means. It is also an example of the growing ambition of the Houston dining scene, and one of two places that lured me here to kick off this occasional series of reviews of restaurants outside New York City. Traditional signifiers of luxury are scarce at Oxheart. No valet materialized to park my car after I descended from Interstate 10 to a pocket of industrial buildings and frame houses north of downtown that the developers forgot to tear down. We were a few minutes early, and Oxheart has no space for a lounge, so we were sent to the front porch. We stood next to trash bags full of mesquite and a covered compost bin. Three or four servers, each friendlier than the last, came out to take our drink orders and check on us while we watched people passing by who may have been bound for the tattoo parlor, a recording studio or a bar where the door is always closed (knock twice to get in). As this urban-wildlife setting suggests, ambitious restaurants are less concerned with comforting the comfortable than they used to be. What the comfortable want, what even those of us who merely aspire to be a little less uncomfortable want, is an experience that feels authentic. In this new hierarchy of values, imported linens and china don't matter. What matters is finding a neighborhood carpenter who can build tables with hideaway drawers where diners at Oxheart will find the silverware for each course. What matters is that Mr. Yu was drinking at the right bar on the right night and met a hobbyist luggage maker who cut the leather aprons that make the dining-room staff look like metalsmiths. Through a similar chance, Mr. Yu also met an actual metalsmith , who forged the knives that Oxheart offers customers out of a wooden cigar box. Brand-name Champagnes and waiting-list cabernets? They aren't important. Beaujolais, vin jaune and sparkling wines from the Loire? They are, and Oxheart has them all . At the table, servers exhibit very little ceremony but lots of good cheer, and of course a flair for telling stories about what you're eating and drinking. Grand piano, washroom attendants, big-budget design? Right. Try a stack of vinyl LPs, a graffiti artist who spray-painted Oxheart's restrooms and a total opening cost of $98,000. (In keeping with the low-budget theme, there are two $49 four-course tasting menus a night as well as the $79 one.) The markers of luxury have even changed on the plate. Truffles, Dover sole, lamb that went to private school? Insignificant. Wildflowers, bizarrely named but abundant fish species, any and all members of the botanical family known as the brassicas? Incredibly significant. At Oxheart the night I visited, there were two brassica courses, starting with a salad of sliced raw chard and kale leaves with pickled chard stems and a dressing of mint and basil oil with the juice of, yes, more chard. In the center, looking like a poached egg white, was a spoonful of tart goat-milk whey. It was one of the most inventive and delicious salads I have had recently. And, if you consider painstaking attention to detail a sign of luxury, it was one of the most luxurious, too. Before opening Oxheart with his wife, Karen Man, who is the restaurant's baker, Mr. Yu spent a couple of months cooking at In De Wulf in Belgium and Geranium in Denmark. As with other chefs who have filled their lungs with the cool breezes blowing from contemporary Northern European kitchens, he creates plates that take their visual cues from the colors and shapes of nature. Each one features a rigorously edited corps of ingredients, many of them treated quite simply -- some are pickled, others left raw. \"You don't see a lot of products on the plate, and the ones that you do see either have a lot of work put into them, or nothing at all,\" Mr. Yu said in a phone interview. \"It's kind of all or nothing for us.\" Before his European tour, Mr. Yu worked for about a year and a half at Ubuntu in Napa, Calif., the late restaurant that was known as much for flavorful, resourceful vegetable cookery as for its location inside a yoga studio. Nearly everything served there came from an on-site garden, and Mr. Yu began to pay the kind of attention to vegetables that a mountain climber gives to rock ledges. He talks about once a week to a farmer at Utility Research Garden outside the city. \"He understands my wants or needs: pick things young, or let them sit in the ground a little longer so they develop more sugars,\" Mr. Yu said. Utility Research Garden supplies the carrots for an Oxheart dish that makes use of several varieties of them at different stages of life. Some are shaved and sprinkled with two kinds of coriander leaf; others are roasted and set in a sauce made with coconut milk, Moroccan spices and even more carrots. From this one humble root, Mr. Yu had extracted fleet, herbaceous flavors; deep, meaty ones; and several others in between that I never knew carrots had in them. Some things about Oxheart, like the stack of vinyl, the 11 seats at a kitchen counter (there are 19 more at the tables) and the ceramic coffee cups with twisted handles, reminded me of other new restaurants that emphasize the personal and the handmade. The naturalistic look of Mr. Yu's dishes, too, is familiar. But every course of my meal showed an instinct for the delicious that is rare in any city. Encountering it, even in a restaurant as often praised as Oxheart, is always a discovery. If Oxheart is taking part in a worldwide conversation about cooking and fine dining, another widely admired new restaurant across town in the Montrose neighborhood is intent on finding the world in its own home. The mission of Underbelly, broadcast on the menu and the Web site , is to tell \"the story of Houston food.\" For Underbelly's chef and owner, Chris Shepherd, it is a story of many cultures and cuisines meeting in a place that has become the most ethnically diverse metropolitan region in the United States. Not all of Mr. Shepherd's cooking coincides with how outsiders see Houston. He isn't fixated on enchiladas and steaks. But his tributes to the city's more recently arrived Asian populations were among the most memorable things I ate at Underbelly. He has an absolute winner in his Korean braised goat with dumplings. He must know it, too, because the dish has not gone off the menu since Underbelly opened a year ago with close to 200 seats, a zigzag wine wall and a glass case for aging meats. Mr. Shepherd tosses chewy rice cakes with butter and gojuchang, the Korean chile paste, which together make something like what you would get if you fermented Buffalo wing sauce and aged it in a barrel. I was wild about Underbelly's Vietnamese-style pork meatballs, too, in a brown gravy flecked with cilantro leaves. But I was less convinced by another nod to Southeast Asia, duck confit on top of bland rice noodles in a red curry that was neither spicy nor salty, sour nor sweet. And the restaurant's take on bibimbap seemed to need a little more garlic, salt and heat. Much more exciting was an ode to the Deep South, cornmeal-crusted chicken livers with lettuce and thinly sliced radishes in a terrific, spicy Thousand Island dressing. And I loved some of Underbelly's \" non-fancy desserts ,\" like a tender half-moon fried strawberry pie and a wedge of vinegar pie, a relic of a recipe from an age when lemons weren't sold year-round. Most of all, I respected Underbelly's confidence in deciding which native traditions to champion. The boosterism comes to a halt with local wines, for instance: Matthew Pridgen, the general manager and \"wine herder,\" has written a short diatribe on the wine list about how few local bottles are made with \"100 percent Texas grapes that haven't been manipulated beyond recognition,\" and then presents \"our extensive list of Texas wines\": three of them, made by two producers. The rest of the bottles range all over the world. Cosmopolitan Oxheart and parochial Underbelly: I've simplified both places, of course. They share a great deal, including the fishmonger who shows up at the kitchen door with unheralded Gulf species like blue runner and bearded brotula. And they share Houston, the city that they are both helping to make into one of the country's most exciting places to eat. Oxheart, 1302 Nance Street; (832) 830-8592; oxhearthouston.com.

It appeared to be a casual pile of squid tempura interlaced with a few splinters of fried green stuff, but I took a knife to it and quartered it anyway. Amazingly, the gold loops and strands held together as they traveled from the dish of spicy dipping sauce to my mouth. As I ate, I understood that Hanjan's chef, Hooni Kim, had accomplished the most delicious kind of engineering feat, minimizing the layer of rice starch that makes up the bulk of a traditional pajeon and maximizing not just the crisp fried bits but also the flavor of scallions and wonderfully fresh squid. At the same time, his pajeon held on to the essential taste of Korean cuisine. This taller, airier pajeon was nowhere near as filling as the original, but I didn't mind. Planning ahead, I had ordered two. Hanjan opened in December on West 26th Street, its recessed entrance easy to miss alongside rowdy neighbors like Hill Country and the Hog Pit. Like Mr. Kim's slightly older restaurant, Danji , Hanjan has a menu divided between traditional Korean dishes (the pajeon) and new ideas (slices of raw wild salmon that you wrap around salad greens in a spicy sesame dressing). And once again, the cover versions and the original compositions are so much in touch with the spirit of Korean cooking that it can be hard to tell which is which. Hanjan does not cast out any obvious chum for food bloggers the way Danji did with its bulgogi sliders and bacon paella. Mr. Kim may be more confident in his cooking this time around, or more certain that New Yorkers will get it. On a menu of mostly small dishes, one of the two substantial enough to anchor a meal is a large bowl of cod roe in a cloudy seafood broth that contains so much chile paste, it's pink. Both the esoteric main ingredient and the fearless seasoning in this remarkable stew suggest that Mr. Kim trusts his audience, and vice versa. Certainly, the relationship has progressed to the point where he can name one of Hanjan's dishes fresh killed chicken wings. Just how fresh , you may wonder, tilting an ear toward the kitchen to listen for muffled squawks. Not quite as fresh as that; the birds are slaughtered off site earlier in the day that they are served. The object is to obtain poultry with a clean and full flavor, which Mr. Kim simply underlines by marinating the wings in sake and soy and grilling them. Other parts of those recently graduated birds end up skewered and grilled, yakitori style, with minimal seasoning. You need to love the flavor of extremely fresh chicken to love most of these skewers, especially the very chewy gizzards. The crunchy accordion folds of grilled skin are probably universally appealing, though. Two of my guests, at least, declared them the best thing on the table. A minute later, they claimed to have found something better. All my meals at Hanjan were like that, with new dishes eclipsing the memory of what had come before. \"That's my favorite of the night,\" somebody would say, chopsticks pinched around a fried sandwich of shrimp and pork paste between shiso leaves. A few minutes later, somebody else would crown the grilled mackerel fillet, its skin gleaming like candy under a glassy soy glaze, accompanied by a lemon and grated daikon. Next the torch was passed to meaty slices of pig trotter braised in soy and smeared with a far-from-tame paste of fermented shrimp and soy beans. In the rush to declare winners, a few also-rans were soon forgotten. To be a contender in a town full of good Korean fried chicken, Hanjan's needs to be crisper than it was the night I had it. A tiny portion of noodles with spicy squid vanished without impact. Thin slices of fish cakes bobbed around in a nearly clear seafood broth that was very, very good, but the dish wasn't substantial enough for a restaurant that is, essentially, a Korean pub. Mr. Kim's small-plates approach leads to one significant miscalculation. Hanjan charges $5 for kimchi and $4 for cold appetizers called namul. Order both and you have a small but high-quality banchan spread, which most Korean restaurants bring without charge or request. By putting a price on banchan, Mr. Kim makes it optional, just another tapas plate. Without it, the whole spirit of the meal changes. Lines of two-tops and four-tops run along opposite walls; in the center is a long communal table that might feel like trend-chasing in another restaurant but here feels like an invitation to put your elbows down and have another bottle of sake. After 8 p.m. you will need it, because the din from hungry-eyed people waiting at the bar and the customers at their tables shouting to one another that everybody needs to try the pork fat rice cakes (they're right) will be bouncing off the concrete walls and the steel ceilings. After a while, you may get curious about the cloudy, oatmeal-colored drink served in frosty mugs. It is makgeolli, a yeasty rice brew with the soft sweetness of cantaloupe. By 10 or so, the crowds may thin a bit and there might be a seat at the bar. This is good because that is when the ramen broth is finally ready, after bubbling in a pot for half a day with the bones of fish and pork and chicken. Ramen is listed on the menu as ramyun, one of the large plates, which implies sharing. I recommend eating it alone at the bar, where you can have all four slices of sweet pork to yourself and make as much noise as you want slurping the bouncy, squiggly noodles out of the steaming and chile-hot soup. The ramen shows up on the modern side of the menu, even though nothing about its long-simmered, bone-rich flavor tastes 21st century. But Mr. Kim is now the city's leading interpreter of Korean cuisine, and if he says the dish is modern, the rest of us will have to believe him.

He would have extended his streak to four courses, I think, had the menu offered a foie gras dessert. As it turned out, his appetizer would have worked almost as well as a finale. The Modern's chef, Gabriel Kreuther, scooped out little balls of duck liver terrine and rolled them in crumbs of fried celery root so they looked like nut-crusted bonbons. These counterfeit candies were set on a rectangle of mango and passion fruit sauce within scribbles of syrupy balsamic vinegar, bringing out an unsuspected kinship between the terrine and ganache. In the second course, foie gras was a star protein, poached in red wine. This time its garnishes -- bittersweet chocolate tuile, pickled red currants and a peppery caramel -- worked as foils to show up its seriousness and depth. Then in the third course, it took a step back, serving as a sauce that enriched slices of squab breast baked in savoy cabbage inside a shatteringly thin brik crust. The three dishes could have been a monotonous episode in self-indulgence. Instead they were a memorable demonstration of the skill, inventiveness and discipline that permit Mr. Kreuther to make his ingredients do what he wants them to do while still tasting like themselves. Those traits made my recent meals in the Dining Room at the Modern a pleasure and something of a discovery, if one can discover an eight-year-old restaurant run by Danny Meyer inside the Museum of Modern Art . When the Dining Room was last reviewed in The New York Times, in 2005, Frank Bruni praised its \"significant joys,\" including much of the food, but warned of \"uneven terrain\" on the menu. At the time, the far more casual and livelier Bar Room up front met its promises more fully, as Mr. Bruni suggested when he awarded that space three stars in a later review, one more than he had given the Dining Room. The Bar Room still has more energy, but the cooking in the Dining Room has more focus and intensity than I remember from the early days. Mr. Kreuther's dishes in this space are more complicated than the more rustic ones in the Bar Room, but the complications pay off in rewarding layers of harmony and contrast. Two cured fillets of sardine (one smooth and silver, the other crackling and golden with a thin sheet of brioche seared to its skin) were outfitted with crisp artichoke chips and dots of artichoke pur\u00e9e, but the warm heart of the dish was a bright sauce of tomato confit, black garlic, green olives, roasted red peppers and blood oranges. Eat it and you almost felt the summer sun beating down on your head. Other recent dishes invited you to burrow into winter's consolations. Sweet apple-wood smoke made its way into every bite of a sturgeon and sauerkraut tart topped with a glittering vein of caviar. It was elegant and powerful, like the pairing of a luxuriously soft poached egg with squid-ink spaetzle, sea urchin, roasted salsify and fragments of black truffles. The white walls and tablecloths, and the grid of steel and glass facing the museum's sculpture garden, suggest a contemporary gallery. This graceful, understated room stands back so the artistry can happen on the plate. Mr. Kreuther follows through. He is bold with color, painting salmon crimson with a marinade of beet juice, or drawing a dark green stripe of powdered Kaffir lime down the center of a monkfish fillet resting in a gorgeous sauce of blood orange and mustard. He is intrepid with flavor as well. Roasted lobster tail seemed complete with a smoky pimento broth that I would have happily drunk from a teacup, but then a server brought something extra, a tiny portion of tender claw meat under a wheel of burned sugar that went beyond caramel by several degrees of bitterness. It was daring and wonderful. One or two dares didn't pay off, like juxtaposition of pear pur\u00e9e and bay scallops. There were technical glitches, too, like the bottom crust on the sturgeon tart that was crisp one night but damp on another, or the piece of cobia cooked to the point of dryness on one side. Yet the next act of each four-course, $98 fixed-price dinner would invariably set things right again. This was especially true for Marc Aumont's desserts, fresh looks at European classics like a black currant vacherin or a Black Forest cake rendered as an array of cubes, cones and spheres. Calling something modern puts it at risk of looking dated, as one or two things at the Modern do. A flurry of amuse-bouches always included a test tube full of hot liquid. Are we still pretending this is a fun way to drink soup? And the charcoal gray suits with collarless shirts the servers wear look like costumes from a sci-fi film about a dystopian, genderless future. The vented jackets in particular don't do the women any favors. As you notice this, though, you also notice just how many women there are in the front of the house, along with others who don't look like men of European descent. It is a pleasure to see this kind of diversity at the higher altitudes of New York dining, where it is still not the rule. The staff was always attentive and mindful, helping diners navigate food allergies, for instance. At moments, though, the service felt disengaged and aloof in ways than can make this formal room feel chillier than it needs to be. (When I heard happy, intoxicated shouts from the Bar Room, I felt as if I'd joined the wrong club.) One night, the server driving the mignardise trolley acted as if listing the whole catalog of sweets would make the meal longer than it needed to be, and suggested that she make the choice for us instead. Another night, it was wheeled around by someone who seemed to have been waiting all night for the chance to tell us about the Calvados lollipops, the saffron truffles, the macadamia pralines and the make-your-own sandwich cookies of butter wafers and chocolate ganache in a tube. By drawing out the moment, our server made it one to remember. Like the trolley, the restaurant itself is full of unexpected delights. Unpacking them one by one is the pleasant work of a meal.

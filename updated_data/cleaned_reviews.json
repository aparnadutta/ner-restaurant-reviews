But if you do decide to eat inside a restaurant, try to go at an hour when it's less crowded. Before you sit down, take a quick look around. If the management doesn't seem to be taking things like airflow and masks seriously, public health experts suggest eating somewhere else. \"A poorly ventilated indoor space with people talking is the virus's dream,\" said Lindsey J. Leininger, a clinical professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. Stuffy, stale air. Crowds standing around the host station or anywhere else. (Outdoor host stands are a good idea.) Tables that are too close together. The distance between customers who aren't seated together should be at least six feet, although some experts, like Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech, recommend 10 feet. Noise. People who talk when not wearing a mask are a risk. People who talk loudly, shout or sing without a mask are a bigger risk. Servers who linger at the table, or who drop their masks at any time. Windows and doors that are open to let in fresh air. Window fans that face out. (Beware of fans that face in and of floor fans, which could move virus-laden particles around the dining room.) Portable air purifiers with HEPA filters. Movable partitions, although they are not an invincible force. Carafes of water on the table, ordering by app and other ways of speeding up or avoiding interactions with servers.

Good news was rare, but she got some a few weeks ago from an unexpected corner: She had won an award for outstanding design from the James Beard Foundation. A design award? Ms. Chemla, the principal owner of Carissa's the Bakery, on Pantigo Road in East Hampton, N.Y., was responsible for the look of the interior, but she isn't an architect. To learn how to make a floor plan, she had walked into dining rooms, kitchens and bars across Manhattan with a tape measure. The news came as a surprise for another reason. In August, the foundation had issued a news release stating that, beyond some awards it had announced in May, it would not be disclosing winners in any other categories, presumably including the one Ms. Chemla was in the running for. \"The uncertainty of this time for our industry is already a hard reality and considering anyone to have won or lost within the current tumultuous hospitality ecosystem does not in fact feel like the right thing to do,\" Clare Reichenbach, the foundation's chief executive, said in the release. That seemed to be the end of that. Except it wasn't. The email Ms. Chemla received in September came from the architect James Biber, the chairman of the design awards committee. He congratulated her on her win in what was a new category this year, Outstanding Design of Alternative Eating and Drinking Places. Mr. Biber sent similar emails to the winners in the two other categories he oversaw. He added a caveat: Although their victories were real, Mr. Biber said, \"the Beard Foundation will not be publicly announcing the awards.\" Nonetheless, the winners were told they could, if they wished, mention the distinction \"as part of your own office P.R. efforts.\" How do you publicize an award from a group that doesn't want to admit that you've won? Ms. Chemla wasn't quite sure, so she asked Mr. Biber for clarification. A week later, a foundation employee emailed her and the other winners. The message turned the previous one on its head: The foundation would be releasing the results of the design awards after all, but the winners were asked to stay quiet about it until a virtual ceremony on Sept. 25. On Monday morning, in response to questions from The New York Times about the design awards, an official at the foundation said in an email that the honorees would be announced later in the day. Some nominees and winners have had a hard time keeping up with these switchbacks and swerves. \"To say it's been a bumpy ride hardly sums it up,\" said Joe Sundberg, an owner of Rupee Bar , in Seattle, which won the award for Outstanding Design for restaurants with 75 seats or fewer. For one of Mr. Sundberg's partners, Rachel Johnson, knowing that other restaurants will never find out if they won a Beard this year makes it a little hard to process Rupee Bar's good fortune. \"I don't understand why they had the design and media awards and not the others,\" Ms. Johnson said. \"I feel like they shouldn't have done any of them. It's just so confusing for everybody.\" Confusion may be the one outcome of the 2020 James Beard Awards that everybody can agree on. The foundation announced the results of its Book, Broadcast Media and Journalism Awards in May, when it still seemed possible that the remaining awards could be handed out in a gala ceremony in September. (This reporter has received six of them. He also served on the committee that oversees the restaurant awards in 2005 and 2006.) Over the summer, though, people involved in the restaurant awards say that urgent meetings were taking place behind the scenes. Some nominees had asked to be taken out of consideration. Others had fallen under suspicion of behavior that might reflect poorly on the awards. And, according to several people close to the awards, at least one foundation employee had raised a concern that no Black people had won any of the restaurant awards. Before a decision on how to proceed could be reached, the foundation announced that no further awards would be given out this year. Some nominees supported the decision. Others found it perplexing , like Katie Button , who was nominated this year in the category Best Chef: Southeast. Subsequent clarifications, revelations and responses to emails that Ms. Button sent to the foundation only deepened her concerns, as did hearing an account of the twisting, turning path of the design awards. \"It's another way of not telling the whole truth,\" she said. \"The stories of what's happening and the whys just haven't been adding up.\" Ms. Button, who added that she had found some Beard Foundation programs very helpful in her professional development, applauded the organization for its decision to conduct an audit of the awards process to root out systemic bias. \"Everybody can sympathize that this is a difficult situation and that they are trying to do their best,\" she said. \"But when somebody is trying to do their best, they need to own all the mistakes and problems along the way, and lay them out for the public, and not be afraid of what happens after that.\" Elaborating on the decision to announce the design award winners, Mitchell Davis, the foundation's chief strategy officer, wrote in an email today: \"As you know, the winners of these awards are design firms, not restaurants or chefs. There is a separate committee governing these awards and in turn, a separate set of criteria. The design awards short list did not experience the same issue with integrity due to nominee withdrawals after the voting concluded, so these honorees are being announced.\" For this article, Rupee Bar's designer, Heliotrope Architects, declined to confirm its win, citing the foundation's request for silence. So did ORA and Klein Agency, the two firms responsible for Auburn , a Los Angeles restaurant that was given the award in the 76-seats-and-over category. Both wins were confirmed by other people who had been told about the results. Mr. Sundberg, Ms. Johnson and another partner built much of Rupee Bar themselves with help from Mr. Sundberg's father, a builder. They fashioned dark wood, brass, polychromatic tile and plaster painted peacock blue into an exuberant lounge that radiates a lack of interest in midcentury minimalism. Few customers are lured by that interior these days, or even have a chance to see it; Rupee Bar has survived mainly on to-go sales for months. Still, having the design honored by restaurant world's most influential awards couldn't hurt. \"Any kind of recognition like this does move the needle,\" Ms. Johnson said. \"It definitely wouldn't have been a hindrance, and probably would have been a help.\" Auburn's award may be the last one it will win. In May, Eric Bost, the chef and owner, concluded that the restaurant could not survive the pandemic, and closed it. Amy Brandwein , a nominee for the Best Chef: Mid-Atlantic award this year for her work at Centrolina , in Washington, believes the foundation has worked hard to help the restaurant business grapple with abuse, discrimination and other deep-seated problems. Still, when she talks about the decision not to announce winners this year, the word that keeps coming up is \"sad.\" She said that her sadness is not for herself, but for other nominees who might have won \"a recognition that they will not receive.\" \"Things happen in life,\" Ms. Brandwein said. \"Life's short. And it would be nice if those individuals knew that they had received this.\" After she got the initial email from Mr. Biber, Ms. Chemla added \"2020 James Beard Award winner\" to the Instagram page she maintains for Carissa's. She hasn't taken it down. She is proud of the space she designed. By day, trays of pastry and bread slide in and out of the oven and customers drop by to eat a quick lunch at the stark slab of a communal table inspired by Donald Judd. By night, oil-burning ship lanterns are lighted, an eating counter is restyled as a bar and a relaxed, off-duty rhythm settles over the room. After the ceremony on Friday, her win will presumably be out in the open. But Ms. Chemla has mixed feelings about celebrating. \"It's very bittersweet for me to flatter myself\" by publicizing the award, she said, \"when others are equally deserving and will not be rewarded.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

Seegal, the committee charged that employees of the organization had \"compromised the integrity\" of the awards by trying to alter the established voting process this summer, after the voting had already taken place. The foundation suggested changing the procedure after a staff member expressed a concern that no Black people had won in any of the 23 categories. The statement, obtained by The New York Times, added that the foundation's \"subsequent lack of transparency undermines our confidence\" in a coming review of systemic bias in the awards process. The committee, which is made up of journalists, editors and other prominent figures in the food media, also accused the foundation of acting in ways that \"negatively reflect on the professional reputations\" of the committee members. The awards, considered the most prestigious and influential in American culinary circles, are presented in a black-tie ceremony in Chicago each May. This spring, as the coronavirus pandemic brought the restaurant business to a near-standstill, the event was postponed until September. Then, in August, the organization, a nonprofit group, made an unusual decision: It would name no winners for its restaurant and chef awards, beyond a handful that had already been announced, citing the pandemic, among other reasons. Next year, there would be no awards at all. The foundation would use the down time for an audit that would look for ways of making the awards more inclusive of people and groups who had often been left behind by the restaurant industry. The awards are supposed to return in 2022. Last month, though, several committee members, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement, told The Times that the foundation's decision had come after several weeks of behind-the-scenes turmoil . After a vote, in May, on a ballot that listed about five nominees in each category, the foundation received accusations against several of the nominees, varying in seriousness and specificity. On a phone call in July that was arranged to discuss the new allegations, \"a Foundation employee revealed that there were not any Black people among this year's winners,\" the statement from the restaurant-awards committee said. \"Apparently in response, the Foundation proposed a revote.\" The proposal was to strike nominees who had come under fire, and to send a revised ballot to a much smaller group of voters than before. Ballots would go to the awards committee itself and the 200 or so regional judges they select, but not to the largest bloc, the hundreds of past awardees whose vote is a perk of having won. The committee \"unanimously rejected the attempt to alter established Awards procedure to obtain a different result,\" the statement said. As for the foundation's disclosure that there were no Black winners, the statement called it \"incredibly disappointing.\" But learning anything at all about who had won, even in the form of demographic data, was in itself \"shocking,\" the statement said, given that under the rules of the awards, all results are supposed to be kept confidential. The foundation's leaders have given versions of events that seem to be at odds with the one presented by the committee. In August, after The Times reported on the backstage discussions, Clare Reichenbach, the foundation's chief executive, denied that there was a list of winners to be revealed. \"There was no final vote on the winners,\" she said. The committee statement, signed by all 20 members, concludes by asking the foundation to acknowledge that a list of winners for 2020 exists, to confirm that \"demographics\" played a part in the decision not to release the list, and to explain, in essence, who at the foundation knew what about the winners, and when they knew it. (This reporter served on the restaurant awards committee in 2005 and 2006, and has received six of the foundation's journalism awards.) Ms. Reichenbach said in a statement on Wednesday that the withdrawal of several nominees after the voting \"compromised the original list of winners and it was our understanding that, therefore, there would be a revote. We thought it best, based on input from committee members and given the dire state of the industry, to change the approach to the Awards this year and next in recognition of these extraordinary times.\" She said the review of the way the awards are run would include new procedures \"to reallocate votes in the event nominees withdraw.\" Through a publicist for the foundation, Mr. Seegal said that Ms. Reichenbach's statement reflected his views as well.

This article has been updated to note that Pete Wells served on the James Beard awards' restaurant committee for two years.) The James Beard Foundation's declaration last week that it would not announce the winners of this year's major restaurant and chef awards startled Blake Spalding and Jen Castle, the two chefs who own Hell's Backbone Grill & Farm in Boulder, Utah. The week before, Ms. Spalding and Ms. Castle had taped a short video at the foundation's request in which they pretended to accept the award they had been nominated for, Best Chef Mountain. Told to give a 30-second acceptance speech, they thanked their employees, then clapped and laughed for 90 seconds, as if they had just won. All the nominees were being asked to make a video like this, they were told. Still, they allowed themselves to get their hopes up. Then they got a mass email from the foundation, calling the whole thing off. \"We were really gutted,\" Ms. Spalding said. \"It was a really demoralizing and wrenching thing to be so close and have them be, \u2018Never mind.' \" She was not the only one taken by surprise. Several people on the volunteer committee that administers the restaurant awards said they learned about an hour before the announcement that there would be no new winners this year because they seemed \"minor\" compared with the hardships restaurants now face. The foundation's news release said the decision not to name winners in 2020 or 2021 had been made \"after serious deliberation and consultation with members of the industry, Award committees, JBF staff, and partners.\" But the days leading up to the decision were so frantic that many people close to the awards say they aren't quite sure what had happened. With the winners' names to be broadcast at a virtual ceremony set for late September, the foundation struggled to stay on schedule as the ground shifted beneath its feet. Restaurant workers were taking to social media to denounce their bosses . The restaurant-going public was rapidly changing its notions of which chef behaviors should be rewarded, which overlooked and which shunned. As Black Lives Matter protests bloomed across the country, patience was growing thin over how few opportunities are given to Black chefs, including the opportunity to win Beard awards. The James Beard Foundation itself was trying to leave behind its origins as a group that celebrated the restaurant industry, and make itself over as one that led the charge for reform. It was a lot to handle. By last week, the foundation's leaders had settled on calling off the rest of the 2020 awards season, which only a few days before had seemed like a remote possibility. The short list of nominees had been announced in May. The final vote had been cast and counted soon afterward. But in July and August, the slate of nominees began to crumble, according to interviews with foundation officials, nominees and members of the committee that administers the restaurant and chef awards. Some chefs took themselves out of the running. The foundation asked others to drop out, having deemed them too controversial because new allegations about their personal or professional behavior had surfaced over the summer. The critics, reporters and other media people on the restaurant awards committee say they were overwhelmed by the number and speed with which chefs were falling under suspicion. At an emergency meeting held on Zoom in late July, a foundation staff member who had seen the final voting results raised a second concern: No Black people had won in any of the 23 categories on the ballot. This would not have been a first for the James Beard awards. The foundation and the restaurant awards committee had promised many times recently, though, to field more diverse slates of candidates. Many observers saw progress. This year, a number of Black chefs were named as semifinalists or nominees. But they had lost in the final round of voting, according to people who were briefed on the racial breakdown of the results. \"The message came through that they knew who the winners were, and the winners didn't look like they want them to look,\" said one committee member, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of concerns about violating the nondisclosure agreement everyone on the panel is required to sign. After some discussion, a suggestion was placed before the committee. \"We proposed removing previous winners\" from the voting body, said Mitchell Davis, the foundation's chief strategy officer. According to the procedures described on the foundation's website, votes on the restaurant and chef awards are given to the 20 members of the restaurant committee, to the 200 or so regional judges they appoint, and to hundreds of people who have won awards in the past. Established in 1990, the awards program embraces several fields, including design, journalism, books and broadcast media. But the prizes that are called the Oscars of the food world are the ones given to chefs and restaurants. (This reporter has received six of the journalism awards, and served on the restaurant awards committee in 2005 and 2006.) The restaurant and chef awards have long mirrored the American restaurant business itself, whose highest slopes of power and prestige have tended to be the preserve of white men cooking food mainly derived from Western Europe. Mr. Davis and others see the voting bloc of previous winners as a possible source of what he calls \"systemic bias.\" But taking them out of the process after the votes had been counted struck many members of the restaurant committee as foul play. \"The committee was like, if the results aren't what we wanted, tough,\" said one member, who asked not to be named because of the nondisclosure agreement. \"We're not going to get into vote rigging.\" There was less resistance to another proposal: a second vote, with the regular group of voters. The ballot would be edited to remove nominees the foundation now saw as problematic. But as summer went on, that list kept getting longer. \"The longer they waited, the more they learned about people,\" another committee member said. In July, Jessica Koslow, a Los Angeles chef, sent a letter to the foundation withdrawing as a candidate for Best Chef California. Her reputation had been bruised by allegations that she had taken credit for others' recipes, misled city health inspectors and allowed furry lids of mold to grow on pots of jam. \"Right now, my presence on the slate will only serve as a distraction,\" she wrote. On social media and in news articles, other nominees were accused of abusing, underpaying or mistreating workers. Additional accusations were made privately to the foundation staff. Several restaurant committee members, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that some of the allegations brought to them were so vague that they weren't sure what the problem was. Lacking the time to investigate each case, the committee asked the foundation staff to follow up. What happened next is in dispute. Committee members say they were waiting for more information about the allegations before making a decision. They also wanted the chefs to have a chance to tell their side of the story. But several chefs who received calls from the foundation say they had no chance to respond, and were given few details about what they were supposed to have done or who said they had done it. Mr. Davis said that in deciding what to do about chefs who fell under suspicion, the foundation was guided by a recently adopted awards criterion that allows chefs to be disqualified for \"allegations of criminal or unethical behavior, or behavior determined to be detrimental or contrary to the integrity and fair perception of the Awards.\" If he or someone else from the foundation called a chef, Mr. Davis said, \"we felt there was enough information to meet our eligibility criteria, which was about the reality that there is some controversy brewing that might affect the integrity of the awards.\" Told that several chefs felt they had no chance to respond to the information against them, Mr. Davis said, \"In questions when people in power are challenged in ways that might undermine that power, not enough weight is given to those who are making those challenges.\" One nominated chef said that a representative of the foundation called two weeks ago to communicate a charge that was both anonymous and nebulous: \"toxic kitchen culture.\" \"I said, \u2018Can you give me an example?' She said, \u2018That's it. Toxic kitchen culture.'\" The chef said the Beard representative suggested withdrawing from the ballot. \"She said, \u2018I'm in P.R., so I can give you a bunch of examples of how to do this.'\" This chef, who spoke anonymously to avoid being tainted by the suspicion of misbehavior, refused to drop out, and remains on the list of nominees. Several other chefs disappeared last week from that list, though, including Rich Landau, Paul Bartolotta, Kristen Essig and Michael Stoltzfus. On the same day, the foundation announced that it would not be disclosing the winners. Another name struck from the record belonged to the California chef David Kinch, a nominee in the Outstanding Chef category. Mr. Kinch wrote in an Instagram post on Aug. 15 that he had \"decided to remove myself from consideration, and potential acceptance of this year's award.\" No \"single event\" had led to the decision, he wrote, but \"the idea of celebrating achievement -- and all that our @manresarestaurant has accomplished -- simply does not feel right in the midst of the ongoing pandemic, and the devastation it has pressed upon our chosen m\u00e9tier and industry.\" In an email, Mr. Kinch said that withdrawing \"was my decision only,\" and that his only communication about it with the James Beard Foundation was sending it a copy of his statement in advance. Asked whether Mr. Kinch could be called a nominee for this year, Mr. Davis said: \"I would say no. I would say the record has been amended.\" Some people who work on the awards say they are concerned by how the foundation handled the allegations against nominees. \"I'm really troubled by the lack of process and transparency,\" said Hanna Raskin, who has been on the restaurant committee for three years. \"What I would like to know is, where is this information coming from and what are the standards? Do we have a list of disqualifiers? To me, it's a really big thing to remove somebody from a list.\" The group's chief executive, Clare Reichenbach, said in a statement on Tuesday that the decision to cancel the awards was not made in haste, but added: \"It is not a secret that we believe that there is work to be done in adapting our Awards policies to have a more fair and equitable playing field. If this means changing the way things have been done in the past, adapting judging privileges that have likely perpetuated bias, and taking a stronger stance on nominee behaviors that violate our guidelines, we are ready to do that for the betterment of the Awards and the community they serve.\" Arguing about the awards is a long-running sport in the food business, but even by those standards the foundation's choice not to name winners has been divisive. \"It makes no sense to me,\" said Alan Richman, a journalist and occasional New York Times contributor who once served on the restaurant awards committee. \"It seems they must have found some intrinsic flaw in the voting. What else could it be? If they found a flaw in the voting, they should say so.\" Ms. Raskin and others feel that the foundation has passed up an easy chance to help restaurants whose survival is threatened by the pandemic. \"What stands out to me about this decision is that the vote was conducted, winners were chosen and those winners weren't allowed to know that they won,\" she said. \"In this time of crisis for the hospitality industry, the foundation had an opportunity to do right by even one person, and decided not to do that for reasons that remain unclear.\" With the traditional Beard awards on pause until 2022, the foundation has said it is taking a year to work with all seven of its awards committees and \"an outside social justice agency\" to settle on new ground rules. The goal, the foundation said, is to \"remove any systemic bias\" and make the rosters of candidates even more diverse. Paola Velez, a pastry chef in Washington, was nominated in the Rising Star Chef category, which recognizes chefs age 30 or younger. When the awards return in 2022, she will be too old to qualify. Even so, she said that she doesn't mind that the world will never know whether she won this year. \"I'm an Afro-Dominican girl from the Bronx,\" she wrote in an email. \"My nomination has inspired so many, including myself. It's not about winning or losing for me.\" In Utah, Blake Spalding has had a harder time accepting that the award she was nominated for will never be given out. \"It feels risky to me to criticize the foundation,\" she said. \"But in a year when they had more women and racially diverse chefs as nominees than ever, why not make every nominee a winner? What does my nomination even mean now that it's been canceled?\" \"I am for a more just restaurant industry and a more just country,\" she said. \"There are a lot of dodgy practices in the restaurant industry that need to be changed. But is this going to change it, canceling the awards?\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

It was something like one of those MasterClasses that everybody is watching these days, except that those run for 20 minutes, and my lesson lasted more than six hours. It may not have been the longest Zoom call in history, but I suspect it set a record for Zoom calls with a strong focus on boneless poultry. It came about because for the past few months Mr. Buford has been on what he calls \"a chicken kick.\" He tends to get preoccupied with a recipe or technique or ingredient and keep coming back to it, over and over, until a new obsession takes hold. Recently he went on a mayonnaise kick, whisking grapeseed oil into egg yolks a drop at a time, sometimes adding the zest of a couple of lemons, a trick he learned when he worked for the chef Michel Richard . Several years ago, Mr. Buford went on a bread kick. He made the dough with flour he brought back from his last trip to France, a flour that he said was \"magical in the way that Bob's flour was magical\" -- Bob being what everybody called Yves Richard, a baker in Lyon who gave Mr. Buford his first apprenticeship after he moved to that city with his family in 2008. He said that as soon as the magical French flour ran out, \"I thought, \u2018There's no point in making bread.'\" The roots of all three kicks are recounted in Mr. Buford's latest book, \" Dirt: Adventures in Lyon as a Chef in Training, Father, and Sleuth Looking for the Secret of French Cooking .\" As in his previous two books, Mr. Buford's reportorial method is to embed himself with his subjects so completely that he becomes almost indistinguishable from them. In \"Among the Thugs,\" he got so caught up in the culture of violent English soccer fans that he was beaten up by the police. (\"It's surprisingly painful to be beaten,\" he said.) Pursuing his interest in Italian cuisine, the subject of \"Heat,\" he spent so much time with the chef Mario Batali that Mr. Batali seemed to forget that he was being watched by a very sharp and observant journalist who was taking notes on his crude patter and sexualized behavior years before multiple women accused him of assault, abuse and harassment. \"Dirt\" is the story of how Mr. Buford tried to understand the food of France by learning to cook it. For this, he moved to Lyon with his wife, Jessica Green , and their twin sons; took classes at the Institut Paul Bocuse , just outside the city; and eventually persuaded the chef Mathieu Viannay to let him volunteer in the kitchen of La M\u00e8re Brazier . The idea was to stay nine months. In Mr. Buford's world, though, departure dates, deadlines and other end points in time are more or less hypothetical. Not flight times -- they turned out to be real, as he learned when he and the boys missed the plane to Lyon that was supposed to begin their new life there, where Ms. Green was already waiting. He writes that his call to her from the airport was \"the nadir of our married life.\" Once they arrived, though, the family did not move back to New York for almost five years. In January, I asked Mr. Buford if we could cook together, making something he had learned in Lyon. At first he was going to have a dinner party. We were still talking in March when dinner parties began to seem unwise and then were banned. We finally settled on a video call. Whenever we talked or emailed, he would suggest different elaborations on the basic theme of poached chicken, and after a while just talking about chicken with Mr. Buford seemed at least as interesting as cooking it. Perhaps he would slide truffle slices under the skin for poulet en demi-deuil, the rarely seen chicken in half-mourning made famous by Eug\u00e8nie Brazier, the chef who founded La M\u00e8re Brazier. I wanted to see that. But I was also intrigued by another dish that had become a signature of Paul Bocuse , who had passed through the kitchen of La M\u00e8re Brazier in the 1950s: poulet en vessie, a whole bird steamed inside a pig's bladder. In \"Dirt,\" Mr. Buford described the appearance of the bladder during cooking with a sense of wonder that stuck with me: \"a beautifully golden, nearly translucent beach ball that some maniac is still insisting on pumping more air into. Also, you can see the chicken!\" One day Mr. Buford called to say that a parcel of bladders had arrived (\"they look like socks\"), but that he had also been talking to a producer at NPR about making chicken en vessie . Would I mind if we cooked something else? I did not mind. We had never exactly settled on poulet en vessie, and the French have so many other ways to cook a chicken. There would be more discussions about chickens before we got together on Zoom, but finally, one day at 2:30 p.m., I clicked a link and Mr. Buford's face appeared on my screen. He was wearing an apron. He had also finished his prep work. I found an apron, tied it on and chopped piles of mushrooms, parsley and bread crumbs as fast as I could. Mr. Buford seemed to be in no hurry. \"We split our duties, and Jessica usually takes over the school nights, because she tends to get food on the table more punctually than I do,\" he said. It was a Friday, though, one of the days when he is allowed to cook, and there was an understanding in the house that dinner might be served on the later side. Almost an hour had passed before we made our first approach to the chickens. Mr. Buford had me nick out the wishbone first. Off went the wing tips, and then he showed me how to slip the point of the knife into the small socket where the wing joins the carcass, running the point of the blade around the hollow place. Without any slicing of meat or sawing of bone, the joint swung free. Then we began exploring the interior of the chicken leg, which becomes a confusing place once you start taking out the bones. I angled my laptop's camera so he had a view of my cutting board. What was lying there looked less and less like a bird. \"It helps to reassemble the chicken every so often so you know where you are,\" he said. His patient manner was nothing like the rushed, barking tone he describes inside La M\u00e8re Brazier. \"Dirt\" depicts the sadism and bullying Mr. Buford experienced in the kitchen, and the sexism and racism shown to other workers. A Malaysian culinary student is taken on as a stagiaire; everybody calls him Jackie Chan. Even Mr. Buford did it until he learned the student's name, Chern Hwei Gan. A female cook, perhaps the first since the days of Eug\u00e8nie Brazier, was addressed as \"Mademoiselle\" for two weeks. After that, all pretense of respect was dropped, and the chef de partie would pretend to \"mount her from behind\" each time she passed. For the epilogue, Mr. Buford tracked them down to see how the mistreatment had affected their careers. Mr. Chern went on to open what Mr. Buford calls a \"witty and anarchic\" restaurant in Dijon . The female cook, though, gave up on restaurant kitchens and went into the fashion business. \"Her cooking spirit had been crushed,\" he writes. \"Dirt\" is more explicit about the damage done by masculine aggression and volatility in the kitchen than \"Heat,\" published in 2006. In that book, Mr. Batali is seen acting coarsely, making sexual suggestions toward at least one female employee. The author's tone, though, is nonjudgmental. I asked Mr. Buford if he regretted that now. \"I think I felt pretty confident in the weight of the observations,\" he said. \"A lot of the observations were not loaded in their presentation but loaded in their content. And I think that's what works.\" The book, which for years remained one of the only pieces of journalism that showed the uglier side of Mr. Batali's bacchanalian drive, caused a rift between the two men. \"Mario hated it, and it took him a long time to get over it,\" he said. \"He described it as \u2018standing naked in front of a mirror for 24 hours.'\" By 4:30, with Mr. Buford's video guidance, I had successfully taken out all the chicken bones that seemed to matter. I'd spread the chicken out like an open paperback and covered it with parsley, mushrooms and bread. Mr. Buford showed me how to tie the bird into a neat bundle with a wrap-and-twist motion that I've seen butchers make but have never been able to copy. \"Now we poach them,\" he said. The trick of this was to keep the stock between 150 and 160 degrees, well below boiling, barely hot enough to decorate the surface of the liquid with slow fingers of steam. The steady, moderate heat of the stock mimics the sous vide method. In fact, chicken breasts are now cooked sous vide with an immersion circulator at La M\u00e8re Brazier. Mr. Buford prefers the older, low-tech method because he gets two delicious things out of one recipe: very tender chicken breasts and double-strength chicken stock. During the lockdown, he began taking it one step beyond, boning several chickens, poaching them and then cooking the stock a second time, with the carcasses. He called it \"chicken squared.\" Earlier, I had asked Mr. Buford how the restaurants of a city once famous for its female chefs -- Brazier was one of many m\u00e8res in Lyon -- had come to be dominated by men such as Bocuse. He pointed to the generation that followed the m\u00e8res, including Bocuse's father and Fernand Point of La Pyramide in Vienne, who went off to train in expensive hotels before coming back to take over the family business. \"In hotels then, you would be taught the brigade system, which would be Escoffier ,\" he said. \"You're learning an expertise that the m\u00e8res didn't have. Also, if you have that training, you're not doing home cooking. You're being taught to do grand cuisine.\" The brigade system became standard in ambitious French restaurants, as did a more stylized form of cooking that took pains to set itself apart from what the m\u00e8res had achieved. It would take several generations for French women to regain what had been taken from them. Now, Mr. Buford said, \"There's a whole generation of female chefs in France who are better at the men's game than the men. They're brilliant and tough and they all had to force their way through the heaps of abuse they faced entering those kitchens.\" By 5:15, both birds were in the pot. Clearly, a glass of wine was called for. Mr. Buford called Ms. Green to join our Zoom cocktail hour. About 20 years ago, when I was writing news releases for The New Yorker, she had worked in the fiction department and Mr. Buford had been the fiction editor. The three of us never had a drink together, though. I had opened a Sardinian vermentino. Mr. Buford and Ms. Green had a long colloquy about whether they had a vermentino in the house from Sardinia or anywhere else. No. A riesling, perhaps? They settled on a Chablis, taking it out to a small patio behind their apartment. Ms. Green is a wine writer and educator. While the couple lived in France, she earned a diploma from the Wine & Spirit Education Trust in M\u00e2con. In the first year, though, she took care of 3-year-old twins while Mr. Buford learned to cook. \"They all the time said no to me,\" Ms. Green said. \"They walked home from the library barefoot one day because I got tired of fighting with them about putting on their shoes. And you were never there.\" This was addressed to Mr. Buford, who nodded. \"This was not a job I would have applied for,\" she said. \"And I did that all over the earth. I spent most of that first year taking them on trips.\" The boys are 14 now. The New Yorker has hired them to make videos of their father's cooking kicks. \"Frederick is the bossy-pants director and George is the genuinely bossy-pants cinematographer,\" Mr. Buford said. \"They're not getting a lot and they've got no rights whatsoever, but they're already talking about what they're going to do with the money. And they're quietly expressing disappointment that I haven't turned in another piece.\" Once a few glasses of wine had been put down, Mr. Buford and I went back to our kitchens. His chicken was nearly cooked. Mine was not. He began to whisking up a variation on sauce supr\u00eame that would incorporate sherry vinegar and mustard made with grape must. \"It's one of the secret weapons I picked up from M\u00e8re Brazier kitchen,\" he said. \"It looks like caviar. I love it.\" In theory, we were going to use the poaching stock for our sauces and for rice pilaf. In reality, there wasn't enough for both things, and we used quarts of stock we had bought from Cascun Farm just in case. The conversation turned back to his family's time in Lyon. Mr. Buford said that they would have become eligible for French citizenship if they had stayed a few more months. I asked him what happened. \"We ran out of money,\" he said. \"I wasn't earning money writing a book that took much, much longer than I thought it was going to take.\" The writing of \"Dirt,\" which he sold to Knopf in 2008, consumed 12 years. By May, when it was published, Mr. Richard had died -- both Mr. Richards, the chef and the bread-baking Mr. Richard known as Bob. So had other subjects and characters in the book. So had its editor, Sonny Mehta. This is all recounted in an epilogue called \"Just About Everybody Dies.\" At 7:30, Mr. Buford told his wife that dinner would be ready in half an hour. He brushed the poached chicken with orange juice and butter to help it brown, and put it into the oven along with a casserole of rice pilaf. I asked if he'd used stock for the rice. \"I used it for the rice and I used other stock for the sauce, but I'm not using it for the zucchini I'm about to do,\" he said. Wait, zucchini? It was about 8:15 when Mr. Buford told Ms. Green that it was time to call the boys for dinner. After Mr. Buford and I hung up, I tried to picture them all sitting down together. When they grew up, the boys would almost certainly remember when they didn't have to go to school for months and their father kept coming up with new ways to poach a chicken. A few days later, according to Mr. Buford, Frederick looked in the refrigerator. Once again, it was full of birds. \"So many?\" he asked. \"Why are we always eating chicken? I hate chicken.\" Recipes: Supr\u00eame de Volaille Fermi\u00e8re \u00e0 la Cr\u00e8me (Chicken Breast in Cream) | Cervelle de Canut (Herbed Cheese Spread) Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

Traditionally, the city's sidewalk cafes tended to be dull to look at, crowded rows of tables hemmed in by plain metal railings. The new ones are more expressive. Governed by two emergency programs meant to let restaurants earn some money until indoor dining can resume, these structures follow a set of rules for keeping the public safe from the coronavirus and, when the seating is placed in parking spaces, from passing cars. Within and around these rules, however, creativity blossomed. A few restaurateurs consulted with the Rockwell Group, Pink Sparrow and other design firms that have dreamed up modular, prefabricated platforms and barriers. Nearly everybody else winged it. Working quickly with small budgets and the awareness that anything they build now will probably have to be torn down in September or October, when the programs end, restaurateurs have built little public gardens to welcome New Yorkers back from their long sequestrations. These oases, surrounded by plants and shaded by wide umbrellas, have temporarily transformed the city. Owners in some neighborhoods, like Chinatown in Manhattan and the Mexican strip in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, have been unable to take advantage of the programs so far. But in many others, every block or so holds out the possibility of a quick getaway to a faraway beach or an elegant urban glade. The promise of these outdoor cafes is a few hours of relief from our well-founded fears. Like most of the United States-Canadian border, the line between Little Italy and NoLIta is not clearly marked. But you know you're in NoLIta the minute you see the planter boxes surrounding the Mulberry Street seating area for Ruby's Caf\u00e9. They're painted millennial pink. The color scheme is just one of the ways Ruby's has maximized the limited design possibilities of a temporary structure that sits on a gray platform built over a patch of New York City asphalt. The chairs are mod bent-plywood numbers, strings of lights suggest a garden and the sun is kept out by a flax-colored awning. A speaker pointed at the sidewalk floats a chill, party soundtrack over the tables, but clear plastic partitions between the tables help keep the scene from evolving into a socially undistanced dance party. Until recently, it might have been possible to walk past the corner of Seventh Avenue and Perry Street without noticing Baby Brasa . This is no longer the case. The restaurant took over a long stretch of the avenue on the far side of the bike lane, furnishing it with chairs, umbrellas, palm trees and two inflatable pink flamingoes the size of Jacuzzis. Eduardo Trejo, a manager, said he had ordered the birds from Amazon to give the street dining zone a little \"Miami style.\" They also complement the restaurant's extremely popular Pink Flamingo cocktail, \"a ros\u00e9-y slushie\" that takeout customers can buy in a clear plastic pouch that looks like an IV bag. One of the flamingoes is meant to be a pool float. The other was designed as a splash pool. Baby Brasa has not filled it with water, but that has not kept customers from sitting inside the flamingo, cocktails in hand. By the end of last weekend, a customer had accidentally punctured its head. The rest of the animal remained inflated, though. \"It's another V.I.P. table,\" Mr. Trejo said. At Evelina , the managing partner, Giuseppe de Francisci, wanted to replicate the feeling of a town in Italy, where he grew up. So he went to the flower district in Manhattan and came back with planters full of tall bamboo spires that tower over the tops of the Peroni umbrellas he uses to shade the tables. Closer to the building are boxes planted with peppers and other foods. \"You are surrounded by nature,\" Mr. de Francisci said. \"You don't think you are in the street.\" Customers have told Dianna Loiselle that the cafe she built in the street in front of her restaurant, Telly's Taverna , reminds them of Greece. That may be due in part to Telly's Greek menu, or to the Greek flag that flies above the tables, next to the American flag. Or it may be that her seating area looks as if it is there for the long haul. \"I didn't want to have something flimsy, because a lot of people drive fast down this street,\" Ms. Loiselle said. On June 22, the first day the rules that expanded outdoor dining went into effect, she went to a garden store in Nassau County for potted palms, New Guinea impatiens, purple coleus and artificial turf. Tables, chairs and umbrellas came from Crate & Barrel, and the sturdy planter boxes were commissioned from a contractor. She likes the outcome so much that she hopes the city will consider making in-street dining areas permanent. \"They said they were only going to leave these until Labor Day,\" she said \"I feel they should have them always.\" Floratorium, a florist that specializes in environmental installations, was hired to build street-dining areas for the three locations of the French cafe Maman . Carlos Franqui, who owns Floratorium, said he had walled the tables off with birch-trunk fences to give them a rustic feel that he describes as \"a barricade that doesn't look like a barricade.\" The inspiration was rustic. \"If you were in the country and needed to build a fence, you wouldn't go to Home Depot,\" Mr. Franqui said. \"You'd call your neighbor and see if he had any logs you could use.\" Behind the fence, which stands on custom-welded iron anchors, are wicker baskets and galvanized buckets filled with rosemary, mint, lavender and other herbs. The two-space parking lot in front of SGD Tofu House suddenly became a major advantage when the city allowed outdoor seating without formal sidewalk cafe permits. Jeff Kim, the owner, said the pavilion he commissioned from a local contractor was inspired by the forest. The plastic barriers, used to control traffic and pedestrians around construction sites, were orange when he bought them. He painted them the color of tree trunks. A local contractor built the wall and partitions on the right and painted them a lighter shade of brown. Greenery is supplied by potted ivy and ferns hanging on the wall, along with 13 arbor vitae trees. Two industrial fans and a pinhole stream of water shooting from a garden hose cool this woodland glade; Mr. Kim thinks the wet pavement makes the area more appealing. \"People don't like eating outside because of dust on the ground,\" he said. Chichi Silva and Fernando Lopez needed a party. They are managing partners of Mansion Supper Club , a restaurant that opened last New Year's Eve and was in business for just over two months before the pandemic shut it down. When outdoor dining was allowed, they looked at a large, graffiti-covered outdoor area where they kept trash and saw -- a party. A beach party, to be precise. They brushed coral-pink and aquamarine paint over the graffiti on an exterior wall, giving it the look of the \" Miami Vice \" wardrobe closet, and \"the rest came from that,\" Mr. Lopez said. The rest: palm trees, picnic tables, umbrellas that look like the roof of a tropical palapa, bamboo mats to obscure the row of brick houses next door. They painted the pavement the color of sand. Finally they built a lifeguard chair, painted it coral and aqua, and stationed it at the entrance where everybody on Broadway can see it. Although restaurants are required to surround in-street dining areas with substantial barriers that are at least 18 inches thick and marked with reflectors, a few places are taking extra precautions. The Blue Bay Restaurant rented concrete Jersey barriers, painted white and safety orange, to protect its customers from the traffic lanes. \"It's safer,\" Elizabeth Katechis, one of the owners, said. The barriers were delivered by a construction firm, which will haul them away again when the city's street-dining program ends in September. Diagrams of model seating areas on the city Department of Transportation's website show planter boxes separating tables from the traffic lanes. Custom-built planter boxes are expensive, though. Andy Hawkins, the owner of Sea Witch , found a cheaper way to enclose the tables he has set out on Fifth Avenue just north of Green-Wood Cemetery : 18-inch-thick stacks of cinder blocks. Mr. Hawkins covered the area with a green, 20-foot-long carport canopy he purchased on Amazon. Striped reflective poles come from a nearby safety-equipment store. Mr. Hawkins believes the cinder blocks satisfy the city's requirement for enclosures, but he has not been able to confirm this. \"The D.O.T. is really hard to speak with,\" he said. The bunker ambience of the street enclosure is a contrast with Sea Witch's other outdoor seating area, a tidy rock garden out back with tufts of irises and a small turtle pond .

Today, he said that he has resigned from the restaurant in order to seek an opportunity to work as a chef in a restaurant he owns himself. \"Something that profits off of Black and brown dollars should be Black-owned,\" Mr. Onwuachi said. \"It's something that's very, very important to me and something that I want to achieve in the future.\" The InterContinental Hotel Group, which operates Kith and Kin and the hotel in which it sits, the InterContinental Washington D.C. -- The Wharf, is still operating the restaurant. \"We are excited for the future of this innovative, landmark restaurant and look forward to sharing more details soon,\" said James Ryan, general manager of the hotel, in a prepared statement. Mr. Onwuachi said that his decision was not directly related to the pandemic. He said, though, that taking time off from Kith and Kin, which was closed from March until June, gave him time to think about what mattered to him. For three weeks in April, he returned to the Bronx, where he grew up, working with World Central Kitchen to prepare meals that were given away to Mott Haven residents and emergency medical workers. \"It was inspiring to cook for the community,\" he said. \"It wasn't, \u2018Oh the nuances, this curry doesn't have enough anise seed in it.' They were just like, \u2018Thank you for this food.'\" He is not sure where his next restaurant will be located. But he is sure that wherever it is, he will be in the kitchen. \"I'm going to cook, I was born to cook, I have to cook,\" he said. \"But I do need to take some time to think about how to build a better future. And I need ownership to do that.\" He also hopes to resurrect Philly Wing Fry, two outposts of which closed in Washington after gaining some renown for their cheese steaks made from dry-aged rib-eye. For Mr. Onwuachi, Kith and Kin was a chance to dust himself off after an earlier and more rarefied restaurant, the Shaw Bijou, failed less than three months into its run. At Kith and Kin, which opened in 2017, he changed gears. He imbued the menu with historical associations of slavery and the African diaspora, leaning more heavily on home-cooking traditions from West Africa, the Caribbean and New Orleans. When he accepted the Rising Star Chef of the Year award from the James Beard Foundation last year, he called himself \"my ancestors' wildest dreams.\" Esquire named Mr. Onwuachi the Chef of the Year in 2019 and placed Kith and Kin among the best new restaurants, even though the place was two years old by then. \"Sometimes a great restaurant takes a while to hit its stride,\" Jeff Gordinier, the magazine's food and drinks editor, wrote. That same year, Mr. Onwuachi published a memoir, \"Notes From a Young Black Chef.\" The book, which is being made into a movie, discussed racism in the hard-driving kitchens where Mr. Onwuachi had trained, provoking a conversation that has come to seem even more timely in the past few months. Paola Velez, Kith and Kin's executive pastry chef, also resigned last week to take the top pastry positions at two Washington restaurants, Maydan and Compass Rose. She will hold the jobs simultaneously. Ms. Velez, who was nominated for the James Beard Foundation's Rising Star Pastry Chef award this year, said that the pandemic and the ongoing protests about the killings of Black people in police custody had reordered some of her priorities. \"In our industry we are always typically fighting to keep the doors open,\" she said. \"Once the doors were blown off the hinges, I had time on my hands and was able to think things through.\" One of the things she thought through was her desire to \"do things for the betterment of other people.\" In June she and two other pastry chefs founded Bakers Against Racism , an \"online virtual bake sale\" to benefit organizations that try to help Black people and communities. So far, she said, the group had raised nearly $1.9 million. She said she felt that the owners of Maydan and Compass Rose were sympathetic to her career goals and her social aims.

Under an emergency program that began on June 22, about 6,800 establishments have been authorized to serve food and drinks at outdoor tables, turning patches of sidewalks and streets into cheerfully ragtag villages of patio umbrellas, beach canopies, outdoor fans and potted palm trees. Another 2.6 miles of roadway, including several blocks along some of the city's best-known restaurant rows, will be available for eating and drinking from Friday afternoons until Sunday nights starting this weekend, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Thursday. Under the plan, an extension of the city's Open Streets program, portions of 22 commercial strips in every borough will be closed to driving but open for dining. \"Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Little Italy -- Mulberry Street -- think about what is possible if we make them into centerpieces of outdoor dining ,\" Mr. de Blasio said. Many restaurateurs were quick to build street and sidewalk seating areas as soon as it was allowed. But some of the earliest adapters have almost immediately run afoul of the city Department of Transportation, which is overseeing the temporary outdoor cafes. The department's first set of guidelines permitted outdoor seating areas on streets with one or two lanes of traffic, to be set off by \"stanchions, barricades or planters, spaced at maximum 5 feet apart.\" Late last week, though, some new requirements appeared, including one that has caused problems for many owners: All barriers, on any kind of street, have to be at least 18 inches thick. Julie Reiner, who owns two bars on Smith Street in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, said that on Monday, an inspector from the department told her that the enclosures she had built around the bars, Leyenda and Clover Club , did not meet city standards. This surprised her. She had printed the specifications on the department's website and handed them to her contractor, who followed them to the letter, she said. He fashioned matching barriers for her bars and two other restaurants on the street out of wooden garden trellises anchored by paint buckets filled with cement. The inspector informed Ms. Reiner that her breezy latticework barriers were too thin; they had to be at least 18 inches thick. She was given 24 hours to change them. \"My contractor needed to fix four places on the block in 24 hours,\" Ms. Reiner said. The cost to each restaurant of taking apart the original barriers and building new planters was $1,000, or about three-quarters of its average nightly revenue. Losing money because the city changed the guidelines \"is really infuriating after all this,\" she said. In a statement, the Department of Transportation said: \"We've worked closely with the industry and city agencies to find processes that put small businesses back to work and kept New Yorkers safe. This program is a brand-new arrangement, enacted at an unprecedented pace, and restaurants have been generous with their patience. Our adjustments to Open Restaurants have been to make sure this program works safely for everyone.\" Interpretations of the department's guidelines have varied. An informal tour of neighborhoods in Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan this week turned up a wide array of materials used to set off seating, from heavy plastic Jersey barriers to colored tape. Some owners say they lost revenue, too. On Sunday, inspectors handed out cease-and-desist orders to an undisclosed number of restaurants, forcing them to shut down until they brought their seating areas into compliance with the new standards. In the East Village, the sandwich shop Foxface and the dusty nautical bar that adjoins it, the William Barnacle Tavern, had surrounded their in-street dining zone with metal barricades of the kind used to control crowds. On Sunday, an inspector informed an owner of Foxface, Ori Kushnir, that he would have to close until he came up with new, compliant barricades. Mr. Kushnir lost two days of business, he said, in addition to the more than $3,000 he had to spend on new, 18-inch-deep planters. \"Anybody who tried to do the right thing the first time, and is trying to do the right thing now, is spending thousands of dollars on this,\" he said. Restaurateurs say they have also heard mixed messages about whether they can seat customers in parking spaces that are cut off from the sidewalk by a bike lane, known as floating parking spaces. The answer is yes, according to the Department of Transportation. Some restaurateurs say they were told otherwise by inspectors. Frank Prisinzano, the chef and owner of three Italian restaurants in the East Village and Lower East Side, said he hopes he misunderstood the inspector who showed up last weekend. \"I spent close to $25,000 on all three restaurants,\" Mr. Prisinzano said. \"I wanted to do it right.\" While he waits to hear from the city, he said he would continue to seat customers in the floating parking spaces outside Lil' Frankie's on Second Avenue. \"It really is helping,\" he said. Indoor dining, which had been scheduled to return on July 6, was put off indefinitely this week as other cities that had allowed restaurants to reopen began to see alarming surges in new Covid-19 cases. Noting that the delay would hurt the hospitality business, Mr. de Blasio said Thursday that one goal of handing the streets over to diners was to \"give maximum options to restaurants and their employees.\" Mr. Prisinzano has little interest in reopening his dining rooms. \"I don't even want the indoors,\" he said. \"I don't feel comfortable seating people indoors. As long as we can put people outdoors, we can get through the summer.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

After thanking her for her business, the company informed her that it would be happy to send a truck to make personal deliveries to the hotel in Newport, R.I., where she and a friend have been living since March. Now, instead of having blocks of frozen meat shipped overnight, she can get freshly slaughtered Rohan duck breasts, squab and baby poussins brought to her door, along with bunches of ramps and other specialties. Ms. Kramer made a note of this in the spreadsheet where she keeps track of more than 50 high-quality food purveyors who are now selling directly to consumers, many for the first time. Some have lowered or dropped their minimum order requirements, or their delivery fees. Restaurant-supply companies that once sold fresh vegetables to chefs by the case now offer them in packages of 16, eight or four ounces. Items the local Stop & Shop rarely stocks -- wild morels, trays of sea urchin roe, pink hunks of sushi-grade tuna -- have become stars of Ms. Kramer's quarantine kitchen. \"It's not as much that I'm getting stuff I could absolutely never get before, but that I'm cooking with it all the time,\" she said. \"It's becoming the new normal because I now run a restaurant for two.\" While the pandemic has changed myriad aspects of American life in ways we are still starting to see (will anyone ever go back to a desk job?), none may be as pervasive as the new ways we shop and eat. As grocery shopping became a minor tactical operation, home cooks began to think like the chef of a small restaurant that is booked every night. To stock refrigerators and cabinets with supplies for menus planned a week or more in advance, they have turned to many of the same businesses that restaurants used -- from major regional wholesalers to family farms raising asparagus and a herd of goats. Many of these suppliers slapped together their retail operations overnight in March in a desperate attempt to survive the month. Now, as summer nears, these new trade routes may be here to stay. In San Francisco and Washington, D.C., fishmongers who once supplied only restaurants now send their trucks into residential neighborhoods. Midwestern farms that used to take chefs' orders by phone sell their vegetables and cheeses in consumer-friendly quantities through online stores. Restaurants in every major city now offer not just delivery and takeout -- minor lifelines for the industry -- but also boxes of the ingredients used in their kitchens, sometimes with recipes or assembly instructions included. Chefs are boxing up their hummus and selling partly-assembled meals to be finished at home -- all the supplies for beef barbacoa tacos; a clay pot of biryani sealed under a lid of dough that needs half an hour in the oven; cookies with decorating kits; meats that had been aged for expense account spenders, now for you. \"We have been talking for weeks now about how the entire business is going to change forever,\" said Marc Hennessy, the executive chef of Rare , a small steakhouse chain in Washington and Wisconsin that is now selling premium dry-aged cuts of meat butchered to order for home cooks. Retail is now about 30 percent of his business, he said, and \"we plan to keep that going.\" What this all means for home cooks is access to better ingredients, sometimes at better prices, and the demystifying of restaurant dishes in ways that have made replicating them at home all the more easy. \"One thing that customers have taken away from this pandemic is that they can actually fend for themselves at home,\" said Anthony Strong, the owner of the year-old Prairie , a mesquite-grill restaurant in the Mission District of San Francisco that is now a grocery store, which it likely will remain during the daytime. \"I think that should be encouraged.\" Large food distributors are still cautiously sizing up home cooks. Others have embraced them. In normal times, restaurant suppliers are essentially nutritional credit unions, giving clients ingredients in exchange for a promise to pay in 30 days or 60 days, if they didn't go out of business first. Retail customers, though, have a peculiar habit of paying up front. This has proved to be a boon for some companies. \"The cash flow model is incredible,\" said Adrian Hoffman, an owner of Four Star Seafood , in San Francisco, which over a single weekend in March rerouted its fleet of 13 fish trucks from high-end Bay Area restaurants to the home addresses of individual customers. Why not keep supplying them with special soy sauces from Japan, unusual oils and, on special request, eggs, Mr. Hoffman thought, for at least a portion of his trade? \"We certainly don't want to let this go when this is all done,\" he said. \"Selling directly to consumers is almost a better business in that it spits out enough cash to pay off everything we owed.\" Baldor Specialty Foods , a Bronx wholesaler specializing in produce and meat, started with a $250 minimum for home deliveries in March, but quickly dropped it to $200. The company also expanded its delivery zones, which radiate out of Washington, New York and Boston to beach towns stretching from Maryland to coastal New Hampshire. \"To home customers our message is, \u2018We'll travel with you this summer wherever you go,'\" said T.J. Murphy, the chief executive. \"Restaurants were always slow in the summer as it was.\" Home shoppers can now place orders with Baldor for rare and unusual ingredients like finger limes, foraged mushrooms and green almonds. They've also learned to treat the company as a virtual big-box store for bulk items as well as everyday staples like bananas. Retail customers are likely to stay in the mix as restaurants start to come back. \"Just like demand led us here, we think demand is going to lead us to the next chapter,\" Mr. Murphy said. For consumers, the Great Pivot of 2020 has brought access to items like prized oysters that until recently were found only at raw bars. Now they are sold by wholesalers or by the oyster farmers themselves, at prices that can be less than half of the $3 or $4 that restaurants typically charge. Many of these newly popular retailers draw on connections that supermarkets don't have. For Anna Thomas Bates and Anna Landmark, who produce sheep milk cheese at Landmark Creamery in Paoli, Wis., driving their award-winning products to the customer's front door has been \"a huge adventure,\" as Ms. Bates put it. They have been able to help some of their neighbors stay afloat by delivering fresh eggs, organic Desiree potatoes, locally milled spelt and rye flour, grass-fed beef and other products from other farms. This week, they will start taking orders for an assortment of cheeses, including some from other female cheesemakers around the country. These Victory Boxes, which can be shipped nationally, are part of a larger effort to help small cheesemakers and dairy farmers. Many farmers saw their customer base grow rapidly when they started making home deliveries. Nat and Alison Bjerke-Harvey usually sell about half the microgreens and garden vegetables they grow in Manhattan, Kan., to restaurants, and the other half at a farmers' market in town. Both were shut down in March, so the couple began loading their Piccalilli Farm sunflower and pea shoots into the back of their minivan, along with French breakfast radishes, beets and green onions. They quickly reached 200 deliveries a week. On Tuesday mornings, when their online store starts taking new orders, they sometimes sit and watch as items sell out within minutes. \"For a small specialty market in our part of the country, we don't usually have the problem of not being able to meet the demand,\" Ms. Bjerke-Harvey said. Restaurants have often had access to ingredients that their customers didn't know about or couldn't get their hands on. Getting a farmer or cheesemaker or winery to grant an exclusive on some obscure, delicious item used to be a considered a victory for chefs. The pandemic has put those relationships in a different perspective. \"There is this group of farms that relied on us, some of them 100 percent,\" Dan Barber, the chef of Blue Hill , in Manhattan, and Blue Hill at Stone Barns , in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., said. \"It feels like the ultimate expression of support. Then in a moment like this you realize you've created the weakest food chain imaginable.\" To keep cash circulating to the farmers, foragers and fishing crews that depend on Blue Hill, Mr. Barber began selling boxes of fish, meat or seasonal vegetables for curbside pickup. Customers get a grab bag of ingredients both well-known (greenhouse cucumbers) and less familiar (Purple Sword celtuce stalks ). Tucked into the boxes are recipes and background on the crops, including the information that the telltale holes in \"beetle-bitten brassicas\" were left by flea beetles, who have a knack for finding the sweetest plants in the field. As supply-chain disruptions have caused shortages in commodity beef and pork, meat from old livestock breeds raised on pastures has taken its place in some areas where a few small, regional slaughterhouses still remain. Grass & Bone , a butcher shop and restaurant in Mystic, Conn., has been flooded with orders for everything from grass-fed ground beef to lamb hearts and trotters. To supplement these cuts, James Wayman, the chef and an owner, also makes items like garlic-rosemary pork liver mousse, pasta sauces, and kits for tacos and burger For some restaurants, these kits straddle a line between raw ingredients and takeout, giving them something to sell that grocery stores can't. Shouk, a fast-casual Israeli restaurant in Washington, is now selling its hummus, which customers have been clamoring for, as well as falafel kits to \"help you get to the last mile at dinner,\" said Ran Nussbacher, a founder. (At least until this week, when protesters broke a window in the shop.) \"Raw falafel mix is really, really hard to do at home,\" he said. \"We use an industrial strength meat grinder, and a food processor at home won't get the same texture.\" These are all things he assumes customers will crave whenever Shouk's regular business returns to full strength. \"Anything we implement today is only something we think will work in the long term, not just to survive right now,\" Mr. Nussbacher said. Until the virus is brought under control, many restaurants will have to configure their dining rooms in new ways. In March, Good Dog Houston converted its two locations to convenience stores modeled loosely on New York City's bodegas, selling dried pasta and beans, canned tomatoes, paper towels and its own line of hot-dog kits. Last month, when the restaurants were allowed to reopen with strict limitations on indoor seating, they displayed grocery items on tables that they would otherwise have had to remove or leave empty. With the spoils, though, come the troubles. Home cooks, just like chefs, are learning about botched deliveries and products that don't live up to their billing. Ordering from wholesalers can also mean ending up with five liters of balsamic vinegar or carrots the size of a small child. But for Mr. Strong and other restaurateurs, the ability to offer provisions, cooking advice and food delivery is likely going to remain good business. \"We have a dining public that is more fickle than ever,\" he said. \"They bounce around from place to place, post their Yelp review, take a picture of their food and move on. We need real ways to provide for our community and have ways to be more sustainable. And any way we can rethink that, I think, is important.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

Just because you can eat out again, though, does not mean that you should. And if you decide to go back before the virus is under control, it will not necessarily be clear which dining rooms are safest. Restaurants will have to navigate a situation that is new to them and to the rest of the world. New guidance for restaurant operators from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention favors broad principles (\"Intensify cleaning, sanitization, disinfection and ventilation\") over specific standards. \"There really is no scientific study\" on the best ways for restaurants to reopen following a Covid-19 outbreak , said Dr. Robert W. Amler, dean of the School of Health Sciences and Practice at New York Medical College. Nevertheless, doctors and public health experts have some suggestions for handling the risks of dining out while the virus is still a threat. Dining rooms are open again in several states that have not met the criteria for progress against the virus suggested by the White House for a phased reopening. The states' reopening is a public-policy decision, but going out to eat is a personal one. At the very least, you should check the latest data on coronavirus cases in your city or county before making up your mind. \"I would certainly want to have some awareness of how much transmission seems to be going on in my community,\" said Craig W. Hedberg, a professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Minnesota. \"So if you know that there are new cases continuing to be occurring every day in your community, you have to assume there's going to be a risk for transmission in public settings.\" Anyone who has symptoms of Covid-19 or who has recently come into contact with someone who has had the virus should stay home, Dr. Hedberg said. As people leave home more often, gathering in groups will start to seem normal. But it will increase the risk of the virus spreading. Anyone who falls into one of the high-risk categories identified by the C.D.C. should be especially cautious about going out to restaurants. In particular, older people, which the agency defines as those age 65 and above, \"really do have to be extra careful, and their family members have to be extra careful,\" Dr. Amler said. Just as you'd interview a babysitter you were thinking about hiring, you can quiz a restaurant's staff in advance about its safety practices, or look for a summary on its website or social media accounts. Benjamin Chapman, a professor and food safety specialist at North Carolina State University, who has collaborated on a training program to help restaurants in his state manage their response to the coronavirus, said that among the things he would hope to hear are: \"We're taking this seriously. We've trained our staff on how to wear masks, on the importance of hand washing and hand sanitizing. We've changed what we're doing to ensure that we're practicing social and physical distancing to keep you safe.\" A fast glance can tell you a lot about how thoroughly the management has responded to the pandemic. \"A restaurant that looks exactly like it did before is probably not the kind of restaurant I want to go to,\" Dr. Chapman said. Are the tables far apart? Will the chairs permit at least six feet of space between customers? Is the restaurant allowing staff or customers to gather in clusters? \"The biggest red flag would just be crowding,\" Dr. Hedberg said. \"If people are crowded near the entrance or around the bar, or there's a lot of interaction going on between staff and customers in close proximity, then obviously they're not operating in a mode that's designed to prevent transmission of the virus.\" The virus spreads readily indoors, as shown by a study of a woman who appears to have transmitted it to nine other people who were eating in the same room of a restaurant in China. Recent evidence suggests that the risk of infection may be lower outdoors. Alfresco dining has other advantages. Dr. Chapman pointed out that there may be more space outside to spread out, and that all-weather furniture may be easier to rearrange than a fixed booth in a dining room. The C.D.C. recommends wearing masks or cloth face coverings when out in public, to keep people who don't know they're sick from spreading the virus by respiratory droplets. This applies to restaurant workers. \"What that shows is that the business is really trying to take the idea of asymptomatic carriers of the virus seriously,\" Dr. Chapman said. Eating a meal with a mask on is a challenge. Diners should arrive with face coverings, remove them temporarily to eat or drink, and put them on again before talking. A new study shows that in an unventilated room, droplets produced by normal conversation could linger in the air for as long as 14 minutes. In many places, the law already requires people who prepare food to wear gloves. That hasn't changed. For hosts and servers in the dining room, however, gloves are not necessary, and some experts believe they're a bad idea. \"The real problem is, over a period of time, if you're using these gloves, you're going to get a false sense of security,\" Dr. Amler said. \"It's better to be concerned about your hands' getting contaminated, and to be washing more frequently.\" Although surface contact is not believed to be the primary way the virus spreads, experts still recommend being careful about surfaces that other people may have touched: tabletops, silverware and so forth. Looking at a chalkboard menu might be safer than picking up a laminated one. If you do touch common surfaces, wash or sanitize your hands and don't touch your face. Thoughtful restaurateurs will provide sanitizer throughout the establishment, but it's a good idea to bring your own. If you need to wash your hands in the restroom, Dr. Hedberg suggested that its condition may give you an insight into the restaurant's overall commitment to a sanitary environment. Picking up a French fry or a burger with your bare hands is permissible, once you've taken care of personal hygiene. But you were probably doing that before the pandemic, too. \"You should always be washing your hands before you eat,\" Dr. Hedberg said. Although we often go to restaurants so we can slow down, unwind and forget our worries, the pandemic makes a more businesslike approach advisable. \"The longer you stay in an area where there's this potential for transmission, the greater the likelihood that something could happen,\" Dr. Hedberg said. In other words: If ever there was a time to eat and run, this is it. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

Before Olio, a Mediterranean-influenced spot fashioned from a boarded-up old gas station, opened in 2012, its St. Louis neighborhood was known mostly as a place to buy illegal drugs. Nearly three-quarters of the lots on some streets were abandoned or demolished, said Brent Crittenden, the chief executive of UIC, the design and redevelopment firm that built Olio and several other restaurants in the neighborhood. By his count, one block was down to fewer than 10 residents. Today, most of the houses are either occupied or under construction. Earlier this year, you could stand in Olio's parking lot and see a French pastry shop, a bakery known for its sourdough, a Mexican restaurant where the tuna tostadas are seasoned with white soy sauce and a new omakase restaurant that has already won national attention. With its streamlined red-striped exterior, Olio was the single beacon that drew people and businesses to Botanical Heights. The businesses remain, but their doors are locked or their hours are slashed. As St. Louis begins cautious discussions about reopening, no one is sure how many of these food businesses will survive the coronavirus pandemic , and what will happen to Botanical Heights if they do not. The nation's cities are peppered with neighborhoods just like it -- areas animated in recent years by a huge restaurant boom. In any one of them, the failure of even a few key independent restaurants could spell devastation for their local economies. While the federal government has created a program to help small businesses, including restaurants, many were largely unable to gain access to the first tranche of $349 billion before the money was depleted. They will also struggle to take advantage of the current $310 billion round because the terms of the program, which require that 75 percent of funds go toward payroll in order to have the loan forgiven, do not seem to take long-term closures into account. \"Restaurants are extremely valuable to cities,\" said Andrew Salkin, a founding principal of Resilient Cities Catalyst, a nonprofit focused on strengthening cities, and a former official in New York City's Finance Department. \"The benefit of having good restaurants outweighs just their tax benefits. They are the anchors of communities. They support tourism and the neighborhood they are in.\" The danger facing restaurants, which thrive on crowded rooms and get by on razor-thin margins, poses a special threat to small cities and large towns where a robust food culture plays an outsize role in the economy. In places that had been hollowed out by poverty and suburban flight, like parts of Indianapolis, Cleveland and Detroit, they are engines of growth. In other cities with a national reputation for good food that is out of proportion to their population, like Providence, R.I., or Asheville, N.C., dining is both a tourist attraction and a key part of their identity. Already, restaurant closures have damaged urban economies in ways that are still being calculated. Of the 701,000 nonfarm jobs lost in the United States in March, nearly 60 percent came from food services and drinking places, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Restaurants \"are major employers of 9.7 million people across the country and are a critical source of revenues for local budgets,\" said Amy Liu, the director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. For example, the restaurant industry is Washington's second-largest private-sector employer, and in 2019 restaurants and bars accounted for $1.3 billion of the city's sales taxes, up 36 percent from 2014. A shift in recent years away from suburban living to urbanization began in many ways with a national restaurant boom that many cities now count on to drive both residential and commercial growth. \"When an area revives, a leading indicator is always a great restaurant scene,\" said Amer Hammour, the executive chairman of Madison Marquette, a large commercial real estate developer. In Washington, the largest development in the city's history emerged in 2017 at the waterfront, anchored by 20 restaurants and some of the city's best-known chefs, like Kwame Onwuachi and Fabio Trabocchi. A newly energetic dining scene -- fueled by chefs whose names are known around the country now -- has lifted Washington's cultural profile and its balance sheet. \"The food industry has helped us change the perception of D.C. as a sleepy government town,\" said John Falcicchio, the city's deputy mayor for planning and economic development. \"We have heard estimates that as much as 50 percent of the restaurants that have closed may not reopen,\" Mr. Falcicchio said. \"That is really troubling when we think of our economy, the job market and the district's bottom line.\" Restaurants like Rose's Luxury, which was a main driver of putting Washington on the food map, have tried their hand at takeout, and distilleries like Republic Restoratives have moved to making hand sanitizer (free with a bottle of delivered bourbon). But this amounts to little more \"than life support, which is better than death but no more,\" said Aaron Silverman, the owner of Rose's Luxury. For many cities, restaurants have been crucial to their economic revival. A burgeoning new restaurant scene has lifted Detroit, where jobs in the restaurant industry grew 18 percent between 2009 and 2019, the latest year available from the Labor Department. \"This helped Detroit in the macroeconomic sense in getting foot traffic where there hadn't been any,\" said Carol O'Cleireacain, an adjunct professor of public affairs at Columbia University and the former deputy mayor for economic policy in Detroit. \"It got more young people to think this was a hip place,\" and to choose living in the long-struggling city over its more prosperous suburbs. The same dynamic helped persuade people to settle in Botanical Heights and other St. Louis neighborhoods. \"It'd be pretty devastating for all of us to lose so much momentum in the area,\" Mr. Crittenden said. When a city's restaurant scene starts to get national attention, it begets tourism. \"When we pitch Providence, whether for leisure tourism or meetings and conventions, we look at things that make us special,\" said Kristen Adamo, the president and chief executive of the Providence Warwick Convention and Visitors Bureau. \"And a lot of that is you get meals you wouldn't ordinarily get in a city of about 175,000.\" With pioneering farm-to-table restaurants such as Al Forno, which turns 40 this year, Providence had a head start on many restaurant towns. But people there say it came into its own as a tourist destination only in the past decade or so, with the arrival of places like Birch, Oberlin, North and Big King. The chef James Mark recalled that when he opened his first restaurant, North, in 2012, Providence used to empty out in the summer. \"Over the last five years that's changed a lot,\" he said. \"People started vacationing, staying in Providence and taking a day trip out to the beach instead of staying at the beach and taking a day trip to Providence. The draw of the restaurants was so high that they'd stay in Providence to eat.\" Leisure travelers kept the occupancy rates of Providence's hotels at or above 90 percent on weekends from May to November 2019, Ms. Adamo said. As valuable as independent restaurants are to their cities, though, owners say that most of the federal relief passed so far does not take their needs into account. The government has shown little interest in compelling or helping insurers to pay claims for business interruption caused by the pandemic, something restaurant owners desperately want. Restaurant owners say the Paycheck Protection Program, which provides forgivable loans to small businesses that keep paying workers, is not useful for eateries that may need to remain shuttered or half full for months after other kinds of businesses are fully operational. \"Getting forgiveness is going to be impossible,\" said Nina Compton, the owner of Comp\u00e8re Lapin in New Orleans. \"How do I make money if I have to bring back all my staff doing less volume and less sales?\" Beyond simply providing tax revenue and jobs, small independent restaurants are often tightly interwoven with the daily life of their communities, sponsoring local sports teams and helping power other small businesses, like local farms. \"The people that own independent businesses live where their business is,\" said Jane Anderson, the executive director of Asheville's Independent Restaurant Association, a trade group representing 150 restaurants in Asheville and surrounding Buncombe County. \"With our restaurant organization alone, on an annual basis we're giving about $1.5 million back to nonprofits -- everything from Little League baseball to the local science museum to the Humane Society,\" she said. At least nine Asheville restaurants serve their food on plates made by East Fork, a local potter that employs 78 people. Dessert menus feature flavors custom-blended by another Asheville firm, Ultimate Ice Cream. Mr. Mark said that about 90 percent of his ingredients at Big King come from Rhode Island farmers and fishers. He knows almost all of them. At North, the percentage is closer to 80, not counting the New England wines that make up somewhat less than half the list. Hand-selecting producers the way he does, Mr. Mark said, is a more costly way to do business and works only when there are enough customers who think the results are worth paying for. This is one reason he worries about the next few months. \"Our city doesn't have that same population of rich people that can afford to support expensive restaurants,\" he said. \"That's why this whole thing is so scary for smaller cities.\" ", "rec_dishes": 0}, {"id": 11, "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/dining/seafood-fish-coronavirus.html", "review_text": " In 1963, on their way home from the hospital after he was born, Louis Rozzo's parents stopped by a building on Ninth Avenue in Chelsea, where the family ran a wholesale seafood business, to weigh him in a scallop scale. This March, when virtually every restaurant, club and hotel that bought seafood from him closed and his firm's income dried up in a matter of days, Mr. Rozzo went back to where it all began. The F. Rozzo & Sons building was still in the family. Mr. Rozzo converted the ground floor into a makeshift store where he sells clams, scallops, sea bass and American red snapper to people who are suddenly cooking at home a lot more than they used to. \"I'm seeing people taking home fish, then coming in the next day and showing me pictures of how they prepared it,\" he said. Some of them undertake recipes that require the better part of a day. Mr. Rozzo enjoys their enthusiastic feedback, although he also suggested that some of the energy New Yorkers are devoting to their kitchen projects is, like his overnight fish store itself, born of desperation. \"There's not much else to do,\" he said. \"It's either that or go home and drink all day.\" A future historian combing through the social-media records would have to conclude that Americans in the pandemic period subsisted on a diet of banana bread , whipped coffee and obsessively decorated sheets of focaccia . The only evidence that people ate seafood might be a few stray images of the more photogenic Portuguese sardine cans, all dating to the early days of the crisis, when you could still find them on store shelves. But people are cooking seafood as never before, whether they're documenting it or not. At supermarkets and other stores, seafood purchases have set records. Year-over-year sales of both canned and frozen seafood were around 37 percent higher for the four weeks that ended April 19, according to data from IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm. Some large supermarket chains closed their seafood counters for a while so their regular workers could help stock shelves that were emptying nearly as quickly as new cans and boxes could be unpacked. Still, fresh seafood sales were up by about 13 percent in the same four weeks. Workers in the United States fishery, a $5.6 billion industry in 2018, have not seen the mass outbreaks of Covid-19 that have swept through some meatpacking plants. But the routines of seafood trade have been knocked sideways by the pandemic. [ Sign up here to get the At Home newsletter with our best suggestions for how to live a full and cultured life during the pandemic, delivered to your inbox.] Restaurants and other food-service establishments normally account for about two-thirds of the sales of fresh seafood in the country. When nearly all restaurants closed except for takeout or delivery, the entire seafood distribution network seized up. Along the Atlantic coast, some boats were dumping fish they couldn't sell. The weather didn't help the fishing crews make up for lost income. \"We've had an awful, just a terrible spring,\" said Ernie Panacek, the general manager of the commercial fishing dock at Viking Village , on Long Beach Island in New Jersey. \"It's been very stormy and windy. That has helped contribute to a reduction in seafood production.\" The bright spot in Mr. Panacek's business has been retail. Sales are considerably higher than usual at the seafood stores his wholesalers supply. \"People are still hungry for their seafood,\" he said. \"They can't go out and get it at the restaurants, and they've got to eat.\" Like others in the seafood business, he has heard all the excuses consumers make for not eating fish at home -- they don't like the smell, they don't know how to cook it, they're afraid it will go off. But he hopes the quarantine may bring some of them around. \"I really think it's going to change, eventually, the way people buy seafood,\" he said. \"They're going to realize it's easy to cook, it's quick to cook. As long as you have good-quality seafood, they can handle it.\" This has been the experience of Robert DeMasco, who reinvented his Brooklyn restaurant supply company, Pierless Fish , to make home deliveries to housebound civilians last month. Mr. DeMasco said that after a somewhat rocky transition, business had been brisk. His new customers, he said, are even buying things that many restaurants won't, like fish collars. \"I probably sold 30 pounds a day of collars,\" he said. \"I bought shad roe. I ran out in a day, and I had 60 pounds. I was like, really? You guys know what this is?\" In addition to the dried anatomical scraps it markets as pet treats, Pierless has also been offering Spanish mackerel, skate, silver dory and blue catfish. All have sold out. Cooks stuck in lockdown have also been eager for shelf-stable products like smoked salmon, finnan haddie, salt cod and even one product that none of Mr. DeMasco's restaurant clients will touch: frozen fish. He said he had received a rave review for his two-pound boxes of frozen squid from Jean-Georges Vongerichten , a longtime customer who, when his restaurants are open, rarely orders so little of anything. In the old family headquarters on Ninth Avenue, Mr. Rozzo has also been surprised by how willing people are to take a flier on some strange aquatic specimen. \"People want a challenge to create dinners with,\" he said. \"They can't go to a restaurant, so they're creating the excitement at home.\" In one day, the improvised Rozzo shop sold 100 pounds of drumfish from the Gulf of Mexico, which doesn't often swim as far north as Chelsea. All the octopus Mr. Rozzo draped over ice as a conversation piece? Sold. He has fielded requests for items as prized as bluefin tuna belly (he sold it for $25 a pound) and as ordinary as whiting ($1.50). Mr. Rozzo noted that the wholesale side of his business is down by 95 percent after a record year in 2019. Getting back to that level, he estimated, will take two or three years at least. Part of his rebuilding plan is retail sales. It would give the company extra stability and, as much as he prides himself on the friendships he has made with chefs, he has found that he enjoys talking to amateur cooks about seafood, too. \"The volume is a pittance of what it was, and the money follows along with that,\" he said. \"But you can't always do everything for money.\" Recipes: Grilled Octopus | Mackerel With Olives, Almonds and Mint | Fettuccine With Asparagus and Smoked Salmon | Salt Cod, Potato and Chickpea Stew Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

In 2012, when Hurricane Sandy drove the evening high tide onshore, Mr. Poliafito was an owner of a small bakery called Baked, in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Bay water ran through the neighborhood's low-lying streets and into the basement of Baked, where it destroyed all the inventory and equipment. Over the next few weeks, Mr. Poliafito and the owners of other small businesses huddled inside the bakery studying sources of federal and local aid. To apply, he needed documents that had been ruined by the flood. But Baked eventually got a loan for about $40,000 from the Small Business Administration. Today, Mr. Poliafito owns a slightly larger Brooklyn bakery and cafe called Ciao, Gloria . Once again, he and other business owners are trading notes on grants and loans that might help them survive a disaster they didn't see coming. But this time, he and his friends talk about their frustrations with an emergency S.B.A. program that ran through its entire $350 billion fund before any of them got a piece of it. Now in the second month of compulsory closings, many owners of independent restaurants and bars across the country are starting to despair of getting the help they need to come back. They are confused, they are angry and they all know a dozen other small business owners just like them. The relief bills that have passed Congress don't seem to be working for them, they are doubtful that a fresh injection of aid will solve their problems and other measures they favor seem to be going nowhere. Mr. Poliafito had hoped that a loan from the S.B.A. fund, the Paycheck Protection Program , would allow him to reopen Ciao, Gloria by May 10, Mother's Day. He applied for about $75,000 and was approved, he said, but was told that the fund had already run dry. \"It just seemed -- corrupt is the word to use,\" he said. The loans, he believes, went to \"people who knew people, and things got pushed around.\" Shake Shack , for instance, a burger chain whose stock is currently valued at $1.6 billion , was given one of the loans, which have a low interest rate and can be forgiven if a business brings back enough employees to get its payroll to three-quarters of what it was before the pandemic. After a public outcry, Shake Shack announced Sunday that it had found another source of money and would return its $10 million loan . It wasn't the only publicly traded restaurant chain to get one, though. Ruth's Chris Steak House received two, for a total of $20 million. It turned out that more than one out of every four dollars in the fund went toward big loans of $2 million and above, thanks in part to lobbying from the National Restaurant Association . Nominally, that organization represents the whole industry. Many independent operators, though, feel that its victories tend to favor wealthier members rather than the unaffiliated places that make up the majority of the roughly 660,000 restaurants in the country. Businesses bigger than Ciao, Gloria are struggling, too, Mr. Poliafito acknowledged. But funding for them \"shouldn't have been coming from the same pot,\" he said. Both Republicans and Democrats have complained about how much first-round funding was directed to large, publicly traded companies. On Tuesday, Congress and the White House reached a deal to pour another $310 billion into the Paycheck Protection fund, with $60 billion to be distributed by lenders that typically serve smaller businesses. Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said $125 billion of the money would go \"exclusively to the unbanked, to the minorities, to the rural areas and to all of those little mom-and-pop stores that don't have a good banking connection and need the help.\" Even so, Mr. Poliafito said, \"I'm in panic mode because what if this second round does come through, and what if I'm still way behind all these Shake Shack-size borrowers who maybe need another $10 million?\" Nate Adler, who opened Gertie , a luncheonette in Brooklyn, almost exactly one year before the pandemic forced him to close his dining room, applied for a Paycheck Protection loan through his bank, JPMorgan Chase. On April 8, he got an email from the bank notifying him that the portal was open, he said. Immediately he filled in all the blanks and submitted the form. Mr. Adler says he spent much of the next week leaving messages for Chase employees that were not returned. Last Friday, a banker told him that the money had run out, and Mr. Adler hadn't made the cut. Later, he talked to other owners who had access to the site earlier, and who had their applications approved. He is about to turn Gertie into a delivery-only soup kitchen that will send packaged meals to health care workers and people who have lost their jobs or homes. He had been hoping to pay its employees with a Paycheck Protection loan, but now he is soliciting private donations. What strikes him most about the federal program, he said, is \"the complete inequity in the way the loans were given out.\" \"There was preferential treatment all over the board,\" he said. \"The process was confusing to begin with, and seemingly people with banking connections, or those using a smaller bank that has personal contact with people at the S.B.A., had a much greater chance of getting the loans.\" In several class-action lawsuits filed this week in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, JPMorgan Chase was one of four banks accused of giving preference to companies that applied for larger loans under the Paycheck Protection Program. Chase has denied the accusation in a page on its website answering frequently asked questions about the program. Given the populist anger faced by Shake Shake and Ruth's Chris, it is not surprising that restaurateurs who did get a loan tend not to broadcast it, even when the amounts are well under $10 million. Once the money flows into their bank accounts, though, they face their own set of problems. Martha Hoover, who owns Cafe Patachou and several other restaurants in Indianapolis, said her company has already received the Paycheck Protection loan it requested. She would not disclose the amount, but said that the terms may compel her to hire more workers than she will be able to keep paying after the money is spent. \"I'm very fearful that the level of funding and the restrictions attached to the funding will not do anything to create a sustainable reopening,\" she said. \"If we reopen in June, we will not be back to numbers that even resemble close to what we need to operate our businesses. And then what happens?\" A Paycheck Protection loan can be forgiven; it becomes a tax-free grant, essentially. One condition, though, is that the money has to be spent within eight weeks. This may work for some businesses that are able to function at something close to normal capacity for the next two months. Most restaurants, though, won't be able to do that for some time. Even when they can reopen, they will almost certainly have to follow social-distancing protocols and other rules that have not been drawn up yet. Some notions that Gov. Gavin Newsom has floated for California, like a mandate that restaurants seat no more than 50 percent of their capacity, were not encouraging to Ms. Hoover. \"Talk about a vibe killer, right?\" she said. \"I get it. Public safety is pre-eminent. I understand that.\" Still, she and other owners agree that trying to pay a full staff out of the revenues from a half-empty restaurant is a quick route to more layoffs. \"The whole business model, the whole point of a restaurant, is to get as many people as possible into the space on a given night,\" said Edouardo Jordan, who owns JuneBaby and other restaurants in Seattle. This week, Ms. Hoover sued Hanover Insurance Group in Indiana State Court over its refusal to reimburse her for losses from Covid-related business interruption, a nearly universal problem in the restaurant industry. The chef Thomas Keller filed a similar lawsuit last month against his own insurer. Together with Mr. Jordan, Dominique Crenn and other chefs, Mr. Keller has formed the Business Interruption Group , an advocacy organization demanding that insurance companies pay those claims. \"That is the faucet that needs to be turned on,\" said Mr. Adler of Gertie. \"Because it affects every single business without dealing with accessibility or preferential treatment or your business acumen.\" One possible solution is for the federal government to subsidize the insurance companies, but the idea has not taken root in Congress. As lobbyists pitch fierce campaigns for federal aid to flow to their industries, the owners of small restaurants say they feel nearly powerless. \"Independent restaurants have never had a great voice in Washington,\" said Andy Ricker, the chef and founder of several Thai restaurants in Portland, Ore. \"The people who have a voice in Washington have the money to pay for it. I don't have a spare $1,000 a month to pay for this stuff.\" Ms. Hoover praised the James Beard Foundation and the Independent Restaurant Coalition , which was formed in March, for their efforts on behalf of restaurateurs. Still, she said, neither they nor any other group has been able to secure the help she and other small business owners say they need. \"I think there are a lot of good innovative ideas coming out of this, but nothing that we've been able to execute on,\" Ms. Hoover said. \"I'm living in real time here and I need to move forward.\" Mr. Jordan said he had a modicum of access in Washington, through his relationship with Mr. Keller, a former employer, who was invited by President Trump to sit on the Great American Economic Revival Industry Group. But Mr. Jordan also said the group, chosen by the president, \"is not a great representation of what America's hospitality industry is.\" It includes several other white male chefs of Mr. Keller's generation, as well as the leaders of some large restaurant corporations. \"There has to be a say from the 11 million workers, the hundreds of thousands of small businesses that make up the hospitality industry,\" he said. \"Not just the major conglomerates.\" For small restaurants that were already a few slow nights away from bankruptcy, hopes of coming back grow more remote with every day they wait for help to arrive. Mr. Poliafito remembers hopeless days after Hurricane Sandy, too. When government aid finally came through, though, it helped Baked and other businesses rebuild and return stronger than before. \"In a weird way, Red Hook flourished after Sandy,\" he said. \"I thought it was going to be the end of Red Hook, and it was the exact opposite.\" As he recalled how he had not only survived that earlier disaster but triumphed, Mr. Poliafito grew more animated. Then he returned to his current troubles, and the hope drained from his voice. \"We should be so lucky to have something like that happen now,\" he said.

With some fresh paint, a new awning and a load of supplies, the schooner would be ready to cruise to Pier 25 in Hudson River Park, where every year since 2014 it has operated as an outdoor oyster bar called Grand Banks . The first customers of 2020 were supposed to have boarded on April 15, but the Sherman Zwicker is still docked in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Next to it is an older schooner that also serves as an oyster bar in warm weather; called Pilot , it was scheduled to start up again in Brooklyn Bridge Park on May 1. Alexander Pincus and his brother Miles own and run both restaurants along with Island Oyster , a nonfloating oyster bar on Governors Island they had meant to reopen the same day as Pilot. Other projects were in the works for later in the season, too, including a restaurant on a retired fireboat. Those plans were laid before Americans began dying of a powerfully contagious new disease. Now, like millions of other people whose way of making a living is temporarily banned, Alexander Pincus isn't sure what the future holds. He is at home in Brooklyn, recovering from what he calls \"a very bad\" respiratory illness that he believes was Covid-19, and wondering how long his savings will last. \"I've got a 5-year-old,\" he said. \"My girlfriend was laid off. And I'm hoping our season starts soon so we can keep it all together.\" Like the Pincuses' oyster bars, thousands of seasonal food businesses around the country are still in winter storage while would-be customers remain holed up indoors. Some of these businesses are fixtures of the warm-weather landscape -- the ice cream stands, seafood shacks, beer gardens, open-air taquerias. Others follow a more recent entrepreneurial model, selling niche products out of banged-together stalls or eye-catchingly painted trucks at outdoor markets, festivals and concerts. All of them depend on freedoms that are usually taken for granted but that the pandemic has placed in short supply, like the freedom to travel, the freedom to go to the beach and the freedom to stand in the hot sun eating out of paper cartons in the company of dozens of other people eating out of paper cartons. Although many seasonal food businesses have a flyaway look, collectively they make a significant contribution to how people experience summer, and to the economy. After hitting a low point around February each year, the number of restaurant employees tends to peak in June and July, when dining areas spill out to patios and gardens, tourism surges and beach towns come alive. Each summer for the past seven years, restaurants in the United States have added more than half a million jobs, according to the National Restaurant Association . Nobody expects to see numbers like that in 2020. Chowder shacks that unlock their screen doors on Memorial Day weekend still have a chance to make their opening dates. But businesses that get off to an earlier start have already frozen new hiring. The Pincus brothers, who had plans to bring on 425 workers for their oyster bars over the next few months, have furloughed 13 of their 18 year-round employees. Big Mozz , a New York company that was expecting to serve about half a million pounds of pecorino- and parsley-flecked mozzarella sticks at seasonal events this year, had planned to hire 200 people. Big Mozz sells its fried cheese at Citi Field and other local stadiums, the summer-long Celebrate Brooklyn shows, a string of major music festivals around the country and catered events. But with baseball season postponed and one major music festival, the Governors Ball , already canceled, Big Mozz's core staff of 25 people was furloughed last month. Matt Gallira, who founded the company, said the money that people earn on short-term gigs at food stalls like his can be vital to them. \"When we travel to a music festival, we might hire 20 to 40 local staff just for the weekend, college kids home for the summer,\" he said. \"It's people who depend on the hours with us to pay for their next semester at school. They also get a lot of tips at these jobs. These aren't nothing jobs.\" Seasonal food businesses were generating temporary work decades before anyone used the term gig economy. A summer spent frying clams or scooping ice cream is a time-honored gateway to a hospitality career. The warmer months also bring a flowering of casual, low-stakes new ventures, from lemonade stands to more original ideas. Last April, for instance, a recent graduate of Rhode Island School of Design named Ruby Schechter introduced her business, the Better Pop , at the Smorgasburg outdoor food market in Williamsburg. She sold $6 ice pops made from whole fruit and kombucha frozen in a mold she designed herself that gives the pops a futuristic, modular shape. (It resembles a carton that the Jetsons might use for quail eggs.) The shape is meant to make it easier to bite off chunks of frozen fruit, but it also looks cool, and people walking around Smorgasburg with a Better Pop pop were always being asked what it was and where it came from. \"It was a huge success,\" Ms. Schechter said. By the end of the summer she was being hired to bring her pops to corporate events put on by Saks Fifth Avenue, Google, LinkedIn and other businesses. \"I made a lot of money in the first year, which for a lot of companies is very hard to do.\" This year was supposed to be even better -- \"really huge,\" Ms. Schechter said. There would be Better Pop stalls at the Governors Ball and other outdoor festivals that look increasingly unlikely now. A collaboration with a fast-casual restaurant chain has been put on hold, she said. The Better Pop had been scheduled to return to Smorgasburg last weekend, too, when its Brooklyn markets were supposed to reopen. They are on hiatus now, along with a year-round Los Angeles edition and a planned expansion of its World Trade Center market to two days a week from one. Many of Smorgasburg's nearly 200 vendors are hanging in limbo, according to Jonathan Butler, one of the market's founders. Most Smorgasburg stalls take in more than $2,000 a day, he said, while some go up to $5,000. Most hire from two to six people to help out. The total daily sales was $150,000 for each of the two Brooklyn markets and less for the Los Angeles and World Trade Center markets. While most vendors don't have the rent obligations that restaurant owners do, \"I suspect they're feeling a similar level of panic,\" he said. For many of the newer Smorgasburg vendors, \"the thing they're most qualified to do is go work in a restaurant. So it's pretty grim. They don't have a lot of prospects.\" Some seasonal vendors live all year on their summertime income. Others say the money is nice, but isn't their first priority. Like many of the people who sell food at the Queens Night Market , an outdoor bazaar of foods from around the world that has materialized every Saturday night from April to October for the past five years, Hendra Lie does not support himself with cooking. Serving the Indonesian food of his childhood from his stall, Warung Jancook, satisfied other needs. \"The Queens Night Market is my passion,\" he said. \"I like to cook. I like to present myself and the culture through food that I created.\" Still, the exposure and encouragement stirred his ambitions. Before the coronavirus descended on Elmhurst, Queens, where he lives, he had been planning an Indonesian restaurant. Now, he isn't sure. Over the past decade or so, outdoor markets like the Queens Night Market and Smorgasburg have become some of the most rewarding pathways to learning about cuisines and dishes. Beyond the money that changes hands, they have cultural benefits that can't be put in numbers. \"Our largest events are about experience, community and connection between people,\" said Matt Cohen, the founder and chief executive of Off the Grid , a San Francisco company best known for shepherding flocks of food trucks around the Bay Area, often in the company of musical acts and fire pits. \"That casual collision connecting people in unplanned ways is something we have found to be very powerful,\" he added. \"It's the same thing that makes farmers' markets very vibrant.\" This year, Off the Grid had lined up more than 300 vendors to sell momos, lumpia, quesabirria tacos, Sichuan salt-and-pepper fish wraps and many other items. The largest and oldest of the organization's 30 or so outdoor markets has been going on for 10 years at Fort Mason Center for Arts & Culture . This season it opened for one night, March 6. As for reopening, Mr. Cohen said, even if San Francisco's ban on large gatherings is lifted in early May, \"we're looking at midsummer at the earliest\" before Off the Grid's larger outdoor events will be back. Seasonal businesses tend to be streamlined. They are built to go dormant and then reawaken on cue. Employees are usually lined up and waiting for opening day. Budgets run low. Everything is timed for the money to start circulating again in April and May. The only thing circulating this year is anxiety. Nobody knows when people will be free to move around again, or how long it will take for them to feel safe outside. \"A lot of us vendors are thinking about are how many people are going to show up to these social events,\" Ms. Schechter, the fruit pop vendor, said. \"How many people are still going to be scared, and not want to put themselves in situations where there's a lot of people?\" Against this fear, seasonal vendors hold on to hope that when the crowds do come back, they'll be ready for action. \"People do seem really excited about the prospect of getting outside again,\" Alexander Pincus of the Grand Banks oyster bar said. \"That's the light at the end of our tunnel. It's what keeps us going every day.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

FieldTrip's chef and owner, JJ Johnson, had taken to Twitter on Wednesday to say he had just packed and sent 40 rice bowls, his restaurant's specialty, to the staff at Harlem Hospital Center. One of New York City's official coronavirus testing sites, the hospital has been flooded, like so many others in the area, by new and suspected cases. In his tweet, Mr. Johnson had promised, \"Each day will pick a hospital close by @fieldtripharlem to help out.\" A few minutes later, the fan in Maryland bought 170 more bowls; Mr. Johnson sent half to Harlem the next day and half to Mount Sinai Hospital on Friday. The order kept FieldTrip busy enough that Mr. Johnson called two of his employees back to join the three others he had brought in earlier in the week as takeout and delivery business began to pick up. Before New York restaurants were ordered to close their dining rooms on March 15, FieldTrip had employed 10 people. \"We're at five now,\" Mr. Johnson said, \"which is 50 percent of the way there.\" Five employees. Eighty-five bowls of rice a day. These are small numbers in a country where, as of Monday, hundreds if not thousands of hospitals were treating nearly 142,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to a count by The New York Times . What has happened at Fieldtrip, though, is playing out at restaurants and hospitals around the country. Delivery orders for health care workers have begun coming in, ranging in ambition from bags of sandwiches paid for by small pledges on GoFundMe pages to multicourse meals subsidized by the philanthropic arms of major companies. Chefs say they are grateful for these new delivery routes. So are hospital administrators, who say their employees have been too busy to run out for coffee or even to place delivery orders. Neither group foresaw this surge in food donations two weeks ago, when it was still possible to believe that closing restaurant dining rooms might be enough to keep new coronavirus patients from overwhelming hospitals. That was before doctors began learning how to keep two patients alive on a single ventilator, before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised health care workers who had run out of N95 masks that they might tie bandannas and scarves around their heads \"as a last resort,\" before nurses were cutting arm holes in plastic trash bags and wearing them instead of standard protective gear. Hearing about all of this inside the homes where they have been ordered to stay, people have come together to send food to health care workers. There are small, neighborhood campaigns, like the members of a Windsor Terrace block association whom Martha Partridge has encouraged to sign up to bring meals to Brooklyn Methodist Hospital at the start of the late shift, when many restaurants favored by Methodist employees are now closed because of the pandemic. A week-old group called Queens Feeds Hospitals is making $1,000 purchases from restaurants and sending the food to hospitals around the borough. On Monday, boxed lunches from Ornella Trattoria , in Astoria, fed workers at Mount Sinai Queens. Pies from an Astoria pizzeria called Sac's Place were planned for lunch on Tuesday at Elmhurst Hospital Center, a hot zone of coronavirus patients. Other projects span whole cities. An artist in New Orleans named Devin De Wulf is sending local hospitals an estimated $10,000 worth of food each day from more than 30 local restaurants, part of a campaign that he calls #feedthefrontline . At least one initiative is global. In New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, Oakland and Ventura County, Calif., the chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s has converted dormant restaurants, including several of his own, into commissaries for World Central Kitchen, his nonprofit disaster-relief group. As of this weekend, the commissaries had sent meals to workers at 10 medical centers, with more on the way, Mr. Andr\u00e9s said. A particularly well-funded version of the same idea has been running in Atlanta since Friday. The Atlanta Hawks basketball team and State Farm are paying two Westside restaurants, Miller Union and Forza Storico , to cook and pack complete dinners that can feed two people. The packages, 200 from each restaurant five days a week, are then parceled out to workers at the six hospitals in the Emory Healthcare network that are treating coronavirus patients. The idea, according to Dr. Bryce Gartland, the president of Emory Healthcare's hospital group and its co-chief of clinical operations, is that employees can bring the food home with them at the end of their shifts, when supermarkets may be closed. Under normal conditions, Forza Storico is a Roman-style beer bar. Its menus for Emory workers retain an Italian cast. \"Today we had pickled baby onions with mixed field greens and artichokes as a first course,\" Michael Patrick, the chef and owner, said Friday. \"Second course was an antipasto platter with housemade charcuterie. The third course today is a lasagna, classic lasagna, housemade, with veal-beef-pork Bolognese.\" Any worker who hadn't shown up for work expecting to be sent home with lasagna for two \"can stick that thing in the freezer,\" Mr. Patrick said. \"We're not doing any hoity-toity food. We're getting down to brass tacks here, stuff that people know that's familiar and comforting.\" Nonetheless, these brass-tacks dinners and those made by the chef Steven Satterfield's crew at Miller Union start with ingredients raised by some of the region's most highly regarded farmers. The purchases will restore some fraction of the income the restaurants lost when Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms closed Atlanta's dining rooms on March 19. When Miller Union drew up its proposal, Mr. Satterfield said he stipulated that \"we were going to put all our money into several farmers that were hurting just as much as we were.\" Few of the ingredients that Ben Goldberg, the founder of the New York Food Truck Association , has been rounding up since last week are seasonal or local. Instead he is soliciting donations from nutrition-minded food companies for individually packaged snacks such as Core organic oat bars and bags of Pipcorn popcorn. Twice a day starting Wednesday, if all goes according to plan, these and other snacks, along with gallons of hot and cold La Colombe coffee, will be given away to employees of NYU Langone Medical Center in Manhattan from a food truck parked across the street. Social distancing will be maintained by brightly colored tape on the pavement. \"Food trucks are taking very large hits,\" Mr. Goldberg said. Normally, the trucks in his association park on densely packed Manhattan blocks, selling Lebanese cuisine (a truck called Toum), Ethiopian and Eritrean food ( Makina Cafe ), certified Glatt kosher burgers (JJ's Holy Cow) and other things to office workers. Since those blocks emptied out, most food trucks have stayed in the garage. The rental and labor fees the association is paying them to go to NYU Langone, financed in part by donations to Frontline Food Trucks, will be the first money some of the trucks' owners have earned in at least two weeks. Although they won't be serving their usual menus, the trucks will be helping health care administrators solve a logistical problem. \"A lot of these hospitals get a ton of requests, but they're not set up to be donation locations,\" Mr. Goldberg said. \"We can take some of those donations and put them on the truck.\" The association worked out the details with Stacey Chait, a senior director at NYU Langone , who said she has been getting about 100 emails a day with offers of food. \"It's really, really wonderful to be going through this crisis but have such an outpouring of support and understanding,\" she said. Because it is cheap, familiar, portable and everywhere, pizza is probably the food most commonly sent during a crisis. It is not, however, ideally suited to this crisis, in which people have been urged to stay at least six feet away from one another. \"Putting a bunch of pizza in a common break room and asking a bunch of people to come in there is not supportive of what we're asking of them as far as social distancing,\" said Dr. Gartland, the Emory Healthcare executive. The logistics of pizza distancing have become a familiar topic to Scott Wiener, a pizza historian and the founder of a company with the self-explanatory name Scott's Pizza Tours . Since about a week ago, Mr. Wiener has helped arrange the delivery of more than 2,600 pizzas to 73 clinics, hospitals, shelters and other care centers affected by the outbreak. Donations, which by Sunday night had reached nearly $150,000, arrive through the website of his antihunger nonprofit group, Slice Out Hunger. A dozen or so volunteers there arrange for somebody at each care center to accept delivery of three to 50 plain cheese pies. Employees of Slice, an unrelated pizza-delivery app, then place the order with a local pizzeria, which must agree to follow specific anticoronavirus safety precautions. One of the project's aims is to support local businesses, and so independent pizzerias are preferred. \"But today I ordered from a Pizza Hut because it was the only option,\" Mr. Wiener said Sunday. He conceded that it is challenging to deliver hot food to facilities that are all but sealed off to the world. \"But it's pretty sad that it's easier for a hospital to get 50 pizzas than it is for them to get masks,\" he said. \"Sometimes the people we speak with on the phone open their hearts about what they're dealing with. They're so appreciative that people care enough to send them pizza.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

Mr. Marhefka catches vermilion snapper, triggerfish, banded runnerfish and several kinds of grouper on two-hook lines he drops into the Atlantic from the side of his 39-foot boat. He and his wife, Kerry, sell those fish directly to some of the most acclaimed restaurants in the Southeast -- Husk, Fig and the Ordinary in Charleston, for instance, and the Grey in Savannah, Ga. The fish are sold whole. This has held back their company's growth because few restaurants have a cook who knows how to clean and cut fish. The new plant, built with money the Marhefkas had put aside over the years, was going to change that. They hired eight people to carve fillets, clean whole fish that could go straight on the grill, pack seafood orders or to work in a small retail shop out front. Their first day was March 15. Two days later, Gov. Henry McMaster shut down all restaurants and bars in the state except for takeout and delivery. Orders from restaurants, normally 80 percent of the Marhefkas' sales, stopped almost entirely. \"There are some restaurants trying the takeaway thing, so they are buying a little,\" Ms. Marhefka said Friday. \"We had two orders go out to restaurants this morning. I would never think there would be a time when I would be excited about two orders.\" As dining rooms in 15 states and some individual counties and cities have gone dark, the first to feel the impact were restaurant employees and owners. In a letter to the president and congressional leaders asking for financial and tax relief, the National Restaurant Association said it expected five to seven million restaurant jobs would be lost because of the coronavirus pandemic. But the pain is also radiating out to the thousands of small companies across the country that, like Abundant Seafood, rely on restaurants for most or all of their sales. The size of this indirect economy is unknown, but independent restaurants can spend anywhere from just under 20 percent to more than 30 percent of their revenue on food, alcohol and other goods. Some businesses that serve restaurants have already laid off workers, driving a nationwide surge in new unemployment claims that labor experts predict will total between 1 million and 2.25 million for last week alone. Others are scrambling and improvising, trying to convert wholesale businesses into retail shops overnight. A few have closed for now, wondering how long it will be before it is safe again for people to eat and drink together. As local and federal governments debate measures to help the economy, they are watching to see when relief will come, what form it might take and whether any of it will reach them. Orwashers Bakery , one of the handful of independently owned bakeries in New York City that sells fresh bread to restaurants, has already laid off 20 of its 110 employees. Wholesale revenue, most of it from restaurants and the distributors that supply them, \"was the economic engine of the whole company,\" Keith Cohen, the owner, said. Since early March, he said, \"it has been in a progressive downward spiral.\" In any other week, Orwashers would have been making daily deliveries of its tender but sturdy hamburger buns to restaurants like Upland , Superiority Burger and the Dutch . Its Rustica and Campagna loaves, familiar by sight if not by name to many New Yorkers, would have been waiting at restaurant doors in the morning. A few fast-casual lunch spots, including By Chloe, Chopt and Fresh&co, are still serving some Orwashers bread to their pickup and delivery customers. Many of their locations, though, cater heavily to office workers who have now been ordered to stay at home. For many vendors, the closings could not have come at a worse time of year. January and February are two of the slowest months for eating out. New spending lags, and old invoices aren't paid even at the end of the 30-day terms that most restaurants demand. \" It's the nature of the beast,\" Mr. Cohen said. \"So as a small wholesaler, you get killed.\" Outside the wholesale business, Orwashers sells bread at local farmers' markets and in stores, including two of its own. Mr. Cohen is throwing all his energy into retail now, like many others who deal in edible products. So is Jason Salvo, who grows vegetables on 15 acres of Snoqualmie River Valley farmland east of Seattle, in Duvall, Wash. Last year about 100 Seattle restaurants bought produce from his farm, Local Roots . With almost all them closed for now, the arugula, radishes, spinach and other plants that he seeded in the ground on Sunday will probably end up in the boxes he sends out each week to summer members of his C.S.A. (for community supported agriculture). Already he is overwhelmed by subscription requests from people who are cooking more than they ever have before. On a far larger scale, wholesale vendors at Eastern Market in Detroit are storing case after case of unsold vegetables. They are fresh now, but won't stay that way for long. Daniel S. Carmody, the president of the nonprofit group that runs the market, said that one vendor held a total produce inventory at the end of last week worth $850,000, which was almost the same as at the start of the week. Another is sitting on 20,000 pounds of broccoli. On Tuesday, the market held a drive-through sale, which Mr. Carmody called \"the first of a set of experiments to make it easier to get food without human contact.\" Retail shoppers could select cases of produce from a form. Boxes filled with 20 pounds of avocados, two dozen heads of lettuce, 50 pounds of potatoes, among other things, were loaded into car trunks and payments were taken by a mobile credit-card-processing unit. \"Part of the challenge is how to get the supply where it's needed, because it's shifted so dramatically,\" he said. Harry Root , a wine distributor in South Carolina and Alabama, usually makes about 60 percent of his sales to restaurants, but said he has begun getting exploratory calls from large supermarkets that have never done business with him before. The wines he champions tend to be made by small producers. About half are shipped from France and Italy. Almost none have any marketing presence in the United States. They are wines, in other words, that don't move unless a sommelier pushes them. But they may start moving now that restaurant drinking is prohibited. The standard supermarket wine section in those states, Mr. Root said, \"will have 1,500 wines and six of them are from France. Not a great ratio. But people obviously drink French wine because we sell a lot of it. If you've got people coming into your grocery asking, \u2018Where's the French wine?', you've got to call the guy that has the French wine.\" A week ago, the Brooklyn seafood wholesaler Pierless Fish began making home deliveries of Ora King salmon from New Zealand, wild halibut from Nova Scotia and other fish that had been mainstays on local menus. Robert DeMasco, the owner, said he knew his business was in trouble even before the bans on public dining, when Danny Meyer and other veteran restaurateurs closed their establishments voluntarily. \"I honestly felt like I'd been kicked off a cliff by a donkey,\" he said. Many East Coast fishing boats stayed at the docks last week, Mr. DeMasco said, because distributors like him had nowhere to sell the fish. If he and other wholesalers successfully become retailers, he said, fishing crews will get back on the ocean again. \"There's only so much chicken you can eat,\" he said. But retail business may be out of reach for vendors that provide highly tailored services to restaurants, like linen services and florists. \"Now that there's a shelter-in-place, we were going to put something on social media,\" said Heather Shouse, whose company, Bottle & Branch , designs and installs flower arrangements, planter boxes and outdoor landscaping for hotels and restaurants in downtown Chicago and the West Loop. As she fielded the phone calls and emails canceling orders that equaled 95 percent of her business, she imagined the sales pitches she could make to people now working from home. \" \u2018Treat yourself to flowers,' \u2018White glove delivery,' where it just gets dropped on your front step,\" she said. \"Or plant delivery: \u2018Turn your brown thumb into a green thumb.' \" Almost as soon as that hope occurred to her, it collapsed. \"No one is going to want these things in this time,\" Ms. Shouse said. In any another year, Bottle & Branch would have hired 10 or so seasonal workers last week to get ready for \"patio season.\" Instead she put nine of her year-round employees on furlough -- unpaid leave -- and put the 10th on part-time status. She said that Chicago's two wholesale flower markets, where the salespeople work on commission, had been brought to a virtual standstill when the restaurant trade died. \"We went from spending $4,000 a week with one salesperson to nothing,\" she said, \"so that's food right out of his mouth.\" Certain restaurant vendors are as busy as ever this month, not that they're happy about the circumstances. \"I've become a therapist,\" said Terence Hanley, whose hospitality accounting firm in Brooklyn serves more than 50 restaurants. \"Weekends mean nothing now.\" Most chefs and restaurateurs ask him about the same few issues. \"The number one concern is, can I take care of my people?\" Mr. Hanley said. \"And unfortunately, the answer is, no, you can't. That was the first few horrible days. A couple of people are trying to give it a go with takeout and delivery with limited success, or no success at all.\" Jasmine Moy, an attorney in Manhattan who specializes in hospitality law, said in an email that she, too, had received \"a barrage of inquiries\" about layoffs. Her clients also had questions about paid sick leave and visas for workers from other countries. Fielding these calls filled some of the time that used to be taken up in negotiating new restaurant deals. Last week and the week before, she said, about half of those deals \"basically died on the spot.\" Ms. Moy said that once the urgent employee issues had been handled, she expected to spend the next few months in one of two ways. For restaurants that are reopening, she said, she will try to get rent abatements or deferrals. For the restaurants that go out of business for good, her job will be \"the assignment of lease and sale of assets,\" she said. \"I don't have any idea at this point how many will fall into that bucket,\" Ms. Moy added. \"But hopefully they will be few and far between.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

They talk about covers when they mean customers, sourcing instead of shopping, and cocktail programs, which civilians would just call cocktails. This week, an eerie new term has rippled through the business: contactless delivery. The concept is simple. The kitchen prepares food that is then boxed up and sent out to an address where a gloved messenger quietly deposits it at the door. The hungry customer and the person making the delivery keep a safe distance between them. It's not the kind of service with a smile that the hospitality industry prides itself on. But for thousands of restaurants across the country, ordered to close their dining rooms to slow the spread of the coronavirus, contactless delivery may be their only chance to stay open and avoid wholesale layoffs. From corner diners to such world-class restaurants as Alinea in Chicago (which by last night had made $5,600 on sales of margarita kits alone), operations focused on delivery and pickup have been adopted at a speed that shows how precarious their survival has become. Servers, hosts and other front-of-house employees at Sugarfish , a chain of 13 sushi restaurants in New York City and Los Angeles, have no tables to seat or water glasses to fill. So all Sugarfish employees who are not involved in food preparation have been reassigned as contactless delivery workers. Jerry Greenberg, the chief executive of Sugarfish's parent company, said he had made the change in order to to keep all of his more than 600 employees on the payroll. Some workers will be leaving packages of tuna, salmon and yellowtail nigiri at doorsteps across those two cities. Others have been learning to operate a piece of equipment that is new to most Sugarfish locations: a telephone. \"We're now taking phone orders,\" Mr. Greenberg said. \"We haven't answered phones in our restaurants in quite some time,\" he went on, explaining that Sugarfish doesn't accept reservations and that all delivery orders were placed online until this week. For restaurants, contactless delivery and its sibling, contactless curbside pickup, are components of a new hygiene protocol that has been adopted alongside old routines, on the fly and despite advice from health departments that can be unclear, contradictory or nonexistent. Kitchens that are accustomed to worrying about the temperature of the walk-in refrigerator now check all employees for fevers. Gloves, once disdained by serious cooks, are suddenly a necessity. Borough Provisions , a delivery service in Manhattan and Brooklyn started this week by Bien Cuit , a string of bakeries and cafes, and Joe Coffee , a roaster that also runs several cafes, has announced a detailed safety protocol. According to Kate Wheatcroft, the bakery's chief executive, it requires packers and drivers to wear masks, gloves and nonporous windbreakers that are sprayed with disinfectant each night. Contactless delivery and pickup is \"a very safe alternative , especially for those who are in high-risk groups for COVID-19, the older people with weak immune systems,\" said Dr. Benjamin Chapman, a professor and food safety specialist at North Carolina State University. A greater challenge is protecting the cooks. \"Practicing social distancing in a kitchen is extremely difficult,\" Dr. Chapman said. He said that smaller staffs would help, and so would staggered shifts, with a pause of five minutes or so between the morning crew's leaving and the arrival of the evening crew. Strictly monitoring the health of each person allowed into the kitchen is also vital, he said. The telephone has come back in vogue at the Publican in Chicago , too. Employees there are taking phone orders for packaged takeout meals, along with boxes of provisions like cookies made by the corporate pastry chef, bread from the corporate baker and cuts of meat carved by the butcher shop upstairs. \"We're trying to drive a lot of sales through the website and trying to get out the word to pick up the phone,\" said Paul Kahan, the chef and restaurateur whose One Off Hospitality company owns the Publican. \"The old-fashioned method. As long as we're going to be quarantined, why not pick up the phone and talk to a butcher?\" There are reasons for restaurants to embrace the telephone that go beyond nostalgia. The device doesn't take a cut of each sale, unlike the big delivery services like GrubHub , Seamless and Uber Eats . Those fees, which can run from 15 to 30 percent, rankled owners even when times were good. Now many restaurants would like to see them go away for a while. And some of them have. DoorDash is waiving fees on pickups and for restaurants that are new to the service, while offering some reduced commissions to restaurants that already use it. Uber Eats has reduced fees to customers but not the commission it charges restaurants. Restaurants that choose to take a new offer from GrubHub can wait to pay their fees until the company decides the crisis is over. \"It's not really beneficial for us, because later on when we get back to normal business we would have to pay it back,\" said Amelie Kang, who owns two Sichuan restaurants in Manhattan with the name M\u00e1L\u00e0 Project. They use Seamless and a host of other delivery services, and Ms. Kang said that orders this month have been \"a little bit overwhelming.\" Starting on Sunday, Ms. Kang and a manager began making certain deliveries themselves, ferrying what she calls \"quarantine food\" in their own cars to several neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn that are normally far outside M\u00e1L\u00e0 Project's delivery range. Through a new website, homebound customers can order 12-ounce containers of beef or mushroom sauce spiced with bird's-eye chiles and Sichuan peppercorns, or containers of two milder sauces based on oyster mushrooms. Demand has been brisk for a new product unsupported by any marketing other than a national state of emergency. More than 300 orders had come in by Wednesday morning. The sauces can be kept in the refrigerator for up to two weeks, Ms. Kang said, and each will season about five portions of noodles, which she also sells and delivers herself. So far, she said, she has not laid off any employees, although none are working more than one day a week. Forced to empty their dining rooms, many restaurants chose to go dark. Some have been selling off their inventory in events that strongly resemble fire sales. On Tuesday, the West Village restaurant Anton's offered a dollar menu , which was essentially the regular menu with prices for such items as chopped liver with house-baked crackers or aged duck breast with sour cherries marked down to $1. Another, much shorter dollar menu was offered on Wednesday. Huertas , a Spanish restaurant in the East Village, sold imported cans of fish, Manchego, almonds, olive and beer as well as \"hearty pints of beans and chorizo\" on Monday before locking its doors for a period that will probably be counted in months, even by the most optimistic estimates. Bags of supplies were sent by car service to customers who could not show up in person. The event raised \"a couple of thousand dollars for our team,\" said a post from the Huertas Instagram account . Restaurants that are trying to stay open for to-go orders have had to scramble their entire routines. Menus have been truncated, simplified or torn up. Whole meals are easier for some kitchens to assemble than \u00e0 la carte orders. Prices have to adjust, too. The Publican is boxing up enough food for four people in meals drawn from what its website terms \"greatest hits,\" like piri-piri chicken, summer sausage, fries, salad, barbecued carrots and cookies, all for $16.95 a person. \"Depression-era pricing,\" Mr. Kahan said. \"We just want to keep some cash flow going. Survival.\" Publican's greatest hits can be purchased through Tock , which was a reservations site until about a week ago. Then Nick Kokonas, its founder and chief executive, got a call from Brian Canlis, an owner of the restaurant Canlis in Seattle. \"He said, \u2018Hey, we need to do a pickup meal and I'm not sure I can properly configure enough of them as \u2018tables,' \" Mr. Kokonas recalled in an email. \"He was trying to \u2018hack' the existing system, which is very powerful for normal restaurants but was not geared to carryout inventory.\" Tock wrote some new software so restaurants could sell meals online and, crucially, process credit card payments, which requires an ability to encrypt data that most restaurants do not possess. About 40 restaurants in the United States and several in other countries have started using the new service, Tock to Go . By Sunday, a competing reservations service, Resy , which like Tock was watching the numbers of bookings on its site crash in one city after another, had also repurposed its site for delivery and pickup orders. About 30 restaurants have signed on. (Resy has waived its fees to restaurants for at least 30 days. Tock is collecting its monthly fee.) Restaurants are the main clients for many other businesses, from florists to linen services to farms, that have lost income as people have been ordered to stay home. Few of them are as nimble, though, as the technology-driven reservation services, and even they are uncertain how many of the to-go operations that were put together over the past few days will still be running next week. \"We're in uncharted territory, and it's evolving very, very fast,\" said Ben Leventhal, the chief executive of Resy. \"Faster than day to day. This is just really fluid, and restaurants are scrambling to figure out how they're going to make money. \"Restaurants are thinking through how best to keep their staff employed -- if that's even possible. How to make sure they're set up in one way or another to come out of this on the other side.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

When New Yorkers hear the word brisket these days, they tend to think of brick pits, stacks of cordwood, neon Shiner Beers signs, and Willie and Waylon singing in the background. Those associations are relatively recent ones locally, dating to the renaissance of the smoked-meat sciences in Texas and the national fame of pit masters like Aaron Franklin in Austin. Before brisket was synonymous with barbecue, its meaning in the five boroughs was the one that you now encounter mainly around the Jewish holidays: a flat slab of beef breast cooked in a closed, humid environment for hours, at which point it not only falls apart unprovoked but also makes its own gravy. That dish has long been one of the chief attractions at David's Brisket House. Although David's has had many owners and probably other names as well, it is thought that the deli was founded by two Jewish men around the middle of the last century, before most of the remaining Jews in Bedford-Stuyvesant left for the suburbs, back when a Brooklyn deli could announce itself as a brisket residence and everybody would know just what that meant. At David's, braised brisket is sliced and stacked into hero rolls, hard rolls and rye. Some of the locals who meander in from Nostrand Avenue -- although David's has occasionally had bouts of fame and sometimes draws visitors from Manhattan, most of its trade comes from longtime inhabitants of Bedford-Stuyvesant -- prefer their brisket in another of its forms: pickled, as corned beef, or, better yet, brined and smoked under a jacket of pepper and other spices, as pastrami. Still others like to combine multiple brisket treatments in a single sandwich. Fuad Hassan and the other owners of David's imported this formula more or less intact for Pastrami Masters, making one striking change before opening. The storefront they had leased on Grand Street was being vacated by a counter-service Lebanese restaurant called Wafa's Express. There may not have been enough fans of hummus and baba ghanouj to keep Wafa's in business, but there were some fans nonetheless, and Mr. Hassan decided to try to hold on to them by fusing the Lebanese menu, almost in its entirety, to the Jewish deli offerings. Pastrami Masters is not kosher, but it is halal; Mr. Hassan, like the other owners, is a Muslim who was born in Yemen. The mastery of Pastrami Masters does not extend to the actual brining of corned beef or the smoking of pastrami. Like most other deli owners in New York, Mr. Hassan buys both meats from a supplier, although he does cook them on site, and he says he gives the pastrami an extra rubdown of seasoning. One effect of the name Pastrami Masters is that pastrami is now the uncontested star. It is Diana Ross, while the corned beef and brisket are the Supremes. Falafel and hummus are in the backing band. This is roughly how I see the menu, too. The corned beef tends to be steamed slightly too long, until it is a little pallid and spongy. Mustard revives it part of the way. What restores it almost completely is being made into a Reuben. The brisket is soft and juicy, even without extra gravy, but it always seems to be missing something. That something could be pastrami. Stacked one on top of the other, the two meats round each other out; the pastrami makes the brisket more interesting, and loses some of its salty intensity in the process. But the highest use of the brisket at Pastrami Masters is an easily overlooked entry on the menu called the Brooklyn cheese steak: hot brisket, gravy and melted American cheese on a hero roll with fried peppers and onions. This is one of those treasures of bodega cuisine, the food created by unsung meat slicers and egg scramblers using standard ingredients found in and around the deli case. The most celebrated example of bodega cuisine in New York is the chopped cheese , which shares some characteristics with the Brooklyn cheese steak. Unlike a chopped cheese, the Brooklyn cheese steak doesn't have lettuce and tomatoes on it. The crunch of lettuce wouldn't be welcome on top of the brisket, but the savory support of saut\u00e9ed peppers and onions most definitely is, as is the polite sharpness of American cheese. When Pastrami Masters finally trots out its breakfast menu, some time in the next month or so, it will begin offering another classic of bodega cuisine: the pastrami, egg and cheese sandwich. If it is made the same way as the one that David's Brisket House has served for longer than anyone remembers, it will be a compelling way to start the day. Like the other sandwiches, it will be improved if you request thick slices of pastrami. Deli-style rotary slicers are used, and when I haven't specified a thickness, my pastrami has sometimes been sliced too thin. Thicker slices seem to give the sandwich greater resistance, which is important with meat that has been steamed into submission as thoroughly as it has at Pastrami Masters. I wish the pastrami and corned beef were sliced with knives, as they are at Katz's Delicatessen . On the other hand, Pastrami Masters makes sandwiches in four sizes, not just a single one the size of a hiking boot. Neither deli uses rye worth singing about. As for the pastrami, if it were not for the different slicing techniques, I'd call it a tie. The Lebanese food was more convincing before the change of ownership. The falafel lately has been densely packed and gummy; makdous, baby eggplants stuffed with spiced chopped walnuts, have been bland and rubbery; the dips and salads have wanted salt and another squeeze of lemon. Lamb shawarma is still wonderful, though, so thickly seasoned with cloves, pepper, cinnamon and other spices that it is almost furry. And while the kenafeh I had gave the impression of having been stashed in the dessert case too long, the baklava is still sweetly evocative, doused with just enough rose water to give you the sensation of lying on a bed near an open window next to a rosebush on a warm night in June. These are nice embellishments, but when you go to Pastrami Masters your main objective will be one form of brisket or another served in some old-fashioned New York way. This is not, to be clear, a modern, artisanal product of the kind that people now associate with Brooklyn, with meat from weird-looking heritage breeds and Levantine spices that flew to the United States in their own business-class seat. For that kind of pastrami sandwich, now that Harry & Ida's is gone, your best bet is lunch at the new Hometown BBQ in Industry City, where the meat is smoked on site and sliced as thick as dominoes. It is very good, but it has a little more Texas in it than the archetypal skyscraper sandwich from a New York deli, which is what you get at Pastrami Masters. Naturally, a full line of Dr. Brown's canned sodas is available. As always, Cel-Ray with hot pastrami on rye is a beverage pairing as harmonious as Muscadet with oysters.

But in interviews they gave -- always in tandem -- it was clear that they were equal partners and that they agreed about everything from their preferred cooking surface (Teflon) to the ideal art to hang in the dining room (none). They share the job of executive chef at their second restaurant, Le Crocodile , also in Brooklyn. This is probably fortunate for them, given how popular the place has become since it opened in December. It is definitely fortunate for us, because another thing Mr. O'Neal and Mr. Leiber apparently agree about is how the food at a modern New York brasserie should look and taste. The menu's long, single page cascades from one category of appetizer to the next, from shellfish to snails, before arriving, about midway down, at Entr\u00e9es. That's a head fake: the word is used in the French sense, and denotes more appetizers. Ten main courses follow, under Plats Principaux, and then come a dozen desserts that more or less describe themselves: profiteroles, chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me, a cheerfully sour lemon tart. There are so many dishes you're not quite sure at first whether two guys whose best-known creation is a pancake will be able to keep up. They do that and then some. Nearly everything I've had at Le Crocodile has made me want to come back for more. This is not the easiest feat in a genre as thoroughly pawed-over and clich\u00e9-ridden as brasserie food, although to be precise we are dealing here with New York City's peculiar notion of brasserie food. In a New York brasserie you almost never see choucroute, but you may well see Jonah crab salad, which at Le Crocodile, is stirred with yuzukosho mayonnaise and sits on a cushion of avocado pur\u00e9e. It's delicious. So are other cold things from the raw bar: sea scallops in a spicy green pool of parsley juice, herbs and lemon; Wellfleet oysters, their deep pearly cups holding a splash or two of bay water. Despite this distinctly broad-minded understanding of brasserie cooking, though, Mr. O'Neal and Mr. Leiber do get in a lot of recipes that either come from France or make you think of it. Onion soup is mandatory in a place like this, but Le Crocodile makes it pull its own weight. The broth is almost velvety, fortified by lardons, and there are good crunchy mouthfuls of toasted sourdough croutons instead of the usual limp blobs of drowned bread. Pickled mussels, plump and orange, nod distantly to the plate of herring at every other brasserie in France, down to the pickled onions and carrots that ride along. Cold leeks in vinaigrette make an appearance, too, though they've undergone a little remodeling: trimmed into bite-size segments that are stood on end in a foundation of ravigote sauce and then covered with toasted hazelnuts. There's a sort of salade lyonnaise -- I say sort of because the lardons you'd find in Lyon have been replaced by smoked eel. The idea is great; the salad is smokier than the original, and with the wonderful added oily softness of the eel. In its framework, it is not too different from the smoked-herring Caesar found at M. Wells Steakhouse , and before that at the original, too-pure-to-last M. Wells in a stainless-steel diner . Mr. O'Neal cooked in the diner, and was later put in charge of M. Wells Dinette inside MoMA PS1. His cooking still has that half-crazy gleam in its eye, but the characteristic M. Wells urge to drive every dish to the edge of a cliff and then step on the gas is not much in evidence at Le Crocodile. He and Mr. Leiber, whose formative years as a cook were spent at Barbuto under Jonathan Waxman, are at home making food that seems perfectly normal and ordinary right up until you taste it. Le Crocodile slithered into the empty shell in the Wythe Hotel in Williamsburg that was left behind last year when Reynard closed. The industrial bones are the same: the double-height ceilings, well-worn floor planks, big arched windows punched through fortress-thick brick walls. But the interior was altered, hiding the open kitchen that used to dominate the room behind light wood paneling, replacing the bentwood cafe chairs with more comfortable models and adding some round leather booths. The results are dramatic; the room has a little more style and sense of purpose, and a lot more energy. It's a place where people, or at least Brooklynites, want to sit and stay. Even after 10 on a school night, there are salty stacks of pommes frites on every table. These are piled next to either the steak au poivre or the roasted chicken, in which case the poultry and the fries will be slowly soaking up a warm helping of chicken jus and fresh herbs. The bar is still in place, with a new marble top. Also left over from Reynard is an impressive trove of natural wines compiled by Lee Campbell, who was more than a few steps ahead of the pack. Rafa Garc\u00eda Febles now has the keys to the cellar, and has built judiciously on the legacy of Ms. Campbell and her successor, Basile Al Mileik. There's no way to mention natural wines, a modern New York brasserie and a pair of coequal chefs without summoning thoughts of Frenchette . Remarkably, there is very little overlap between them. Le Crocodile looks less McNallyish , and the kitchen is less entranced by organ meats, although somebody back there knows how to prepare sweetbreads, which are puffy and creamy on a small hill of potato pur\u00e9e, set off by charred onions and a fistful of lardons. (They must be on loan from the salade lyonnaise.) Both restaurants sell a lot of frites. The ones at Frenchette are better, but it's close. Both take the science of charcuterie seriously, but Le Crocodile, with almost half a dozen terrines and p\u00e2t\u00e9s to try on any given night, gets the edge. Even the mushroom p\u00e2t\u00e9, smooth as foie gras and held together by what must be a small mountain of butter, is superb. The food at both places shows great skill and self-assurance with very little preening and self-consciousness. You can tell when you eat at Le Crocodile that Mr. Leiber and Mr. O'Neal are cooking things they'd eat if they ever sat down in their own restaurant. That's rarer than you'd think.

This has not stopped Peruvian restaurants from sprouting up there. They line Jamaica Avenue under the shuddering elevated tracks of the J train, which by the time it gets here is nearly at the end of the line. Most are modest in spirit and unprepossessing in appearance. Seen from the outside, Caleta 111 Cevicheria seems to belong to this category, too. It's a narrow sliver of real estate, about as wide as a parking space. Not long ago it was a cellphone repair shop and, before that, a pet grooming service called New Happy Pawz. Your first clue that this cevicheria's ambitions are out of proportion to its square footage is likely to be the sight of the chef, Luis Caballero. He is easy to spot. His chef's jacket is stiff, spotlessly white and double-breasted, and his name is stitched in black below the left shoulder. He brought the jacket with him from Raymi, a bigger and more elaborate Peruvian restaurant near Madison Square Park where he was the sous chef until it closed two years ago. In place of a toque, Mr. Caballero's head is covered by a Panama-style hat with a wide, flat brim. In Peru, where he was born, raised and began his cooking career, this kind of hat is typically worn, with a swagger, by cowboys. The restaurant debuted last fall. Now Mr. Caballero is usually stationed by the front window, behind a counter that runs about two-thirds of the way back, ending in a dining area with seating for about 20 people. In front of him, dozens of limes are spread out. Lime juice jolts through almost every dish that leaves his end of the counter, which is in fact the restaurant's entire kitchen. It allows the dishes known as causas to escape the gravitational pull of the mashed potatoes they are built upon. It is trickled over choritos a la Chalaca, a platter of big, chilled mussels in their green-edged shells under a mound of raw Peruvian salsa. And, of course, lime juice is the main ingredient in the leche de tigre, or tiger's milk, that bathes all of Mr. Caballero's ceviches and makes them stand out from ceviches prepared anywhere else. The lime juice is joined by ginger, the combination that makes Moscow Mules worth drinking. Further assistance is provided by garlic, cilantro, the mighty rocoto pepper and one or two other chiles. There is corvina ceviche made with the sweet-fleshed white fish preferred by Peruvians, and there is shrimp ceviche. There is also an everything ceviche, into which Mr. Caballero will toss the whole fish market: clams, mussels, octopus, squid, shrimp and corvina. And you can have a ceviche built to your specifications, known on the menu as ceviche personalizado. If you do have one personalized, you might skip the squid, which isn't as appealing as the rest of the seafood. Whatever you choose will be outfitted with plantain chips, a few chunks of sweet potato and cancha, salty kernels of toasted Peruvian corn. (One of the best things about ceviche is that it comes with its own bar snack.) Earlier generations of ceviche cooks generally left seafood in its acidic marinade for hours until its flesh turned opaque, as if it had been cooked. Like many of his contemporaries, Mr. Caballero prefers a shorter soak, just long enough to infiltrate the seafood and slightly roughen its slippery texture. The milky liquid that the seafood gives off during its bath is perhaps the most important component of leche de tigre, being the one that transforms it from a marinade into a beverage, and probably the source of its reputation as an aphrodisiac. Some cevicherias serve a few ounces in a shot glass along with the ceviche. At Caleta 111, leche de tigre can be ordered from the menu, where it sits, alone, under the heading Hangover. It contains some marinated corvina but much more of its life-restoring liquid, so much more that it comes in a small glass bowl of the kind that usually provide a home for a Japanese fighting fish. Most ceviche connoisseurs will tell you that the leche de tigre is their favorite part of ceviche. This is how I feel about the leche de tigre at Caleta 111. It is what an energy drink would taste like if energy drinks were any good. Other dishes that hope to live up to the level of the ceviches have their work cut out for them. One that manages it is a seafood stew, aguadito de mariscos. Rounded out with vegetables and rice, it comes to the table bubbling in a hot iron pot. The broth contains so much cilantro paste it is bright green, and it gets a quasi-Japanese flavor from strands of yuyo, the Peruvian seaweed that looks like purple fettuccine with legs. A tamal filled with pork is another strong contender. The pork filling is fatty, which serves as a foil for warm and salty black olives. The ground corn surrounding the pork is exceptionally fluffy and sharp with dried aj\u00ed amarillo peppers. They are not quite spicy, but the rocoto puree on the side is. Sudado de pescado, kingfish in a tart seafood and beer broth, would have been more inviting if the main ingredient hadn't been overcooked. Arroz con mariscos -- rice with seafood -- is cooked in beer, too, seasoned with aj\u00ed amarillo and aj\u00ed panca. The beer is Peruvian, Cusque\u00f1a. Following Peruvian custom influenced by Italians, Parmesan is grated over the top. The menu names four desserts. What it doesn't say is that they are available on weekends only. At the back of the dining room is a screen on which surfing videos play without end. A surfboard is propped up beneath it. The walls are painted the blue that the inside of a wave takes on just before it breaks. Beer is served in plastic cups, as is the excellent chicha morada, a purple punch Mr. Caballero's wife, Yanet, brews each night from corn, pineapples, citrus peels and heavy doses of cinnamon and clove. The cups are out of keeping with the rest of the service pieces, which are more decorative. One plate is shaped like a whale. Another is shaped like a big whale and a baby whale swimming together. Cancha are served in a dish that looks like a spoon rest with the tail of a fish. Other dishes come in heavy, glazed ceramics or iron pots. Caleta 111 is also the first restaurant I've been to where the tables are set with nondisposable metal sporks. After slurping leche de tigre and spearing clams with one, I am prepared to say that ceviche is the spork's highest use.

Many of the restaurants that have been built there have seemed cursed on one level or another, but the latest one sounded uniquely inauspicious, starting with its timing. It opened in November -- the 13th of November. The Tavern by WS , as it's called, faces west on 11th Avenue, offering a last nostalgic glimpse of the West Side railyards before they vanish beneath the second phase of Hudson Yards. (Yes, there's going to be a second phase.) This winter, the restaurant's front door has seemed like the most ferociously wind-battered part of the whole site, no small distinction. It's such a forsaken spot that even the helpful greeters who roam the barren tundra between the buildings giving directions to despondent tourists stare blankly when you say you're looking for the Tavern by WS. Then again, it might be the name. To repeat, it's called the Tavern by WS. If my instinct didn't already tell me to beware of restaurants with bylines, past experience would. But an initials-only byline is even more suspect. Who is this W.S., and why would he, she or they hide behind first letters? Is it Willie Sutton, the succinct bank robber? Will Shortz, the world's only academically accredited puzzle master? Walter Slezak, the Austrian-born character actor? Watermelon Slim, the pseudonymous harmonica player? Wallace Shawn? Wayne Shorter? Whit Stillman? Wanda Sykes? I won't get your hopes up any further, because the real WS isn't a person at all. The initials turn out to stand for Wine Spectator , a magazine whose publisher, Marvin R. Shanken, owns the restaurant together with Steven M. Ross, the developer responsible for Hudson Yards, and Kenneth A. Himmel, another developer, who built the mall across the tundra where David Chang and Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s have their restaurants. Wine Spectator is probably best known for assigning scores to wines on a 100-point scale. Numbers in the 90s can be seen in screaming boldface print on \"shelf talkers,\" those hanging sales pitches that dangle in liquor-store aisles like socks on a clothesline. The notion that a drink produced by sunshine, rain, dirt, vines and yeast can be judged by how close it comes to perfection, signified by a 100 score, never made much sense. Now that many drinkers are turning to quirky, imperfect wines, the Wine Spectator's numerals seem like artifacts from an earlier time. Perhaps this is why the Tavern by WS looks as if its designer, Rockwell Group , finished all its drawings for the dining room around 1999, lost them, rediscovered them last year and decided they were still good to go. The interior's most prominent features are the wine walls. There's one by the host's desk, two behind the bar and more on a mezzanine that seems to have no other purpose. And catwalks, too, because what use is a wine wall without a catwalk? All that's missing to complete the Vegas-in-the-Clinton-era theme are women in bodysuits zipping up and down on cables to collect a Screaming Eagle here, a Harlan Estate there. For a magazine whose current issue has such cover lines as \"Bordeaux 2017: What to Buy\" and \"2017: Another Great Vintage\" (that one is about Oregon pinot noir), these walls seem almost inevitable. Any magazine like Wine Spectator is going to promote wine as a status symbol; this just turns the idea into architecture. The Tavern by WS is very nearly another case of an aging brand getting funky on the dance floor to prove that the old man's still got it. But somewhere in an unseen kitchen behind those walls, a brigade of cooks is working like crazy to keep that from happening. They're led by Eli Kaimeh, who worked for Thomas Keller for 13 years, ultimately as chef de cuisine at Per Se . He was there in 2015, when I reviewed the restaurant , and the cooking seemed to have lost its conviction. At this new restaurant, though, he has a clear sense of what he wants to do and how to do it. The menu is a laundry list of routine American restaurant dishes like grilled salmon, but they're almost all made over in ways that improve them without becoming excessively fiddly, a fate that is never far away in Mr. Keller's restaurants. Mr. Kaimeh has helped turn the Tavern by WS into a good restaurant, despite its owners' efforts to make it look like the opposite. The minestrone has tiny pasta tubes, two types of shell bean, two types of string beans and miniature fried croutons that stay crisp as they float on the surface of very pure and sweet tomato soup. Excellent olive oil has been spilled on top. This minestrone has been cleaned up in too many ways to count, but it still tastes like honest vegetable soup. The Caesar salad looks like a cross-section of an iceberg-lettuce head, which it essentially is, except that every leaf inside it has been somehow painted with a gratifyingly sharp Caesar dressing. The top is golden with toasted chips of Parmesan bread crumbs and grated Parmesan; crisscrossed over this are two anchovies, battered and deep-fried, fish-and-chips style. I have tried telling myself I won't eat the anchovies first, but I always do. The single slab of Nueske's bacon would be worth ordering even if it didn't come with a subtly upgraded spinach salad. (The walnuts are freshly toasted and the shallots are fried.) Lobster ravioli may be a little overcomplicated, but who will complain when the complications include lobster inside the ravioli, outside the ravioli and in the brandy-spiked sauce Am\u00e9ricaine? Although he spent a decade cooking tasting-menu portions, Mr. Kaimeh has a knack for making main courses that are big without being boring. Sea bass gets an herb crust and a really lively vinaigrette of chopped green and black olives. The skin on spatchcocked chicken is good and crunchy, and the sauce supr\u00eame tastes a bit like skin itself, or at least like the golden drippings on a Sunday roast. A lamb shoulder is braised until it simultaneously holds its shape and falls to pieces; it has enough flavor to make up for the somewhat blah heap of cavatelli, which might also be helped by another big spoonful of gremolata. Some stunts backfire. The cucumber jelly shards crumbled over salmon rillettes have a slight back-of-the-fridge taste, and one of the few vegetarian dishes is also one of the few things worth steering clear of: a whole honeynut squash that seems to have had brown butter pumped into it. Stephen Collucci, the pastry chef, treats American desserts affectionately but not indulgently. If a better crust can be supplied, it will be, as with the very thin and crunchy Graham cracker layer under the coconut cream pie, or the tender shortbread holding the excellent lemon meringue tart in one piece. I don't know what to make of the crunchy, underbaked apples in apple pie, but I know that I'd skip it next time in favor of whatever doughnut has captured Mr. Collucci's imagination at the moment. His department also makes the gluten-free bread, which you might want to ask for even if you eat gluten. You will get long golden ingots of rosemary cornbread, or something very like it, and they will be wonderful. Micha\u00ebl Engelmann, who is in charge of alcohol, put together a robust wine list, closing in on 400 choices. Wisely, he doesn't treat the document as the Wine Spectator's greatest hits. It's got a few much-hyped names, but the large number of bottles for under $100 is really something, and nowhere on the list will you see a point score.

The loftlike dining room still looked so much like 1985 that it could have served as a set for \" The Bonfire of the Vanities ,\" in the unlikely event that any studio wanted to remake it. The cooking may not have been in the vanguard any longer, but Mr. Portale was still wringing fresh pleasures out of ideas he had been refining for years. Meanwhile, Victoria Blamey, a chef who cut her teeth in kitchens that practiced the latest avant-garde techniques , was between jobs, taking a long eating tour while she looked for inspiration and a new place to show off her stark, contemporary cooking. Somehow, files containing the fates of these two chefs must have ended up on the desk of some cosmic prankster who decided it would be amusing if they switched places, \"Freaky Friday\" -style. Today, Ms. Blamey is the chef at Gotham and Mr. Portale no longer works there. Since November, he has been found at Portale, a few blocks northwest in Chelsea. When he steps up to the pass of his busy steel kitchen, he looks out on a bright dining room with bleached white-oak floors, marble tabletops and Italian leather chairs on elegantly slender legs of black steel. By 6:30 p.m., very few of those chairs are empty. As the bartender who stirred up one of the restaurant's several Negroni variations for me early one night said, \"When you cook at the same restaurant for 35 years, you're going to have a following.\" The proximate cause of this mixup was Mr. Portale's desire to open a second restaurant while keeping some control of the kitchen at Gotham. The other owners apparently refused , putting Ms. Blamey in charge of the hulking white elephant from the '80s. Mr. Portale then went forward on his own with the second place. Portale is Italian. The food of Italy, in particular its pasta, was one of several running themes on Mr. Portale's menus at Gotham, braided together with French cuisine, strictly seasonal East Coast ingredients and a homegrown predilection for emphatic flavors. This also roughly describes what used to be called New American cuisine , a style founded by Mr. Portale and a handful of other chefs. If you subtract the French recipes but keep some French techniques, it describes his food at Portale. This is not cooking just like Nonna's. Mr. Portale hits the accents harder, and underlines the heartier flavors with reductions and other tactics. His response to Emilia-Romagna's delicate tortellini in brodo is to stuff wads of foie gras, cream and chestnut paste, which melt like hot fudge, into tortellini the size of pinkie rings. In Italy, brodo for tortellini is meant to be a little restrained. At Portale, it is a voluptuous double chicken stock. A similar fate lies in store for another broth, the brodetto di pesce. On the Adriatic, this might be made by boiling the bones of whatever fish will end up in the soup. Mr. Portale's recipe starts with pounding lobster bodies and shrimp shells through a sieve. The broth is the color of a brick and as thick as heavy cream. It verges on a sauce for the gleaming hunk of cod at the center of the bowl, surrounded by wild shrimp and clams. Most of the other main courses are cuts of meat or fish. They're generous and skillfully cooked, but they're often upstaged by the appetizers and pastas and occasionally by the vegetables they share their plates with. The dry-aged sirloin is an impressively tender piece of beef, and it does manage to live up to the standard set by the smashed fingerling potatoes wearing golden jackets of crisp baked Parmigiano-Reggiano. The chicken, which has been brined and cooked sous vide before its skin is browned in a pan, is perhaps not as interesting as its wild mushrooms and dandelion greens. The pork roast could use more roasted Nardello peppers and a more potent orange mostarda. The good news is that we have pretty much come to the end of the bad news, and it wasn't all that bad. Now we can talk about the pasta, which shows the Portale method to its best advantage. A purist would admire the hand-rolled, ridged ricotta cavatelli, but might want a word with Mr. Portale about the sauce. Sauces, actually. There are two, a spicy arrabbiata and a cilantro pesto that sends it whirling in another direction. It's unconventional but logical, too -- essentially tomato sauce with fresh herbs. In midwinter, field-grown tomatoes are scarce at the Union Square Greenmarket, where Mr. Portale was a familiar face before some of his cooks were born. He leans instead into ingredients like mushrooms and cheese, or both at once. Fleshy wild porcini are tossed either with kinky strands of mafaldine glazed with truffle butter, or with cappellacci, little bishop's hats of pasta that break open to let the melted taleggio slip out. The appetizers are high-spirited and showy, like the salad of fennel (raw and roasted) that starts on one side of the plate with a trail of black rice and winds up on the other with shining pieces of citrus. There is also a fritto misto with a thin, light, frilly crust that a Japanese tempura specialist would admire; a hamachi crudo whose curls of raw, pink fish look like waves breaking over bits of oranges and pools of avocado-and-basil pur\u00e9e; and a kale-and-quinoa salad that sounds like penance but ends up being totally charming. The desserts at Gotham tried hard to impress. The ones Kaity Mitchell has devised for Portale are calmer, but that doesn't mean they've given up. The tiramis\u00f9, shaped into a dome and sheathed in a dark chocolate shell, does a straight-faced impression of a tartufo . The pear torta, for its part, seems to have delusions of being an upside-down cake. Whatever it is, I like it. I handed the wine choice over to my guests, who included a natural-wine fan, a winemaker with a lifelong interest in undervalued regions and a former resident of Florence who can still drink like a local. Each of them seemed to play the long and almost entirely Italian list from a different angle and to come out at the end with a bottle that precisely answered their desires. Multiply their satisfaction by the 30 or so other tables; add to that the pleasure of two rooms full of New Yorkers discovering another side to a chef they've admired for years.

Normal people who find a great dish at a restaurant come back and order it over and over, barely noticing that the rest of the menu exists. A restaurant critic who finds a great dish will come back and order all the other stuff. Most of the time this means eating some things that are average or slightly better, and a few that don't click, and then writing a review on the theme of inconsistency. If I were a normal person, I'd go back to a two-month-old West Village restaurant called Anton's every few weeks and get the spaghetti anchoiade each time. I'd twirl the noodles around my fork, noticing how plain and mild they looked. Then I'd start to eat. As I chewed and chewed -- here's a kitchen that knows what al dente means -- I'd start to taste anchovies, as if one small piece had been pounded into invisibility and stirred with the garlic and oil. The anchovy flavor would build. It would magnify. So would my appreciation of the spaghetti. But I am not normal, and I am obliged to report that after digging around at Anton's I found some, you know, inconsistency. The restaurant, the first that the chef Nick Anderer has opened since he left the velvet clutches of the Union Square Hospitality Group, is a low-key homage to old-guard New York specialties and traditions. His menu has no truck with avocado toasts, rainbow bagels and other early-21st-century ephemera. Chicken broth comes in a two-handled bouillon cup that, like many of the floral-patterned plates and bowls at Anton's, looks as if it came from Grandma's china hutch. (The broth is darker than the yellow broths of Grandma's time, though, with a roasted flavor that can handle the shot of amontillado that is tipped into it at the table.) Anton's occupies a squat Federal-era building on the corner of Hudson and West 11th Streets with mullioned windows and five-pointed metal stars that hold its brick facade in place. From just about anywhere in the low-ceilinged, plank-floored dining room you can look across Hudson Street and see the White Horse Tavern . It is the kind of West Village view that makes you hope for snow. Around the interior are framed oil paintings of bottles, cups, fruit and other still-life chestnuts. Some were commissioned from a contemporary artist from Tblisi, Georgia, named Vitali Dvali . Others were picked up secondhand by Mr. Anderer and Natalie Johnson, the general manager and his partner in operating the restaurant; these look as if they have been quietly decorating the back room of some neighborhood restaurant for decades. Nostalgia is a fraught exercise in the Trump era. Reviving historic dishes is one thing, but when an entire restaurant seems to be based on a gauzy dream of a rose-colored past, you hope for some sign that the creators understand that the past wasn't equally dreamy for everybody. To some extent, Anton's menu does this by portraying a history of New York in which appetites have been shaped by immigrants. With an eye on Jewish appetizing stores, he serves a whitefish salad that I might almost call luxurious if we weren't talking about whitefish salad. The chopped liver may have the same inspiration, although it's been made significantly meatier by the addition of chopped chicken hearts and significantly fruitier by a glug of Marsala. The liver is served with white toast and curly parsley, which has waited long enough for its comeback, thank you very much. Mr. Anderer brings together slices of dry-cured country ham from Tennessee with a sweeter and less salty \"city ham\" brined and smoked by the East Village Meat Market on Second Avenue , still owned by the Baczynsky family and one of the last standing relics of Little Ukraine. Since the demise of the great Kurowycky butcher shop , the Baczynskys have been the undisputed ham champions of the East Village. They also make a fine bacon, which Anton's incorporates into the spicy and smoky bucatini Baczynski, essentially a pasta all'amatriciana by way of Kyiv. It is very good, as you would predict if you are familiar with the amatriciana that Mr. Anderer kept on Maialino's menu for his 10 years as chef there. So are the spinach ravioli, along with most of the four or five other pastas, whose ethnic heritage needs no footnote. The angel hair francese could use a brief introduction, though. Gene's Restaurant is known to passers-by on West 11th Street for its Garden State Brickface -style molded stone facade and its faded red awning stretching from the front door to the taxicab; regulars know it for what it calls \"continental cuisine.\" Mr. Anderer is given to ordering chicken francese with a side of angel-hair pasta, a pairing that by the end of the meal results in a nest of noodles coated with garlic, lemon and chicken juices. This is what Mr. Anderer serves as angel-hair francese, approximately, although at Anton's the angel hair is freshly made and is blitzed with fried bread crumbs so it won't be mistaken for noodle soup. It is another Anton's dish that I would make an appointment to eat every few weeks if I were a normal person. As a critic, though, I pressed my luck. I ordered the thin, weak rag\u00f9 with overcooked lasagna noodles. I went for the roasted cauliflower, too, and wondered why the random scattering of chopped apricots, almonds and olives sounded so much more interesting on the menu, where it is called a relish. The onions under hanger steak Lorenz, supposedly \"melted,\" were still quite solid, and kind of strange. The roast chicken and some other main courses were flat-out dull, and the schmaltz potatoes didn't taste like much of anything, not even schmaltz. The service was hard to get a fix on, too. Maybe you will get the jovial, welcoming treatment I got one night when no wish went unfulfilled, no matter how minor. Maybe, as happened to me on a different night, your requests for another appetizer or a side dish will be met with vague nods which could mean \"later,\" or \"much later,\" or \"never.\" This worried me more than the schmaltz potatoes. You can simply stop eating a dud dish, but when some food doesn't show up at all, that's the kind of inconsistency that can keep even normal people away.

I didn't know it was going to change the sushi landscape when I wrote a four-star review of it a few months after it opened, but I knew it was original and unexpected. I also knew that no other omakase meal lobbed out so many thrilling pieces of sushi, or was quite as entertaining. Within a year, its name was a metonym for excellence in the art of raw fish. In 2017, the TV series \"Billions\" used it as the setting for a scene in which a sushi connoisseur upbraids a young moron who is sloshing each piece of nigiri in soy sauce as if he were dunking a mop into a bucket of soapy water. In 2018, a second location opened in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, to predictable wails and moans. Behind the front door, though, the original restaurant had been changing all along, leaning into its popularity, trying to share its wares with as many people as possible. As a result, Sushi Nakazawa is now more accessible than ever. At the same time, some of the qualities that made it so exciting when it was new have been tossed overboard. The great inspiration that Mr. Nakazawa and his business partner, Alessandro Borgognone, had at first was to translate an elite Tokyo-style sushi counter in ways suited to an American audience. They didn't try to make you feel as if you were in a 1,000-year-old Zen temple in Japan. [ Read more about New York's four-star restaurants .] Instead of a muted, all-natural palette of wood and stone, Sushi Nakazawa was done in a stark black-and-white, always in style in New York. The counter was white marble, the plates were glazed with a monochromatic drip pattern that recalled Jackson Pollock, and the stools at the counter were swiveling numbers in black leather that suggested a casino, which in fact is where Mr. Borgognone first spotted them. Mr. Nakazawa put customers who might have felt out of their depth in a hushed, old-school nigiri sanctuary at ease. He was already a minor celebrity from his appearance in the 2011 documentary \" Jiro Dreams of Sushi \" as the downtrodden apprentice who can't make a pan of tamago to his boss's satisfaction. Out on his own, he showed an instinct for the spotlight that the movie barely hinted at. His smile was quick. His laugh was quicker, and was heard every time he successfully startled diners by flicking live shrimp on to their plates. Some traditionalists found Sushi Nakazawa's mix of American and Japanese sensibilities off-putting. But it helped introduce Tokyo-style omakase, in which the chef decided what you would eat based on a close reading of the ocean's seasons and, to some extent, pure whim, to New Yorkers who weren't necessarily students of Japanese culture. You didn't need to know that shiny-skinned fish are called hikari-mono, or that kohada come into season in April to enjoy a meal at Sushi Nakazawa. You just sat back and let it happen. This had a downside, and before long you saw or heard stories of rich young men -- they were always young men -- acting like the cretin on \"Billions.\" (These \"bromakase\" patrons must be the reason Nakazawa's chefs and servers now warn you at the start of the meal to eat every piece in one bite, and never to top sushi with pickled ginger.) Before Nakazawa, the best omakase meals were typically served inside restaurants that did most of their trade in \u00e0 la carte sushi; after Nakazawa, one dedicated omakase parlor after another opened up, and like Nakazawa, many of them were inspired less by Japanese customs than by modern New York stagecraft. That a 21-piece dinner at the counter cost $150 seemed like a deal even in 2013. Today, dinner at the counter is still $150, and it's $30 less in the dining room, although there are some new efforts to upsell. As the cost of other omakase meals has gone up to $400 or more, holding the cost steady is an achievement. It's even more impressive because some parts of the experience have been upgraded. Originally the front door opened directly into the skinny room that holds the sushi counter. In 2015, Sushi Nakazawa took over the space next door on Commerce Street, and now you enter through a lounge where, if you are early for your reservation, you may bide your time perching on a small beige tuffet or leaning against the bar while putting away a glass of Champagne. If your destination is the dining room, you'll find that the chairs there have been replaced with cushier ones. Reservations, which used to be harder to find than West Village street parking, are plentiful now that the restaurant has added lunch service and stays open seven days a week instead of five. This is a net gain for patrons, but it comes at a cost. Mr. Nakazawa can no longer work every shift, as he once did. When he's absent, it doesn't much change the dining-room experience. But the counter is far more interesting when he is behind it. To keep up with the increased traffic, Mr. Nakazawa has made his production line more efficient. Rather than slicing each piece of fish to order, chefs do it before each seating begins. This gives you less to watch, but it speeds up the meal and doesn't seem to harm the sushi much, with one exception. One of my strongest impressions from the restaurant's early days is the flavor of the live shrimp -- the same ones Mr. Nakazawa liked to launch at unsuspecting customers before killing them, shelling them and laying them over a parcel of warm rice. Each time I ate one, I felt the room spin. The lusterless, pre-killed spot prawns I've had there recently were no substitute at all. I doubt advance slicing was the reason the scallop with yuzukosho on its underside, like a concealed weapon, seemed less vividly seasoned than it used to be. Nor did it have anything to do with what's happened to the tamago, which used to be a kind of whipped custard with a haunting savory finish and is now more like a blandly sweet yellow spongecake. Some pieces still took me on a quick thrill ride: the rich golden-eye snapper, or kinmedai, warmed with a torch and sprinkled with sea salt and lemon juice; the creamy Spanish mackerel and the firmer, slightly metallic-tasting horse mackerel; the hay-smoked wild yellowtail that tastes like tuna prosciutto. There were, however, few surprises or rarities. Spots in the lineup that could have been given to delightful character actors of the sushi stage are taken up by overexposed stars, like the four cuts of tuna and two species of salmon I was served last month. If you want to add something different to the roster, your choices are caviar, Wagyu beef and truffles. It's become a greatest-hits menu. I can't say the changes are a surprise. Sushi Nakazawa's populism was one of the things I most liked about it from the start. I'm glad that more people can get in now, and that they will be paying more or less what I paid the first time I went. The temptation to angle prices higher and higher out of reach must be a strong one, given how many places in New York seem unable to resist. Up there in the stratosphere where Sushi Nakazawa's elite new competitors hold court, there's a price to be paid, too, in empty seats, eerily hushed dining rooms and customers who don't seem to think there's anything odd about having the whole place to themselves.

You go there for Lamoon's mango salad dotted with ant eggs , and Ayada's chile- and garlic-laden raw shrimp . At first the four-month-old restaurant Thai Cook doesn't seem to fit that description, although it sits across Broadway from the cluster of restaurants that contains Lamoon. \"Manhattan Thai food,\" a Jackson Heights friend pronounced soon after the first dishes arrived. This was premature, and she took it back once we'd tried the hot dog salad. Hot dog salad is not the dish's Thai name, of course. Yum is the word for salad, which in the central part of Thailand means red onions or shallots, cilantro, fresh chiles and so on (the ones at Thai Cook have chrysanthemum greens), dressed with lime juice and fish sauce. This particular yum was yum sai krok, translated as \"sausage salad.\" The sausage in question was skinny, pink and a little salty, like a hot dog, although it is in fact made by a Vietnamese butcher in California. I think it may be the saltiness that makes Thai Cook's sausage salad so compelling, although I wouldn't discount the fresh red and green bird's-eye chiles that had been lightly smashed so that even if you avoided eating a whole one you couldn't avoid eating some of its fiery shrapnel. In any case, the hot dog salad was enough to change my friend's mind about Thai Cook. As for me, I already knew the place was anything but ordinary. It's true that the menu shares things in common with garden-variety Thai restaurants around Manhattan and, for that matter, many other American cities. There are, first of all, the yums, although not every takeout Thai menu will offer a yum made with pork liver, or with a translucent sphere of preserved egg yolk, or with another kind of sausage called moo yor that is wide and pale, more boudin blanc than frankfurter. And it's reasonably certain that Thai Cook is the only restaurant in the city where you can order \"Yum What the Heck,\" a riotous assembly of all the preceding ingredients plus squid, steamed mussels and the uncooked claws of blue crabs. The yums and some other features of Thai Cook's menu look familiar because the restaurant's chef, Boonnum Thongngoen, makes dishes from Bangkok. (She grew up outside the city, where her mother was a cook for the Royal Thai Navy and her husband was a partner in several restaurants.) Bangkok supplied most of the recipes for the first wave of Thai restaurants in the United States, and for some New Yorkers, Bangkok-style cuisine is still synonymous with Thai food. For others, it refers to dishes that have been degraded by careless cooking, grown dull through excessive familiarity, and been turned into old news by the chile-pummeled larbs of Isan, the fragrant khao soi of Chiang Mai, and other specialties that chefs from parts of Thailand far from Bangkok have brought to New York, and to Elmhurst in particular. There are reasons the food of central Thailand has spread so widely, though, and you'll remember them when you are in Ms. Thongngoen's hands. She runs a restaurant in Brooklyn that has a more expansive menu, Am Thai Bistro , but at Thai Cook she restricts herself to Bangkok street food. She almost has to, because of the limitations of her kitchen. Along with the rest of the Thai Cook operation, it has been carved out of the dining room of another restaurant. The front door on the left leads to a Chinese hot-pot place called iCook Buffet . The one on the right takes you to Thai Cook, after you walk down a long hall where toy models of tuk-tuks, the three-wheeled taxis of Bangkok, dangle at the end of rainbow-colored Slinkys. Between the restaurants are waist-high partitions and a few tied-back curtains. No wall separates the diners who are dunking enoki mushrooms into boiling chicken broth from the ones spooning out panang curry. Ms. Thongngoen and two or three other cooks are out in the open, too, lined up behind a counter that might have been a service bar in a former incarnation of the space. On the left are two tall wood mortar-and-pestle sets. This is where Ms. Thongngoen stands, shredding papayas and cucumbers with an imposing knife, then hammering them with a small bat she holds in her left hand, mixing in chiles, peanuts, bean sprouts and lime hulls, scraping down the sides with a metal spoon in her right hand as she goes. Bangkok papaya salads do not come at you with a fire hose of heat, like the northern Thai som tums you'll get at nearby restaurants. But you will notice the chiles, as you'll notice the saltiness and sharpness, the way you will when a tom yum has been smashed with care. Slide along the counter of this skeletal kitchen to the right end, and you'll find a couple of induction burners. One of Ms. Thongngoen's deputies, stationed there, prepares the desserts, like soft taro, or pumpkin cubes in warm coconut milk that has more than a trace of salt. She also makes cool emerald-green pearls of pandan tapioca and coconut-milk shaved ice, infused with enough jasmine to affect your dreams; cantaloupe balls and white sheets of fresh young coconut are dropped on top. What's missing from this mise en place? Quite a lot, including the gas burners, woks and deep-fryers that Thai Cook would need to make spring rolls or fried tofu. For appetizers, there are slippery, thickish sheets of steamed tapioca and rice flours -- \"fresh crepe\" on the menu -- folded over chopped pressed tofu with chives and splashed with a soy dressing. Or, less interestingly, something called \"steamed fish,\" which is what it sounds like, with the addition of fried pork skin. But Ms. Thongngoen uses a behind-the-scenes burner to simmer the base for her excellent noodle soups. She also cooks pork or beef into an excellent panang curry, a little thicker than usual, which may be why she calls it \"home style.\" Whole chiles are scattered over the top but, unless you eat one, they won't take over the coconut-milk sauce; the dominant aromatic is lime leaf, sliced into threads. Other curries are worthwhile, but the only one that's as compelling is the clear, sour one called kaeng chuk som in Thai; it is particularly delicious when she makes it with very fresh grouper. The clay-pot noodles, full of pepper and fresh ginger, are nicely done, too, particularly the one made with crab. When it arrives, take the shot glass that comes on the side and pour it over the noodles. It contains a rough, green sauce, like a salsa verde but with the ingredients you think of when you think of Thailand: minced garlic and shallots, fresh chiles cilantro, culantro, lime leaf, fish sauce and lime juice. Ms. Thongngoen calls it millionaire sauce. \"I named it after my husband,\" she said. Is he a millionaire? She laughed. In fact, she said, he lost \"almost a million\" in the restaurant business in Thailand, but when it was over he still had his family's recipe for the sauce.

It had opened in the summer of 2015, and while I'd enjoyed it, gone back on my own and even suggested it to friends, I also thought the food was the least interesting thing about it. In fairness, that was largely because other aspects of the place were unusually interesting. One of the owners is James Murphy of the band LCD Soundsystem , who, after getting New Yorkers to dance while articulating their discontent with the Bloomberg era, was looking for a second act. At the Four Horsemen, Mr. Murphy was responsible for the decision to pour natural wines and for the acoustic environment, which is as close to perfect as you could wish for in a small room full of people who've been drinking, some of them for hours. In retrospect, the arrival of the Four Horsemen looks like a turning point for natural wine. In the early days, people who chased down unfiltered, unsulfured and un-futzed-with bottles from Beaujolais's Gang of Four , Thierry Puzelat in the Loire Valley or La Garagista in Vermont were rare. These people were passionate in evangelizing for the winemaking practices they believed in, but their goggle-eyed radicalism could, at times, make you think of Bolsheviks with corkscrews. The Four Horsemen wrapped the movement's scruffy environmentalist and antiglobalist urges inside a sleek, cosmopolitan style that appealed to the kind of people who had dinner at 38-seat restaurants in Williamsburg. Just when apartment-design bloggers and Instagrammers had become obsessed with the warm, homey Scandinavian quality known as hygge , the Four Horsemen offered a hygge-rich environment, with burlap-coated walls and Opinel steak knives whose wood handles were the color of Christmas lights. Diners who had aged out of late-night dance parties, like the ones where Mr. Murphy used to spin records, could drink a chilled Brouilly while listening to his favorite albums played through a vintage McIntosh preamplifier he'd bought on eBay. In one sign of its ability to appeal to multiple demographics, the Four Horsemen must be the first natural-wine bar to get a review in Pitchfork . After a much-publicized opening, the compressed dining room in back and little horseshoe bar up front were packed whenever I looked through the windows on Grand Street in Williamsburg. The place didn't need my faint praise. It still doesn't, but the food I've eaten at the Four Horsemen since a friend suggested we meet there in October has been more sharply defined than anything I remember having in the early days. Over the past two decades, a style of cooking coalesced in northwestern Brooklyn, made from seasonal and local ingredients but generally built along the relaxed, country-French and Italian lines first laid out by West Coast restaurants like Chez Panisse . Now I am inclined to think that the current keeper of the flame for this style is the Four Horseman's chef, Nick Curtola. A weekend lunch just before Christmas was one of the most satisfying meals I've eaten in a long time -- thoughtfully proportioned, gracefully shaped, intelligently seasonal, quietly festive. The set menu, priced at $32, began with a delicious Waldorf salad, a phrase I've never used before. The celery was shaved to a translucent thinness and the walnuts were fresh enough to crackle, but the key to the whole thing was the mayonnaise, tart and lemony instead of sweet. There was also a potato gratin with a gold lid of baked Fontina and Taleggio on top that you could eat like a potato chip. The centerpiece of lunch was pot roast. These words will not quicken the pulse of many diners born after the Depression, but the pot roast in question was not the stringy gray substance often brought out after church on Sundays, apparently to prolong the period of atonement. It was an elegant, restorative braise of boneless short-rib bundles, thoroughly browned but pink inside, with red carrots and white Japanese turnips in an opaque broth from which every drop of fat had been skimmed. This was, of course, a pot au feu traveling incognito, and the Four Horsemen's by-the-glass list had a match for it, a cheerfully complex Beaujolais from Jean-Louis Dutraive. The menu ended with a yellow ball of eggnog ice cream with rum-spiked caramel and a flurry of sugar-cookie crumbs, a dessert straight from the pastry chef at the North Pole. (In fact, all the pastries are Mr. Curtola's.) The Four Horsemen had been open more than a year and had experimented with brunch before Mr. Curtola settled on $32 set menus for Saturday and Sunday afternoons. Many of these lunch menus have themes. Others simply make sense together. Either way, they are a welcome change from other, preposterously expensive tasting menus that just present a long sequence of dishes without a common thread. And the clarity of Mr. Curtola's cooking now is a welcome change from what I ate in the early days, food that struck me as smart and artful but a little somber. Before opening the Four Horsemen, Mr. Curtola had cycled through some leading European kitchens, including Noma's . Like a number of other local chefs at the time, he seemed to have fallen under the elegant but chilly spell of the New Nordic style. But he also spent several early years working in the smoke-scented, California-Mediterranean kitchen of Camino in Oakland, Calif., and two more later in his career at Franny's in Brooklyn. The forthright, rustic style of those restaurants appears to be reasserting itself now in the dishes on the dinner menu, which is \u00e0 la carte. Other influences are poking through the fabric, too. Peeled, cut-up satsumas are seasoned with sesame oil, cilantro stems, crushed Kampot pepper and pickled Calabrian chile, an electric combination that suggests Chinese cuisine without resembling it in the least. Leaning up against a mound of warm sushi rice, sea urchin and Spanish mackerel tartare are some toasted rectangles of nori, and if they remind you of rolling papers, you're right: you're being invited to make your own temaki . Coating the mackerel is a spicy mayo made with a home-brewed tribute to Sriracha. Vinegar slashes its way through fat and creamy Maine mussels, an unexpectedly alluring cold antipasto. Red algae, more appetizingly known as dulse , is smoked and crumbled over the tuna tonnato, a long-running favorite on the menu, made by spreading the creamy tuna sauce under a sheet of raw yellowfin. Any charcuterie shop would be proud of the supremely smooth and delicately pink chicken-liver mousse. The bread, dense and brown from house-milled whole wheat and rye flours, was good from the start. So was the wine. Justin Chearno, who is both the wine director and an owner, imported almost all of it from France and Italy at first. Like the natural-wine movement itself, though, he has enlarged his map of the world. He now extracts bottles from Slovakia, Australia, Texas and Canada, among other exotic locations. Some of the 650 or so wines on site are woolly and unkempt, others charmingly moody, and a few are models of propriety. Somewhere on the list may be one for you, but if you doubt it, you might ask about the unlisted beers. They're pretty interesting, too.

As you probably guessed, the Equinox Hotel is owned by the Equinox gym people, although they want you to think of them as more than that. These days they are also \"fitness-tourism\" people, with whom you can book a mountain-climbing trek, a surfing expedition or, if that sounds a little too close to nature, a stay inside a 1,000-foot Manhattan tower at the first of what Equinox promises will one day be a constellation of 75 hotels around the world. Rooms start at $700, which seems like a lot of money for a night in a part of town where some New Yorkers won't go during the day. But it does get you access to a spa, three kinds of pools, a herd of SoulCycles and a fitness center, or what I would call a gym. As of August, the hotel also has Electric Lemon. What made me think of that quote by Sartre, or whomever, was the music at the restaurant, which had a fast, insistent, mechanical beat. It sounded a little like the music you hear in those hotels with earth-toned lobbies and bars that call every drink on the menu a \"signature cocktail,\" but that music has more of an \"oontz oontz oontz\" thing going on, while the Electric Lemon playlist has a definite \"feel the burn\" flavor. The music isn't bone-pulverizingly loud, but it's dopey enough to become one of the factors that helps put Electric Lemon in the odd category of good restaurants where you probably won't want to eat. The restaurant is run by the restaurateur Stephen Starr's company, and as you already know if you've been to Le Coucou or Upland (to name two out of about three dozen Starr places), he knows how to find the right pieces and put them all together. That's what he does at Electric Lemon, where he seems to understand that many customers will not self-identify as fitness tourists, and that even those who do might be in the mood, after hopping off the treadmill, for a burger and a glass of pinot noir. But it's an uphill battle; the space seems to fight the restaurant that's trying to live inside it. There is a reasonably big wine list compiled by Natascha Patterer, the beverage manager. If she was daunted by the task of pairing bottles with cardio equipment, she doesn't let it show. She has corralled familiar names and styles, a lot of them from France, along with a few mystery guests. There are even a handful of bottles for less than $50. This is classic Stephen Starr anti-snobbism, and it's a refreshing change from the lists of those sommeliers who spend months trying to get a single bottle from some vigneron who doesn't have a phone and rides a donkey to work. As far as cocktails go, medical authorities have long debated whether a vigorous workout should be followed by a single, perfect martini or a whole row of them. The Equinox Hotel website seems to endorse the latter view, encouraging patrons to \"stop in throughout the day\" for \"a high-intensity series of martinis.\" The last time I had a high-intensity series of martinis it was followed by a high-intensity nap, so I passed. I can, however, tell you that Electric Lemon's bartenders shake up an eye-opening tall drink called a Bucks Bunny out of carrot juice, ginger and Armagnac, a combination that in other hands is likely to lead to explosions. If that sounds like more than you can handle, the website promises that \"an adaptogenic superfood latte\" is available. There's also a tightly coiled mezcal number called \"Kyle Knall, Y'all.\" The name does not evoke Oaxaca, but it does evoke Kyle Knall, Electric Lemon's chef. At his last restaurant, a likable, bourbon-scented spot called Maysville, Mr. Knall mined a Southern vein. In my memory, a lot of the food there was brown, or maybe it just seems that way in contrast with the psychedelic colors he slings around at Electric Lemon. Carrot diamonds jut out of a deep green cilantro-lime marinade for razor clams; sunny yellow broccoli flowers decorate a crushed-potato flatbread covered with grilled broccolini and a young sheep's milk cheese. Mr. Knall paints his plates with radishes, beets, gooseberries, cherry tomatoes and a garden's worth of leaves, and the cheerful palette can put you in a good mood before you've taken the first bite. The flavors are vibrant, too. Mr. Knall seems to have tweaked the dials so that every dish has some acidity or juiciness or herbal freshness, and nothing is especially fatty, either, which seems to be the extent of the kitchen's gestures toward healthy eating. The purple juices of roasted grapes fall over the sweet, scarlet threads of pickled aj\u00ed dulci peppers and heart-shaped mint leaves that decorate a plate of pan-roasted scallops. Small flying saucers of ravioli are stuffed with ground duck. You can even taste the crunchy, golden skin, although you can't feel it, because the filling is completely tender. It's delicious, but the flavor is very wintry and heavy until you hit one of the disks of crisp raw apple tossed with lemon verbena, and then everything lightens up. The kitchen is very good, but it isn't perfect. One night the halibut main course was moderately overcooked and my chicken was seriously dry and splintery. Kelly Nam's desserts are more modern-leaning than the rest of the food, and sometimes more than is good for them. There's a very strange one called the Chocolate Moon Rock that looks like cold lentils and carrots and tastes like an Aero bar. A less strange one that plays with lemon in different forms is called the Electric Lemon Curd. It's perky enough to embody the whole menu on a plate. But Electric Lemon's space takes any spikes of energy the food might cause and flattens them. It's an awkward, narrow area, and while the designers at the Rockwell Group have successfully made a lounge area that would be ideal for a low-key hotel in Las Vegas, the dining room seems to get away from them entirely. It's just a group of tables next to the elevator bank; if the restaurant were an office, this would be the team-building area, and nobody would use it. On one wall is a warped, wavy circus mirror that makes the room look as if it's melting. Meanwhile you're listening to a workout playlist that's probably not yours, or Sartre's, either. Maybe the answer is to wear earbuds. Conversation would be tough, but at least it would complete the gym experience.

It isn't breaking much culinary ground, and dinner there won't last much more than an hour. But its ideas about value are fresh, and it gets things right that other, similar places aren't even paying attention to. It opened eight weeks ago on Carmine Street in Greenwich Village with a considerable publicity push, and it seems to have grown more popular since. Most of the 39 seats are for walk-ins, so reservations are scarce. I've always gone without one, arriving just before the doors open at 5:30 p.m. Every time I return, the line outside seems to have started earlier and grown longer. A good part of the draw is that the menu reads as inexpensive. Temaki is the specialty, seasoned rice under a sushi-like topping, such as chopped yellowtail and scallions; each bundle is held together with a green-black square of nori. Almost all cost $5, $6 or $7, and you could probably make a light dinner out of five of them. Most people will probably eat more than that. They'll want to rummage through the appetizer menu, where some intriguing surprises are waiting, particularly the buttery miso-clam soup and the juicy squid fried in a batter shell that's as fluffy and light as a new down jacket. And they'll probably end the meal with one of the ice-cream sandwiches cleverly dressed up as temaki. But with a modest appetite or a minor act of self-discipline, you can keep your check under $30, before tax and tip. English-speaking sushi bars usually call their temaki hand rolls, although \"hand-rolled sushi\" would be a closer translation. Unlike the spicy tuna maki that are tightly rolled up with a bamboo mat and then sliced into six or eight tidy drums compressed inside a skin of nori, temaki are shaped by fingers and palms, without the aid of any tool. They tend to have a slightly loose, casual appearance; like silk scarves on the shoulders of Parisian women, their nori wrappers seem to have fallen into the right position by accident. Because of this, temaki also have a tendency to unwind themselves, which is why they are generally passed straight across the sushi counter, from the chef's hand to yours and from there, ideally, into your mouth. At most omakase sushi parlors that roll will resemble a small ice-cream cone, with nori serving as the cone. For some reason, New York's leading temaki bars use a different configuration: DomoDomo on West Houston Street, perhaps the first example of the genre, uses an open-ended cylinder that looks like the barrel of a gun. So do the Sugarfish spinoff KazuNori , in NoMad, and the Daigo Hand Roll Bar in the DeKalb Market Hall in Brooklyn. Nami Nori has a temaki construction style of its own. Each square of seaweed is not wrapped or rolled, but softly bent into a U. Warm rice runs down the hollow. On top is what in sushiland is called the neta, the main ingredient. Naturally, yellowtail-scallion is an option, along with spicy tuna, or salmon with avocado or cucumber. Like the California roll, these are well-prepared if a bit tranquil; any one will do if you want to see a familiar landmark at the table. The crab dynamite roll sounds as if it's in that category, but the mall-sushi favorite has been stripped down to its impure essentials: snow crab and tobiko mayonnaise, broiled and pinched together in nori to which grains of puffed rice have been stuck. Korea muscles into the striped-bass temaki with a fiery streak of chojang and a freshening garnish of slivered perilla leaves and daikon. China has made some exciting appearances, lending some XO sauce to the sea-scallop roll and fermented bean-chile sauce to a composition that distinctly evokes mapo tofu. It is one of several vegan temaki, including an irresistible one filled with eggplant pulp broiled with miso. A scattering of gobo chips on top serves the same function as the potato sticks on a Venezuelan hot dog. The temaki arrive slotted into individual wooden holders that keep them from unbending while in transit. Because restaurants believe that people can't consume food without explicit instructions, you are told to \"try\" to eat this square taco in two bites. Try? Take as many bites as you need. For me, it's three or four. The rice will be loose, barely held together by its own stickiness. And it will be seasoned by someone who knows the location of the spot where sweet meets tart. The nori will be so crisp that your teeth will slice through it like razor blades. This will be true whether you have a seat on a rattan stool at either of the two counters or at a whitewashed table in the front window. These are among the small pleasures a very good sushi counter reliably offers, generally at a much higher price. The three friends who dreamed up Nami Nori -- Taka Sakaeda, the executive chef; Jihan Lee, the chef de cuisine; and Lisa Limb, whose title is director of operations -- met when they were working uptown at Masa . One of the most memorable occurrences at that restaurant is the moment when a chef extends a U-shaped temaki filled with chopped toro and scallions to signal that the blizzard of sushi has come to an end. Nami Nori's founders have clearly studied the ways that Masa's attention to minor details like crisp nori and clued-in service contributes to its overall sense of luxuriousness, and they've managed to transfer some of that sense to a restaurant that's busier, less formally Japanese in design and less expensive. (To be fair, every other restaurant in New York is less expensive than Masa.) Of course, Masa also communicates luxuriousness through a nonstop flow of truffles and caviar. White Italian truffles can be added to any of the temaki at Nami Nori for an extra $20, and Kaluga caviar for another $10, as my server kept reminding me the first time I ate there. I was never given the hard sell again, which is lucky, because if it had kept up I would have started wondering how committed the restaurant really is to keeping cheapskates like me happy. Just because the prices are low doesn't guarantee you will have an inexpensive meal. This is what I think of as the Smorgasburg Effect, named after the outdoor markets where almost everything seems to be just a little too small to be lunch. I've spent more than $100 a person at Nami Nori, without the aid of truffles but with the help of alcohol and sea urchin. That was my choice, though, and one secret to the restaurant's early success is that it lets you make those choices. You can easily assemble a vegan meal, or a gluten-free one. Nami Nori is a hospitable place, built to be accommodating. They make you feel welcome, even when they're making you wait for a table.

By the time you've gone a mile, if not sooner, you'll have found every kind of taco that is consumed in New York on this stretch of road in Jackson Heights. Tacos are sold from the windows of takeout taquerias, from sit-down restaurants and bars with neon Modelo signs in the window, from the deli counters of convenience stores, from carts with vertical grills that roast spinning pink towers of marinated pork for tacos al pastor. The most talked-about tacos of the year, though, are sold from a white truck that pulls up each afternoon around dusk in front of an auto mechanic's unusually large and well-groomed parking lot at the corner of Roosevelt and 78th Street. When the truck opens for business, at around 5 p.m. on weekdays and about 1 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays, the men working inside will arrange a trash can, a plastic cooler filled with ice and bottles of Jarritos, and a handful of folding stools on the sidewalk. Signs on either side of the window, illuminated by a long strip of blue light, read \"Beefrria-Landia.\" In fact, the truck is named Birria-Landia . Birria is the filling in those tacos, the foundation of the other items on the extremely short menu, and the reason for the line that starts to take shape at the sidewalk-facing window each afternoon and that dissipates and rematerializes several times until the truck drives away, usually long after midnight. In Mexican culture, birria means different things to different people. To those not talking about food, it signifies trash, a mess, something you're better off not inspecting too closely. In the state of Jalisco, it also means a hunk of goat or other meat massaged with spices and cooked slowly -- formerly in an outdoor pit but these days, chances are, in an oven. Somebody from Zacatecas who hears birria will picture birria de res, beef stew cooked in party-size portions and served on plates or bowls. In Tijuana, and lately in more and more parts of Southern California, when you say birria, people are likely to imagine birria de res, but they will picture it on a taco . The birria at Birria-Landia is Tijuana-style birria de res, beef marinated and cooked in an adobo of hypnotic complexity. The meat, a blend of brisket, shank and top round, is rich and seems to grow softer as you eat it, like a square of chocolate. Chopped to pieces, it is folded into tacos, scattered over tostadas or sandwiched between facing pairs of quesadillas to make mulitas. If this were the whole story, Birria-Landia would still be a respectable addition to Roosevelt Avenue. But it is not the whole story, because Tijuana tradition decrees that the tortillas must first be dipped into the shimmering coppery beef fat that rises to the surface of the stew pot, then warmed on a griddle until they are pliable and electrifyingly red. This brings the birria's spices right into the tortillas, doubling the throb of dried, toasted guajillo and morita chiles, and the minor hints of cinnamon and clove that you can already taste in the beef. The fat dip must be one reason Birria-Landia stands out in New York City, where most of the tortillas could use a little help. Tijuana custom also demands pausing between bites of a birria taco for a sip of birria broth, known as consom\u00e9 and generally given away in a small paper cup. In Los Angeles, where birria de res tacos have recently become an obsession, many people take this an extra step and dunk their tacos into the consom\u00e9. This custom has taken off on social media, which has in turn fueled the rise of birria vendors such as Teddy's Red Tacos, which has one restaurant, two trucks and more than 100,000 Instagram followers . There is no error in dunking your tacos de birria or in keeping them dry, either. What would be a shame would be to miss out entirely on Birria-Landia's consom\u00e9, which is so flavorful and meat-laden it almost overshadows everything else. Whether through long simmering or quick reduction, the broth is about as thick as melted butter. True, they don't give it away. Some traditions simply don't travel to New York. But at $4 for a small cup and $6 for a large one, the consom\u00e9 is a worthwhile expense, particularly because it always seems to include a ladleful or two of meat. Forced to choose just one of the three other things on the menu, I would probably go with the mulitas, mostly because in New York a good mulita is hard to find. A mulita's two tortillas are not as crunchy as the one on a tostada, but they do have the benefit of fixing the beef in place with melted mozzarella. Inside the truck, griddling the tortillas, loading them with birria, splashing it with the sharp and essential tomato-tomatillo salsa, and making change for 10- and 20-dollar bills are Jos\u00e9 Moreno and his partner, his brother Jes\u00fas. They grew up in the Pueblan town of Coatzingo. Puebla is not known for birria. It is, however, known for producing a large number of New York's restaurant cooks, including the Moreno brothers. Jes\u00fas cooked American food -- burgers and so on. Jos\u00e9 specialized in Italian cuisine, working for the greater part of 20 years in restaurants including Lupa , Parm and Del Posto . Two years ago, Jos\u00e9 was sent to California to help open Eataly in Los Angeles , which is where he fell for the beefy charms of Tijuana-style birria de res. His favorite spot was Teddy's. He also drove to Tijuana several times to study at the source. When his turn came to cook meals for the staff at Eataly, he worked on his birria recipe. If it wasn't excellent before the Birria-Landia truck began rolling in June, it is now. The business is already changing in response to its popularity. People kept telling the Morenos that they needed to charge more, and last week they listened. Tacos and tostadas are now $2.50 each instead of $2, and a mulita, formerly $3, now costs $3.50. A second truck is also under discussion, too. A candidate for running it has already emerged. His name is Javier, and he is the third Moreno brother.

Luckily, it's easy to find advice on the internet. Well, not advice as much as rules. So many rules. For instance, Epicurious has \" The 7 Golden Rules of Friendsgiving .\" (Rule No. 3 is \"Sit on the floor.\") Chowhound sets forth \" 9 Rules for Planning a Perfect Friendsgiving ,\" including \"Use nature for your tablescape,\" which apparently you can do by spray-painting \"some of those fall leaves from outside.\" The Kitchn has \" The 10 Essential Rules for Every Friendsgiving Host .\" Rule No. 4, \"embrace technology,\" tells you to coordinate who is bringing which dish by using Google Docs or an online tool called Perfect Potluck . There are 10 Friendsgiving rules in Washingtonian magazine, too. The third, \"Buy bulk booze,\" also happened to be my own impulse when I saw a Friendsgiving article on Thrillist that lays down not rules, but commandments -- 19 of them, including \"Have (Extra) Toilet Paper.\" The good news about some recent Friendsgiving advice from the website Bustle: No rules! The bad news: there are \" 15 Books to Read Before You Host Friendsgiving .\" Among the titles on the syllabus are \" The Gift of Gathering: Beautiful Tablescapes to Welcome and Celebrate Your Friends and Family \" and \"Beautiful Boards: 50 Amazing Snack Boards for Any Occasion.\" By the time you have seen all 50 beautiful snack boards, if not long, long before then, you may ask yourself: How did Friendsgiving, originally a low-key, low-stress get-together with nonrelatives whose company you enjoy, become a bigger pain in the wishbone than Thanksgiving? This is not just a case of the internet making everything worse, although that is also true. Friendsgiving really is getting more complicated in the three-dimensional world. Because the event is gaining popularity and does not have a set date, Friendsgiving invitations can stack up; very popular people may attend two in one week or even one night. Many Friendsgivings are held on the weekends before or after the fourth Thursday in November, so some brave souls go home for the traditional holiday and travel somewhere else for Friendsgiving. Just as there are destination weddings, there are destination Friendsgivings. Guests will pay round-trip airfare and, if they don't stay with the host, the price of a hotel room or short-term rental. For each of the past six years, Barbara Bisoni, the president of a New York City company that sells engagement rings and other jewelry, has put together a Friendsgiving dinner in Paris. The first time, she was going through a breakup, and a friend living in Paris had offered her a place to stay. As a kind of hostess gift, Ms. Bisoni offered to cook an American Thanksgiving dinner. On the day of the meal, about 10 people showed up for turkey and sides prepared in what she calls \"the teeny, tiniest Parisian kitchen you could possibly imagine.\" When she did it again the next year, the guest list and the menu grew. They've kept growing. A friend from New York, \"an amazing cook,\" now comes with her to help make the food, and others come to help eat it. The local butcher, who has been asked to supply bigger and bigger turkeys, recognizes Ms. Bisoni. And before it closed, she was an annual customer at a store in the Marais, called Thanksgiving, that specialized in American ingredients. What the shop didn't carry, she packed in her luggage: cornbread mix, pecans, a turkey baster. While it's hard to feel sorry for the friends whom Ms. Bisoni invites for dinner in Paris, one can muster a little sympathy for James Norton's Friendsgiving guests, particularly because he lives in Minneapolis and has chosen to celebrate the day in February. Mr. Norton and his wife held their first \"Febgiving\" in 2008. \"I get a bit of seasonal blues every year,\" said Mr. Norton, an editor for The Growler magazine. \"So we thought, \u2018Let's take the best holiday and copy-paste it into the worst part of the year, and see if we can get friends to join us for a big feast.' \" For guests flying from out of town for Mr. Norton's smoked turkey and dulce de leche pumpkin pie, \"travel is a snap\" compared with November, he said. \"There are still a lot of logistics, planning and stress involved, but if you put it into February, it's an asset not a liability.\" For those who observe Friendsgiving in November, though, the stress remains. And, because people in their 20s and 30s have been the quickest to embrace the idea, Friendsgiving meals are often hosted by people who are relatively new to entertaining. This helps explain the rise of the rules and commandments, as well as Emily Stephenson's decision to write \" The Friendsgiving Handbook ,\" which Chronicle Books published in August. Ms. Stephenson is the gentlest of rule-givers. Apologetically, she advises a spreadsheet to avoid redundancy if the meal will be a potluck. The year she failed to do this, the feast consisted of 12 salads and five pies. Although Friendsgiving is \"more casual\" than Thanksgiving, she said, \"you still need advice to pull off a dinner for eight-to-however-many people you're having over. And a lot of Thanksgiving advice just doesn't apply.\" Articles about how to tell Aunt Marcia that nobody likes her green-bean casserole, for instance, are of limited relevance to the Friendsgiving host, given that avoiding Aunt Marcia is one of the points of the meal. Not having to weather familial microclimates, in fact, seems to free up vast reserves of energy that enable Friendsgiving hosts to prepare meals that would otherwise be exhausting. Fans of the custom say they throw themselves into celebrations because it's a chance for them and their chosen social group to invest meaning in a day with no prior significance. \"You're not taking over from your mom,\" Ms. Stephenson said. \"You are kicking off this new tradition for your friends.\" Bri Lurie, an epidemiologist who lives in Brooklyn, has survived her share of Friendsgivings. With a group, she rented a house on Long Island one November, and calls the expense \"the happiest money I spent all year.\" She has also passed several Friendsgivings at the home of a friend whose cooking tends toward the goofily surreal, like hot queso flowing in a punch fountain, or lumpia filled with turkey, gravy, stuffing and cranberry sauce. Ms. Lurie thinks that what might strike some people as Friendsgiving excess is just a reflection of cooking culture. \"We're all watching shows on Netflix filmed in high-definition video, and it's so beautiful,\" she said. \"So people are plating their food, and they're very cognizant of the source of their food.\" \"I'm sure it'll come around,\" she said. \"In five years, Friendsgiving will be only things out of a can.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

Mr. Portale was not the first chef at Gotham, but he took the job so soon after the restaurant opened in 1984, and kept doing it for so long, that when he finally left in May his name and its name were almost inseparable. It was Mr. Portale who lured Tom Valenti, Bill Telepan, Tom Colicchio and Wylie Dufresne to work at Gotham early in their careers. Gotham's first three-star review in The New York Times , from Bryan Miller in 1985? Mr. Portale was in charge. Its most recent review, three stars from Sam Sifton in 2011? Mr. Portale was in charge. The three other Times reviews in between? Always Mr. Portale. Always three stars, too. Anyone following a long-running success like that has two choices. She can try not to startle the horses by speaking softly and moving slowly. Or she can get it over with and shoot the horses. Victoria Blamey , who was hired to take over for Mr. Portale at Gotham Bar and Grill, shot the horses. In an interview published in September, speaking of the architectural plating style Mr. Portale was once known for, she said, \"no one wants to see that right now.\" The next day she let loose with a menu that buried every one of her predecessor's dishes (here's your hat, tuna tartare; what's your hurry, seafood salad?) under a heap of her own ideas. No question, Gotham Bar and Grill is in the Blamey era now. Loyal customers are going to have to get out or strap in. Ms. Blamey's new menu is not self-consciously avant-garde, the way Atera's tasting menus were when she was the sous-chef there, but it may be more original. It's certainly not like anything else around town. Her plating style is stark -- not aggressive, but a little severe and occasionally challenging. The flavors aren't like that, though. They're deep and enveloping; they tend to open and change in your mouth, and linger after you swallow, like wine. Take her ceviche. Normally, you know where you stand with a ceviche. You know how the marinade will change the seafood, how the seafood's juices will knock the edge off the citrus and how the chile fits in. The sea scallop ceviche at Gotham is a trickier character. The splayed-open scallops sit in a pale yellow juice that tastes of corn, first sweetly, like a fruit, and then not so sweetly. Then other things enter the picture, smoke and citrus and chiles. The scallops taste like scallops, so of course they're wonderful, but they've also been rolled in chile salt and each one has a pink dot of aged umeboshi paste in the center. There is more to the story, including some charred baby corn whose kernels are the size of poppy seeds, but it should be clear already that you will need to hold on tight if you are going to follow every twist and turn at Gotham. As anyone knows who has eaten the drippily sophisticated burger incorporating bone marrow and American cheese that she invented when she was the chef at Chumley's, Ms. Blamey has a way of using fat to underline her points. Most of the time, this comes off as smart rather than obvious. (With the burger, now available at Gotham's long, much-loved, pink-granite bar, it's both.) Try the Baywater Sweet oysters farmed in the Hood Canal in Washington State; they're creamy enough to bring on a swoon, but instead of the mignonette that might keep the fat in check, Ms. Blamey spoons a cauliflower and white chocolate pur\u00e9e into each silvery shell. Half vegetable and half candy, it even upstages the black pearls of caviar on top. Triangles of foie gras torchon under a translucent layer of black-truffle jelly are really quite fluffy and rich, even by the standards of foie gras torchons. So of course Ms. Blamey serves it with butter -- kombu butter, which goes so well with the warm kombu brioche. If the city's new ban on foie gras ever goes into effect, I already know one place where I'll stop to say goodbye. While the torchon will not win Ms. Blamey many fans among the vegans, the cabbage should. The warm, satiny leaves -- she uses the caraflex variety, tender and virtually ribless -- are dressed with sugary brown juice pressed from charred onions; golden pearls of fregola give the dish the heft of a main course. Although Ms. Blamey is quite clearly a cheerful carnivore, she turns vegetables into compelling events. She amplifies the smokiness of creamy charred Japanese eggplant with a lapsang souchong broth; her dal is made with coconut milk, mustard seeds, fried curry leaves and the care a good Indian cook would put into it. The legumes, though, are the dense, creamy red peas long cultivated by Gullah rice farmers on the Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia. The animals she does cook, and there are quite a few, are ones she believes were sustainably raised or caught from healthy populations. Tilefish, not popular enough yet to be overfished, is on the menu, under a thick coral pelt of caramelized sea urchin from Maine. Oregon Dungeness crab stewed with tomatoes and aj\u00ed dulce peppers, a twist on an abalone dish Ms. Blamey ate in Chile as a girl, is stuffed between layers of puff pastry to make a cross between an empanada and pithivier. Rabbit leg is braised in olive oil and an allium stock flavored with charred fig leaves and seasoned with fish sauce. I learned that later on, in a phone call with Ms. Blamey; at the time, I just knew that I'd rarely had rabbit as rich or as sneakily packed with flavor. The rabbit is served under black lentils. The lentils are augmented with chicken fat. The owners and Ms. Blamey have said they want to entice younger diners to give Gotham a try. Josh Lit, the wine director, does his part by adding five pages of fashionably noninterventionist, sulfur-phobic winemakers like Christian Tschida and Frank Cornelissen to a list that is already as long as a novella . There's a whole page for Joe Swick , a young Oregonian who calls his chardonnay \"Wyd? U up?\" and his field blend \"Only Zuul,\" a \"Ghostbusters\" reference that the list handily decodes with the hashtag #thereisnodana. The interior may be a sticking point in the youth campaign; it hasn't kept up with the pace of change in the kitchen. The walls were freshly painted and the lighting fine-tuned this summer before the new menu was unwrapped, but Gotham is still a time capsule of postmodernist restaurant design motifs from the 1980s, when vast loftlike spaces were automatically exciting. There is still some drama left in the theatrical, multilevel dining room; the parachute chandeliers that show off how far away the ceilings are; and the plants from the garden that press their leaves up against the back door as if they wanted to come inside. But it's not the kind of drama that translates well to Instagram, and so far the new crowd looks a lot like the old crowd. At first you might wonder why a pastry chef with more modern leanings hasn't been recruited. Then you eat Ron Paprocki 's desserts and you stop wondering. Who would wish for vegetable ice creams, shattered cakes and fermented fruit when we could be eating sticks of pain perdu under a crunchy caramel shell, or near-levitating souffl\u00e9s made from the red flesh of Ruby Prince peaches? Mr. Paprocki also makes what must be the greatest tarte Tatin in the city, a ring of apples in a state of collapse on a Frisbee of puff pastry stained with what always seems to be the right amount of burned sugar.

He isn't putting them together in the usual ways, either. The starting point of his menu is Nikkei cuisine, the hybrid style forged by Japanese cooks living in Peru, but Mr. Ramirez hasn't let himself get tied down by it. Certain Llama San dishes have clear Nikkei roots, but have sprouted into something new. Others seem to come from an imaginary Peruvian-Japanese world that Mr. Ramirez dreamed up. There can't be many cevicherias in Lima where the tart and spicy marinade for raw scallops and soft hunks of avocado is made from cherimoya pur\u00e9e. Ripe cherimoya, also known as custard apple, has the miraculous ability to taste like bananas, pears, pineapples and about six other, equally delicious fruits at the same time. And you could probably walk the entire Peruvian coastline without finding a hamachi tiradito whose leche de tigre -- the sauce that is essential in tiraditos as well as ceviches -- is a rich, spicy coconut milk soured with a squeeze of lime. If you added lemongrass and lime leaf at this point you'd have the beginnings of a number of Thai soups, but that's not where this is going. Llama San scatters a few puffs of matcha foam over the plate, between curls of fresh coconut. If you didn't already know that green tea, chiles, coconut and raw fish are quietly thrilling together, you do now. Up and down the menu are flying leaps like this, followed by graceful landings. Mr. Ramirez's confidence has grown since he opened his first restaurant, Llama Inn , in Brooklyn about four years ago. When news got out that he was planning to follow that initial Peruvian outpost with a sandwich shop called Llamita , I worried that his talents might disappear into the fast-casual sinkhole that seems to claim so many chefs these days. (As a budding empire builder, Mr. Ramirez, a native of New Jersey raised by parents from Lima, has at least one thing going for him, an irresistible logo of a llama in a bow tie.) That fear was premature; last summer, when Llamita opened, it turned out to be a more interesting proposition than it had sounded, with homestyle Peruvian cooking at dinner and a wine list that hews to the organic, biodynamic and natural creed. But neither place goes as far as Llama San, which slipped into its unmarked brick facade in September, taking its place between the tattoo studios and dildo boutiques that line the west side of Avenue of the Americas between Waverly Place and Bleecker Street. Sit at the compact bar in the front window, and the drinks menu you're handed tells you right away that this is not going to be a typical postcard from Peru. The Nikkei Martini includes pickled kombu and a \"nori pisco rinse\"; a drink called Flaming Creature, distantly related to an old-fashioned, is made with cacao and miso, and infused with smoke from palo santo wood; and the closest thing to a pisco sour contains matcha, green tea and coconut and is called Quiz\u00e1s, Quiz\u00e1s, Quiz\u00e1s, after the old Cuban song covered by Bing Crosby , among others. While Llama Inn draws all its wines from Spanish-speaking parts of Europe and South America, Llama San claims a larger piece of the globe by specializing in coastal regions: Provence, Catalonia, Corsica, Sicily, New Zealand and so on. And, as at Llamita, low-intervention winemakers are favored. The result is an idiosyncratic read, with potential discoveries on every page. Beyond the bar are two dining rooms. The front is more cramped than the rear, which spreads out a bit before ending in an open kitchen, but in either room the seats and the tables are so close together that you, or at least I, have to inhale to sit down. The d\u00e9cor is spare in a way that you might take for Japanese, particularly after a Flaming Creature or two. You might take the nigiri for Japanese, too, if they weren't topped with tender, plummy duck breast and a sweet mush of cooked banana with fresh cilantro. They come four to an order, but I could have eaten a dozen, leaving behind only the nasturtium leaves that cover them for no reason I could see. Peru has a chile for every occasion, it seems, and Mr. Ramirez knows which ones to use and when. The swirling heat of rocoto chiles, underscored by a sprinkle of togarashi, lights up a bowl of rice noodles outfitted with mushrooms and seaweed. Aj\u00ed panca, purplish and mild, brings some complexity to Llama San's tribute to an izakaya standard, grilled salt-cured mackerel. The same chile turns up in the cream sauce on lobster meat that is paired with an exceptionally fine grilled beef heart rubbed with a classic Peruvian skewer spice mix that includes oregano, cumin and dried aj\u00ed panca. Bright yellow and sunny, the aj\u00ed amarillo is crucial to the flavor of the walnut-thickened yellow sauce that douses a sushi roll filled with a rich stew of chicken thighs. This, in case you haven't recognized it, is how Mr. Ramirez interprets aj\u00ed de gallina, transforming it into a new form while keeping the qualities that make it a comfort-food staple in Peru. Aj\u00ed amarillo is also the secret of another creamy yellow sauce, this one a shrimp stock that turns what could be an invitation to boredom -- soft tofu stuffed with minced shrimp and covered with smashed potatoes -- into a really good time. The savory menu, printed on sheets of Japanese paper as soft as an old dollar bill, hops from success to success. Desserts are less memorable. I recall encountering three of them, and each one seemed to be some kind of semifreddo. I'm not sure Mr. Ramirez knows yet how good the food at Llama San is. If he did, would servers still describe it as \"a family-style, \u00e0 la carte restaurant?\" In any case, the assurance displayed in the kitchen gets a little shaky in the dining room. Every dish is deposited in the middle of the table, often one at a time, so four people may find themselves taking tiny forkfuls from a single plate as they try not to eat the whole thing at once. Repeat this routine for each of the two-to-three-dishes-a-person that servers suggest, and you might be there for hours. There must be a better way, but I am not holding my breath.

I may have to reconsider that, though, in light of how much good it seems to have done a sushi bar called Uogashi . When Uogashi's owners in Japan -- a seafood distributor, according to several employees, although the management has declined to confirm it -- decided the time had come to expand to the United States, they chose a location in the East Village. The space was deep, and the spare blond-wood interior featured a sushi bar along the right wall that had room for at least two dozen seats, starting near the entrance and running nearly all the way to the back of the restaurant. The populism suggested by all those counter seats was reflected in the menu. There were nigiri platters for under $50 and an omakase for less than $100, prices you might see in a neighborhood sushi dispensary with no special pedigree. Apart from the tuna, all the seafood was imported from Japan and seemed unusually fine for the price, although the slices were often two or three sizes too large for the rice, and the individual pieces were on the bland side. My meal at the counter wasn't quite exciting enough to lure me back for a full review, so I shuffled Uogashi off into a roundup of good values on the sushi front that I was writing. After that, Uogashi slipped my mind until last fall, when I woke up to the news that its building had nearly been destroyed by an overnight fire . At first there was hope that fish and rice would be reunited there one day, but eventually word got around that Uogashi had closed for good. Except that it didn't, exactly. With much less drama than attended its demise in the East Village, Uogashi reopened in January on a block of West 51st Street characterized by vintage tenements, low-rise hotels and restaurants catering to the theater-district crowd. The new edition does not appear, at first glance, to be an upgrade. The restroom, a short walk from the dining room in the lobby of an adjoining hotel , has a neglected, unloved feeling. The dining room is boxy, and the tables, which in the first location were partly secluded with rice-paper chandeliers behind hanging curtains, seem to have been wedged in wherever they would fit. The sushi counter has shrunk to nine seats, but still has to accommodate three busy chefs, just as the older, longer one did. The walls are decorated with oversize black-and-white illustrations of fish. The whole place looks as if it could be in the food court of an ambitious supermarket. It's much better than that. Akamutsu, known in English as rosy sea bass, is on the sushi menu now. If you get it, and why wouldn't you, it will be seasoned with a squeeze of sudachi juice and a few flakes of kombu salt, a firm contrast to the lush, pink-tinted flesh, whose oils have been made soft and creamy by a hot swipe with a chef's torch. Kohada has been available lately, too -- gizzard shad, a silver-skinned fish so small that it can take two or three to make one piece of nigiri. At Uogashi it has been briefly salted and vinegared, and has an effect that is something like eating a bite of pickled herring and chasing it with a gulp of very dry, very cold Champagne. Engawa is a fluke's dense and chewy outer perimeter, the muscular edge that sends the rest of the fish fluttering along the ocean floor. A little of that would be good to try, too. Short strips so firm they almost crunch will be piled over rice, seasoned with a dab of the spicy daikon paste called momiji oroshi, and finished with a tiny shard or two of sea urchin. The sushi chefs have had several varieties of urchin lately; you might want try the smaller, sienna-colored lobes of bafun uni from Hokkaido to compare them with the less-intense and creamier Murasaki uni from Maine. The prices are almost as forgiving as they were downtown. Most of the nigiri are either $6 or $8; more prized items such as chu-toro and shiro ebi, the tiny white shrimp that have to be pressed together by the dozen to make a single piece, are $10 each, and a small handful of rare treats like Japanese abalone and sea urchin are $12. A platter of eight pieces of nigiri and a maki roll, chef's choice, is $45, and comes with miso soup and a hot bowl of chawan mushi, savory and smooth. One night when I was sitting at the counter, I watched as two chefs assembled several of those $45 platters while simultaneously handing pieces of sushi across the counter to omakase customers paying $95 and up. The fish, the seasoning, the rice and the hands that put them all together were the same. Their names were Fumitaka Takeshita and Masao Matsumoto, and between them they have been putting fish on top of rice for six decades. For one of those decades, they worked side by side at one of the Sushiden locations in Midtown. Both Sushidens closed last winter, leaving those discerning customers who had appreciated their quiet, serious handiwork bereft. I doubt that more than a few of them have had the means to follow Nozomu Abe, the restaurant's most famous chef, uptown to Sushi Noz , where the fish is stored in insulated cabinets cooled by ice blocks, and a tasting menu costs $175 or $325. Noz is one of many cosseting, forbiddingly priced sushi parlors that have opened in the wake of Sushi Nakazawa , from Sushi Ginza Onodera to Sushi Amane to Noda to Uchu by Ichimura ; each new one makes Nakazawa's $150 omakase look more and more like the recession special at Gray's Papaya . New York may be losing Tad's Steaks and single-screen movie theaters, but at least it has lots of places where you can spend more than $300 on sushi. The low end is even more crowded, with unprepossessing neighborhood places sending out California rolls by the carton. What is harder to find, among sushi bars and many other types of restaurants, is the middle ground. That, though, is where you'll find Uogashi. All the omakases, including the entry-level $95 meal, start with an appetizer; lately it has been tsubugai, a whole whelk broiled and brushed with soy before being tucked back into its shell. The more you pay, the more varied and luxurious the courses become, but even the $95 omakase pauses halfway through for a cocktail glass nearly filled with chilled salmon roe and sea urchin. After a spoonful or two, it can be hard to remember where you are or who you came with. The peripatetic writer A.J. Liebling, who contributed hundreds of articles to The New Yorker, liked to say that he could write better than anyone faster and faster than anyone better. Uogashi, in its new theater district home, may be the equivalent in sushi terms: better than anyone cheaper and cheaper than anyone better.

There is the insistent smell of broiled dry-aged steak that hits me the minute I open the door and sometimes sooner, while I'm still outside on the South Williamsburg sidewalk, producing a raised pulse, a quickening of the senses and a restlessness familiar to anyone who has seen a tiger that has just heard the approach of the lunch bucket. There is the hiss of butter and melted tallow as they slide down the hot platter, past the sliced porterhouse or rib steak and their charred bones, to make a pool at one end. The server will spoon some of this sizzling fat over the meat he has just plated, generally with some line like \"Here are your vitamins.\" There is the thunk of a bowl filled with schlag landing on a bare wood table when dessert is served, and soon after, the softer tap-tap-tap of waxy chocolate coins in gold foil dropped one at a time on top of the check. And after I've paid, there is the unshakable sense that I've been scammed. The last sensation was not part of the Peter Luger experience when I started eating there, in the 1990s. I was acutely aware of the cost back then because I would settle the tab by counting out $20 bills; cash was the only way to pay unless you had a Peter Luger credit card. At the end of the night my wallet would be empty. Because a Peter Luger steak made me feel alive in a way that few other things did, I considered this a fair trade, although I could afford it only once a year or so. I don't remember when the doubts began, but they grew over time. Diners who walk in the door eager to hand over literal piles of money aren't greeted; they're processed. A host with a clipboard looks for the name, or writes it down and quotes a waiting time. There is almost always a wait, with or without a reservation, and there is almost always a long line of supplicants against the wall. A kind word or reassuring smile from somebody on staff would help the time pass. The smile never comes. The Department of Motor Vehicles is a block party compared with the line at Peter Luger. [ Sign up for Sam Sifton's Cooking newsletter for recipes, food writing and culinary inspiration. ] The management seems to go out of its way to make things inconvenient. Customers at the bar have to order drinks from the bartender and food from an overworked server on the other side of the bar, and then pay two separate checks and leave two separate tips. And they can't order lunch after 2:30 p.m., even though the bar and the kitchen remain open. Since its last, two-star review in the Times , written by Frank Bruni in 2007, the restaurant has started taking online reservations. It accepts debit cards, too, which is nice. But the credit card you use to buy a cortado at the cafe or a bag of chips at the bodega will still not buy you a meal at Peter Luger. The servers, who once were charmingly brusque, now give the strong impression that these endless demands for food and drink are all that's standing between them and a hard-earned nap. Signals that a customer has a question or request don't get picked up as quickly; the canned jokes about spinach and schlag don't flow as freely. Some things are the same as ever. The shrimp cocktail has always tasted like cold latex dipped in ketchup and horseradish. The steak sauce has always tasted like the same ketchup and horseradish fortified by corn syrup. Although the fries are reasonably crisp, their insides are mealy and bland in a way that fresh-cut potatoes almost certainly would not be. The sole -- yes, I'm the person who ordered the sole at Peter Luger -- was strangely similar: The bread crumbs on top were gold and crunchy, but the fish underneath was dry and almost powdery. Was the Caesar salad always so drippy, the croutons always straight out of a bag, the grated cheese always so white and rubbery? I know there was a time the German fried potatoes were brown and crunchy, because I eagerly ate them each time I went. Now they are mushy, dingy, gray and sometimes cold. I look forward to them the way I look forward to finding a new, irregularly shaped mole. [ Readers respond to the Pete Wells review of Peter Luger .] Lunch one afternoon vividly demonstrated the kitchen's inconsistency: I ordered a burger, medium-rare, at the bar. So had the two people sitting to my right, it turned out. One of them got what we'd all asked for, a midnight-dark crust giving way to an evenly rosy interior so full of juices it looked like it was ready to cry. The other one got a patty that was almost completely brown inside. I got a weird hybrid, a burger whose interior shaded from nearly perfect on one side to gray and hard on the other. The same issue afflicted a medium-rare porterhouse I was served one night: The fillet was ideal but the other side of the T-bone, the strip, ranged from medium-rare to medium-well. I could live with this; big cuts of meat don't always cook evenly. What gnaws at me every time I eat a Luger porterhouse is the realization that it's just another steak, and far from the best New York has to offer. [ Melissa Clark shows you how to cook a steak at home . ] Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, can put a formidable crust on both sides of the cut; Luger caramelizes the top side only, while the underside is barely past raw, as if it had done all its cooking on the hot platter. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, buy beef that is tender, richly marbled and deeply flavorful; at Luger, you get the first two but not the third. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, age that beef to make flavor grow and intensify and double back on itself; dry-aging at Luger still results in a tender steak, but it rarely achieves a hypnotic or compelling or even very interesting one. But those other restaurants are not Peter Luger, as Friedrich Nietzsche might have said. \"When in this essay I declare war upon Wagner,\" Nietzsche wrote in \" The Case of Wagner ,\" \"the last thing I want to do is start a celebration for any other musicians. Other musicians don't count compared to Wagner.\" I could say the same thing about other steakhouses -- compared to Peter Luger, they don't count. Luger is not the city's oldest, but it's the one in which age, tradition, superb beef, blistering heat, an instinctive avoidance of anything fancy and an immensely attractive self-assurance came together to produce something that felt less like a restaurant than an affirmation of life, or at least life as it is lived in New York City. This sounds ridiculously grand. Years ago I thought it was true, though, and so did other people. The restaurant will always have its loyalists. They will laugh away the prices, the $16.95 sliced tomatoes that taste like 1979, the $229.80 porterhouse for four. They will say that nobody goes to Luger for the sole, nobody goes to Luger for the wine, nobody goes to Luger for the salad, nobody goes to Luger for the service. The list goes on, and gets harder to swallow, until you start to wonder who really needs to go to Peter Luger, and start to think the answer is nobody.

It isn't hiding anything; its glass facade on Orchard Street wants to strike up a conversation so badly that it almost follows you home. The windows are stenciled with cartoon characters and with text-message bubbles that call out in English (\"Hello! New York\"), Spanish (\"que rico!\"), French (\"bon app\u00e9tit\") and Tagalog (\"masarap,\" for delicious). The language lessons continue on the front door, which gives translations for \"tuloy po kayo\" (welcome) and the restaurant's name (gossip), pronounced chiss-miss. In case you miss all of this, a sandwich board straddles the sidewalk, advertising discounted beer, wine and wings at the bar during happy hour (\"5:thirsty\"). If you accept the facade's invitation to benaquitodits (come here here, a repetitive bit of Tagalog slang), the conversation will continue inside. Tsismis, which opened in June, is a chatty restaurant. At times, when one of the owners pulls up alongside your table and expounds on how the chef's interpretation of the dish you're trying to eat differs from what you might find in the Philippines, you may find yourself eyeing the exit. If you've found your way to the menu's strengths, though, odds are you won't want to go anywhere. Kinilaw, a Filipino ceviche in a piercingly sour calamansi and cane vinegar marinade with a jab of bird's-eye chile, is worth sticking around for, especially on those nights when it's made with bay scallops instead of fish. After that, you might look into the fried pork-and-carrot won tons called pinsec frito (or, as the menu has them, pinsit frito). They are typically folded into triangles, but the ones at Tsismis are twisted into little cones that look like Hershey's kisses, though slightly bigger and golden-brown. Once they stop steaming, you can hold them by the cowlick of fried wrapper at the top and swish them around in the sweet chile sauce. Won tons with the same filling flop around in the soup called pancit molo, although these are boiled. There is almost as much ground pork inside them as outside in the broth, which is thick with garlic and chopped scallions. Even if it's well after 5:thirsty and you're not sitting at the bar, Jappy's wings are worth considering. Jappy is the chef, Jappy Afzelius, and he fries those wings with thinly sliced garlic and sends them out to the dining room with a salsa of raw mangoes, charred onions and chiles. The heat of the salsa will not cause your shirt to burst into flames, but it is hot enough to make your memory of Jappy's wings a lasting one. Mr. Afzelius is a native of the Philippines and a graduate of a cooking academy in Manila, which shipped him off to Paris to intern in one of Alain Ducasse's bistros. The Ducasse masterminds then sent him to work at Benoit in New York, after which he turned up as the sous-chef at a Filipino restaurant in Brooklyn that was best known for its $100 doughnut -- ube-filled, Cristal-frosted and gold-leafed. Happily, nothing at Tsismis approaches that level of look-at-me desperation. Mr. Afzelius's cooking is loose, unfussy and liberated. He tosses tradition under the bus when it suits him. The result is Filipino-American drinking food that tends to be charmingly offhand. From time to time, it can lean toward sloppiness. One night the fried milkfish in pritong isda was so overdone that even topping it with calamansi juice, fish sauce and a crisp, juicy spoonful of marinated chayote on top didn't revive it. A version of adobong manok, which Mr. Afzelius makes as a roasted chicken plus a soy-turmeric sauce rather than an all-in-one stew, would have been more successful if the smoked eggplant hadn't been so undercooked it squeaked. But the grilled eggplant on top of the kare-kare was as soft as warm marrow, and the other vegetables -- crisp green beans, bok choy, enoki mushrooms -- made a refreshing counterpoint to the stewed oxtails in thick peanut sauce. Already pungent with shrimp paste, the kare-kare comes with extra on the side that you can add to your heart's content. As they do at Bad Saint in Washington, probably the country's most talked-about Filipino restaurant, Tsismis makes its laing by simmering local kale, rather than the more traditional taro leaves, in coconut milk. And if this version doesn't have the perspective-altering funk of Bad Saint's, it still draws plenty of depth from the shrimp paste and smoked fish in the milk and the big handful of dried baby shrimp dropped on top. By this point, you will probably want to have a glass in your hand. Housemade calamansi soda sounds lovely, but mine was a little flat and weak. In lieu of hard spirits, sake is the backbone of most of the cocktails. They are typically fleshed out with half a dozen other ingredients -- vermouth, Aperol, artichoke liqueur and bitters, in the case of the A La Bira -- which sound at first as if they had been assembled by walking through a liquor store blindfolded, but which after a closer look reveal a degree of inner logic. If this does not pique your curiosity, the list of wines by the glass is almost long enough to qualify Tsismis as a wine bar, although the choices are not as outr\u00e9 as they are across the street at Wildair . In a city crazy for kakigori , patbingsu and other varieties of flavored snow, Tsismis's halo-halo will probably be an instant hit. Mr. Afzelius has the very good idea of putting coconut sorbet where the shaved ice would usually go; from there he goes to town with coconut jellies and what seems like every fresh fruit he can put his hands on. But discerning collectors of Filipino sweets should note that Tsismis serves excellent silvanas. A silvana is either a shrunken cake or a cookie with big ideas, depending on your perspective. It is made of two cashew meringues that are sandwiched together with buttercream and then painted with more buttercream, which holds cashew crumbs to the outside of the whole package. Once frosted and crumbed, it has to be refrigerated or the buttercream will melt before it gets inside your mouth. No gold leaf adorns the silvanas. It would only get in the way.

But I had not come across one that made as much sense to me as the big, sloshing platters you get at old-line Italian-American clam bars like Randazzo's until tripping into a new Greenwich Village restaurant called Babs this summer. Mind you, virtually the only Italian thing about the tagliatelle with clams at Babs was the tagliatelle. The sauce was a mustard beurre blanc, one of those French sauces that all culinary-school students are supposed to be able to make in their sleep. Mustard beurre blanc is often found providing a decorous yellow veil over a chicken breast or salmon fillet. It is not normally poured over noodles. But, tossed with salty French ham and Manila clams smaller than a thumbprint, it made a strangely exciting bowl of pasta that was much more coherent than it sounds. Once I got to know Babs better, I understood that strange excitement is what it does best. Its chef, Efr\u00e9n Hern\u00e1ndez, has talked about Babs as a European grill, and many of the dishes are seared over hot charcoal, but he has a wider frame of reference than that. He was raised in Southern California by immigrants from Mexico, and Mexican cuisine runs through his menu like an underground stream that sometimes gurgles up to the surface. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez is not particularly interested in fusion, though; as far as I can tell, he likes rubbing cultures together to see what color the sparks will be. See, for example, what the menu calls divorced sea bream, a handsome dish that would be splashed around Instagram even more frequently than it already is if the dining tables were lighted by ceiling pinspots rather than disco-era chrome globes that look as if they were salvaged from Regine's . The bream is split, and one side brushed with a red sauce and the other with a green sauce, before it is grilled over charcoal. The dish is an allusion to the two-tone pescado a la talla served at Contramar in Mexico City, itself derived from huevos divorciados, a breakfast of two fried eggs beneath two contrasting salsas. In Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez's kitchen, though, the red adobo at Contramar is replaced by a Catalan romesco, and the parsley salsa becomes a French pistou. But surely the tortilla on its own plate off to one side brings it back to Mexico? Not so fast. According to the menu, it is a taloa, a Basque cornmeal cake that cooks from Bayonne to Bilbao have been griddling for centuries. The taloa at Babs is tender, smooth and floral. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez has been cooking at Babs since it opened in July. He is also the chef at Mimi , a French restaurant a block away that is owned by the same people (Daniel Bennett, his brother Evan, and Louis Levy; they named Babs and Mimi after their grandmothers.) I haven't been back to Mimi since Liz Johnson was the chef . She was aiming for a style that was at once brawny and lavish, and since taking over last year Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez has seemed to continue in that vein while bringing his far-ranging curiosity to bear. As they did at Mimi, the owners have planted a small curved bar right by the door at Babs. The cocktails stirred and shaken there are mostly recognizable relatives of classics, like a martini made with two brands of gin. There's something charmingly self-deprecating about a cocktail list that includes Mount Gay and tonic, which seasoned barflies know as one of the drinks you can safely order in dives that don't do anything else right. The wine list, meanwhile, is mostly French and sticks to the old guard; you can tell it's not trying especially hard to be cool by the way it has just one orange wine, lumped in with the sparkling wines. Only the wine geeks will wish for more, but the rest of us might wish there were as many bottles costing around $50 as there are in the $90 range. The numbers on the menu can sneak up on you, too. My $48 lobster was a small creature that couldn't have weighed much more than a pound. The server brightly suggested dunking its tomalley into the smoked potato pur\u00e9e, and I would have tried it if I had found any tomalley. And while I can imagine happily paying $36 for Babs's lamb chops, I'd want them to be served with something more compelling than the cold, underseasoned \"Basque potato salad\" into which some baby sardines had apparently disappeared without a trace. But there is nothing wrong with the charcoal-grilled swordfish with mint salsa verde, fennel and green olives, and if you ordered the chicken andouille this summer you found Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez knocking cuisines together again, this time with a corn-and-chanterelles risotto under a slow-burning splash of Calabrian chile oil. He shows how well he can work in small strokes with a layered appetizer of raw sea scallops, sweet potato pur\u00e9e and trout roe, seasoned with a briny and fascinating salsa of chopped cucumbers, seaweed and fermented serrano chiles; or the fried cod cheeks, tender and crunchy over an orange slick of romesco aioli. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez's imagination fights against predictability. A crab salad, for instance, doesn't need to be interesting if it is fresh, but the one at Babs is both. It's seasoned with a gribiche that's full of chopped fresh dill, and then it's piled up in a big beehive on top of a smoked potato pancake. Like many small restaurants these days, Babs doesn't offer many desserts, but the ones it does are far more intriguing than average. A fine apple galette is improved by a grating of Swiss-style cheese from Edelweiss Creamery in Wisconsin and by a drizzle of 20-year-old Pedro Xim\u00e9nez sherry, thick as syrup and tasting like chocolate and coffee. Why sherry with Swiss cheese? I don't know, but Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez does. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

The ones that cared the most about upholding traditions, maintaining quality and so on -- like Totonno's , John's of Bleecker Street , Kest\u00e9 , Lucali , Una Pizza Napoletana -- emphatically did not. Today, we live in the era of the elevated slice joint. Some of them, like Scarr's , grind wheat berries into new flour every day. Many use minuscule quantities of yeast; others abandon commercial yeast altogether in favor of the natural leavening in sourdough starters. There are slice joints that ferment their dough for a day, some that let it bubble away for two days and a few that go in for three days. A new example of the breed, F&F Pizzeria , opened in Brooklyn last week with the help of a baker whose starter dough has traveled internationally and another baker who has decades of experience at the end of a pizza paddle. Among themselves, these new-school pizza makers speak of hydration levels, fermentation periods and digestibility. Many of these slice masters are chasing an ideal version of the foldable, portable triangle sold across linoleum counters in all five boroughs, a search suffused with nostalgia for an era before processed cheese, sweetened sauce and wholesale dough. Others are celebrated for achievements in the square slice, a descendant of the Sicilian, with an airier, less doughy crust; leaders in this style include Corner Slice and Mama's Too . Perhaps the smallest group of all are the bakers who turn their eyes toward Rome, where the slices are rectangular and are known as pizza al taglio. They resemble focaccia more than a $3 slice from Ray's , and it's doubtful that the practitioners of this style even think of themselves as belonging to the elevated-slice movement. But I'd argue that they do belong to it, and that some of the most elevated slices in the area at the moment are the Roman-style ones that Bread and Salt sells inside its bakery and restaurant on Palisade Avenue, up in the Jersey City Heights. At any given time, three to six pizzas sit on the counter. They are oblong and, because they are baked without a pan to shape the dough, they have rounded corners, like a horse track. The crust is noticeably lightweight when you pick it up, an impression that is confirmed by the mouth and, later, the stomach. The interior is honeycombed with air pockets. The underside of each slice is strong enough to carry a relatively heavy load of toppings without bending or collapsing. This structural soundness is key to the pleasure. The toppings on a Bread and Salt slice are not decorations or seasonings, as they often are on round pizza. Each one is the point of its slice: a mix of fresh mushrooms with pepper, parsley and flecks of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano; zucchini shaved into fine threads and showered at the last minute with mint leaves; slices of late-summer red and yellow peppers picked while they still had few faintly bitter streaks of green reaching up their sides; a rough, dark pesto spooned around cherry tomatoes that were roasted until their skins turned black and pulled away from the globes of pulp inside; Concord grapes that blotch the dough with purple like exploded jelly grenades. A chef's hand is at work here, tossing black pepper and rosemary over the grape pizza, adding salt and excellent Sicilian olive oil to the tomato pulp, and hammering basil and hazelnuts for the pesto in a mortar. The hand belongs to Rick Easton, who oversees the pizzas and the nonpizzas and owns the restaurant. He also owned its predecessor, the Bread and Salt that operated in Pittsburgh for all of 2015 plus a few weeks on either side. For a short-lived place, it got a lot of media attention, luring restaurant hunters and recipe gatherers from across the country. By the start of 2016, he had decided to move to New York City. When his first job fell through, he began shopping for a location for Bread and Salt. The real estate market had ideas of its own, as it often does, which is how the incarnation of Bread and Salt that Mr. Easton opened early this summer wound up in New Jersey. In addition to cheaper rents, Jersey City has ordinances that allow customers to show up with bottles of wine or beer and drink them, a handy policy because Bread and Salt's beverage list has nothing more potent than Italian sodas and sparkling water. Each night's menu, written in chalk on a blackboard next to the counter where you order, contains at least as many things that are not pizza as things that are. Generally these other items are modest in size and trattoria-ish in spirit; prepared ahead of time, they need at most five minutes in the oven before a cook will arrange them on a board and carry them to one of the 25 or so seats. I wish the tripe stewed in spicy tomato sauce, the way Romans do it, were available all the time. It is not, but the meatballs almost always are, and they are wonderful, made with enough bread that they are extremely tender in a bright marinara. Another reliable find is a sandwich of some kind, made with plain, untopped pizza. Twice I've had a warm mortadella sandwich there, and both times I was convinced there was no way to improve on it. One dish was denoted on the menu by a single word: beans. I've thought of it nearly every day since, partly because the beans -- scarlet runners -- were perfectly intact but perfectly tender; partly because of the brooding depth they took on from being finished with sweet red peppers that the kitchen dried and fried, an ingredient the Italians call peperoni cruschi; and partly because their broth tasted so good when given a chance to soak into the slice of thick-crusted sourdough bread that came on top. That bread is Mr. Easton's, too. It comes with a lot of things, and it is excellent. Bread and Salt is still settling into New Jersey. Some ingredients may be better when Mr. Easton has had time to infiltrate the local farm scene. In August, when the state was rolling in juicy peaches, he was serving crunchy unripe ones in red wine for dessert. There was also a very strange cantaloupe pudding. By September things were looking up; one day there was a scoop of Tristar strawberry sorbet served with anise-seed-flecked polenta gelato, both made by Superiority Burger. (Mr. Easton is friendly with that restaurant's owner, Brooks Headley , and helped devise the recipe for the focaccia Superiority Burger serves on Fridays.) Although Mr. Easton has a handful of employees, Bread and Salt has some of the blind spots of a one-person operation. It is not the easiest restaurant to communicate with, having an Instagram account but no website or phone. On a recent Sunday, when the restaurant was supposed to open at 1 p.m., a sign on the front door announced that it would be delayed until 1:30. That was the last communiqu\u00e9; the doors were not unlocked until 2. But Mr. Easton has a singular vision, and it is the reason the food is so compelling. Looking around at the place, you're not sure how it can keep going like this. But then the plates start to come out of the kitchen and you don't want them ever to stop.

At first, there was no reason to doubt him. That the man is comfortable with long time horizons was clear to anyone who watched how patiently he studied the science of indirect heat at his first establishment in the neighborhood, Hometown Bar-B-Que . After Hurricane Sandy flooded streets and knocked out power in the area shortly before the scheduled opening in 2012, he gave away smoked briskets, ribs and shoulders to local residents until electricity was restored almost three weeks later, honing his technique all the while. The years rolled by without a drumstick in sight. But as recently as March, it was still possible to take Mr. Durney at his word when he talked about the star attraction of his nearly completed fried-chicken emporium , to be called Red Hook Tavern. The doors were finally unlocked in July, revealing a row of tables under electrified gas lamps and a row of stools in front of a white-oak bar that looks as if it was built to last at least until Van Brunt Street sinks into the sea. Wearing wallpaper and wainscoting and pressed tin, Red Hook Tavern does a straight-faced impression of a whiskey-simmered New York corner bar of a certain age. The attention to detail was to be expected, given how convincingly Hometown conjures a Texas Hill Country barbecue palace. What was something of a surprise, though, was that chickens were not being fried anywhere on the premises. In fact, Red Hook Tavern's star attraction turned out to be a cheeseburger. To be fair, Mr. Durney probably would not have drummed up much enthusiasm had he gone around telling people he was going to open a bar that served hamburgers. New York has so many of those already that the style they typically serve is a recognized subgenre that George Motz calls \"the New York City pub burger.\" According to Mr. Motz, a filmmaker and author whose work explores all things ground-beef-and-bun-related, the hallmarks of a pub burger are a thicker-than-average patty and a relative lack of adornment. It is the plain, sturdy and hunger-calming burger you get at P.J. Clarke's , JG Melon and Fanelli Cafe in Manhattan and at Donovan's Pub in Queens. Mr. Durney has said that he intends the Red Hook Tavern burger as a homage to the one at Peter Luger Steak House . (You might think that Luger traffics in the style known as the steakhouse burger, but most burger taxonomists agree that what it serves, only at the bar and only at lunch, is a pub burger.) Like Peter Luger, Red Hook Tavern employs a toasted and buttered hard roll with a smattering of sesame seeds -- about as many as the stars you can see in the sky over Manhattan on a very clear night. In both places, the patties are made with some portion of dry-aged prime beef, stand about an inch and a half tall, and possess a dark crust that fills your head with the instinct-triggering aromas and flavors whose creation in browned meat was described by Louis Camille Maillard . There are some minor divergences. At Peter Luger, cheese is optional, while the top and sides of the burger at Red Hook Tavern are tightly wrapped in glossy yellow American cheese by default. A thick cross-section of white onion is laid below the top bun at Luger. At Red Hook Tavern, the onion is stationed below the patty, where it helps keep the bottom bun dry, like a coaster. They give you a half-sour pickle spear and fries, too, which are about the same dimensions. The important difference between the burgers, though, is that lately Peter Luger's have tended to be better in memory than in reality, while the Red Hook Tavern's is, right now, one of the few absolutely mandatory burgers in New York City. The kitchen is overseen by Allison Plumer, a chef who has done most of her cooking in Brooklyn. She has an excellent dry-aged steak -- New York strip, naturally -- impressively browned and served with a small cast-iron skillet full of creamed spinach, a touch so right it may qualify as art. It is the kind of detail that makes Red Hook Tavern something more than a place for the locals to get beer and burgers. Another is the golden chicken gravy with a hint of butterscotch that is ladled into a well in the mashed potatoes that come with the half-chicken, which is advertised as simply pan-roasted, although it has the wonderfully stiff shards of skin you get from weighting down the bird as it cooks. Everybody who has eaten at Red Hook Tavern will tell you to get the country-ham-and-Cheddar croquettes on a creamy pool of whole-grain Dijonnaise. Everybody is right, too. Consensus has also formed around the wedge salad, which is clearly not a wedge, but is still a very fine salad, with blue cheese and a thick, Lugeresque bacon slice flopped over individual leaves of romaine. There is considerably less unanimity about the roasted corn, kernels of which you are supposed to wrap in radicchio that you've first smeared with 'nduja; I'm in the camp that thinks it would be a fine dish for another restaurant. There is no restaurant where I'd be glad to see littlenecks steamed with way too much stale, acrid garlic. Of course, there's no correct amount of stale, acrid garlic, but the kitchen really goes all in. There are two desserts. Both are sundaes . They do not have the thematic inevitability of the creamed spinach, but they're put together with more sophistication than average. The truth is, though, that nothing on the menu gives the burger a real run for its money. What does, or at least equals it as a reason to reserve a table a couple of weeks in advance, is the list of drinks Mr. Durney has put together with Jeff Porter and Kenneth Crum. Mr. Durney's enthusiasm for wines made by small, eccentric producers is on view at Hometown, surely the only place on earth where you can drink Milan Nasterec's skin-fermented Moravian pinot noir alongside a taco filled with a slice of barbecued brisket and, in lieu of salsa, a glowing yellow stripe of queso. Mr. Durney indulges his curiosity more deeply at the tavern. Ten grower Champagnes can be had for under $100 a bottle, and there's a $40 sparkling red from Maryland. Darlings of the nonconformist wine movement such as Radikon , Marcel Lapierre and Frank Cornelissen are all given the space you'd expect, but there are also less familiar names like Subject to Change , a Forestville, Calif., outfit that has the peculiar idea of making a bright-toned, low-alcohol zinfandel-syrah blend and calling it Moon Juice. A small number of brews from Other Half, Folksbier and Threes Brewing, leading lights of the Brooklyn suds scene, are on tap, along with uncredited light and dark ales billed as \"A Tribute To McSorleys Ale House.\" McSorley's, famously, has you buy two mugs at once, which Red Hook Tavern doesn't do. It's less well known that McSorley's serves a burger. Like the one at Luger, it's only available at lunch. It is, of course, a pub burger.

When I asked where he wanted to eat, he answered, a bit wistfully, \"Somewhere that speaks of New York, a city I have lost touch with.\" At first, I looked for a place where we could be in the thick of it all. I thought of Bar Pisellino , that narrow glass sarcophagus run by Rita Sodi and Jody Williams, where you drink your sgroppino standing up between the window along Grove Street and the one along Seventh Avenue. People trickle in, eat some olives and a tuna tramezzino, and head out again. Although it's about the size of a subway car, you get the feeling that if you stayed long enough, you'd eventually see everybody you know. But a restaurant that truly speaks of the place New York has become over the past decade or so would be nearly the opposite of Bar Pisellino. This restaurant would not be in the thick of it all. It would be hushed, sheltered, exclusive, admitting no more than a handful of people at a time. It would protect those people, once they were inside, from crowds spilling in from the street, even from the street itself. It would join the steady march of new tasting counters and omakase hideaways. And it would illustrate the growing ease with which New Yorkers of means can glide through and above the fray, slipping from one cloistered room to another in black cars without touching down. That restaurant would be a lot like Frevo , which has been serving suave, $124 tasting menus with a modern-French sensibility in Greenwich Village for the past four months. Frevo is the work of Franco Sampogna, who is the chef, and Bernardo Silva, the manager. Mr. Sampogna is from Brazil and Mr. Silva comes from Portugal; they met 10 years ago while working in restaurants in France, and quickly decided that one day they would open a restaurant in New York City that would give diners \"that feeling of being in your own secluded safe haven,\" as Mr. Sampogna put it. To get into Frevo, you first need to know that Frevo exists. There's no sign. When you arrive at the correct address, what you see is an art gallery with just enough room on its white walls for the six abstract paintings that hang there fairly close together. The paintings are real paintings made by a real artist, Thomas Labarthe, who goes by Toma-L , but the gallery is not entirely a real gallery. If it were, the young woman who sits there keeping an eye on things would stare blankly ahead when you entered, instead of walking up to you with a smile and reassuring you that, yes, you've come to the right place. Then she reaches behind one of the canvases and it swings out on invisible hinges, leaving in its place a doorway through which you can see, illuminated in a large, dark room, a stainless-steel kitchen and a long, curving counter of polished quartzite. You hop up on one of the 18 padded seats, and the door clicks closed. You are in. When the door opens again, typically not for another half an hour, in will walk another set of people who, like you, knew that the gallery was not a normal gallery. Let's say that the misdirection of the gallery and the secret door do not make these newcomers feel sufficiently insulated from the outside world. Frevo gives them the opportunity to sit at a round chef's table in a back corner around which a curtain can be drawn, as in a hospital room. Much of this comes right out of the neo-speakeasy handbook, although Frevo does throw itself into the act with an unusual level of commitment. The gallery, for instance, installed a new batch of Mr. Labarthe's canvases around Labor Day. But each time I went to Frevo, I stared at that curtain. Nobody ever closed it while I was there, but it still reminded me how easy it is now for some New Yorkers to climb into the treehouse and pull the ladder up behind them. I have to admit, though, that I like Frevo more than I like the version of New York that it brings to mind. The pleasures of this secluded safe haven are real, and Mr. Sampogna's cooking is focused and refined. I haven't been able to get his halibut dish out of my mind, for instance. The fish rests on a thin, crisp platform of fried bread shellacked with a dark mushroom marmalade; this miniature mushroom tart drinks up the flavor of the halibut as it goes, in the oven, from raw to that just-cooked state where its flesh slides apart into thick and almost fluffy white flakes. Alongside the fish are bulbs of melted fennel, their spiced cooking juices boiled down to a bittersweet syrup. Mr. Sampogna's opening salvo often involves quinoa doing something quinoa doesn't usually do, and doing it quite nicely. I liked its freshness when it was used in a salad spooned over a demitasse of creamy hummus; I liked its crunch when it was dehydrated and sprinkled over a few mouthfuls of black lentils topped with glistening orbs of smoked trout roe. A dish from early July brought peas, at the tail end of their season, together with a rich pistachio-tarragon cream and white puffs of coconut mousse: light and charming. I wished Mr. Sampogna had exploited summer produce as sensitively when I went back in August and September. His kitchen is small enough that he could respond to the market day by day, but so far this doesn't seem to interest him. Frevo, at $124 for five courses, is not a huge splurge by New York standards, but servers try to inflate the total by pushing supplements. For $30 you can get Kaluga caviar troweled on to your first course; $20 gets you upgraded to a foie gras torchon instead of the less-thrilling mushrooms with gnocchi; it's $18 for a serving of aged Comt\u00e9 before dessert, and another $30 to have white truffles with the cheese. This tactic is not as grating as it is at Per Se , where the supplements are piled onto a base charge of $355, but it is still a snag in the otherwise smooth hospitality provided by Frevo's small crew of servers and cooks. Everyone I've brought to Frevo has fallen under its spell, which is hard to resist. The music is slinky and sinuous. The room has a nocturnal theatricality; sitting at the counter with darkness behind you facing the spotlighted kitchen can feel like attending an extremely elegant campfire. I still think Frevo is a perfect spot to familiarize yourself with the frictionless New York of 2019. Still, when my out-of-town friend arrived, we had our dinner at Bar Pisellino. We were hungry for a taste of the old chaos. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

In fact, dim sum is only a small portion of what the menu offers at Hutong, which opened in Midtown in July. But you would do well to make it a large portion of what you order, because only one or two other restaurants in town can plausibly claim to make dim sum that rivals Hutong's. Where else will you find cooks who have the dexterity to make Wagyu-beef mille-feuilles whose flaky layers of pastry overlap each other by only a few millimeters, like the feathers on a songbird's wing? Who can craft steamed buns that look just like shiitake mushrooms, which happen to be the chief ingredient in their filling? Or who knows the secret that allows the crunchy, chewy, charcoal-black mini-footballs stuffed with pork (in what is known in Sichuan as \"fish-fragrant\" seasoning) to sparkle as if diamond chips had been kneaded into the dough? There is real skill in the kitchen at Hutong. You see it most clearly in the dim sum, but much of the other cooking evinces the kind of discipline, precision and technical mastery that has rarely been seen in this city over the past few decades, to the dismay of eaters who know what Chinese food is capable of. \"While expensive French restaurants in New York can hold their own against many places in Paris, if you want to move beyond steamed dumplings and stir-fries to experience the complexity of Chinese banquet cuisine, the possibilities grow dimmer each year,\" Ruth Reichl wrote in The New York Times in 1998. She gave reasons for the poor showing, including talented chefs being paid more in Hong Kong and China. That is as true as it was 21 years ago, but what has changed is the rise of global Chinese restaurant groups, from the disappointing duck specialist DaDong to the surprisingly solid Hao Noodle outposts and, now, to Hutong. The original Hutong opened in 2003 on the 28th floor of a glass tower overlooking the Hong Kong harbor, but the dining room tries to conjure the atmosphere of Beijing's vanishing premodern alleys, or hutongs, by means of red paper lanterns, carved wooden doors and birdcages. The Manhattan branch makes a different impression. The entrance is on the east side of the circular driveway below the Bloomberg Building between East 58th and 59th Streets. Turn right and you are in a narrow hallway between two soaring glass stacks of wine bottles, every one of them for decorative purposes only. Turn left and you are in a glittering, soaring, hard-edge dining room. The inspiration seems to be Art Deco with a pinch of cocaine; the blue leather banquettes, beveled mirrors and chandeliers of mirror-polished steel could come from the set of a nightclub in some cross between \" Scarface \" and \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\" A guest who has lived in China allowed his eyes to adjust to the glinting light as he looked toward the ceiling, which seemed to be far away. \"It's very \u2026 yin,\" he said. Hutong is ostensibly a Northern Chinese restaurant. This is more apparent in Hong Kong than in Manhattan, where the menu has been pruned to about half the size. Lamb, a mainstay in the northern provinces, was represented in August by a single dish, cumin-speckled ribs roasted languorously to a mind-altering tenderness. By the time of my last visit, lamb had ambled off the menu entirely. The most famous preparation from northern China, Peking duck, arrived at my table worse for wear and tear, carved haphazardly, with blobs of unmelted fat clinging to limp skin. The second course, a dark-meat stir-fry to be folded in iceberg lettuce, was more skillfully done, but the sting of paying $84 for a whole duck with uncrisp skin lingered. Much of what hasn't been trimmed from the Hong Kong menu comes from Sichuan. So does Fei Wang, the executive chef of the New York branch, and a native of Chengdu. Most recently seen running the kitchen of the Hutong in London, Mr. Wang weaves chiles -- fresh, dried, roasted, pickled, name it -- into nearly everything. In the dish known as Red Lantern, the whole dried peppers the size of cherries are mostly decorative; fried soft-shell crabs are buried under the chiles in a pan with an arcing bamboo handle, like jelly beans in the plastic grass of an Easter basket. The ground spices on the crabs' shatteringly brittle crust -- lightly sweet and more aromatic than searingly hot -- may remind you of a Chinese rice-cracker snack you grew up on, or it may make you think of Old Bay. Fermented chiles provide an electric buzz, and a modicum of heat, to the steamed halibut that arrives boxed up inside a red bell pepper and sitting on a nest of rice noodles. (The pepper opens into a six-pointed star that gives the dish its name, halibut red star noodles.) Kou shui chicken is nearly submerged in an orange lake of excellent chile oil, although the adroit way the oil is balanced by rice vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger and other flavors is what gives Hutong one of the city's most impressive versions of this traditional cold dish. If Hutong has another appetizer that equals it, I haven't found it yet. I did, however, have a cryptic encounter with a log-cabin stack of okra doused in a sweet wasabi sauce, and an inconclusive rendezvous with some steamed asparagus stalks whose tips were enrobed in white sesame sauce; it was as if somebody had tried to replicate strawberries dipped in white chocolate without access to strawberries or white chocolate. You could attempt to unknot these mysteries. Then again, you could simply begin your meal with dim sum. And then, after picking your way through the chile-besotted main courses, you could end it that way, too. There is a dessert that mimics the shape of a steamed bun, pleated and twisted into a pucker at the top. It is made of white chocolate, the wrapper on this trompe l'oeil bao, and filled with white sesame cream and a core of bittersweet salted caramel. Alongside it is a single scoop of ice cream made from lightly sweetened soy milk. The soy milk is extremely fresh. I don't mean that the carton won't expire for another three weeks; I mean that somebody in the kitchen was squeezing the soybeans shortly before the ice cream was frozen. This is a snack from a Chinese childhood, bread and a glass of milk, and it would be hard, after several courses of spice, to think of anything more welcome.

He began with a counter in the Gansevoort Market food hall called Mission Ceviche ; there is now another in Canal Street Market and a third is supposed to open in Norwalk, Conn., later this year. At all locations, the stock-in-trade is citrus-marinated raw fish with sweet potatoes and kernels of chubby Andean corn, in both its soft and crunchy forms. This is of course the standard Peruvian formula, but Mr. Ch\u00e1vez had the inspiration of serving his ceviche in a clear plastic bowl over a base of salad, rice or, for a dollar more, quinoa. The supplemental ingredients make a plausible desk lunch out of a dish that some New Yorkers still aren't quite sure what to do with. The surprising thing about Mission Ceviche's salad bowls is that they taste like real Peruvian food. The raw fish is firm and cold and neatly cut up into solid pieces that hold their shape. The leche de tigre marinade in Mr. Ch\u00e1vez's \"ceviche cl\u00e1sico\" is a bright and precise cocktail of lime and rocoto chiles, although you might wish that the rocotos had been applied with a little less restraint. You get a higher-caliber shot of spice, this time from aj\u00ed amarillo chiles, in the ceviche mixto, a combination of octopus, shrimp and fluke enveloped in a creamy, goldenrod-colored leche de tigre. The cl\u00e1sico is accessorized with sweet potato pur\u00e9e; the mixto gets avocado pur\u00e9e, too. The pur\u00e9es are piped out of pastry bags like buttercream roses on a wedding cake, and they are delicious. When I wandered into the Gansevoort Market location in February, it seemed clear that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez could run an interesting restaurant if he ever decided to put his food into something other than recyclable salad bowls. Then, at the beginning of the summer, he did just that, opening a sit-down restaurant on the Upper East Side with real plates and bowls. The new space is not particularly large or lavish, but compared with the earlier efforts, Mission Ceviche Restaurant & Bar is a palace. There is seating for 65 or so people beneath a wall sculpture of a fish that glows from behind and a pink neon sign that reads \"tiger milk effect,\" probably a reference to the belief that drinking leftover leche de tigre can put extra topspin on sexual performance. The menu now paints a slightly fuller picture of Peruvian cuisine, extending into new foods including the grilled skewers known as anticuchos. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez dresses up the country's most popular anticucho, grilled beef heart, brushing it with a creamy rocoto sauce and serving it with newly fried blue potato chips and kernels of choclo corn. The trio of rocoto, blue potatoes and choclo is so solidly Peruvian that it can withstand the chimichurri that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez brings in, by way of Argentina, as a final touch. He clearly has a soft spot for chimichurri because he deploys it again with the shrimp anticuchos (the shrimp are very big and look even bigger because they're grilled with their heads on), served with a squirt of huanca\u00edna, the spicy yellow cheese sauce that is something like Peru's version of queso dip. My favorite anticucho is a more straightforward situation, grilled scallops under arugula, lime zest and a smooth Parmesan fondue. But Mr. Ch\u00e1vez has the ability to put several flavors in motion at once and keep his balance, as evidenced by the beef-heart skewer and his octopus causa. This is, reduced to bare bones, a tendril of octopus curled around a disc of mashed potatoes. But the potatoes, seasoned with lime and yellow chiles, are coated in a smooth lavender-colored sauce made from Peruvian black olives; the octopus has been rubbed with cumin, oregano and aj\u00ed panca paste and grilled to a crackle; the plate is decorated with a few wobbly curls of paper made with purple Peruvian potatoes. Mission Ceviche's servers, while eager to be helpful, have a habit of singling out the most obvious dishes -- the classic ceviche, the octopus leg -- and pushing them so hard you might suspect the rest of the menu is a minefield. It isn't. There is nothing to avoid unless the kitchen brings back the bizarre strawberry-kiwi ceviche that showed up as a special one night. If you are being herded into getting the \"Peruvian paella,\" you should know that the other three main courses are also worth looking into, like the aj\u00ed de gallina, shredded chicken breast in a creamy aj\u00ed amarillo sauce that is both soothing and spicy; or the seco norte\u00f1o, a slowly braised short rib in cilantro sauce. All are larger than average, too. Still, nothing on the menu quite rivals the ceviches. They are served, yes, without lettuce or rice, and they are better for it. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez's creative engine seems to have a high idle, and he has come up with different ways to present dishes that are also on the menu at the fast-casual counters. The \"Nikkei\" ceviche, for instance -- tuna in a kind of modified ponzu sauce seasoned with aj\u00ed amarilllo and togarashi -- now comes with watermelon and a bloop of ginger foam that would never survive a trip from the food court back to the office. Neither would the odd but intriguing attempt at a vegetarian ceviche where the fish is replaced by shiitakes and the leche de tigre takes the form of snow, frozen by liquid nitrogen. The art of ceviche-making has at least as much in common with mixology as with cooking, so it is no surprise that the cocktails are well calibrated and sing out with fresh lime. There is a twist on the pisco sour made with passion-fruit juice and another with the purple-corn drink chicha morada, although neither quite achieves the bracing elegance of the original. And it's nice to see the less well-known chilcano, a pisco highball made with lime juice and ginger ale. (Would ginger beer be better?) Chicha morada appears again in the raspadilla dessert. This time it is a syrup poured over shaved ice and sprinkled with lucuma foam. When I had the raspadilla, it was sprinkled with candied pecan crumbs but in a phone interview on Monday Mr. Ch\u00e1vez said he had replaced the nuts with crumbled Oreos. This, it hardly needs pointing out, was not exactly a staple in the diet of the Incas. \"What can I say?\" he asked. \"I just really like Oreos.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

The city is not yet in the same league as, say, Chongqing, where the dish is said to have originated and where an association dedicated to keeping track of such things says there are about 50,000 places to eat it. New York, by my count, has a mere two or three dozen, most of them in the sections of Brooklyn, Queens and Lower Manhattan that have considerable Chinese populations. But new hot pot restaurants seem to arrive every few weeks, with some independent operators among a growing number of chains from China. Downtown Flushing, Queens, has Little Sheep Hot Pot , founded in Inner Mongolia and one of the first hot pot purveyors in New York to move beyond the all-you-can-eat model, which led to widespread improvement in ingredient quality; Mister Hotpot, known among the city's pig worshipers for its creamy, ivory-toned pork-bone broth; and Liuyishou Hot Pot , a Chongqing-based concern where the spiced beef tallow that is an essential component of Sichuan hot pot is molded into the shape of a smiling, bow-tied cow. Farther south in Flushing is Niu Pot , the city's best hot pot establishment by several measures, including the number and complexity of its broths. Niu Pot cooks a very good winter-melon soup and serves it inside the melon's hollow shell, although it is most widely known for serving marbled slices of raw beef wrapped tightly around a Barbie doll , like a dress for Lady Gaga . In Manhattan, hot pot outposts have been planted along the Bowery in a line advancing toward Chinatown, starting with Zhen Wei Fang . If there had been a hot pot restaurant in \"Blade Runner,\" it would have looked like Zhen Wei Fang, an import from Miami that has private booths, simultaneous videos projected side by side on the walls and a robot host by the entrance. (Adding to the sense of a future gone awry, the robot wasn't working the last time I went.) A few blocks south is Tang Hotpot , probably the most luxe hot pot in the city. The menu is illustrated with still-life ingredient photographs that look as if Vermeer painted them, and the pictures aren't that far off from reality. Almost all of these emporiums offer Sichuan hot pot, a broth covered in a deep slice of chile oil in which dried red chiles, Sichuan peppercorns and various other spices churn around like the remains of toy sailboats after a hurricane. But Da Long Yi Hot Pot, which opened in May in a second-story space above Canal Street, has the advantage over most of its competitors of having originated in Sichuan. Its home base, from which more than 200 Da Long Yis have issued, is the provincial capital of Chengdu. Chongqing was administratively sheared from the rest of the province in 1997. Although you key your name into a touch pad at the top of the stairs to get on Da Long Yi's waiting list, and you learn that your table is ready from an automated text, you order by penciling an X on the paper menu, in a box next to the item you want. The menu also suggests the length of time each item should be held down in the boiling soup. It goes without saying that you will want a Sichuan hot pot at Da Long Yi. You will be asked whether you want it mild, medium or spicy, although in my experience there isn't much difference. A more important question is whether you will cook your meal in Sichuan broth alone; in a split pot with Sichuan broth on one side and either tomato or mushroom broth, neither of them spicy, on the other; or in a three-chambered pot with some of each. The narrow range of choices can be an advantage for a novice hot potter, who might be swamped by the maximalist menus at Tang or Niu Pot. The split pots make Da Long Yi a good place to take somebody with a low tolerance for heat, although as a practical matter it is impossible to eat a Sichuan hot pot meal without ingesting at least a spoonful or two of chile oil. Old hands know that the oil tends to pool away from the region of the broth that is bubbling most furiously, and ingredients that, after cooking, are removed from the pot in this area will emerge relatively clean. Whether this is desirable varies from eater to eater and from ingredient to ingredient. Deeply furrowed, folded or layered foods -- the Kungfu beef tripe spread out on a mound of chipped ice; the tofu skins; the fried dough sticks known as youtiao or, on Da Long Yi's menu, \"fried bun\" -- retain spicy oil in quantities that may become challenging. Extremely smooth items, like the hard-cooked quail eggs, the rabbit kidneys speared on a toothpick, or the long and surprisingly slippery tubes of duck intestine, on the other hand, can survive a trip through the deepest patch of chile oil without any appreciable damage. You can, if you like, follow the custom of Chengdu or Chongqing by focusing on ingredients that are prized more for feel than flavor. The duck intestines, for instance, which quickly contract in the hot broth and come out about 30 seconds later with the texture of barely cooked squid. Or the pale ivory sheets of flattened artery, which after cooking about twice as long have a long-lasting chew that reminds me of geoduck. On the other hand, more flavorful ingredients, once they've cooked for a few minutes, can help punch up the broths, which aren't quite as deep or complex as they are at some other hot pot providers. This does not apply to the lengths of corn on the cob, which don't taste like anything to begin with. And I would avoid the \"vegetable platter,\" which was more like a lettuce platter. But it is useful to keep in mind that if you toss sliced king oyster mushrooms, or crown daisy greens, or bands of kelp tied into knots, or even the Hershey's Kiss-shaped fish balls with gooey orange roe inside, into the soup and forget about them for a while, both the ingredients and the soup will rise to the occasion. Some ingredients, though, you hold in your chopsticks, watching for 30 seconds or a minute until you can see they're ready. The marble tiles of Wagyu rib are in this category, and the New Zealand lamb shaved as thin as prosciutto, and the Kurobuta pork belly from Japan. The whole prawns on wooden skewers will be tender and running with juices in just over a minute. The sweet, small flounder fillets might need twice that. Even if you are careful to pull these bites out in the bubbling center of the pot, away from the oil, the chiles and Sichuan peppercorns will catch up with you sooner or later. They build up on your tongue, they slowly infiltrate your dipping sauce, and the mala tingle will take over. There is no fighting it at that point, of course, though a bowl of white rice is a good investment in the future. And when conversation at the table has stopped completely, when the water you keep pouring into sadistically small cups won't help any more, there is one thing that will: fresh watermelon juice, sold by the carafe.

The cooking there is hard to pin down, geographically. Stopping in a few weeks ago, I ate Low Countryish wild red shrimp on grits, with sweet corn off the cob and a potent saffron-lobster sauce. More recently, I had skinless pork sausage inspired by sai ua, the spicy and tangy specialty identified with the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai. The soft tripe I enjoyed the other weekend had been simmered with 'nduja, the fiery and malleable Calabrian sausage, and then covered with a few thin shingles of shaved pecorino. If I had started hanging around at Foxface sooner, especially during the cold months after its opening, in February, I might have run into a wider variety of cuisines and main ingredients. I did manage to get some of the elk osso buco while that was still on the menu. I never got to try the wild hare, though, stewed in red wine with a bit of chocolate and thickened with its own blood, a formula that students of very old-guard French cooking will recognize as li\u00e8vre \u00e0 la royale. Nor did I make it in time for the venison, left to bubble for hours in white wine with mushrooms and dark juniper berries. The Foxface dish I may never forgive myself for missing, though, is the kebabs served with preserved lemons and tahini, because the kebabs were made from ground lamb and camel. Although these foods may lack any unifying cultural background, they did have one thing in common: They were all served on rolls. Apart from an occasional salad or soup, everything cooked at Foxface arrives in sandwich form. And with the exception of a muffuletta that briefly manifested a few months back, every sandwich at Foxface is filled with hot, cooked meat or seafood or vegetables. In Mexico, certain taco stands specialize in tacos de guisado, tortillas filled with one kind of stew or another. Most of Foxface's offerings are, in effect, sandwiches de guisado. Which reminds me of another impressive Foxface sandwich, a magenta and green tangle of cilantro stems and pickled onions pressed into an engagingly tart pile of pork, marinated in sour orange juice and roasted very slowly under a banana leaf in emulation of cochinita pibil from the Yucat\u00e1n. There is no guarantee that any of these items will be available when you go to Foxface. The menu is printed daily and taped up next to the window on St. Marks Place where most of the business is transacted. Sometimes a new sandwich appears after the printed menu has already been posted, so it will be written out by hand on a card that has in its upper left corner the restaurant's logo, a drawing of an elegant fox in cat's-eye glasses with a cigarette holder in one gloved hand. The sandwiches have names like It's What's 'Nside (for the tripe with 'nduja) or 120 BPM (bison heart with tahini and \"many spices\"). The Smoking Fox is sold every day. It is filled with smoked pork rib the color of a dry ros\u00e9, separated from the bones and covered with coleslaw, pickles and a few splashes of habanero-orange vinegar. Your mind, of course, goes either to Memphis or to the McRib , and neither is exactly wrong, but the meat is of a superior grade and is smoked with the attention to timing and nuance that characterizes Foxface's cooking. It's a great sandwich. To place an order, you lean in to the window and speak with Sivan Lahat, who owns and runs Foxface with Ori Kushnir, her partner in life and in sandwiches. They immigrated to New York from Israel almost 20 years ago and have lived here ever since, apart from a brief flirtation with the Midwest and a longer experimental period in Tokyo. While they were in Japan, they operated a pop-up restaurant, which is the closest either of them came to running a food business before opening Foxface. Like the fox in the logo, Ms. Lahat has coppery hair and wears cat's-eye glasses. She prepares the orders in the room behind the window, which measures 48 square feet. Inside the building, under the stairs, Foxface has a second room. Mr. Kushnir thinks it could be as large as 14 square feet. A variety of equipment is stowed in the two rooms, including three induction burners, a roaster, a smoker and a dishwasher. After business hours, some of it comes out as Mr. Kushnir supervises the more time-consuming roasts and stews. He describes the food that he and Ms. Lahat cook as \"dishes we like to eat, reimagined as sandwiches.\" I like to eat a lot of the same dishes, as it happens, but they have been hard to come by lately, especially those shapeless brown stews that are so out of style. Following some of the world's most influential chefs and shamed, perhaps, by the unflattering lenses of a million amateur photographers, restaurants have shifted away from plain and plain-looking cooking. The subtlety and the thrill of plain cooking comes from searing, simmering, reducing, skimming and so on. All the people who own Instant Pots know this, but the segment of the restaurant scene with artistic leanings has forgotten it, focusing instead on plating, arranging six or seven things in some photogenic design and hoping they will cohere. Slapping a roll on it is one way to get a shapeless brown stew ready for its close-up, although it has to be said that on the mean streets of Instagram, an elk osso buco sandwich is no match for a rainbow unicorn ice cream sundae. Because space is at a premium, there is no room to sit and eat your Smoking Fox at Foxface itself. You can, however, take it to a table a few steps away inside an adjoining business called the William Barnacle Tavern . This is a reassuringly gloomy bar that is said to have originated as a speakeasy. Model ships and other nautical paraphernalia are strewn about, references to the rumrunning operation a former owner of the building presided over during Prohibition. (The stairs that Foxface's dishwasher is housed below lead to an exhibition space called the Museum of the American Gangster .) The bar's current owner has resisted some modern conveniences. Most of the lighting at night comes from small candles, and all of the music is provided by old films -- of Irish folk recitals, Cab Calloway concerts -- that run in looping, watery projections on the back wall. All Foxface sandwiches are presented in a trim little white box that can be unfolded into a place mat. You can purchase an Italian fruit soda for $3 from Foxface, or buy alcohol from the tavern. The beer is not expensive, but the specialty of the house is absinthe. Most patrons drink theirs diluted with ice water poured from a four-spigot absinthe fountain at the end of the bar. The bartender will make absinthe cocktails, too, including the one Ernest Hemingway supposedly invented that is just absinthe and Champagne in a big glass . He called it Death in the Afternoon, and it is what I intend to drink if I ever get my hands on that camel sandwich.

Nearly every place Mr. McNally has built since then has been a firm rejection of all that is fashionable in food, and each one has been, at least in its first few months, the most fashionable restaurant in town. The one he opened in early June in the meatpacking district, Pastis , was assembled partly from the salvaged bones of a nearby restaurant he closed five years ago, Pastis. (He salvaged the name, too.) The onion soup, the meaty snails sloshing around in the divots of a black iron snail pan with what must be half a pint of garlic butter, and a few other old war horses from the original menu have been summoned for one more joust on the battlefield. In short, the new Pastis takes almost everything straight from the old Pastis , which in turn took almost everything from the stodgiest, least trend-conscious sort of French cafes and brasseries. Needless to say, reservations are harder to come by than at any other New York restaurant that's opened this year. The paradox of this is that Pastis is really meant for those nights when you decide to cancel your reservations at the little nine-seat tasting counter where the menu is inspired by Kieslowski's \"Decalogue.\" It is for those times when you get an urge to eat a Gruy\u00e8re omelet after 10 p.m., cooked medium-rare, flecked with herbs, skillfully rolled and staunchly backed up by a cold white from the Savoie. Urges like that do not typically announce themselves three weeks in advance, and they don't tend to survive exposure to rooms filled with people who have read about Pastis on the blogs but haven't yet figured out what it is for. For much of his life, Mr. McNally has been chipping, cracking, distressing and weathering interiors that are the architectural equivalent of rumpled sweaters two sizes too large. Perhaps the largest and certainly the most rumpled of all is Pastis. It doesn't have the corner entrance it had at its former address, or the long communal table that sliced through the front room like a surfboard. And the shelves of cigarette packs are definitely gone. ( You could still smoke in restaurants in 1999, when Pastis opened.) But the magazine racks are back, along with the overhead fans turning steadily below a stamped tin ceiling. Once again the walls are covered with chipped subway tiles, white, framed by black grout. The chairs still don't match. The ambient light is the color of a Scotch and soda and makes everybody look the way they do after you've drunk one. On an antique mirror, or one that looks like an antique, someone has scrawled a menu of desserts, almost none of which Pastis actually serves. You can, however, get an energetically whisked dark-chocolate mousse under shaved curls of chocolate, or a baba au rhum so drenched in booze that it might spontaneously combust if it weren't being restrained by a white dune of whipped Chantilly cream. The most significant change from the first Pastis to the second happened offstage. Mr. McNally, who had a stroke two years ago, has brought on the restaurateur Stephen Starr as a partner who, essentially, manages everything except the design. Familiar faces from La Mercerie and other Starr enterprises work alongside loyal retainers from the McNally empire. The McNally troops are exquisitely poised, self-assured, able to spot a misplaced butter knife from across the street. The Starr cadre is more casual, and occasionally a server will ask your opinion of \"the flavors so far,\" a question that has surely never been uttered at Minetta Tavern . Mr. Starr has oversight of the wine list, which is less conservative than a typical McNally lineup, and of the food, which has not been a strong suit of the McNally organization since the chefs Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr went out on their own. Pastis's chef, Michael Abt, was until recently in charge of the kitchen at the Washington restaurant Le Diplomate , which Mr. Starr owns. Better qualifications would be hard to conjure, given that Le Diplomate is essentially an imitation McNally restaurant. Taking his cues from the old days, Mr. Abt is putting out simple, unadorned, hunger-obliterating French cuisine drawn from the era before supermarkets and fast food. The salad of pickled herring and carrots with boiled potatoes might come straight from Brasserie Lipp . The country p\u00e2t\u00e9 is laden with chicken livers and riddled with soft white pork fat in gobs the size of gumdrops, although it could stand more salt, and I'd be happy to trade the slab of butter that comes with it for a pot of mustard. The p\u00e2t\u00e9 is made in house, as is the gorgeously smooth boudin blanc. With the boudin, you want pur\u00e9ed potatoes that are almost liquid. That is what you get. You might argue that, when it offers chilled king crab legs to be dipped in aioli, this unextravagant cafe breaks character. Does the same apply to garnishing sardines served in the can with an ingot of prized, costly butter made by Jean-Yves Bordier? Maybe. I thought, in any case, that the sardines and the olive oil they are packed in tended to talk over the butter. The half roast chicken is not in the same class as the birds that Antoine Westermann cooked when he was still at Le Coq Rico , but it is probably as good a roast chicken as any normal restaurant can produce. The duck in olives, though, is misconceived; the sauce is thin, acrid and one-dimensional instead of head-spinningly rich, the way it is at Allard in Paris . The seafood -- the trout amandine with its saut\u00e9ed skin taut beneath its armor of toasted almonds; steamed mussels in a lemon broth that's satiny with melted butter; an entire steamed branzino with enough crisp summer vegetables to make a salad -- is very appealing, though that won't stop the people who are going to get steak frites without even a glance at the menu. Those people may get fries that are crunchy and golden, or they might end up with a limp, oily batch, or they may get both in the same night, as I did. At the length of 20 years, memories are untrustworthy, but I'm reasonably sure the food at Pastis is better than it used to be. The wine is certainly more interesting. What's gone, and won't be back now that the surrounding addresses have been taken over by shops like Loro Piana, Sephora, Herm\u00e8s and RH, is the pure downtown electricity Pastis once generated. Sharing real estate with meat cutters in blood-smeared aprons and prostitutes in dresses as tight as the skins on a boudin blanc, Pastis did a drop-dead perfect imitation of the coolest restaurant in France. The French part was fake, but the cool was real. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

Rezd\u00f4ra doesn't. A few steps down from the sidewalk, on the same block of East 20th Street as Gramercy Tavern and the brownstone where Teddy Roosevelt was born, Rezd\u00f4ra lists a \"regional pasta tasting\" for $90 on its menu. The region in question is Emilia-Romagna, whose refinements in the art of rolling and saucing noodles are admired even by Italians from other parts of the country. Chances are that most of the five pastas in the tasting are exactly the ones you picture when you think about Emilia-Romagna, starting with tortellini in brodo. This would seem to make it an easy sell, and yet servers at Rezd\u00f4ra never tried to sell me on the tasting. Until I asked about it one night, I had never seen the separate menu card that describes each course. With some hesitation, I ordered it. Every one of the pastas was excellent, and one or two would be worth walking a long distance for. After the fifth course was gone, it slowly dawned on me that Stefano Secchi, Rezd\u00f4ra's chef and one of its owners, had just laid down a straight flush. The tortellini were penny-size hoops rolled around minced and blended pork in a parcel just big enough to suggest the idea of meat. \"This is a special broth made from older chickens,\" a server said as he poured a steaming liquid from a kettle over the tortellini. It was the color of turkey gravy. The broth spent about half a day on the burner; drew some of its power from melted Parmigiano-Reggiano; and was more intense than canned chicken broth in roughly the same way that a dry-aged rib-eye is more intense than a McDonald's all-beef patty. This was followed by a smooth, almost fluffy tomato-basil sauce over maccheroni al pettine, delicate tubes with ridges they get from being rolled by hand along a comb made for the job. Three straw-colored blobs that looked like melted Brie turned out to be a glossy and wonderful fonduta made from Parmigiano-Reggiano. From there it was on to tortelloni, each about three bites big, filled with plush fresh ricotta and shiny with melted brown butter in which a few sage leaves had been bubbled. If we are talking about Emilia-Romagna we have to talk about rag\u00f9, and that was the next course, tossed with slim ribbons of tagliolini. Some people will find the rag\u00f9 saltier than they like. Almost everyone will find it more tender and smooth than the last 20 or 30 rag\u00fas they ate. The tour winds down with round, meat-filled anolini, a branch of the ravioli family that resides in Parma. They are served in something called crema di Parmigiano; you will not be far off if you imagine an Alfredo sauce cooked for one of the more sybaritic Roman emperors. This is not Rome, though, and the sauce gets the tart counterpoint it needs from an inky, 25-year-old balsamic vinegar poured straight from the bottle. Mr. Secchi blew into town in May on a small gust of publicity whipped up over his time at Osteria Francescana , the Modena workshop where Massimo Bottura reconfigures the touchstone flavors of the region in dishes with names like \"memories of a mortadella sandwich.\" Mr. Bottura's approach to menu writing seems to have rubbed off on Mr. Secchi more than his experimental urges did. At Rezd\u00f4ra, you are unlikely to catch the kitchen using any overtly modernist techniques, but you may well encounter \"cherry season in Vignola,\" a pleasant if somewhat too soupy plate of stracciatella with toasted almonds, almond milk and cherries both sweet and sour; or \"cow grazing in Emilia-Romagna,\" a sirloin basted with butter whose richness is modulated by a sauce of sweet red peppers; or \"Grandma walking through forest in Emilia,\" a transfixing plate of mushroom pur\u00e9e, slivered snap-pea pods and little hats of spinach pasta filled with braised leeks. If we are tracing influences, though, Mr. Secchi's cooking at Rezd\u00f4ra seems to have been molded at least as deeply by his time working at the pasta station of another restaurant in Modena, Hosteria Giusti . Laura Galli Morandi, Giusti's chef, steadfastly defends the style of the local nonna tradition that Mr. Secchi channels in his pasta tasting and other parts of his menu. Like a meal in Giusti's four-table dining room, one at Rezd\u00f4ra can and probably should start with prosciutto and other manifestations of salted pork draped over warm pillows of fried dough called gnocchi fritti. Before leaving Italy, Mr. Secchi also cooked at Antica Moka in Modena and All'Enoteca in the Piedmont; after coming back home to Dallas, where he grew up, he ran the kitchens of two restaurants his parents own there. Still, I suspect the Bottura connection is responsible for the speed with which the bar stools fill up when the restaurant opens at 5:30 each night, for the difficulty of reserving one of the other 48 seats, and for the way would-be customers collect in eddies outside the door to strategize. Not much about the interior is likely to lure crowds; with its brick walls, timbered ceiling and bare wood tables, it looks like any number of Manhattan restaurants that emulate the trattorias, enotecas and osterias of Italy. And of course, people who eat at Rezd\u00f4ra have a way of becoming repeat customers. They come back even though it is still a young restaurant and occasionally makes a young restaurant's mistakes. One night, the stewed cannellini beans placed alongside black sea bass and black garlic zabaglione were still crunchy; the rock shrimp served with strozzapreti could have been a little less tough and tasted a little shrimpier. And some of the original pastas aren't quite as stunning as the classics, but then every grandmother in Emilia-Romagna could have told you that. Mr. Secchi is still one of the most appealing new talents in years to enter the city's Italian restaurant scene, the kind of cook who can unite ordinary people who just like to eat pasta and the fanatics who collect menus from Osteria Francescana. (The date-stamped copy of the regional tasting menu that's given out at the end of the night, signed by Mr. Secchi and his kitchen crew, must be for this crowd.) He also has the good luck to come along when some of the figures who dominated New York's Italian landscape for the past two decades or so have either disappeared or gone into hibernation. There is one more workplace that I hope has left a mark on Mr. Secchi: his parents' restaurants in Texas, both of which are called Ferrari's Italian Villa & Chop House . The first has been in business since 1983, a life span that any restaurateur would envy. The odds are against Rezd\u00f4ra's being around 36 years from now, but Mr. Secchi and his business partner have made one move that tends to be associated with longevity in New York restaurants. They bought the building. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

The tuna tartares start to run together; we can't recall whether it's served in lettuce cups with threads of shiso at Perry St. or at JoJo . At some point it's hard to recall what makes the chicken breast inside a resoundingly crunchy Parmesan crust at Nougatine different from the Parmesan-crusted chicken at the Mark. With his partner, Phil Suarez, Mr. Vongerichten has founded scores of new restaurants around the world. Nearly 40 of them are still up and running, 15 in New York. Devising menus for each new place, he repeats himself occasionally, but more often he rearranges old patterns. Lime juice is traded for yuzu, cherry vinegar comes in for balsamic. Almost always, the result is a dish that is similar enough to his past work to be recognizably Vongerichtenesque but different enough to seem fresh. Maybe he can keep track of it in his head, but for the rest of us it would be really useful to have a family tree of every dish he ever invented, with its parentage and offspring. Something like 23andMe , it could tell you which strands of kitchen DNA are shared by which Vongerichten restaurants -- 23andV. This service would come in handy in times like the present, when critics and superfans are trying to metabolize the two restaurants Mr. Vongerichten opened in New York City during a single week in May. One is the Paris Caf\u00e9 , a casual, all-day proposition inside Eero Saarinen's T.W.A. terminal at Kennedy International Airport, now gloriously resurrected as the TWA Hotel. The second is a polished seafood house that sits out in the East River on the end of Pier 17, next to the wreck of the old Fulton Fish Market; it's called the Fulton . Because I've been to both so recently, I can report confidently that the Fulton slices deep-red strawberries over strawberry ice cream and a sorbet made from strawberries and red wine to make its strawberry sundae, while the one at the Paris Caf\u00e9 substitutes dried strawberries. That version isn't bad, but there is an undeniable difference between fresh summer berries and dehydrated ones, and that difference suggests the quality gap between the two restaurants. The best reasons to go to the Paris Caf\u00e9 are Saarinen's glass walls, gliding curves and suspended catwalk, although the dining areas are swell, too, smartly evoking Raymond Loewy's original design for the space, which looked like a coffee shop on the moon. The place has some likable pizzas and salads, and it vaults clear over the other restaurants at the airport. But the recipes seem designed not to push the kitchen too hard, the menu is even more Vongerichtenesque than usual, and any dishes involving fruits or vegetables will make you wonder whether the produce truck drove to La Guardia instead. The Fulton, though, is a grown-up production. Under the day-to-day command of Noah Poses, the executive chef, it is easily the best seafood restaurant to open in Manhattan since the Pool , and easier to afford. Yes, a handful of items on the menu have that glassy-eyed stare, but almost everything else comes through. To get to the Fulton, you have to walk almost all the way to the end of the pier, where some tall planters cordon off the Fulton's outdoor tables. All the tables, indoors and out, have a view of the Brooklyn Bridge, but the best backdrops are inside and upstairs, where you can see that you're surrounded by water. Mentioning the view as a selling point will make some New Yorkers cringe. But Pier 17's developer, clearly hoping to erase the stigma, has recruited David Chang, Andrew Carmellini and Mr. Vongerichten. Day trippers and tourists will love the Fulton, in any case, and they will be right. True, the outdoor patio feels like the beachside bar of some island resort, with soft-core club music playing and servers carrying too-small trays slinking around in long skirts. Once you get inside, though, the tension in the open kitchen lets you know this is, in fact, New York. Running a seafood house gives Mr. Vongerichten an opening to lead with one of his strong suits, raw fish. The sea trout tartare is stirred with raw oysters and horseradish, which creates the uncanny momentary illusion that you're eating beef. White ponzu, made from white soy sauce, is the centerpiece of a platter of iced sashimi. Local fluke, taking a bath in habanero vinaigrette, is topped with mint and Sichuan buttons; even if you know what's coming -- Sichuan buttons are the flower buds of the toothache plant, which when chewed, produce a numbing and cooling sensation -- the dish is a surprise. The Fulton's Manhattan clam chowder is spicy, thick with potatoes and a healthy portion of clams. It's the rare version that tastes as good as it sounds, although purists will deduct one point for the absence of oyster crackers. There's a very intriguing sesame-poppy crust on the soft-shell crabs; you have just enough time to register the seeds before a potent green salsa of coriander and jalape\u00f1o kicks in. Few chefs are as skilled at using acidity, heat and salt to bring definition to a dish. So it's a surprise to realize how generic the Fulton's fish stew is, or to wonder what the ingredient is that throws the red snapper ceviche in watermelon juice out of whack. A separate menu card lets you know that most of the seafood in the main courses can be ordered \"simply cooked.\" I was never curious enough to try it, being too distracted by the salmon in a cumin-coriander seed crust so fragrant it turns heads; the sea bass and carrots in a life-affirming pool of lemon-turmeric sauce; and the detailed-oriented fish and crisps, a brick of flounder kept at scalding temperature by a leakproof and supernaturally crunchy buckwheat batter. Served with mashed fresh peas, it could almost pass for English if it didn't come with saffron aioli. Most distracting of all is the whole black bass baked inside a fish-shaped pastry lavishly decorated with golden scales, fins, gills and other parts the bass itself won't be needing anymore. It takes a good 10 minutes to unveil it, fillet it and then plate it together with slices of crust, some tomato concass\u00e9 and a sauce choron, and I doubt many movies playing in theaters now can rival it for entertainment. Wonderful as it is to see one of the showpieces of pre-nouvelle cuisine given so much attention, you could ask whether whole fish en croute really makes sense after, say, kale salad. Mr. Vongerichten's technical approach may let him generate a menu full of smart, reliably pleasurable food, but it doesn't guarantee that it will all hang together. The pastry menu does, though, by sneakily staying true to classic American desserts. What's sold as Meyer lemon pudding turns out to be more like a lemon meringue tart with a quick, pulsing acidity; the apricot pie is more like a crisp, with oatmeal streusel on top; and the highlight of the strawberry sundae isn't the fresh fruit but the strawberry ice cream, its flavor straight out of the summertime ice cream shacks in a thousand vacation towns.

If Darryl and Melissa Burnette had been able to afford to rent a space bigger than 275 square feet for their restaurant, Belle Harlem , Mr. Burnette might do the cooking behind a wall instead of behind a counter. Ms. Burnette, his wife and business partner, might spend all night going in and out a swinging kitchen door instead of paying attention to the customers sitting at the 12 seats in the restaurant's single room. At this point, after three years in business, Belle Harlem might be run by employees, and the Burnettes might come in a few times a week to keep an eye on things. Instead they have a paid staff of one. His name is Alex Geudelekian. He was eating dinner there one night, noticed that the weeds were growing up around Mr. Burnette's ankles, asked if he needed help, and has been the sous-chef ever since. The smell of foie gras gravy with duck breast being seared on one of the three induction burners might not rush up to meet you when you step through the door, on the opposite side of Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard from Striver's Row. You might not hear the hiss of chicken being fried inside buttermilk batter before it is arranged between standing partitions of pizzelle and tied together by an amber river of truffled maple syrup warmed with jalape\u00f1os and bananas. If you didn't hear the low roar of a Searzall torch as it warms a plate and then melts and browns a patch of Cheddar, you might not know that you're about to be served Mr. Burnette's cheese-steak crostini. (These are small toasts stacked with seared filet and melted cheese, and in between are onions that have been caramelized until they're sweet enough to be a dessert topping. The Cheddar would cause every Philadelphian who lives within 10 blocks of East Passyunk Avenue to pick up the nearest blunt object, but it makes a certain amount of sense when you taste it.) Some of Belle Harlem's space limitations are, in fact, a little constricting. When the place is full, some customers have to ride sidesaddle, their knees angled away from the counter, because if they faced it head-on they'd cut off the narrow path to the restroom in the back. But 275 square feet are what the Burnettes have to work with, and they have made this shallow sliver into something rare not just in Harlem but in all Manhattan. One of the peculiarities of dining in the city, circa 2019, is that the more high-functioning a restaurant is, the less likely you are to encounter a proprietor. There are exceptions, of course, but often the most successful restaurateurs are very busy people, so they leave their dining rooms in the hands of professional managers. Proprietors aren't always as smooth as professionals, but they are as attuned to what goes on in their dining rooms as new parents are to the noises coming from a bassinet. I never quite felt as if I were attending a dinner party in the Burnettes' apartment, which is the feeling they say they're going for, but I always knew I was in a place that somebody cared about. Their original plan was to feed everyone the same meal -- a tasting menu. \"We found out pretty quickly Harlem wasn't ready,\" Mr. Burnette said in an interview. How quickly? \"We tried one night.\" Belle Harlem rolled out an \u00e0 la carte menu the next day. It stuck. The first half is given to smaller plates, although one of the hallmarks of the restaurant is that the Burnettes don't serve anything truly small. They want you to eat. Two people could get away with ordering one main course and two appetizers, though I'd urge anyone going to Belle Harlem not to overlook dessert. These introductory dishes are where Mr. Burnette takes casual American vernacular food like chicken and waffles out for a stroll. His fried chicken has a convoluted, frilly crust, with plenty of golden surface area for the jalape\u00f1o-banana syrup to get lost in. The pizzelles are a new idea of his, replacing the regular waffles he used to make, and they work best when he cooks them to a dark crisp. This is also where you'll find the cheese-steak crostini, as well as spring rolls stuffed with macaroni and cheese -- kid food in a fried shell, yes, but a bacon marmalade with fresh dill makes it unexpectedly complex, a chef's dish. The bottom of the menu is more substantial: The pan-seared, smoked pork tenderloin, for instance, is bigger than what usually crosses a 12-seat tasting counter. This month, Mr. Burnette is laying the barrels of pork over a cherry compote with basil leaves, with a few snap peas for added sweetness. He brings a keen sense of what to do with ingredients as they come into season to the vegetables he grows on the roof of the Burnettes' apartment building, a block away. The tiny yields of an urban garden wouldn't satisfy a larger restaurant, but they can shuffle right onto the menu at Belle Harlem, and shuffle off again when they're all gone. This month, there are thin bands of zucchini under the beef tenderloin, and young, soft favas around the lobster salad. There are more favas over pan-seared dorade and garden chives, with the almost transparently thin noodles tossed with butter and cream and tucked under the fish fillet. Mr. Burnette, who is black and who grew up in rural southwestern Virginia, has said he worked up the nerve to move north for culinary school after seeing the chef Marcus Samuelsson on television . (\"I thought, hell, if he could do it, I could do it, too.\") Sometimes today, in his restaurant less than a mile away from Mr. Samuelsson's Red Rooster Harlem , he reaches back to his childhood for ideas. A dessert in a glass called the Triflin' Ho-Ho is an acknowledged homage to Hostess cakes, although there is an English trifle in the mix, too, as well as a trace of Spice Market , where Mr. Burnette once worked. The chocolate in the broken shards of cake pulses, intriguingly, with Urfa pepper; its heat rubs up against the passion-fruit cream, brandied cherries and whipped cream that fill the glass. A year ago, Belle Harlem eliminated tips and raised prices. If you take that into account, check totals can still seem high, especially if you happen to be served pale, limp housemade potato chips or a $42 duck breast with a bitter arugula sauce and a poached pear that tastes like alcohol. The margins must be tight. At times you almost hear them squeak, as when Ms. Burnette anxiously reminds you that you were a few minutes late and suggests you order quickly so she can turn the seat in time for the next reservation. A professional manager might have brought a more soothing manner to the exchange. But a manager might not be as genuinely happy to see a party of three walk in without a reservation just when three seats had opened up, and might not smile as widely when told that the sparkling ros\u00e9 is fantastic with the lobster salad, and would she mind pouring another glass? No, she doesn't mind at all. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

One of several operations he is running in the new Times Square Edition hotel, it is clad in paneling on the walls and ceilings. Velvet curtains and banquettes are the slightly alarming color of a blue macaw's tail feathers. Wooden blinds are usually snapped shut against the strobes of 47th Street and Seventh Avenue. To get to your table, you must first pass between two identical Champagne trolleys. An iced reservoir in the center of each is loaded with about half a dozen bottles that range in price from a Blanquette de Limoux for $26 a glass to a 2006 brut from Dom P\u00e9rignon for $66 a glass. Before you sit down, you've already learned that wine is front and center, literally and figuratively; that it is more likely to come from classic, mannerly European estates than, say, Macedonian villages still using amphoras that Odysseus drank from; that the ideal customer is not likely to get up and walk out upon being offered a $66 aperitif; and that the restaurant expects to attract so many of these customers that a single Champagne trolley is not enough. Which is to say that Marriott International and the hotelier Ian Schrager installed 701West on the 11th floor of the Edition for people who still think a leisurely, three-course dinner with a few interesting bottles and some of the customary niceties is worth spending money on. It belongs to a species of restaurant that is no longer in great supply in Manhattan, let alone on the intersection where the green neon of the Olive Garden faces off across Seventh Avenue against the giant candy bars of Hershey's Chocolate World. It also marks Mr. Fraser's first arabesques on the stage of formal dining since Dovetail closed last year. These are early days for 701West, but so far I've found the cooking more original and appealing than Dovetail's in its final phase. As you know if you've tried the fried-cauliflower buns at Nix, or the ramen-style boiled eggs at the Loyal whose yolks are red with a film of jellied chile oil, Mr. Fraser has a playful, imaginative streak. He needs it at 701West, where there is no real theme beyond wine and style. But there is enough creativity across the menu, on which he collaborates with the chef de cuisine, Rob Lawson, and the pastry chef, S\u00e9bastien Rouxel, to make dinner the engaging, somewhat eccentric experience it is clearly meant to be. Before the first courses appear, for example, there may be a \"cauliflower mille-feuille,\" the raw vegetable shaved into white sheets that are softened by chilled mezcal cream and then topped with sturgeon caviar. It's enticingly off-kilter, and another frequent amuse manages to outdo it: a spoonful or so of white-asparagus foam above a warm custard of sunflower-seed butter, dense and nutty and sweet with a few drops of honey. This is luxury dining in its way, which is not the predictable way. The menu proposes three courses for $98, but a server informed me that \"we also have \u00e0 la carte, if that's more your rhythm for the evening.\" Frequently the surprises come in the form of an unexpected tweak dealt to a vegetable. Slowly cooked in beet juice, a whole beet takes on the glistening ruby intensity of raw bluefin tuna. There is an appetizer of actual bluefin as well, and it has the precise, Japanese-informed minimalism of a dish you'd get at Jean-Georges, with tiny spring peas and young turnip greens and an electrifying white cloud of grated horseradish. In a dish of fava agnolotti, the X factor is the bright, almost effervescent sparkle of vinegar-marinated tomatoes and their juices stirred into a Parmesan-rind broth. There is one mystifying appetizer in which the dueling tidal flavors of sea urchin and squid-ink risotto are allowed to cancel each other out. For the most part, though, the plates don't overreach, for all the inventiveness on display. Asparagus dipped in aioli is a good idea, of course, but what if the asparagus has been steamed inside a wrapper of thinly shaved cedar until it is nearly as smoky as country bacon? And what if the aioli is enhanced by truffles? It may sound overworked, but it is such a thrill that one of my guests asked for another plate before we could move on to the main courses, throwing the rhythm for the evening right out the window. The night will pause again if one of the main courses is the sweet potato, as everyone tries to figure out where it got its creaminess and savory depth. Even once you know it's been sealed up and baked inside a little coffin of sourdough that is streaked with green threads of wakame seaweed, you still can't quite believe that all this flavor has been achieved with an ordinary sweet potato. Some of the large pieces of fish and meat are showstoppers on their own, like the lobster that rests for four days in aged-beef fat before being broiled and set over some jammy ratatouille. When they are not, something else on the plate usually is. The long slab of roasted duck breast dredged in powdered herbes de Provence would keep my attention even without its sidekick, a curiously likable risotto made from pine nuts. In the case of lamb, the firecracker is a cocotte of fresh, creamy cranberry beans. Mr. Rouxel, recently of Upland and the Clocktower, brings a lighter-than-air quality to the desserts. Hovering over a crunchy buckwheat pastry crust is a wavy sea of pastry cream infused with parsnips. It's earthy and ethereal at the same time. He even knows what to do with white chocolate, aerating it into a mousse to frost an English-pea sponge cake, and giving it a piercing sour-cherry sorbet as a foil. All seven captains working at 701West are sommeliers, listed by name on the menu; they are assisted by back servers who are sommeliers in training. This is one of those innovations in service that seems obvious now that somebody's actually doing it. The meal can become an evening-long conversation about wine; the sommeliers even invite you to play the wine-insiders' game of guessing the identity of a mystery pour in a black glass. It is slightly incredible that a restaurant that tries so hard to give wine equal status with the cooking does not have more bottles for under $80. That said, the ones it does have tend to be very good and fairly priced. Besides 701West, Mr. Fraser is in charge of the deep-dish focaccia, carrot Bolognese and \"billboard burger\" at the Terrace and Outdoor Gardens, which is open all day on the ninth floor. He also oversees the dinner-theater menus at the Paradise Club on the seventh floor, which is currently staging \"The Devouring,\" a neo-Burlesque extravaganza (juggling, sword swallowing, aerial acrobatics) purportedly inspired by William Blake. This was no doubt the destination of the stilt walker I nearly ran into in the lobby one night. Dressed in scarlet from head to heel, she got along faster on her stilts than I do on my own legs.

Realizing that this was somewhat ambiguous, especially applied to a dish as laden with stuff as the brew of lambs' snouts, ears, tongues, cheeks and eyeballs known in Turkey as kelle paca, I tried again. \"Is it very filling, I mean?\" My concern was a familiar one, to me at least. I was in Queens, at a new Turkish restaurant in Astoria called Lokanta , and the menu was so appealing that I wanted to try it all. Already I was set on a few bourekas, some labneh, the fava dip and some form of braised lamb over eggplant. I'd spotted another three or four dishes that I was probably going to tack on at the end of my order, as if by afterthought. I suspected that I could add a small bowl of kelle paca and still eat everything else. But a big bowl, one so thick with bits formerly affixed to a sheep's skull that a spoon would stand up in it, might tip the scale. The server pondered this for a while until a wiry man got up from his marble-topped table in the corner and conferred with her. Wearing baggy jeans, a white T-shirt and a baseball cap that kept his zinc-colored ponytail in place, he looked like a contractor, maybe a painter who'd come by to touch up the moldings and had been invited to stay for a Turkish coffee. Then he spoke to us about the sheep's head soup. \"I am a genius,\" he began. \"And even I don't know how to answer this question. I think that the question must be wrong.\" As those who chase the scent of lamb and charred eggplant around the city have probably guessed, this was no contractor. This was Orhan Yegen, the Turkish-born chef and restaurateur who has opened close to 20 Turkish restaurants over the past two decades or so while keeping up a running monologue that made him a favorite of food writers . In 2004, Mr. Yegen opened Sip Sak in Turtle Bay, then proceeded to surprise those who had charted his career by embarking on a long, stable period . All was quiet, relatively speaking, until April, when Lokanta arrived in Astoria to supplement the Greek and Cypriot menus along its stretch of Broadway, and Mr. Yegen arrived to tell customers that their questions were wrong. The kelle paca colloquy ended when I agreed to order it. After hours on the stove, the meat on the head had fallen away into about eight different textures, from frilly to ropy to collagenously chewy to tender and lean. All of this suspended in a slippery, almost sticky broth the color of cappuccino. And no, it was not too filling. Soups, braises, stews and other recipes requiring plenty of time and even more olive oil are the basis of Mr. Yegen's reputation. They set his menus apart from those at other Turkish restaurants around town, which tend to revolve around the grill. Lokanta makes very fine kofte, but for a full medley of minced and skewered meats, you are better off under the swaying chandeliers of Taci's Beyti on Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn. Lokanta will grill or roast a whole fish, but it will not be all that different from what might be served in Brooklyn at Liman , where your bass will be filleted within view of the fishing boats and swans of Sheepshead Bay. Diners in Lokanta's custody have signed on for a more nuanced view of the Turkish kitchen. Take, for instance, the shadings that lamb takes on. In hunkar begendi, chunks of it are stewed in tomatoes and peppers and ladled over an eggplant mash beaten to a memorable richness with cheese and milk. Ali nazik is, in schematic form, the same thing, built on the same foundation of milky eggplant, but in Lokanta's version the lamb is ground and simmered with onions and red and green peppers; somehow it achieves a rich, unctuous consistency that is amplified by the eggplant and the scoop of strained yogurt dropped on top. Lokanta's \"roasted lamb and rice\" is in the pilaf family, which means that the rice is not just a side dish but the heart of the recipe, baked until alluringly sweet with currants, allspice and cinnamon, then sprinkled with fresh dill at the last minute. The lamb's job is to be obligingly tender, and it succeeds, one reason the dish is requested by so many tables. To fend off boredom, I imagine, Mr. Yegen fills his manti with both lamb and beef. Each little dumpling is rolled by fingertip and is roughly the size of one. The meat has been seasoned just forcefully enough that it will announce itself, politely but clearly, as it breaks through the dough. It would be possible to sit down in front of a bowl of these, spooning them up with their warm yogurt and chile oil and dried mint, and call for another bowl a minute later. Of course, the meal should begin with strips of nigella-dotted Turkish bread and a spread or two -- maybe memorably creamy pur\u00e9e of dried favas; or the roughly mashed eggplant, smoky without a trace of bitterness; and one of the strained-yogurt dips, either the tangy cacik, laced with minced cucumbers, or the labneh, as firm as a new mattress. Either will prove useful as the meal goes on. So will a simple salad, especially the one with white beans and purple onions. The tightly rolled, golden bourekas are like skinny Turkish spring rolls filled with dill and melting feta. Cold poached leeks, a frequent special, are more appealing than the cold poached artichokes that have a permanent spot on the menu. If Mr. Yegen tells you that the grilled octopus is the best in the city, keep in mind that he rarely seems to leave his own restaurant. It's quite good, though, with a fugitive sweetness that may be supplied by the tomatoes and purple onions. Desserts run toward milky white puddings, nice if you are looking for a mild sedative. The baklava, imported from Turkey, is a treat for those of us who like pistachios and think sugar syrup makes a better baklava sweetener than honey. The unlikely champion, though, is the butternut squash that has been languorously baked in its own juices with nothing but sugar. The technique is one of those small tricks that helps Mr. Yegen's cooking stand out, like the perfume of lemon peel in the Turkish lemonade. Lokanta has no liquor license yet. Some customers smuggle wine through the door and keep the bottles on their tables, which are topped with radiant white marble from Turkey and surrounded by classic bentwood cafe chairs. But it is hard not to want the lemonade, which is cold and just tart enough and not very filling at all. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

TAK Room is so determined to be \"timeless,\" as Mr. Keller has often called it, that it seems clueless. TAK Room opened in March, one of 11 restaurants inside the 720,000-square-foot mall at 20 Hudson Yards. Parts of Hudson Yards are still under construction, but enough has been finished for most New Yorkers to figure out that this fistful of glass needles stabbed into the West Side wasn't built for them. Just as the helipad the city offered to build for Amazon crystallized anger about the cruddy state of our subways, the glittering new home on 10th Avenue for global luxury brands, investment funds, law firms, business travelers and hunters of seven- or eight-figure apartments spurred a lot of New Yorkers to ask, What's in it for us? Mr. Keller's answer is a restaurant that looks and acts like a millionaire's hangout in an old New Yorker cartoon. It charges like one, too, with adjustments for inflation. An eggplant Parmesan is the least expensive main course, at $30, followed by the New Zealand salmon for $42. After that, please turn off all electronic devices and place your tray tables in the upright, locked position, because we are going up to $66 and $75 before reaching a cruising altitude of $85. Look down there -- don't the people look just like ants? TAK Room's timing is off in other ways, too. Hudson Yards has stirred up New Yorkers' latent resentment of chain stores from beyond the Hudson, and what does Mr. Keller offer them but a clone of his restaurant in Florida, the Surf Club ? The name has been changed, but the menus are nearly identical; they glorify the strait-laced, spice-free food that rich white Americans used to feed on when nobody was shaming them into being adventurous. It is the food of \"21,\" of three-martini lunches, steakhouses and country clubs: prime rib and Dover sole, iceberg lettuce and oysters Rockefeller. Of course, being a Thomas Keller production, TAK Room serves the most refined, meticulous country club food you've ever seen. Most of it is very good, and a few things are so inexplicably delicious that you have the sensation of slipping the knots of gravity and floating an inch or so above your seat. The entrance is on the fifth floor, just past Neiman Marcus. But the action is on the sixth floor, up a Deco-cubist staircase so grand that you may feel a little underdressed unless you have Carole Lombard on one arm. (There is no dress code.) At the top, you find yourself in a lounge where a pianist and upright bassist glide through satiny jazz standards. Bartenders whip up streamlined, uncomplicated drinks that are either genuine classics, like the Pendennis Club, or modern drinks built along classic proportions, like the Tritter rickey, a tall, fizzy gin number that shimmies with absinthe. Around sunset, when pink light trickles through the western windows, it has to be the most pleasant room within a mile for fighting vainly the old ennui . They let people eat in this room, too, and it is tempting. But there is more to see, room after room, all laid out by the London interior-design firm David Collins Studio. There are leather banquettes deep enough to lose a small child in. Facing them are mohair-velvet chairs that swivel so you can quietly surveil the room without craning your neck. Each table gets a white linen cloth and a flickering oil lamp behind a white porcelain shade. The other colors are black walnut, midnight blue and law-firm green. At some point a captain in a crisply tailored suit will deposit the wine list. It mostly avoids the latest fashions, like a croquet party on Nantucket. Later there will be a preamble to the menu. Under the day-to-day care of Jarrod Huth, TAK Room's chef de cuisine, it has a continental theme and an \u00e0 la carte format. Highlights will be pointed out, and the prime rib will certainly be mentioned, as will the restored 1930s silver trolley on which it is ferried from table to table. Here comes a French onion dip surrounded by newly fried potato chips that are dark without a hint of charring. This is TAK Room in one extremely crunchy, lusciously creamy bite: an hors d'oeuvre from the age of Naugahyde and polyester, transformed into something so good and pure it's beyond reproach. The Parker House rolls are gravity-defying orbs served with soft cultured butter that, in the evening's best magic trick, rises from a custom-made dish in six identical ridged curls , like shrimp performing a Busby Berkeley routine. Bespoke flourishes like that are a TAK Room hallmark; see also the oyster crackers, like down pillows shrunk to the size of Chiclets, served with the silk-smooth New England clam chowder that is one of the most likable appetizers and, at $16, the best value. Another hallmark, though, is unevenness. Avocado Louie with a small bouquet of other vegetables is thrillingly right, thanks to a Thousand Island dressing that crackles with energy; the Caesar salad, made while you watch, has almost no personality. Grated Parmesan and anchovies vanish into it without a trace, along with dull croutons that could take some pointers from the oyster crackers. Something called \"warm soft boiled egg\" is a quietly joyous celebration of luxurious flavors and textures, the yolk running like lava over a buckwheat blin and a heap of warm osetra caviar in cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. (Yes, warm. It's wonderful.) And the chilled prawn cocktail is going to be my platonic ideal of the dish from now on. But the crab cake had very little crab flavor, on two different nights, although it contained almost nothing else. Lobster thermidor (now there's a name I've not heard in a long, long time) is so tender, its sauce so fluffy and rich, that eating it becomes an intimate act. Dover sole meuni\u00e8re, though, has neither the crisped skin nor the juicy flesh that can make this fish so alluring. Yes, life cannot be one giant plate of dancing butter-shrimp. Still, the gap between great and non-great items -- nothing comes close to bad -- is a bit too wide and comes into view a bit too often. Regulars will learn to work the menu the way golfers learn their way around the eighth hole at Pebble Beach. Some will love the prime rib, which could not be any more moist without breaking several laws of chemistry. Others will wish that it had more concentrated beef flavor and that the flaps and handles had not been trimmed off, perhaps in pursuit of some Kellerian quest for bovine symmetry. A large number will settle on the roast chicken for two. The meat is juicy but not gushy, the flavor full but not salty, the jus dark but not over-reduced. After the chicken, the pastry chef, Alex McClenaghan, can offer a highly refined coconut cake or an urbane lemon meringue tart, but you'd almost have to be insane not to get the chocolate cake. Certainly a close relative of devil's food cake, his version weaves dark-chocolate cremeux between its many, many layers, all of them wrapped in a dark-chocolate frosting. And there will be regulars, because the rewards of TAK Room, if you can find them and pay for them, are as intense as the chocolate in that cake. The core audience may turn out to be travelers on loan from the Surf Club and Mr. Keller's California strongholds, or they may just be people who like the feeling of crashing the country club. Anti-plutocrat fevers come and go, but the trappings of American aristocracy are always in style somewhere.

Banh beo, a species of small rice cake, are a favorite afternoon snack in the central Vietnamese city of Hue. Each one is steamed in a ceramic dish just big enough to hold a few spare coins. Faced with a platter of banh beo, you realize fairly quickly that you have essentially two choices: You can use a spoon, or hold the dish to your mouth and tip it up while throwing your head back, as if doing a Jell-O shot. If you go the Jell-O shot route, it may help to bring a pair of chopsticks or a fingertip into play at the last minute to encourage the banh beo to leave the nest. You have now transferred to your mouth a warm divot of steamed rice and tapioca flours that has a consistency like panna cotta's and a negligible flavor on its own. All the action is in the toppings. At Van Da, these include a spoonful of chopped scallions and the green oil in which they were sizzled, red rings of fresh Thai chile, some fish sauce, rehydrated dried shrimp and a flap of fried tofu skin, standing in for the pork rinds a banh beo vendor in Hue would use. The divot of rice cake is still warm, which helps the aromas drive their way into your head. It's over in a minute. If you're lucky, there will be another banh beo on the table so you can start over. Van Da joined the East Village's growing hub of interesting Vietnamese restaurants three months ago. Like Hanoi House , Madame Vo and Madame Vo BBQ , it is semitraditional and semimodern. Those two strains are embodied at Van Da by, respectively, Yen Ngo and Hannah Wong. Ms. Ngo, who owns the place, was raised in Dalat, Vietnam, and while she has worked in restaurants and catering in New York City for years, she has never had a chance before to show off the food of her childhood, like the banh beo steamed by her mother, who had grown up in Hue. Ms. Wong is the chef. Though she has cooked at Gramercy Tavern and Battersby , her background in the food of Vietnam before Van Da was more or less confined to the roughly two weeks she spent traveling there while living in Hong Kong on a Fulbright grant a decade ago. Nevertheless, she has put together a trenchant, concise and pleasure-focused menu of Vietnamese dishes. Some she learned directly from her boss, and on those recipes she was apparently discouraged from drawing outside the lines. Others are more freely interpreted. It's a credit to Ms. Wong's sensitivity that if you don't already know the original templates, it can be hard to tell where they end and her imagination begins. Banh beo and the other snacks from Hue that Ms. Ngo taught Ms. Wong get their own berth on the menu. As you'd imagine, they tend to be very good. Banh it ram are chewy, fried balls of mochi, filled with a coconut-soaked mash of mung beans and shallots. Banh khot are little rice-flour pancakes molded into edible cups about the size of a Ritz cracker. In Vietnam, the cups would be filled with shrimp. Ms. Wong instead spoons saut\u00e9ed mushrooms into hers, along with a crisscrossing of fresh herbs and a spill of coconut cream. Ms. Wong makes an effort to bring out regional differences in Vietnamese cuisine by devoting sections of the menu to Saigon and Hanoi, hundreds of miles apart, as well as Hue, somewhere in the middle. She doesn't have quite enough dishes from any one place to paint a full picture, but the project is intriguing. Like other New York chefs, she has been caught in the tractor beam of cha ca la Vong , the turmeric-and dill-scented fish dish that is a specialty of a 100-year-old Hanoi restaurant of the same name. Her version, though, supplies less dill, less sauce and less satisfaction than some others. Her two improvisations on the theme of Hanoi's best-known contribution to gastronomy, pho, are more effective. One gives you the soup without the noodles; floating in a rich and cloudy broth are ghostly white, billowing won tons that contain chopped beef fillet freely seasoned with black pepper. The other dish is, humbly enough, a plate of soupless pho noodles stir-fried with springy mushrooms, bitter greens and chopped scallions. Its simplicity makes the impact of the dish hard to explain until you learn that it has been showered with Maggi Seasoning , a soylike sauce that is the invisible secret of many Vietnamese dishes. Nodding toward Saigon, Ms. Wong makes a rendition of shaking beef by stir-frying tender and chewy marinated hanger steak with potatoes and then throwing a fistful of watercress at it. If you think that sounds like a French bistro plate, then you are starting to understand how her mind works. Ms. Wong cooks skillfully, with an appreciation for nuance, and she doesn't abuse her freedom by innovating pointlessly. It's possible, though, that she could stand to be less shy with chiles and herbs. The table salad of greenery to be wrapped around grilled shrimp offers no herbs other than mint and basil, and you'll run out of lettuce before the fourth shrimp has been dressed. The green papaya salad is a little too innocuous, and while her version of the street snack of grilled corn in fish sauce is a real success, fresh chiles would have more impact than the chile threads Ms. Wong balances on top. (Incidentally, the kitchen at Van Da makes a fine hot sauce that is like a milder and less acidic Sriracha, but servers never seem to remember to mention it until the end of the meal.) There are just three desserts. By the time you order, one or two may have been 86ed. With luck, though, the che will have survived. In Vietnam, che is thought of as a drink even though it can take the form of a pudding, as it does here, where warm pearls and threads of tapioca are cooked in coconut milk with cubes of soft taro. It is just sweet enough to qualify as a dessert. A black dust darkens the surface: black-sesame brittle, ground to powder. Even a single dessert qualifies as an impressive feat inside Van Da's tight quarters. Through the miracle of careful design, the space almost never feels cramped, but this is still an intimate restaurant. In the basement is a small seating area laid out as efficiently as the cockpit of a fighter jet; above it, at the top of a staircase, is an even smaller seating area sharing a room with a window-facing dining counter, the kitchen and a bar. The cocktails that roll off that bar, like the gin-and-celery duet called the White Tiger, are much more sharply drawn than the drinks at restaurants with twice the space and four times the budget.

No doubt it went through the same birth pangs as all the others. As far as I can tell, though, it simply materialized one morning this March at 70 Pine Street, and was open for business that afternoon by the time the financial district's elevators began disgorging traders, bankers and analysts in search of 5-o'clock refreshment. One reason it seems to have crept up on the city is that it's a large, well-capitalized, big-time restaurant of the kind that only established groups seem able to get off the ground these days. Yet Crown Shy doesn't come from Danny Meyer, Andrew Carmellini or any of the other usual suspects. Its two main players were recruited after talks among April Bloomfield, Ken Friedman and the building's developer fell apart in 2016, before accusations of sexual harassment engulfed Mr. Friedman. Crown Shy's chef, James Kent, used to run the kitchen at the NoMad , and his partner, Jeff Katz, is the managing partner at Del Posto . Neither exactly fell off the turnip truck last week. As a team, though, they're unproven, and as they went through construction and hiring, the drumbeat of publicity was more muted than it might have been if marquee names had led the project. Then there is Crown Shy's location, a sprawling, soaring, street-level space that, as far as anyone recalls, has never held a restaurant before. Many New Yorkers have seen the 1932 building's distinctive, hulking, pyramidal silhouette on the skyline, but until recently, when the offices on its 67 stories were repurposed as expensive apartments and hotel rooms, not many had encountered the frenzied exuberance of the lobby, which makes use of polished marble in at least five contrasting colors. It looks like something Bernini would have designed if he'd lived to see the Jazz Age. Depending on which entrance you use -- the revolving doors are crowned with aluminum reliefs of Art Deco flowers being pollinated by elongated stylized butterflies -- you may want to allow an extra five or 10 minutes to take it all in before you eat. Above all, it's the extent to which Crown Shy already has its act together that makes you ask: Where did this place come from? The whole operation radiates confidence from start to finish. The finish brings real desserts from a real pastry chef, Renata Ameni. She comes to Crown Shy fresh from Manresa, in Los Gatos, Calif ., and before that, she put in half a decade at Eleven Madison Park . Her desserts at Crown Shy look uncomplicated, and you don't realize how intelligently they've been put together until you start to eat one. There's a milky-white yogurt cheesecake under tender spring strawberries, with smooth strawberry sorbet in the center and a pistachio crumble sprinkled over that. Her chocolate tart gives her a chance to show off about half a dozen different effects she can work with chocolate, starting with a crunchy, crumbly, almost salty chocolate crust, moving on to a soft, souffl\u00e9-like filling and ending with curls of dark chocolate. Ms. Ameni's side of the kitchen is also responsible for the savory churros filled with Gruy\u00e8re sauce -- the menu calls them fritters, they taste like goug\u00e8res and the texture is something else entirely. Also her work: the miniature loaf of pull-apart bread that appears after you order. With dried olives on top and olive tapenade between every skinny slice, it is one of the most memorable parts of the meal. Even the obligatory scoops of ice cream that restaurants seem required to offer aren't allowed to leave her pastry station until they've been turned into a composed dessert, and not some kind of slapdash sundae , either. Satsuma ice cream gets to wear a toasted turban of marshmallowy meringue and some cracked honeycomb candy on the side. The effect is witty and delicious, progressing from purely sweet to bittersweet to tart and bittersweet. Mr. Kent's savory dishes pursue the same strategy. This is to say, they regularly over-deliver, starting with the iced Wellfleet oysters dressed with cucumber jelly, diced cucumbers, grains of jalape\u00f1o and microleaves of purple shiso. An almost absurdly creamy pur\u00e9e of white bean hummus under a fiery red slick of melted 'nduja is probably meant to be shared, but as soon as I'd tasted it I came up with other ideas, as my dinner guests will testify. Two tartares show Mr. Kent's talent for carrying bright new ideas with him into well-traveled territory. In the first, he laces hand-chopped raw beef with toasted walnuts and earthy rye croutons; in the other, chopped raw snapper is sprinkled with individual juice-filled vesicles of grapefruit, lime, lemon and orange that pop between your teeth, a kind of instant, interactive ceviche. Maybe one or two ideas should have been left by the side of the road. The chicken liver rag\u00f9 tossed with housemade cavatelli doesn't need to be so sweet with sherry; a rough pesto is a fine use for fresh chickpeas, but isn't there a better partner for it than shaved jicama? All is forgiven when Mr. Kent turns a mainstay like grilled chicken into a main course as exciting as the one at Crown Shy, which keeps the sunshine brightness of its citrus marinade, and is served with a pur\u00e9e-slash-hot sauce of fermented hot and sweet peppers. The vivid orange of that hot sauce almost matches the marble in the lobby. But Crown Shy's two big dining rooms and extended bar are a little more restrained, dominated by cream tones, blond wood tables, and chairs with saddle-brown leather seats and backs. The only echoes of grandeur are the enormous windows and the ceiling high up overhead. The wine list is one to get lost in. Finance wizards with bonuses to expunge can certainly do that, but it's great to see lots of bottles under $100 on almost every page. Anyone who knows what some of these wines cost wholesale will be able to locate any number of good deals, but even the unschooled will notice the value regions. They jump off the page: Portugal, Greece and New Zealand, for instance, along with vast stretches of Germany and pockets of Spain, France and Italy. With so many strengths, Crown Shy must have at least one thing wrong with it. And yes, it does. Obviously that name is ridiculous. Knowing that it refers to a tendency of very tall trees not to let their upper stories grow into their neighbors' branches doesn't help, either. But we should probably get used to it, because we're going to be hearing more about this restaurant. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and Pinterest .

The sheer number of restaurants in the city -- about 27,000, according to the health inspectors -- makes the argument absurd. How many of them are slipping? All of them? Just the first 20,000 or so? In reality, people who gripe about the state of New York restaurants are usually talking about a sliver of a slice of a fraction, probably around 50 places whose names are in steady circulation, with the newest weighing most heavily in the results. The number of really good ones is higher than anyone can count. Places that other cities would brag about get lost in the crowd here. The chef G\u00fcnther Seeger, for instance, was a national star when he cooked in Atlanta. The tasting-menu restaurant he opened in the West Village three years ago should have been a major destination, especially after he dropped the prices. Mr. Seeger can make ingredients bend to his will almost without touching them. His cooking outshone that of some of the city's more famous chefs, who whip their ingredients harder with far less payoff. Yet he struggled to put G\u00fcnther Seeger NY on the map. I reviewed it, but some other critics didn't, and by the time it closed, last month, Chris Crowley of Grub Street wrote , \"it wasn't a restaurant you heard a lot of food geeks talk about.\" Mr. Seeger complained to one acquaintance that he couldn't even get on a list of New York's 100 best restaurants. Of course, good restaurants fail everywhere, but it's hard to imagine Mr. Seeger vanishing into the crowd in San Francisco, Chicago or Los Angeles. Considered and rejected, maybe. But overlooked? Not likely. I'm not sure that any words of mine could have persuaded the city to cuddle up to Mr. Seeger, who isn't particularly cuddly. But I wish I'd found ways to remind New Yorkers that his breathtakingly pure cooking was there to be enjoyed while that was still true. Which brings us, by a circuitous and not particularly well-paved route, to Anthony Mangieri of Una Pizza Napoletana . Using naturally leavened dough and a short shopping list of ingredients, Mr. Mangieri makes what is unmistakably the finest sit-down pizza in the five boroughs. (I doubt he has any rivals in the stand-up joints, either, but slice pizza is a different game.) Two years ago, I posited that Razza, a pizzeria in Jersey City, made \"the best pizza in New York.\" I don't regret writing that, but I would like to point out that Mr. Mangieri was not cooking in the city at the time and that Razza's chef, Dan Richer, has said that he began taking pizza seriously only after he met Mr. Mangieri. Una Pizza Napoletana saw a rush of curious pie-eaters after it opened on Orchard Street a little more than a year ago. But the last few times I've gone, there were too many unclaimed chairs and bar stools. When Anthony Mangieri is making pizza, the right number of empty seats is zero, as any New Yorker who waited in line at the old Una Pizza Napoletana, in the East Village from 2004 to 2009, could tell you. Press interest in the new place has died down, too. So when I heard a rumor that Mr. Mangieri was thinking of leaving the city and taking his pizza with him, I was unnerved, to put it mildly. Asked about it, he told me he was considering it but hadn't made up his mind. Mr. Mangieri has left New York before, and I didn't like it then, either. This time, I wasn't going to let him get away without a fight. It is true that my review of Una Pizza Napoletana last year was decidedly mixed. It is also true, though, that almost every criticism I made has been addressed. It has gone from one of the most confounding pizzerias in the city to one of the most enjoyable. The problem with Una Pizza a year ago was that it was trying to be two things at once. It was, of course, a Neapolitan pizzeria, serving classic, unadorned pies baked for about two minutes inside a wood-burning oven shaped like an igloo. But it was also a cutting-edge Lower East Side experiment. At the instigation of Mr. Mangieri's partners, the chefs Fabian von Hauske Valtierra and Jeremiah Stone, the kitchen brought forth appetizers that had rarely if ever been asked to live under one roof with a pizza. There was a jellylike mass of raw lobster inside a ring of chickpeas, and a rust-colored puddle of 'nduja under raw turnips and nasturtium leaves. The wine list was virtually a treatise on natural wines, a long document full of the names of eccentric producers and obscure European villages. In another restaurant, all this would have been the departure point for some adventurous evenings. But in a pizzeria it led to some peculiar pairings, made the check a bit higher than you wanted and resulted in long waits before you were finally allowed to eat the delicious pizza you'd come for. Over the past year, Mr. von Hauske and Mr. Stone have stepped aside, letting Mr. Mangieri call the shots. The wines on offer now number about 15. They are still a likably eccentric lot, but picking one doesn't feel like studying for a master sommelier exam. The appetizers are simpler and less expensive: a plate of marinated white anchovies, a dish of warm Italian olives or a bowl of Little Gem lettuce with sunflower seeds in a Caesarish dressing. I do miss the tiramis\u00f9 from the opening menu, but the new cannoli filled with ricotta -- a blend of domestic cow's milk and Italian sheep's milk -- are nearly as good. It's common for a new restaurant to trim its sails, but this one has trimmed its prices, too. In the beginning the five regular pizzas were all $25; now they range from $19 to $25, and the two extra-complicated Friday and Saturday pizzas are priced at $26. I liked Mr. Mangieri's pies in the East Village, I liked them more when he came back to town, and it's possible, just possible, that they've improved over the past year. He is, like Mr. Seeger, a minimalist. He lets you notice each ingredient: the little ping of sourness in the Campanian buffalo mozzarella, for instance. Or the unruly, windswept-hillside aroma of dried Sicilian oregano. The precise crunch of each unrefined Trapani sea-salt crystal waiting to dissolve. The crust is so tender it barely fights fork, knife or teeth. Some diners will wish it put up more crackly resistance. You inhale it at least as much as you eat it. When you have finished, some of the most popular pizzas in town will seem tough, leathery, overworked. Even if this is not the style you crave, you'll know that it's the work of a baker who has spent years listening to the dough. There is a place for people who are as obsessed with pizza as Mr. Mangieri, and the place is New York City.

By the time people reach Kawi they tend to look rattled; New Yorkers who will easily weave their way around broken sidewalks, potholes, garbage piles and al fresco rat conventions come undone when faced with the interior of a shopping mall. Kawi, now two months old, can be disorienting in its own way, but at least you can have a seat and a drink while you get your bearings. Space there is used, or not used, the way it is in Las Vegas. There's a very long bar behind a line of black, geometric bar stools receding toward the vanishing point; low lounge tables; taller, square wood tables; round wood tables; black-leather booths; red-leather booths; red-leather banquettes; and a row of chairs facing a kitchen counter. Between all this furniture are aisles wide enough for a Zamboni. All those seats have backs, too. Kawi is loaded with the comforts and accommodations that critics, including me, were begging Mr. Chang to pay more attention to as recently as the opening of Nishi three years ago. Has anybody complained before that a David Chang restaurant was too quiet? They're saying it about Kawi. If there is anybody left who still thinks of Mr. Chang as a downtown punk, Kawi will clear up that misconception. The early Momofuku restaurants were skateboards; Kawi is a minivan with sliding doors, armrests, cupholders and Don Henley on the stereo. The ride may not be as fast, but it's a lot smoother. Kawi is also the first Momofuku restaurant in New York to address Korean cuisine head on and at length. Majordomo , which opened in Los Angeles last year, is at least half Korean, but the menu is loaded up with other stuff, a lot of which is big and showy and seemingly designed to dazzle the high rollers. It can be hard to remember you're eating galbi-jjim after a server buries it beneath a tableside avalanche of shaved raclette. Eunjo Park, Kawi's executive chef, avoids this type of distraction. This is lucky, because she makes food that you want to concentrate on. Before joining the Momofuku stable, she worked in the formal and highly fastidious kitchens of Daniel , Le Bec-Fin and Per Se . She later returned to South Korea, where she had lived until she was 12, for advanced studies at the Seoul restaurant Gaon and at the kitchen of the Chunjinam hermitage, presided over by Jeong Kwan , certainly the most celebrated cooking Zen nun in her country. A strong interest in tradition marks Ms. Park's food at Kawi. Her dishes are set apart from versions you may have had before by the exactitude of the technique and the quality of the ingredients. One section of her menu is turned over to kimbap, those wide, nori-wrapped sushi rolls often spotted at salad bars, languishing under plastic wrap. Most kimbap is designed to be portable, filling and inexpensive. Ms. Park's kimbap, on the other hand, is built for pleasure. She has a pickled vegetable kimbap on the lunch menu that is truly exciting; you are meant to dip it in a dark liquid that tastes a bit like soy sauce but is made with beets. The dinner menu brings kimbap filled with chives, pickled daikon, citrus jelly and a buttery pink vein of foie gras terrine. Has this really never been done before, you wonder as you eat it, and if not, why not? Among the other gussied-up raw fish that you expect in Momofukuland, like a refreshing if somewhat staid madai tartare, are some dime-size clams in chile sauce and an elegant, inspired interpretation of gejang. Blue crab legs and claw are cracked and given a three-day soak in soy sauce, among other things, which gives them an impressive amount of flavor. Then, in case you haven't noticed that you're dealing with a real chef, Ms. Park stirs the crab's roe with creamy rice and spoons this Korean risotto into the open belly of the shell. At moments like this, or in the hwedupbap filled with raw fish as strikingly good as any you'll find in a $200 omakase, or in the doenjang jjigae, a potful of braised fermented bean paste with pork belly that appears on the menu as \"yesterday's stinky soybean stew\" and manages to be homespun and polished at the same time, it's possible to see Kawi as Ms. Park's response to Atomix . It's as if she had looked at Junghyun Park's dazzlingly complex compositions at his year-old modern Korean restaurant and decided that she could cook in a style that was every bit as modern and painstaking, but that instead of turning traditional dishes into tasting-menu food she would keep the old forms and innovate inside them. With her tidy, refined, French-influenced neo-traditionalism, Ms. Park could become something like the Alain Ducasse of Korean cooking. It's not obvious, though, that Kawi needs an Alain Ducasse. Certain appetizers seem to belong on another planet, more beautiful and gentle than ours, such as the soft tofu with soy syrup that, sitting under a shattering thin crust of caramelized sugar, is like a savory cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e by way of Seoul. And there are others, such as the sticks of fried cod that a server pointlessly snips in half with scissors and then spritzes with atomized yuzu juice, that are right at home at Hudson Yards. The presentation seemed forced. That could also describe the boiled chicken dish, one of the menu's showiest items and, at $64, one of its most expensive. The whole bird is steamed, then the breast is sliced and served plain while the dark meat is fried and coated with spices. Neither is spectacular on its own, and the combination is bizarre. More successful versions of elaborate, oversize, multicomponent dishes are proven moneymakers elsewhere in the Momofuku republic. But arm-waving platters like that seem out of place at Kawi, which is the least Momofukian of the Momofukus. The most uncharacteristic thing of all is that the dining room has never been operating at anything close to capacity, at least when I've been there. Maybe tables are being kept off the reservation books to give the cooks time to learn where the spice cabinet is. Or maybe the fans who are so devoted to Mr. Chang's downtown spots are still trying to figure out the escalators.

The condoms became the subject of a series of advertisements on which the production company worked; in one of them, called \"Acts of Love,\" dancers in London re-enact, with surprising grace and dignity, the mating rituals of blue-footed boobies, fiddler crabs and other animals. Well, kids, when two companies like each other very much, sometimes they decide to create a new company together. That is what happened with the production firm and the prophylactics people when, for reasons that are perhaps best not to question, they hit upon the idea of expanding their product line from condoms into noodles. The restaurant lies across Union Avenue from Kellogg's Diner. Its door is marked during business hours by the fluttering white noren curtains. It is the second Hanon location. The first is about 6,700 miles away, in the city of Kamakura, which lies south of Tokyo and is known for soba, not udon. This gave Hanon the advantage of not competing against any of Japan's established udon styles, leaving its chef, Takahiro Yanagisawa, free to come up with his own. Mr. Yanagisawa, who had spent 25 years making sushi before turning to noodles, focused his innovative urges on the dough. He began by adding wheat germ and bran to the white flour that in udon is typically used alone. The resulting noodle is called zenryufun or whole wheat. The bran and germ are Mr. Yanagisawa's attempts to make a more healthful udon, but they also add flavor, a mottled color and a slightly rough texture that holds on to the dashi-based broth. This dough is also made into a green noodle, called sasauchi, by mixing in powdered barley shoots and leaves of kuma-zasa, a bamboo variety that pandas dote on . To the human palate, or at least this human's palate, sasa tastes something like green tea. Both the speckled zenryufun and the green sasauchi are flat noodles, resembling fettuccine that has been working out. Avoiding extremes, they are moderately chewy and reasonably springy. Either flavor, or both, can be ordered cold and spread on a bamboo mat for dunking into a sauce, either a peanut-buttery sesame sauce or the traditional dashi-based dipping sauce. For larger or more curious appetites, these dipping noodles, called seiro udon, can be dangled into a hot duck soup in which a few hunks of well-boiled duck meat swim. The cold noodles can also be accessorized with whipped mountain yam or tempura or both. If you had stumbled into Hanon under the impression that it was another generic Williamsburg noodle mill, the tempura would set you straight. The crust is engineered for udon, thick and substantial enough that it will not dissolve and float away in the soup, yet somehow not oily or clunky. The tempura is served with sea salt, which will not only season the fried blowfish tails, shrimp, mushroom and vegetables, but will also do very good things to any noodles it happens to meet. With the hot soups, there is no choice of noodles. All are made with zenryufun. The plain broth, a dashi augmented by white soy sauce, is not so salty or concentrated that I didn't want to drink it all. It also performs well made into a thick-but-not-sludgy curry soup with thin pink slices of washugyu beef; a shaggy, mossy, salty-sour mass of ume and kombu; and a soup of shaved beef and onions that tastes like a deeper, stronger version of French dip jus and is blitzed by a little grated yuzu peel at the end. A few near-relatives of udon make it to the menu as well. The beef-and-onion combination can also be had over rice. Creamy, slightly spicy cod roe is tossed with zenryufun for an excellent mentaiko pasta that, for once, relies on the roe rather than Kewpie mayonnaise to make an impression. The eventual plan is to sell both colors of noodle to grocery stores and other restaurants -- to become, in essence, the Sun Noodle of the udonisphere. This would be a gain for New York, but for the moment Hanon's udon is found only at Hanon, where the noodles are made fresh each day. Any plan for world domination is not hinted at on the restaurant's Facebook page , which seems to be its home base online, though nobody has bothered to post a menu there yet. Nor does the dining room suggest a budding global chain. Atmospheric and presumably expensive prints by the photographers Takashi Homma and Nobuyoshi Araki hang over the tables, and a signed Cy Twombly lithograph has been placed by the door to the backyard. The music -- torch songs, jazz piano -- seems to be coming from a radio tuned to another decade. A lot of this cocktail music will make more sense once the liquor license comes through. Hanon is getting set to offer sake, shochu and wines chosen by Jorge Riera, who built the list at Frenchette and has turned countless New Yorkers on to the fizzy, fuzzy and furry delights of natural wines. The idea of Hanon is not to slurp and slide out, but to stay for a meal: a chilled French red with the fried chicken and Japanese omelet, maybe, and something a bit brawnier with curry soup. Dessert could be a tofu blancmange, smooth and white and somewhat sweet, but there is more satisfaction in the grainy, earthy bricks of red bean paste. The meal might end with tea, to which the restaurant takes the same unhurried approach it applies to everything else. The iced oolong is slowly cold-brewed; a bamboo whisk and ceramic chawan are kept on the dining counter for painstakingly whipping up bowls of matcha; an appliance imported from Taiwan will transform freshly steeped hojicha and ice into a tan froth, a process that takes about five minutes. This foam tea is dairy-free, unlike Taiwan's infamous cheese tea. It is served in a wine glass, and the experience of drinking it is similar to tackling a pint of Guinness before the head has settled down.

The restaurant had changed significantly since the last time it had been evaluated by a Times critic: Sam Sifton promoted it from three stars to four in 2010, when Mark Ladner was the executive chef and Brooks Headley was running the pastry kitchen. First, Mr. Headley had quit this stately, expensive Italian restaurant in Chelsea so he could sell fast, cheap vegetarian burgers . Next, Del Posto had spent about $1 million on crystal candle vases, white leather chairs and other luxurious fittings that made it even more stately and expensive. Finally, Mr. Ladner had left to sell fast, cheap pasta. A fresh review was clearly in order. Before I could write it, though, a number of women who had worked for Mario Batali, one of the owners, started talking about the sexual harassment and abuse that they say he had doled out. Suddenly there seemed to be more important questions than whether the braised-rabbit agnolotti were cooked al dente. Negotiations took more than a year, but Mr. Batali no longer profits from Del Posto, having sold his stake in March to a group led by his former partner, Joe Bastianich . Employees have said that Mr. Bastianich himself helped, at a minimum, to build the sexist and disrespectful environment in which Mr. Batali operated. Mr. Bastianich has apologized, saying that he had heard Mr. Batali speak inappropriately to employees, and that he should have done more to stop the sexual harassment. Some diners will stay away, feeling that Mr. Bastianich has not sufficiently atoned. I understand this, but I am also interested in the way employees may be treated at the restaurant now and in the future. Here, there is reason to hope. Among other human-resources reforms, employees can now report complaints about owners or corporate officers to an independent investigative firm with the power to refer cases to outside counsel. As part of the restructuring, Melissa Rodriguez, who has been the executive chef of Del Posto since 2017, was made a partner in the restaurant, along with Jeff Katz, now the managing partner. A new pastry chef, Georgia Wodder, was appointed last spring. Del Posto is, with the possible exception of Aquavit , the grandest and most expensive restaurant in New York where women are in charge of everything you eat, starting with the miniature saffron waffle rolled like a cannoli and stuffed at one tiny end with taleggio and at the other with fennel pesto, and ending with the prosecco marshmallow tucked into the wooden drawer of a custom-made cheese grater. The cooking is more subdued now. The kitchen is not seen as a beacon of innovation the way it used to be, perhaps because Ms. Rodriguez is less interested than Mr. Ladner was in feats of technical derring-do like 100-layer lasagnas . She gets her effects by following old Italian templates and putting them together so elegantly that they seem to light up from inside. There's an honesty to her approach -- she doesn't try to shoot out all the lights by supercharging dishes with fat -- but it's not the kind of peasant simplicity people usually mean when they talk about honesty in Italian food. It's a sophisticated honesty. You know chicken cacciatore, of course. Ms. Rodriguez's version is made from guinea hen breast, roasted until the skin crackles like parchment. What would be the body of the stew is now a sauce; the tomato, celery and onion in it come through distinctly. Occupying a little sidecar is a pressed puck of braised leg meat under a single, Roman-style gnocco, a small featherbed of semolina held together by eggs, milk and cheese. One side has been broiled so hard it is nearly burned, which seems like a mistake at first, but turns out to supply the bit of campfire that this hunter's stew needs. It has to be far more complicated to prepare than the cacciatore at your neighborhood Italian restaurant, but it seems simpler, pared to essentials, and wonderful in every bite. I've never seen anyone wring as much flavor out of salsify as Ms. Rodriguez does. Sliced transparently thin and fried, it makes crunchy brown chips about half the size of an M&M. These decorate the top of a grilled-salsify pudding that has the refreshing bittersweetness of one of those plant-based Italian aperitifs. If it were not garnished with streaky leaves of radicchio, it could pass for a dessert. The menu structure has not changed, although the prices have. Everything can be had \u00e0 la carte. Lunch is still a relative bargain, though the price has shimmied up to $59 for three courses. For a blowout $194 dinner, the Captain's Menu yields eight courses or so. Most people, however, go with the $164, five-course Menu del Posto. The primary argument in favor of this strategy is, to me, an overwhelming one: Two of those five courses are pasta. Del Posto's pastas are worth doubling up on. They can come in many forms. Delicate conical tortellini have hidden pockets of nettles and spring peas; they are half-submerged in a light spring-vegetable brodo in which Parmigiano-Reggiano rinds once bobbed like bay leaves. This is the spring minestrone. A single, plate-spanning raviolo, called a fazzoletto, is topped with poached mussels and filled with spinach and fresh herbs -- not a lawnmower-mulch of greenery but a layer of emulsion as thin and velvety as the dough that envelops it. The sauce of mussel juices, white wine, butter and saffron makes this the only convincing mussel pasta I've ever had. The range of flavors Ms. Wodder commands in her pastry kitchen seems unnecessarily limited to me, although I may be unfairly comparing her desserts with Mr. Headley's, which roamed all over the place. Individually, her desserts are soothing, often showcasing the comforts of dairy. More emphasis, some extra acidity or bitterness, might have brought an assemblage of quince paste, brown-butter gelato and griddled brioche into relief. But I appreciated the way winter squash in the batter modified the sweetness of an olive oil-orange cake, and I enjoyed the moody sulkiness that amaro lent to a citrus salad served with the cake. Del Posto has in recent years picked up a reputation as a restaurant for one-percenters. It rarely gives that impression once you are inside, where servers solemnly accommodate just about anyone. There is a vegan menu at Del Posto. A vegetarian meal can be put together easily, and almost everything can be made without gluten, including the pasta. Yes, the stockpile of Champagnes includes some lock-and-key stuff, and should you require a Barolo costing between $2,000 and $4,000, one will quickly be added to your bill. But among the 3,100 or so Italian labels superintended by Evan Clagnaz, the wine director, are more marked from $60 to $75 than I can count. Piemonte is a place to hunt, and Friuli, and the Valle d'Aosta, for starters. Though the restaurant is not exclusively for rich people, it is explicitly for occasions. Once, when a reservationist called to confirm and asked whether I was celebrating anything special, I said no, and was gently laughed at: \"Just a normal Tuesday night at Del Posto?\" There is little danger that anyone will mistake a night at Del Posto for normal. If nothing else, the napkins and towels are a tip-off. First, there is a small hot linen napkin scented with tomato-vine oil, to wipe the dust of the outside world from your hands. Then a large white linen napkin, followed just before dessert by a small yellow one. It is given to you, and the white one is taken away, by a server using a large fork and spoon as tongs. When you go to the restrooms, you may encounter an attendant who has just restocked the hand towels from a large basket she carries on one arm, like Heidi out gathering wildflowers for Grandfather. There are little ceremonies like this from start to finish; I don't know of any other restaurant that performs quite so many tasks whose only real purpose is to draw attention to themselves. And these things are rarely done with a smile; employees seem to have been directed to keep a respectful, formal distance as they carry out your requests and perform other services you'd never think of requesting. They rarely seem comfortable. Their solemnity is underlined by the sepulchral lighting at night, so gloomy it makes the crypt of Grant's tomb look like a tiki bar. A good deal of the service is the attentive, helpful kind that you really want, but the rest of it seems designed only to give customers the sensation of temporary power over other people. Some people may love this, but it reflects a serious lack of imagination when you think about the ways the service at Blue Hill at Stone Barns or Noma , for instance, is integrated into the experience. Is it stretching a point to ask if enshrining subservience, as Del Posto does, reflects the same twisted sense of priorities that allowed Mr. Batali to get away with abusing his own power for so long? (And is it a coincidence that far more men than women seem to work in the dining room, particularly in the upper ranks?) Now that Ms. Rodriguez owns a piece of the restaurant, perhaps she can lead a reconsideration of priorities in the front of the house, and find a tone that more closely matches her philosophy in the back. She shouldn't have to clean up the messes men made. But having worked her way to the top of a restaurant that has always aspired to provide luxury, she has a chance to decide what, in New York in 2019, that word might mean.

At least it has escaped now. For the past decade or so, Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana , the 93-year-old establishment said to have invented the regional delicacy, has been exporting it to its other branches in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. There is also a small cult of the clam pie among New York pizzaioli. It has become a fixture at Lombardi's and some Staten Island pizzerias, as well as inspiring lovingly considered tributes at Pasquale Jones , Motorino and the Clam . I have eaten most of them, and happily, but on a recent trip to Connecticut I was led to what I now realize is the clam pie against which all others should be measured. It is baked at Zuppardi's Apizza in the city of West Haven. Unlike the coal ovens used to fire New Haven's more famous \"abeetz,\" to use the Connecticut-Neapolitan dialect, the ovens at Zuppardi's are fired by gas. As a result, Zuppardi's pies are not nearly as blackened as the ones from Pepe's, but the crust still bulges with air pockets and emerges with a pleasingly dry, thin and crackery crunch. [ Learn how to make pizza at home with this guide from NYT Cooking. ] Zuppardi's tops its clam pizza (market price, typically $32.45 for a medium pie) with fresh garlic, olive oil, dried oregano, cracked red pepper and littlenecks. Smaller clams may be opaque when they reach the table. Larger specimens will be just warmed through. All will taste as if they had just been shucked, as in fact they were. Opening clams to order means that the clam pizza takes longer than Zuppardi's other specialties, like the plain pie (tomato sauce, grated cheese, no mozzarella), itself worth a detour from Interstate 95, which rumbles by about a cherrystone's throw away.

These flattened cod fritters are the size of pie plates in Puerto Rico, while in Queens they are roughly the diameter of a coffee can. Dimensions aside, they give off all the right signals. They are the color of a corn muffin, with green specks of chopped cilantro under the surface that let you know they are not made from Goya's mix. They don't leave your fingertips entirely free of grease, but they come close. They have an exterior crunch that surrenders quickly to the firm, chewy interior of mashed salt cod; the texture is less fried dough than fish taffy. You could start to build a business around bacalaitos like these. That, in fact, has been Derick L\u00f3pez's plan for some time now. Mr. L\u00f3pez, who was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the South Bronx, is the Freakin Rican's chef and, with his husband, Victor Vargas, its owner. About four years ago, armed with picnic coolers and a couple of folding tables, the two men began selling a short menu of Puerto Rican staples at the street fairs that seem to infiltrate a different New York thoroughfare each weekend. As they promoted the Freakin Rican catering operation, the Freakin Rican product line, the Freakin Rican Facebook page and the Freakin Rican YouTube channel, they saved their earnings so they could found the Freakin Rican restaurant. After a false start in another part of Queens, it opened a short distance from the Museum of the Moving Image one year ago this month. The dining room has 19 seats. The banana-plant wallpaper on the left wall is reflected in the mirrors on the right. In between are some metal chickens and bright-green figurines of coqu\u00eds, the little frogs that chirp from every Puerto Rican tree. Diners sip on tropical-fruit shakes or bottles of Kola Champagne, Coco Rico and Malta India, the Harry, Ron and Hermione of Puerto Rican soft drinks. H\u00e9ctor Lavoe may be playing over the speakers, or V\u00edctor Manuelle, not so loudly that they can't be drowned out by the sounds of a small number of employees singing \"Happy Birthday\" while wielding a tambourine and a pair of maracas. If you have spent any time at all on the trail of chicharrones, mofongo, sancocho and other wonders of the Puerto Rican kitchen, you know that Astoria is not a primary hunting ground for any of them. You also know, though, that blinking-light cuchifritos parlors and family-run cocina criolla luncheonettes have been disappearing from the Bronx, East Harlem and the Lower East Side over the past few decades, along with many of their customers. The Puerto Rican population in New York peaked around 1990, when residents of the old barrios began to flow to the suburbs in large numbers, according to Laird W. Bergad , the director of the Center for Latin American, Caribbean and Latino Studies at City University of New York Graduate Center. Beacons of Puerto Rican cuisine still survive; Casa Adela, for instance, is still busily dispensing chickens from its venerable lemon-yellow rotisserie on Avenue C, despite the death last year of its founder, Adela Fargas. But there are not so many of these places left that we can take an unlimited supply of tostones and mojo de ajo for granted, either. The Freakin Rican developed its act on the street-fair circuit, but it applied the same tactics that succeed at Smorgasburg and similar urban foraging grounds, where the ideal dish can be held in one hand, gets immediate attention, costs under $10 and can serve as a plank in a branding platform. This may explain why appetizers are the strong suit on the Freakin Rican menu. The sorullitos, Puerto Rico's answer to hush puppies, are an exception; they are dense and dry, as if the cornmeal hadn't absorbed enough water. Mr. L\u00f3pez's alcapurrias, though, are very good, even if the picadillo that runs down the middle of a tube of mashed fried plantains like the graphite in a pencil could be seasoned a little more forcefully. And his pasteles are exceptional. Pasteles are structured like tamales. Where the masa would be, Mr. L\u00f3pez makes a sweet, enjoyably gummy mash of green plantains, taro root and kabocha squash. The filling is a soft, rich vein of stewed pork shoulder with ham, bacon, red peppers and green olives. Rolled up in a banana leaf, these pasteles probably deserve their own float in the Puerto Rican Day Parade. Mr. L\u00f3pez fries chicken in two styles. One, the chicharrones de pollo, is traditional. The other, the Freakin Crispy Wings, is not. Each has its rewards. The chicharrones, hacked into three-bite hunks, taste of cider vinegar and garlic powder and have a smooth, achiote-tinted buttermilk crust that breaks open with a pleasing crackle. The Freakin Crispy Wings are spicier, and the shell is thicker and more deeply crevassed. These wings may owe more to Atlanta than to Mayag\u00fcez, although you can get them with a guava barbecue sauce that's reasonably tropical. Leave behind these appetizers, the core of the street-fair business, and the menu can start to appear unsteady. At dinner, the main courses tend to be fairly plain fried or grilled meat. Grilled pork chops splashed with mojo can be dry and dull, and the grilled chicken breasts are not much more interesting. Baked pork ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce are tender enough, but they aren't very persuasive. On several nights, I found myself gazing longingly at the lunch specials on the back of the menu, wondering why I couldn't have a brick of pastel\u00f3n for dinner. (I came back for it one Thursday afternoon, and was glad I did.) Until more long-cooked dishes like it appear at dinnertime, consider a bowl of sancocho. Listed as \"vegetable root soup\" for $7, it doesn't sound like much of a meal. But it is a grab bag of a stew with at least two kinds of meat, great hunks of taro and yuca, a couple of inches of corn on the cob and a magical squash broth that has the consistency of heavy cream and the color of very ripe mango. In the unlikely event that you finish it and the bowl of rice that comes with it and then cry out for more, the Freakin Rican has just the thing for you: mofongo. A dome of mashed plantains possessed by garlic, the mofongo is cooked to order to keep the crunchy bits crunchy and the whole thing from getting boggy. You can have it with chicharrones or sliced roast pork, which leaves behind a happy impression of garlic, oregano and salt. If you have come for a birthday, a candle stuck in the meringue icing of a tres leches cake is probably in your future. If not, flan and espresso will do, and a bag of pasteles for tomorrow.

Again the flavors come from Asia and the methods, generally, from France. Again the far-off tropics are evoked through the play of indirect, dappled light, as if filtered through jungle foliage or a carved wooden screen. Again the presiding culinary sensibility belongs to a Vongerichten. Jean-Georges Vongerichten put together Spice Market in 2004, a confection of teak, silk, vodka, peanut sauce and high heels that brought the Asian Party Temple restaurant genre to its apotheosis. All the earlier examples suddenly seemed fumbling and unsophisticated, and with the possible exception of the Spice Market spinoffs in Qatar and Mexico, the ones that would follow seemed increasingly mindless and out of touch. Interior design that rummages through the musty old trunks of Orientalism doesn't look as alluring as it did 15 years ago, and cooking that filters Asian flavors through a Western sensibility isn't automatically met with gales of excitement. Wayan, where Mr. Vongerichten's son, C\u00e9dric, is the chef, avoids both traps, I think. The restaurant is a tribute to Indonesia, the home of his wife and business partner, Ochi Vongerichten, and the site of two restaurants that he opened recently. (He is also the chef of Perry St. in Manhattan, which his father owns.) The scale is more personal and the cultural references are more specific at Wayan than at Spice Market and its kind. The menu is far from encyclopedic, but it is clear that Indonesia's cuisine has been given more than the quick glance that informs a lot of Asian fusion. Ms. Vongerichten works in the dining room, stopping by tables to offer explanations of the menu and how the cooking differs from that at some other Indonesian restaurants in New York, which she cheerfully calls \"more authentic.\" More than any other factor, she helps keep Wayan from turning into a junior version of one of her father-in-law's restaurants -- Young Vongerichtenstein. Servers will tell you to start with a stick or two of satay. You can, although the skewers are cooked on a flattop instead of a grill, and inconsistency is an issue. The pork skewers that are so appealingly juicy and savory with sweet soy one week can be scorched and bitter the next time you see them, and just ordinary the following week. (The pickled watermelon radishes on the side, though, are always terrific; they're brined with lime leaf.) The peanut sauce on chicken satay may hum with red curry and chiles, or may present as a sweet, inert blob. A more promising opening move, and one that will help place C\u00e9dric and Ochi Vongerichten's mental map of Indonesia in perspective, would be the Jimbaran-style clams. This is not a dish that is likely to have been stirred by generations of sainted grandmothers since the dawn of time. It is, in fact, a specialty of the seafood vendors who sprang up on a stretch of Balinese beach where resorts first began to appear sometime around the birth of Taylor Swift. Littlenecks, flavored with soy sauce and garlic paste, are grilled under flakes of coconut, which form the golden crust that would be provided by bread crumbs if these were clams oreganata. A slice of pickled red chile sits on each one, waiting. If you were on vacation, you would order tray after tray of these. Here on Spring Street, other things will keep you distracted. In the hearts-of-palm salad, sweet and sour are carefully pitted against each other by means of a mango vinaigrette, a lime-and-fish-sauce dressing and a neon coat of passion-fruit pulp. The crab cake is, despite its sweet chile sauce, about as Indonesian as Betty White, but it is fresh and fluffy and not worth arguing about. Wayan's rendition of the street snack bakwan jagung is a golden agglomeration of corn kernels and shallots fried into a flat, crunchy disc. There had better be nasi goreng at any restaurant that is even playing at being Indonesian. There is, the rice fried just until it crackles a bit between your teeth. It has a gentle but genuine spice undercurrent that would be welcome in more of the cooking. Of course there is a gado gado, and this being 2019, of course the main ingredient is avocado; the hard-cooked eggs belong to quail. This time the peanut dressing isn't cloying or clumpy. As the plates get larger, few dishes really come forward as the kind of knockout that everybody will talk about later. The closest contender must be the lobster and basil with wavy noodles in a sauce containing, among other things, sweet soy and melted butter -- a combination that the senior Mr. Vongerichten has used so successfully that it may be his son's inheritance. Should the calamansi vinaigrette poured over the steamed black sea bass be more sour and spicy? Probably. But if there are few stars on the table, the contrast of flavors, colors, textures and techniques makes the meal into a memorable ensemble piece. The drumsticks in yellow chicken are crunchy, and the thighs are tender; both are mellow with a yellow curry seasoned by lemongrass and ginger. The tomato-chile sambal pressed into the surface of cod \"bilindango\" is potent enough to carry over to the spears of asparagus and fiddlehead ferns sprawled alongside. All of this looks very come-hither in the dining room, where the Rockwell Group has abandoned stadium-size props, building atmospheric effects instead out of contrasting textures and light values and the movement of shadows. This is the visual language of expensive tropical resorts, and Wayan seems to give people the feeling they're on vacation. It is not necessarily a loud restaurant, but New Yorkers are a loud people, and around 10 the noise can start to press down. It is a good time to call for dessert. The purple-yam ice cream with banana cake and caramelized bananas is good if sundaes are your thing. The pandan custard under passion-fruit pulp gets a lot of mileage from just a few flavors. But the one that sounds too boring to bother with (\"assorted exotic fruit?\") is worth a second look. Lychee, mango, pineapple and dragon fruit may not be particularly exotic, but a dip or a dunk into a dark, spicy syrup of tamarind and palm sugar will wake them right up.

And they did, in a sense. Soon Mr. Haraguchi had established his own free-standing establishment, Yuji Ramen in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where he serves that bacon-and-egg mazemen along with his possibly visionary \"tunakotsu\" ramen. In 2014, when Ivan Orkin came to New York , he brought along his own mazemen recipes. Over the next few years mazemen turned up in other restaurants, too, but all of them remained better known for soup ramen, and sold more of it. It began to look as if mazemen would never be more than a sideshow act, the one-armed ax-catcher of the ramen circus. Then at the start of the year, the chef Shigetoshi Nakamura, who operates an intimate ramen shop on the Lower East Side, opened an annex next door that is dedicated to mazemen. All the seating at this new place, Niche , is at a dozen or so stools arranged around one long, narrow table. When the dining room is fully occupied, the only way to get from one end to the other is to walk sideways while holding your breath and picking up all the coats that you are going to knock off their wall pegs as you go. Not that there is much reason to roam around. Orders are taken from and delivered to the table, and there is no public restroom on the premises. As is the case next door at Nakamura, seats by the window offer a close-up view of the stone walls that support the last few yards of the Williamsburg Bridge before it empties onto Delancey Street. Before he came to New York, Mr. Nakamura was already well known in Tokyo, where he proved to have a theatrical streak. Before filling a bowl with noodles, he would yank them from the boiling water with his left hand and then hold them high in the air for a few seconds, letting them drain while standing completely motionless. Suddenly he would drop his arm and the basket would plunge toward the water again, before stopping just in time and getting one quick, emphatic shake. When Mr. Nakamura was immortalized as one of four \"ramen gods\" in a set of Hello Kitty notepads and phone straps, Kitty was posed with her left paw raised high in emulation of the Nakamura Shake. If Mr. Nakamura has been practicing his choreography on the spaghetti-like, crinkly noodles at Niche, I haven't seen it yet. The Nakamura Shake seems designed to extract cooking water as quickly as possible before the noodles cool, and temperature is not especially critical in mazemen. The idea of noodle soup without the soup has been on the loose in Japan for decades. Broth is the most expensive and labor-intensive part of a bowl of ramen; in the 1950s, a Tokyo noodle shop, in the pitiless logic of the restaurant business, began omitting the broth when ladling out noodles at staff meals, or so the story goes. This \"abura soba\" -- oil noodle, because it was moistened with lard along with the seasoning sauce called tare -- wasn't half bad, so it went on the menu at a discounted price. As an even cheaper version of an already cheap and filling meal, abura soba was quickly embraced, especially by students. As food ideas tend to do in Japan, it evolved rapidly. Today, abura soba tends to refer to dry soups that have more or less the same toppings you'd find in a bowl of normal ramen, while mazemen generally has toppings that are rarely seen in soup and often would not respond well to being submerged in hot liquid. There is Italian-style mazemen, with anchovies, salami, olives and tomatoes. Some mazemen shops specialize in fried beef cutlets. At a Tokyo restaurant called Beefst , the centerpiece of each bowl is sliced roast beef, served rare. Mr. Nakamura has an answer to that: steak mazemen. The steak is rib-eye, in cubes that have been browned with a kitchen torch. When you stir them with the noodles and a smooth, creamy spoonful of something the menu simply calls \"pork sauce,\" their juices and flecks of char flavor the whole bowl. Plain spinach and fermented bamboo, meanwhile, keep the total effect from being queasy-making. Novel, straightforward, refined, unruly and impure of heart, steak mazemen has the makings of a classic New York dish. So does the duck, a common special. A sliced breast of moulard duck cooked to a deep violet-pink, it is served with a bright, focused sauce built on soy and enough warm duck juices to lubricate the whole-wheat noodles. It is not an austere dish by any means, but it is balanced and restrained. The same cannot be said for another special that is always offered on the same nights: a bowl of liquefied foie gras topped with pistachios and truffle oil. It is not clear what will happen to anyone who tries to eat this with a spoon, but the prognosis does not seem good. Instead, everybody orders it with the duck mazemen and dips the noodles into the foie gras, after which conscious thought tends to stop for a minute or two. When cerebral activity resumes, you might wonder why the sauce doesn't come with its own noodles. No other mazemen is such a joy ride, but the vaguely Italian one with tomatoes, mushrooms, kombu and an angry red soak of chile oil is not the kind of thing you want to turn your back on. Even the tribute to Russ & Daughters , where the noodles are coated with spicy cod roe and the topping is sliced smoked salmon, can sneak up on you. Niche is one of the few ramen-yas in town where the appetizers are worth noticing. Sea urchin perched on tiny corners of toast is a strange and awkward affair, but the sardines on toast, dressed with chile flakes, are very good, as are the raw scallops with yuzu juice and the avocado salad showered with tempura flakes. Should fries be an appetizer? Maybe not, particularly Niche's \"umami kombu fries,\" which have been sprinkled with powdered shio kombu until they are almost subliminally green. Apart from the color, they look like the fries at McDonald's. The difference is that the shio kombu makes them almost diabolically hard to stop eating.

Her third restaurant, Haenyeo was about three months old and already filled with people who looked as if they'd been going there for years. It sits on a prime corner lot, on a stretch of Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that is rich in local minichains serving banh mi, burritos, lobster rolls and so on, to take out or eat in. Intimidating restaurants don't tend to prosper here. Very few people inside Haenyeo look the least bit intimidated as they lift grilled oysters by the shell to pour the dregs of hot seaweed butter over toast; or carve wedges of zucchini-scallion pancakes fried to a dark and satisfyingly rich brown; or stir mushrooms, squid, bean sprouts, steamed spinach and cabbage kimchi with a just-cracked egg into a bibimbap whose bottom layer of rice is golden and crunchy where it meets the hot stone bowl. The customers at Haenyeo seem to have an easy familiarity with Korean food. Some of them, at least, can probably thank Ms. Kwak for that. In 1992, when she began serving the cuisine in the East Village at her first restaurant, Dok Suni's, the words tteokbokki and seolleongtang and jajangmyeon did not roll off the tongues of most non-Koreans. But that's who she wanted to lure in with American music, date-night d\u00e9cor and Western-style service. Once she had them, she would tempt, teach, turn them on to the flavors she'd grown up with. Her mother, Myung Ja Kwak, shared cooking duties. Ms. Kwak's was not the take-it-or-leave-it approach of 32nd Street, and she kept at it. She wrote \"Dok Suni: Recipes From My Mother's Korean Kitchen,\" which was one of the few Korean cookbooks in English when it came out, in 1998. At her second restaurant, Do Hwa, she and her mother led customers deeper into unfamiliar ground. Each of the restaurants stayed open for about two decades, which is a very long time in New York. If you want a metaphor for how effectively Ms. Kwak paved the way for restaurants like Atoboy , Soogil, Danji and others whose chefs weave Korean cuisine into new patterns, consider that one of them, Oiji, moved into its address on First Avenue right after Dok Suni's moved out. What Ms. Kwak is doing in Park Slope isn't all that different from what she has done all her career, except that by now South Korean comfort food has become comfort food for New York in general. Haenyeo does pay more attention to seafood than Dok Suni or Do Hwa did, though. Ms. Kwak hasn't gone pescatarian on us. She still serves impressive pork and beef bulgogis with ssamjang and lettuce, and the pan-fried dumplings are filled with high-fat ground beef seasoned with kimchi, garlic and soy. But her menu's orientation has shifted slightly toward the ocean. This is good news, because the seafood at Haenyeo has a sparkle and sweetness you don't always find in the smoke-filled rooms of 32nd Street. A bibimbap variant may be the menu's sleeper dish, partly because it starts out looking like a lunch bowl from Sweetgreen. It is a version of hwe dup bap. At first you just see raw tuna, shredded romaine and perilla leaves, grated carrots and cucumber, and strips of seaweed. Hidden underneath is warm rice. But there is a pink mound of spicy cod roe in the bowl, too, with cured salmon eggs and a few lobes of sea urchin. Both of them will break apart as you stir, bringing their distinct saltwater intonations to the rice and vegetables. What the menu calls \"white fish fillets\" -- pan-fried cod with rings of scallion showing through their thin gold sheet of egg batter, otherwise known as saeng seon jeon -- is so modestly named it might get overlooked; it shouldn't. The menu plays Don't Mind Me again with \"mackerel, grilled or braised.\" Just get the mackerel, because the kitchen knows how to cook it, whether over a flame or in a dark, smoky pan of garlic and gochujang. In truth, the kitchen seems to know how to cook every kind of seafood, although perhaps it could come with a better partner for the fried scallops than the sweet, yellowish tartar sauce with corn in it. The walls are hung with photographs of Korean women in wet suits. These are the haenyeo of Jeju island , who dive up to 30 feet deep for conch, abalone and seaweed while holding their breath for several minutes at a time. The money they made diving is probably the reason parts of Jeju have a matriarchal family structure. Naming the restaurant after them, Ms. Kwak continues a theme started with Dok Suni's, which means \"strong women's.\" One dish that seems out of place is a revival of Dok Suni's fried chicken. Was the batter always so pasty and airless? That's not how I remember it, but it's possible my standards have changed as Korean fried chicken has infiltrated nearly every part of town over the past decade. In any case, there is better chicken to seek out here, not just the home-style dokdoritang stewed in chile sauce but also the wings. Haenyeo double-fries wings that have been dipped in potato starch, then coats them with a fine version of a yangnyeom chile sauce, tangier and a little less sweet than some. When Ms. Kwak detours from the Korean straight and narrow, consider traipsing along behind her. You may wind up having beignets for dessert, buried under a fresh coat of powdered sugar in the best Caf\u00e9 du Monde style. (This and the grilled oysters may betray the hand of her business partner, Terrence Segura, who is from New Orleans. He is also her husband.) Or you may follow her all the way to the joyous rice cake fundido, which starts out as tteokbokki in chile sauce and becomes totally atypical through the addition of chorizo, sliced jalape\u00f1os and a melted, browned topcoat of Oaxacan cheese that comes up in long, stretchy strings when you pull on it. It is, in all likelihood, the best Tex-Mex dish in New York. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

At the very least, it has paused to catch its breath. Since the seven-story food court in Hudson Yards was unveiled last month, the public reaction has been somewhere between shrug and ugh. Attitudes may improve as visitors eat their way to the top floor. So far, though, the response hasn't come close to matching the greeting bestowed on the restaurants at Time Warner Center in 2004, even though the project represents the same basic idea executed by the same developer with at least one of the same chefs, Thomas Keller . Even more striking has been the low-key reception to Rocco DiSpirito's return. Late last year Mr. DiSpirito took over the kitchen at Standard Grill in the meatpacking district. At one point, when he was the chef at both Union Pacific and Rocco's on 22nd while starring in a television show, he was arguably the most famous chef in the country. Then both places closed, and the show was canceled. Mr. DiSpirito has not been in charge of a restaurant since George W. Bush was in the White House. For that matter, it has been some years since Standard Grill itself has done anything noteworthy. In 2009, when it was new and Dan Silverman was the chef, I reviewed it, gave it one star and then lost track of it. In other words, the selection of Mr. DiSpirito did not just come out of left field. It came from the weeds across the street from the parking lot behind left field. For surprise value alone, it should have been one of the year's most buzzed-about news items. But the trumpets have been muted, and the back handsprings seem to lack a certain bounce. This, at least, is the view from outside the restaurant. Once you're sitting at one of the tables -- newly topped with leather pads in a major retrofitting that has made the dining room look like an expensive cabaret, blue velvet and all -- you will hear quite a lot of talk about Mr. DiSpirito, or as they call him here, Chef Rocco. Chef Rocco, you learn, conceived each dish on the menu so that it can be eaten by one person or shared with others. No, I didn't believe it at first, either, but apparently it's true: Rocco DiSpirito invented food. There is also something that servers call Chef Rocco's Game Changing Toast, although sometimes they shorten it to Rocco's Game Changing or simply Game Changing, as in \"Here's a little more Game Changing for you.\" The item in question is a toasted, cracker-thin slice of bread made of nuts, oats, seeds and psyllium-seed husks held together without benefit of wheat flour. Like nearly everything on the menu, it is free of gluten. Being mostly made of browned nuts, it is also delicious. Whether it is truly Rocco's is up for debate. It seems to strongly resemble the Life-Changing Loaf of Bread recipe that Sarah Britton published on her blog, \"My New Roots,\" in 2013, and that appeared on another blog two years later, with minor changes, as Game Changing Nut & Seed Bread . It's one of the items that reflect Mr. DiSpirito's recent obsession with nutrient-dense dietary supplements , although the way it keeps coming up in the servers' patter makes you wonder if Mr. DiSpirito spent too much time as a QVC pitchman. Anyway, somebody-or-other's toast sits under the smoked gravlax, red with beet juice and very silky on its bed of coconut cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, that Mr. DiSpirito sends out as an amuse. A plate of the toast will also appear if you order the platter of acorn-fed, hand-sliced Ib\u00e9rico ham or the chilled Maine sea urchins served on the spiky half-shell. Either one will convince you that Mr. DiSpirito knows how to get his hands on raw materials that can stun with almost no assistance. The best things at Standard Grill, and there are quite a lot of them, depend on very good ingredients touched as little as possible. Back in the Union Pacific days, Mr. DiSpirito's interest in East Asian cuisines came out in the form of complex preparations, arcane ingredients and out-of-nowhere juxtapositions. Now he seems to have moved on to the luxury minimalism of an omakase sushi chef, a style that was foreshadowed by the only Union Pacific dish he's brought back, bay scallops and sea urchin with a few throat-searing drops of mustard oil. Standard Grill's ice-cold cubes of bluefin chu-toro stirred with golden osetra caviar, meanwhile, could have come straight out of Masa , while the yellowfin tartare, barely dressed with crushed macadamias and freshly grated wasabi, is like one of the better items at Tetsu . Each night there are half a dozen or so skewers cooked over Japanese charcoal and wheeled to the table on a mini-grill the size of a toaster oven. Speared on a stick might be fantastic small scallops out of Peconic Bay; a feathery mop of maitake mushrooms; buttery chicken livers with barely a hint of bitterness; or firefly squid, a little bigger than a fava bean and grilled whole so they can be swallowed guts and all. Again, the ingredients are exceptional. The skewers look simple enough, but they are all, you learn, brushed with \"a little sauce Chef Rocco came up with to complement the charcoal.\" The sauce for seafood involves coconut nectar and lemongrass, and what it actually does is put you, vaguely and pleasantly, in mind of Thailand. While I am one of those increasingly stooped and wizened diners who remembers, in detail, Mr. DiSpirito's cooking at Union Pacific, far more people recall him as the meatball-pushing antihero of \"The Restaurant,\" an NBC series about Rocco's on 22nd, an actual (and doomed, it turned out) Italian-American restaurant. The show, which debuted in 2003, was a pioneer in the genre of cooking-focused reality television, although when everybody started suing everybody else, it became clear it was a pioneer in the way the members of the Donner Party were pioneers. The handful of Italian dishes at Standard Grill may be meant for \"Restaurant\" fans. Neither of the two pastas showed Mr. DiSpirito at his best, but a chewy risotto with red shrimp and what seemed like half a dozen forms of black truffles may make you understand why Ruth Reichl started her 1998 Times review of Union Pacific with a woman moaning at the next table. Standard Grill's Norwegian salmon on an ivory puddle of vegan cashew sauce won't inspire the same reaction, but the steaks might; they are dry-aged until ripe, and earn their deep-brown crust over extremely hot Japanese charcoal. Given what Mr. DiSpirito is capable of doing with a piece of halibut and some goose fat, I can't quite believe that I'm recommending the rib-eye over the seafood, but I am. It may be that Mr. DiSpirito knows exactly what he is doing. Simplicity is the whole point of a grill, which is first cousin to the steakhouse. He has also designed a menu so straightforward that if, after a respectable period of time, he is no longer in the kitchen, the food quality can stay roughly the same as long as the hotel doesn't argue about ingredient costs. The Standard has not left the restaurant's fate entirely in his hands, either; besides redecorating, it hired a ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel, Michael Cecchi-Azzolina, away from Le Coucou ; he is hard at work building an audience every night, handing out old-school business cards to old-school producers, chefs and publishers, sitting down to chat with Brooke Shields and Ms. Reichl. Standard Grill is so much better than it used to be, and so much better than almost any restaurant serving a comparable menu of grilled meats and chilled seafood, that it's foolish to wish for the return of the same Mr. DiSpirito who gave us Union Pacific. It's a little bit as if Barbra Streisand had returned to Broadway, and then sang all her songs in a whisper sitting on the edge of the stage.

In fact, in Blue Smoke's attempt to bring together the barbecued game hen of Cozy Corner , in Memphis, with the fried hot chicken of places like Prince's, in Nashville, the bird has been through a good deal more than that. The process goes like this, approximately : spatchcocked, brined, rubbed with spices, smoked, chilled, dunked in a frothy batter, tossed in seasoned flour, deep fried, dipped in spicy oil and sprinkled with four kinds of ground pepper. \"Just a little pop-pop dust right on top\" is how Jean-Paul Bourgeois, Blue Smoke's chef, describes the last step. \"That introduction of fresh chile onto that fried chicken, it just brings the zing.\" Then came one final touch, he said: \"a little swirlybird of Tabasco hot honey.\" Handily, this can all be shortened to smoked, fried hen when you order ($24 at the Battery Park City location and $26 on East 27th Street). But you'll know there's more to it when your jaw smashes through the dark crust with a sonic boom; when the particular forms of heat contributed by habanero, black pepper, Sichuan peppercorn, Aleppo pepper, cayenne and Tabasco sauce all start to pile up and reverberate like My Bloody Valentine guitar chords ; when the meat gives up juices that swirl with wood smoke.

That small children routinely bought coffee-flavored milk in school cafeterias; that \"beer\" was not pronounced with an \"r\" at the end, but pizza was; that a hot dog shortened to about four inches and topped with meat sauce is called a hot wiener , and that a counterman preparing six of them at a time may deploy a maneuver known as \"wieners up the arm\" -- all of this apparently strikes people who grew up more than 20 miles from Providence as very funny. When New Yorkers hear that Violet , a new restaurant in the East Village, serves a style of pizza that comes from Rhode Island, they start to smile, as if getting ready for the punch line. In fact, though, Violet's pies are a homage not to the whole state but to a specific restaurant, Al Forno, in Providence. If you know one thing about Al Forno, you know that its pizza is not a joke. One of the restaurant's two founders, George Germon, originated the recipe in the early 1980s, more or less out of desperation. After failing to get an oven hot enough to produce a crust as thin and crunchy as the ones he remembered eating in Italy, he tossed dough on a wood-burning grill and watched in awe as it stiffened to a crisp almost instantly. The pizza he and his wife, Johanne Killeen, would develop and elaborate from there was in a category of its own. The skills required to bake dough in a pizza oven, whether it runs on gas, coal or wood, don't apply to grilled pizza at all. This makes it an unending source of fascination to pizza technologists including Violet's chef, Matt Hyland. With his wife and business partner, Emily Hyland, Mr. Hyland paid tribute to wood-fired New Haven and New York pizza at his first place, Emily , then took on Detroit pan pizza at Emmy Squared . They have expanded both restaurants to new locations, including Citi Field, where Emmy Squared is now the \"official pizza.\" But Mr. Hyland has been a student of the Al Forno school of pizza for years, since going to college in Rhode Island. Violet, which he opened at the start of the year, is dedicated to the style. He has worked allusions to other features of the state's cuisine into the menu, which makes forays into pasta and small seafood dishes, but the pizza grill is at the center of the action. Anyone who has eaten at Al Forno will recognize the lineage of Violet's pies. Both are as thin as a saltine all the way to the edge, with parallel lines of grill marks on their undersides. Al Forno puts fontina on its margheritas, as Violet did with all its pizzas until recently, when it began experimenting with havarti. In any case, the cheeses are on the dry side and grated for fast, thin distribution. Sauces are splashed down by the spoonful, quickly, before the crust burns. That's the template for a pie called the Atwells: a base coat of grated havarti and pecorino under big blots of a garlic-laden pesto made even greener than usual by the inclusion of broccoli and pistachios. While Al Forno tosses raw, slivered scallions on almost every pie, Violet may chop its scallions or grill them. One appealingly eccentric pie that combines a New Haven clam pizza with a Peking duck pancake is finished with fried julienned leeks. Olive oil does give Al Forno's crust extra crackle and flavor, but Violet's less lavishly oiled dough, made with a sourdough starter, has more flavor of its own. It's a little salty, crunchy but not brittle, more substantial than you expect, and highly chewable. Violet gives you a heavy pair of shears to snip the pie into wedges, or any shape you like. Wielding them supplies the palpable thrill of using exactly the right tool for the job, and it's even better than that because the job is eating pizza. A trip to Providence last weekend, though, turned up more than structural similarities between Violet and Al Forno. Three of the four pizzas on Al Forno's menu reminded me of pies I'd eaten at Violet. One resembled the Atwells, but its pesto was made with asparagus rather than broccoli. For Violet's Beech Vibes, a thin layer of duxelles is spread from rim to rim, then topped with tahini, caramelized onions and pickled beech mushrooms. It reminds me of a pissaladi\u00e8re in which the anchovies have been replaced by mushrooms. Al Forno makes a duxelles pizza, too, but tops it with unpickled white mushrooms, and doesn't use tahini. And, of course, both places do a variation on a Neapolitan margherita, called the margarita in Providence and the Classic in the East Village. The difference between their dough recipes doesn't quite put to rest the suspicion that Violet should be more conscientious about avoiding overlap even though Al Forno is 180 miles away. Most diners, of course, will just be happy to have a new style of pizza in town. Any of Violet's pies, eaten before or after the iceberg-wedge salad with blue cheese and a jolt of ranch dressing, or the fris\u00e9e salad tossed with fried artichokes, would make an ideal fast dinner. Beyond that, the going can get tricky. All the pastas I tried seemed like rough drafts, from the radiatore baked in a very salty vodka sauce to the spaghetti con vongole con dashi, a Japanese-Italian blind date that doesn't have the right chemistry. The two desserts I had were even stranger. Describing one of them, a cheesecake with banana pudding on it, the server said, \"I'm just going to tell you what it is and if you guys want it, you can order it.\" If the warning had been any stronger it would have come with liability waivers. If you did want to build a longer meal, some of the seafood appetizers can help. Not the \"stuffies,\" baked stuffed littlenecks or cherrystones that could use more clam. The smoked mackerel, though, is excellent and comes with some unusually good fresh-fried potato chips. There are also shrimp that have been grilled with their heads and shells on, placed over johnnycakes and splashed with spiced piri-piri sauce. Johnnycakes, which are made of fried cornmeal mush and taste like it, are probably more strongly identified with Rhode Island than any other food. I have never been sure why, because johnnycakes can be found, if you really want to look for them, all along the Atlantic Coast. The only time I've seen Rhode Islanders eating them was on a Boy Scout camping trip, and boy scouts will eat anything if you leave them in the woods for a few days. In any case, the johnnycakes that Violet places under the shrimp and the piri-piri sauce are kind of wonderful. The cornmeal has a lush, right-off-the-cob flavor. I'd have them for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Is it possible that the joke has been on me all along? Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

At two points during the March menu, a person who is not Mr. Odo faces you across the thick plank of Lebanon cedar that forms the dining counter and makes something for you. The first time is about halfway through the meal, when Seong Cheol Byun shows up, shapes half a dozen pieces of sushi and lays them down, one by one, in front of you. Some of his ingredients, kept on wooden trays that he carries from place to place, are typical, like the warm short-grain rice and the dark nikiri that he will brush over certain fish. Others are less typical. The ginger he mounds on your plate is pickled together with sliced lotus root and daikon. On March 1, looking forward to spring, he added cherry leaves to the mix. Mr. Byun, a Korean-American, ferments daikon, cabbage and sesame seeds to make white kimchi, which he wraps inside nori for a tuna roll. You eat it like an ice cream cone, but faster. When Mr. Byun worked at Sushi Nakazawa, much of the seafood he used was flown in from Japan. At Odo, almost all the fish have been caught off the East Coast of North America: Long Island black sea bass, Florida mackerel and North Carolina bluefin tuna, which may be several weeks old before Mr. Byun is ready to serve it. This sushi reflects the American region where it is made, incorporates the Korean background of the chef making it and still has an unmistakably Japanese spirit. This one course, if tripled in length, could be spun off into a separate establishment that would probably be among the top two dozen sushi restaurants in the city. The second time an Odo course is prepared while you watch, it is made in a cocktail shaker and served in a cocktail glass. It is, as you may have guessed, a cocktail, though it is also the first of two desserts, sweetish and not especially boozy. Frank Cisneros, the sommelier, subordinates the alcohol to fresh fruit, in the style of the revered Tokyo bar Gen Yamamoto . Barrel-aged shochu is muddled with one or two sprightly segments of mikan orange, subjected to a calisthenic shake and strained into a delicately etched glass before a shimmer of sparkling wine is laid down on top. Orange juice in cocktails usually tastes diluted and weak; in this drink, it was radiant. I would say that the drinkable dessert course could be expanded into a separate cocktail bar, except that Odo already has one of those. Odo, which opened in December a few minutes' walk from the Flatiron Building, is entered through a door hidden in the back of a compact den -- cafe by day and bar by night -- called Hall. This arrangement seems to remind people of a speakeasy, although it would take an especially clueless bootlegger to open a speakeasy inside a bar. So far, Hall has not been fully discovered, but it still gets busy enough at dinner time that you can be stranded by the front door for a few minutes before anyone on staff notices. Some diners on their way to Odo will find this an awkward start to a meal that costs $200 before tax, tip and drinks. But they may also discern that Hall, lined with carved oak panels salvaged from what appears to have been a library or church vestry from around 1900, is one of the neighborhood's most entrancing rooms; that the corridor, which seems too narrow and definitely climbs on its way toward a too-short brass door with no handle, is perspective-altering in a way a Surrealist would enjoy; and that Odo, a shadowy and windowless space on the far side of that door is an unusually tranquil shelter from crowds, noise and anything else you might want to get away from for a couple of hours. The 14 counter seats face the kitchen and, in the middle of it, a charcoal-gray island. This is where Mr. Odo and his cooks assemble the other courses I promised to tell you about. Duck breast has been grilled over charcoal and positioned between two sauces. One is a black spill of concentrated soy spiced with sansho pepper; the other is an ivory pool of pur\u00e9ed apples and cream. These sauces contrast in every way you can think of, including East versus West, and they come together like opposing poles of a magnet. A springy chunk of truffle-flavored mochi is crisped on the grill and engulfed in a white-miso soup that has grated white truffles floating on the surface. You smell truffles in the air first, get them on the tip of your tongue next and finally taste them everywhere when they're released from the mochi. A croquette tastes something like an Italian rice ball made from New England clam chowder that has young bamboo shoots in it. This golden, breaded arancino is finished with dots of grated goat cheese. Shaved lamb shoulder, baby harukei turnip and two asparagus stalks as thin as licorice whip are served, still cooking, in a hot broth, a kaiseki version of shabu shabu. Odo -- incidentally, the name is pronounced as a set of initials, O.D.O. -- pursues local ingredients not just for its sushi course but throughout its menu. The simmered lamb used to gambol in the Hudson Valley, the croquetted topneck clams were raked in off Long Island and so on. Kaiseki's near-liturgical focus on timeliness almost seems to demand local ingredients, and they have been central to Niki Nakayama's strategy at n/naka in Los Angeles, but less so for New York's few kaiseki chefs. Chikara Sono at Kyo Ya , for instance, takes pains to import traditional ingredients from Japan the minute they're available. Mr. Odo came to New York as the chef of Kajitsu , the extraordinary restaurant on East 39th Street that follows the vegetarian cooking tradition known as shojin ryori, born centuries ago in Zen Buddhist temples. One contribution he made in his five years there was to freshen up the menus with more food grown nearby. In the first and last tastes of his February and March menus, he anchors Odo firmly in the New York region. When you sit down, you are immediately poured a cup of cold sake. It is brewed in Brooklyn, and it is very good, swirling with fresh-fruit aromatics. Then at the end, after the fresh fruit, Mr. Odo serves ice cream made with kasu, the creamy solids left over at the end of sake distillation. The ice cream looks like vanilla and tastes, not surprisingly, like fermented rice. This particular kasu is supplied by the same brewery in Brooklyn that makes the sake. Expanding his range to meat and fish at Odo, he has kept the resourcefulness that limitations encourage. Somewhere along the way Mr. Odo also picked up technical skills in traditions far outside kaiseki. Each night, in the gohan course, Odo offers a choice of three starchy dishes. This is where I encountered a very fine seafood curry over rice; an elegant bowl of short ramen noodles in king crab broth; and fresh soba served with little pieces of pickled vegetables and wasabi blossoms, looking a bit like broccoli florets but tasting like mustard. As with the cocktail and the sushi, each of these dishes could, if Mr. Odo wanted, be leveraged into separate specialized restaurants, or food-hall stands. You could tell yourself that $200 is a large amount of money for a single meal or you could say that for the chance to visit all these different establishments without leaving your seat, it's a pretty good deal.

Arrive before the fish shops along this famous, not-quite-faded Italian strip in the Bronx take in the iced clams and octopus for the night. Across from Dominick's, turn into the indoor market that Fiorello La Guardia ordered up. Move on past the hand-rolled cigars and the T-shirts reflecting various tenets of Bronx philosophy. Keep going beyond the scamorza, the soppressata and the ready-to-go heroes, and walk out the door on to Hughes Avenue. Just to the right is a spinning wheel that looks old enough to have been Rumpelstiltskin's and next to it, another door. Open it, walk inside. The short trip seems to have taken you back in time. The spinning wheel turns out to be just one piece in Cka Ka Qellu's collection of antique tools, stringed instruments, yokes, brass coffee mills, manual typewriters, dishes of hammered metal and embroidered costumes that the owner, Ramiz Kukaj, brought over from the old country. Some, he says, go back to the 18th century. The floors and walls seem to have been airlifted from an Albanian farmhouse, and the speakers play wistful folk tunes on traditional instruments, not the modern, globally aware wake-up calls of the brass band Fanfara Tirana . The restaurant is soaked in nostalgia. The other reason for the walk from Arthur Avenue is that it recapitulates a pattern that's repeated throughout this neighborhood, where the signs and menus facing the street are still written in Italian but many of the people in the back rooms, seasoning the sausages and frying the veal cutlets, are Albanian. Here and there, those Albanians have brought a little of their cuisine into those Italian businesses. Cumin-laden suxhuk sausages hang to dry in the salumerias. In some pizzerias, the burek challenges the Jamaican beef patty for outsider meat-pie supremacy. One such place, also owned by Mr. Kukaj, is in the Norwood neighborhood and is called Tradita. ( Ligaya Mishan reviewed it in 2017.) But if you want a deep-end Albanian experience, Cka Ka Qellu, pronounced SHA ka chell-OO, is the place to go. The kitchen does not focus on the seafood of Albania's Adriatic coast, or the more intensely Greek- and Turkish-leaning cuisine of its southern reaches. Instead, it heavily favors the north, which shares many dishes with the former components of Yugoslavia that are its neighbors. In particular there is a strong overlap with Kosovo, home to many ethnic Albanians including, at one time, Mr. Kukaj and his chef, Afrim Kaliqani. In their kitchen, yogurt and cream are everywhere, along with curds of soft fresh cheese and triangles of creamy, unsqueaky feta. A good portion of the menu could be described as things in a creamy white sauce. Another, entirely different portion could be described as creamy white sauce with things in it. Included in the second group are some of the dips that are almost obligatory at the start of your Cka Ka Qellu experience: tarator, tart yogurt with minced cucumbers, garlic and parsley, similar to tzatziki, but nearly as fluffy as whipped cream; cream stirred with bits of suxhuk to give it a pinkish tint and a suggestion of spice; and kajmak , which our server described as \"like butter for bread\" and I would say was like cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche blended with cream cheese and butter. (In parts of Albania, it would be made by boiling unpasteurized milk from water buffalo.) I found myself dipping sausages, vegetables and just about everything else into the kajmak, but it is exceptionally good with a warm slice of the bread that Cka Ka Qellu bakes in the pizza oven that is the first thing you see when you walk in. When the menu defines kacamak as \"cream with polenta,\" the cream in question is kajmak, stirred into a fine-grained, nearly white mass of cornmeal that takes on the lightly fluffed quality of really well-made mashed potatoes. Sometimes there is a creamy sauce where you don't expect one. Each slice of lecenik, a cornbread with spinach and cottage cheese that is so rich it is only a few rungs in the ladder from cheesecake, comes to the table under a spoonful of kajmak. Sometimes there is no creamy sauce where one would do some good. The restaurant's version of fli, the slow-baked, many-layered pancake, is served as a long, narrow wedge with no accompaniment, although it is somewhat less than fully tender and moist. Luckily it responds immediately to any spare yogurt you can forage from elsewhere on the table. The mantia, baked dumplings filled with ground veal and onions, will seem tough and dry, too, if you order them alone. The same mantia cooked with yogurt in a clay dish will seem perfect. Is there another restaurant in New York that makes as much use of veal, and as little of any other meat, as Cka Ka Qellu? It is the main ingredient in the restaurant's qofte, ground and mixed with onions and red pepper; and in its qebapa, mild skinless sausages cooked on the grill. (The sausages would be called cevapi in other corners of the Balkans, where they are likely to be made from lamb or beef.) Veal works its way into many of the clay-dish stews, including the veal tava, something like a Mediterranean ratatouille that got itself entangled with a meat-and-potato stew from another part of Europe. Rolled up with cheeses and smoked meat, breaded and fried, veal also serves as the filling for the alluring Skanderbeg. Named after a great patriotic hero of the 15th century, Skanderbeg is generally called Albania's national dish, although its resemblance to a kayak made from chicken cordon bleu renders it something of an outlier in the cuisine. Ladled along its crunchy, golden length is -- please rise and face Hughes Avenue -- a creamy white sauce. Eating all of this without a salad is unimaginable and probably unadvisable. Each of Cka Ka Qellu's several salads seems to consist of cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions and cheese in slightly different arrangements. If the vegetables were any fresher, you'd be embarrassed to eat them in public. Surprise appearances by olives and their ilk provide extra variety. Like the breads, the desserts are baked on site: syrup-soaked baklava, a nut cake called haxhimak, a sugar cookie with nuts pressed into the top whose Albanian name is sheqerpare. I like them best with coffee boiled on the stove in a long-handled brass pitcher and served on a matching tray, both of them engraved with ancient, geometric designs that repeat and repeat.

This is a familiar concept in Vietnam, where it is known as bo bay mon, as well as in San Jose, Calif., Houston and other areas with robust Vietnamese populations. In New York, where the Vietnamese restaurant scene is more anemic, bo bay mon is still a rarity. The rough outlines of the setup at Madame Vo, though, will be familiar to any New Yorker who has gone out for Korean barbecue. New York City bureaucracy is unwelcoming to the tabletop charcoal grills seen in Hanoi, so an electric grill under a metal screen is embedded in each table. Once the grill is switched on and the metal rods down at kneecap level begin to warm up, an array of sauces, condiments and vegetables will arrive. When the rods are red, a server with a pair of tongs will lay some meat down on the screen, return periodically to fiddle with it and eventually decide when it is ready to be eaten. The similarities with, say, Han Joo Chik Naeng Myun & BBQ in Queens end, of course, with the actual food. Yes, both offer lettuce for wrapping, but at Madame Vo BBQ it is part of a Vietnamese table salad, along with fresh herbs; raw cucumbers, pineapple and apple; and pickled carrots and daikon. The restaurant also sets out a nifty caddy that holds circles of rice paper and warm water, in a miniature bathtub, for wetting the paper until it is soft enough to fashion into rolls. Rather than gochujang and sesame oil, there is a classic Vietnamese nuoc cham, an intoxicatingly good version of the pineapple-and-fermented anchovy sauce known as mam nem, and lastly a tamarind sauce, which suggests Madame Vo BBQ can follow or leap over Vietnamese tradition at will. This is about what you'd expect if you've eaten at another restaurant, a few blocks north, simply called Madame Vo . Jimmy Ly is the chef in both places; he and his wife, Yen Vo, are the proprietors. Each was raised in the United States by immigrants from Vietnam, and like many children of immigrants they seem to be fluent not just in two languages but in two cultures, enabling them to serve dishes their families might recognize in a setting that outsiders might embrace. The wings at Madame Vo, sticky with caramel and fried garlic, are drive-straight-from-the-airport good. The restaurant produces some of the only pho in Manhattan worth talking about. One of them, in a porcelain bowl the size of a baptismal font, is filled with a potent beef broth, a short rib on the bone and enough other cuts to make a butcher smile. At least one dish at the couple's new restaurant can stand alongside the wings and the pho at their first: the oxtail congee. Congee, or chao thit bo, is customarily the last course in bo bay mon. It frequently takes the form of a cloudy beef-and-rice soup. Mr. Ly cooks his congee with some chicken stock until it has the consistency of polenta, then spoons over it some sweet and savory braised oxtails in honey, fish sauce and brown butter. Everything about it is wonderful, even the scallion greens on top. The first of the seven beefs is typically boi tai chanh, a raw beef salad, and this is a high point, too. Lean eye of round cut into thin pink sheets is the canvas for an action-painting whirl of fried shallots, raw red onions, chopped peanuts and slivers of fresh mint. Pretty standard stuff so far, but then Mr. Ly bathes the salad in tangerine-lime vinaigrette, which has a positively buoyant effect, and splashes it with a bright-green, lemony pulp of fresh rau ram pur\u00e9ed in oil. In the middle of this $59 menu come the grilled meats, the courses for which the table salad and rice paper wrappers have been waiting. The finest of these might be the relatively straightforward five-spice tongue, although the betel-leaf-wrapped bundles of seasoned ground beef -- bo la lot -- are soothing and stimulating at once, and the New York strip with marrow butter is a clever way to acknowledge Manhattan's own beef-eating rituals, even if it would draw blank stares on the streets of Saigon. If you, like me, are naturally skeptical when servers persistently push a big-ticket item, you might be tempted to blaze your own path through Madame Vo BBQ's menu. But once you've tried the bo bay mon you have, by and large, seen the kitchen at its best. Yes, you could get the whole catfish, and if you are not into beef perhaps you should. Despite what the menu says, the catfish is not grilled, but fried and then baked. It was perfectly done the night I had it, and was filleted at the table by a server who knew his way around a fish skeleton. By that time, all that was left to do was to wrap a chunk of fish in lettuce and rice paper with a squeeze of grilled lemon and some of the saut\u00e9ed shallots, lemongrass and bird chiles that the kitchen had ladled along the snaking curve of the spine. If you are thinking about a vegetable, the skewered and grilled okra pods in soy are crunchy and unslimy. The other appetizers, though, can be tricky. One night, the grilled scallop brushed with duck fat was transporting; on another, it tasted too much like the grill. Spring rolls filled with short rib and bone marrow seemed pointlessly indulgent, and so did their truffle hoisin dipping sauce in which I couldn't taste the truffles. A few dishes might have been improved if they'd arrived while hot, like the extra-large grilled oysters under caramelized sea urchin mayonnaise or the charred sea urchin, basted in its shell with butter, sake and fish sauce. Grilled prawns brushed with a lovely orange butter were slightly more mushy than two prawns sold for $38 should be. And while the 44-ounce tomahawk steak was more than a fair deal at $90, it would have been helped by a more aggressive sear and more salt. On certain nights, the whole operation had a slack, inattentive feeling that's rare in new restaurants. The catfish sat on the table, getting cold, while we waited for the table salad to show up. The thick stems of stir-fried morning glory would have been better cut into shorter lengths. Madame Vo BBQ may eventually run as smoothly as its older sibling. While it works out the mechanics, the surest route to happiness is to eat the bo bay mon while sipping cold coconut water through a metal straw out of a whole green coconut that you hold in one hand, like a cup of coffee.

The dish is Hong Kong-style won-ton noodle soup, though, which requires Maxi Lau, the chef and proprietor, to keep a large number of items on hand to be added to or subtracted from the soup at the customer's whim: the broth of pork bones boiled with dried shrimp; the skinny yellow noodles with their firm, elastic snap; the stewed beef cooked with a sizable pinch of five-spice powder; the dense fish balls streaked with scallions; the weightless, grease-free chips of fried fish skin; and so on. But the one item that is absolutely essential is the won ton. Make that plural -- won tons, as many as Ms. Lau will put into your bowl ($8). This turns out to be four if you also want noodles, and six if you don't. Years ago Ms. Lau's mother dreamed of opening a won-ton shop, and had gone to Toronto to learn the art of won-ton wrapping from a family friend. Those plans changed when she learned she had cancer. After she died, two years ago, Maxi Lau decided to rebuild her own life. Leaving her job in corporate management, she retraced her mother's steps, learning to make won tons with the same family friend. Three months ago, she started Maxi's as a pop-up every evening but Thursdays, taking over a Hong Kong-style breakfast and lunch cafe owned by an aunt in Flushing, Queens. Ms. Lau plans to set up a noodle soup shop of her own in another part of Flushing later this year. Until then, she is making more won tons than she expected, because customers keep coming back to buy them by the dozen, frozen. Ms. Lau's won tons are filled with a mixture of shrimp and pork, with the emphasis very much on the shrimp. Each bite -- it takes at least two to finish off a Maxi's Noodle won ton -- confirms that the shrimp are of very high quality and are cooked in a way that keeps them unusually crisp and juicy. You can see their bodies glowing pink through the thin skins of the wrappers, whose loose ends trail behind the plump, round won tons like comets' tails.

Another part is the sense of being in on a secret, eating at some place that doesn't have a Yelp entry and may not even have a name, while your friends are waiting in line at Roberta's . The mismatch between the borrowed space and the borrowers can send off sparks, too. Three years ago, when the Danish chef Bo Bech staged a one-night pop-up in the kitchen at Cosme in Manhattan, using ingredients he'd bought from farmers and shellfishers in Virginia the day before, his Mid-Atlantic-Nordic cooking stood out against the aromas of griddled masa and roasted chiles. When a pop-up settles down into a space of its own, it loses those things. In their place, it takes on the extra weight of proprietorship. The owners have to make decisions that were previously made for them, and those decisions will start to define them. It's their paint color on the wall, their scented candles in the bathroom, their name on the door. This is the position in which we find the former pop-up Oxalis and its chef, Nico Russell, a veteran of Daniel , in New York, and Mirazur , on the French Riviera. Beginning in 2016, Mr. Russell slalomed through a series of restaurants that would hand him the keys on off nights so he could cook tasting menus of 10 courses or so. First he inhabited Fitzcarraldo , an Italian restaurant whose combination of industrial, nautical, cinematic and Mediterranean elements has made it a frequent wedding site. Later he moved on to Egg , an austerely contemporary temple to breakfast which had begun its own life, more than a decade earlier, as a pop-up. He sold tickets to his Oxalis dinners, enough of them to get a few investors interested. With enough funding to take on a lease in Crown Heights, Oxalis opened in November in a former wine bar within sight of the Brooklyn Museum. Mr. Russell's vision for Oxalis is the one behind the bistronomie movement in France and its disciples abroad: carefully considered food served without the hoopla that drives up tabs. He slings a lot of vegetables in Oxalis's four- to six-course set menus, and it's one sign of his skill that this doesn't come across as a cost-cutting measure even though it must be, at least in part -- dinner is an extremely reasonable $60. Both the price and the understated cooking style reminded me of Contra , which opened with a five-course, $55 menu. The last time I went I ate a dish built around spaghetti-like strands of rutabaga under a warm snowdrift of whipped Alpine fontina. These two mild-tasting ingredients were set in motion by the force of a third, a dark and focused coffee-and-chicory cream sauce. This was a rutabaga that made me smile. Granted, I probably like rutabaga more than the average person, but I suspect that exposure to the rutabaga at Oxalis would make the average person realize that I'm right. Meals begin with a couple of bite-size snacks, one of which tends to be a crisp potato cake dusted with bay-leaf powder and topped with a chip of nori. It looks harmless enough, but can produce powerful emotions, which are easier to understand once you know that the potatoes are stewed in duck fat and then deep-fried. The other snack might be some lightly dehydrated beets brushed with marjoram-infused cream, or tiny grilled carrots that you dip in chamomile sabayon. (This is one of the dishes that suggests the long shadow of Noma , which in its early days famously matched aged carrots with chamomile.) The price seems meant to encourage frequent visits, but if you return often you may experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. At meals in December, January and February, I was always served some variation on raw sea scallops with daikon and apple and some version of duck breast, sweet potato and yogurt. The portions in both cases were restrained but the flavors were outsize. The scallops were cured in miso and refrigerated for a few days and came out of it with something like the concentration of flavor that beef gets from dry-aging, but none of the funk. The duck's flavor was less surprising, but there was some energy in its collision with sweet potato pur\u00e9e and fig-leaf yogurt tart enough to cause double-takes. Like the rest of the menu, desserts are unshowy but can be highly impressive. One worked goat milk up into a thing of beauty: Some of it was made into a simple frozen custard, the rest cooked down into cajeta. The cooking makes it clear why people chased Oxalis around Brooklyn in its various borrowed spaces, but other aspects of the restaurant suggest that it hasn't quite figured out how to live in a space of its own. A meal there can be a somewhat solemn experience, which doesn't seem to be what Mr. Russell and his partners are aiming for. The layout seems to work against it. The kitchen is right up front, and the bar is all the way in the back, separated from the dining room by a glass door in a glass wall. I can't imagine what the wall is for, unless Oxalis is planning to bring back the smoking section. Instead of serving as a street-side welcome and a source of energy for the dining room, the bar feels like a waiting room. And while it takes reservations, the tasting menu isn't served there. The bar menu is \u00e0 la carte. The dining room could use a little lift. It's as plain as a Shaker church, with clamshell-colored wainscoting below white walls unbroken by pictures or anything else. (All the art is in the restroom.) The way the servers have been coached on their lines so far underlines the decorative stiffness. They say stuff like \"Moving now into more sweet things \u2026\" rather than \"Here's your dessert,\" and my neighbor one night was instructed to \"sit back and relax,\" something that tends to go without saying in most restaurants. Things have loosened up since the liquor license came through. In the first few weeks, the servers were always trying to push a nonalcoholic beverage pairing for $20, and while the bar was mixing sodas that were more interesting than many cocktails around town, I'm not sure they were different enough from one another to justify drinking the whole slate. Now there are also wine pairings, starting at $35. Sometimes I wondered whether it would get the air circulating if the bar popped up in the dining room, or vice versa. There's probably some simple fix, or a series of them, that would give Oxalis some of its old sense of adventure. You can sense it lying there, waiting, when you taste that cajeta, those scallops, the fantastic little potato cakes.

At the same time, another style of French restaurant was dying off, but generally without benefit of a full obituary. This was the small, discreet bistro with forehead-height curtains in the windows, Piaf on the speakers, snails on the menu, chips on the china. They could be found uptown or downtown, almost always on a side street. Unlike Le Pavillon, La C\u00f4te Basque and their ilk, and unlike Keith McNally's immersive brasserie sets , which came later, these bistros were rarely fashionable. They were filled with professors and psychotherapists, Paris Review readers and Film Society of Lincoln Center members. Occasionally a passer-by out walking the dog would stand on tiptoe to peer over the curtain, but paparazzi did not stake out the doors of these establishments. Individually, few were landmarks. Collectively, their quiet continental self-assurance, their indifference to the passage of time, not to mention their cr\u00e8mes br\u00fbl\u00e9es and blood sausages and Fleuries, helped form the backdrop of the city. You always thought you'd have one within walking distance. Then, one day, you didn't. Bistro Pierre Lapin , which the chef and restaurateur Harold Moore opened last May in the West Village, is either a very late entry into the genre, or else a homage of impressive intensity. The dining room has the forehead-height curtains -- green gingham. It has Piaf on the playlist, and also Pink Martini's \"Sympathique,\" which has become the \"Vie en Rose\" of the Spotify era, for better or worse. Pierre Lapin also throws in some frills that go beyond the basic formula. White tapers burn on every table, wall sconces throw off Cognac-colored light from behind lampshades the size of teacups, a collection of thin flowery china dishes supplements the chunky white bistro ware. Most of all, Pierre Lapin has that rich, creamy, antique cooking -- all the stuff nouvelle cuisine tried to kill. As soon as you order, you get a preview of what you're in for: A length of chewy, substantial baguette arrives with a small mound of cultured butter, a pile of truffled cheese spread and a pink hunk of rustic pork p\u00e2t\u00e9. On a quiet night at home, this could serve as a light dinner. At Pierre Lapin, it is a little snack to stave off hunger before the appetizers. Going back at least as far as his days at Commerce , Mr. Moore has seemed at home with profuse helpings and sauces that settled over them like a goose-down duvet over a sleeping Saint Bernard. After closing that restaurant, he opened an ode to Southern immoderation called Harold's Meat & Three, now just Harold's ; the most memorable thing I've eaten there was a Kentucky hot brown sandwich on which the Mornay sauce flowed freely. He also briefly ran a less focused study of Americana called the Greenwich Grille, where I ate a chicken potpie that I thought had potential. About a week later, I learned that the place had closed. None of Mr. Moore's previous kitchens went for the gut quite as gleefully as Pierre Lapin's. Your first course there could well be, and almost certainly will be if you leave the choice to me, an avalanche of mushrooms in cream cascading over the edge of a tall slab of buttered and griddled pain de mie. But it would be a mistake to overlook the Brie au four, roughly half a pound of baked Brie melting among dried figs and walnuts, all served with toasted baguette. I ended up ordering the Brie for the table, which freed somebody else to get the very meaty frogs' legs in a small lake of parsley, garlic, butter and lemon juice, while another guest tried the \"balle de matzo en consomm\u00e9.\" In English, that means a nice bowl of chicken soup with a single matzo ball so densely packed that if you tossed it out of a second-story window it would probably put a dent in a car hood. This is not a bad trait in a matzo ball unless you happen to own the car. The lusty tune begun by the appetizers is picked up by the main courses. There is a fairly classic coq au vin, not too winy-tasting; some hefty sea scallops under toasted almonds, sensibly outfitted with endive and citrus sections; and a grouping of gnocchi, foie gras, saut\u00e9ed sweetbreads and mushrooms, black truffle shavings and puffy chicken dumplings, all milling around in a Cognac-flamed cream sauce. It sounds insanely overcrowded, but is very rewarding to unpack. We have only scratched the surface of the menu. It goes on, perhaps longer than it should, because some dishes are more appealing than others. A black sea bass \"bonne femme\" was simply dull instead of simple. The soupy, thin cassoulet could have used more meat and a thicker crust of bread crumbs. The garlic sauce Mr. Moore made for snails tasted less garlicky than run-of-the-mill snail butter; the snails and I never figured out what we were supposed to do with the sunny-side-up egg planted in the middle of the plate. The menu could be trimmed by about a third. The same is most likely true for a few individual dishes, although Mr. Moore's shambolic, celebratory cooking style is one of the reasons Pierre Lapin works as well as it does. If he tidied everything up he'd be going head-to-head with Le Coucou , a contest that would not play to his strengths. The excess, the untucked shirttails on the dishes, the incomplete thoughts on the menu are part of the restaurant's charm. That charm does not quite extend to the wine list, which looks like one from four decades ago. It's almost entirely drawn from Bordeaux, Burgundy and the Rhone, with very few bottles under $75. This seems to be taking the joke a little too far -- in 1971, you could still get cheap Bordeaux. I drank well, but I always spent more on it than I meant to, which is the kind of thing that can keep diners from coming back. For dessert there is a coconut cake that has little to do with France. Dense and rich in a homespun American style that some people will love and others will find too leaden, it followed Mr. Moore here from Commerce, where it was a big hit. Other members of the lineup you already know. The chocolate mousse is deliciously dark, though not as airy as it could be. The sugar crust on the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is burned to order. Both are overshadowed, though, by a peculiarly likable Pavlova. It is conceived as a tart, with a meringue crust and a whipped-cream topping; once it is sliced into a white wedge, bright yellow passion-fruit curd runs down its sides. Anna Pavlova would not recognize it, but she would have liked its sense of theater. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

To be fair, this was not the original plan at Shelsky's Brooklyn Bagels , either. The idea was to serve pork roll, egg and cheese sandwiches on a kaiser roll or one of the bakery's palm-size, hand-rolled bagels. Peter Shelsky, the bakery's owner, grew up in Manhattan, but he knew that some good things come from New Jersey, particularly pork roll, which he wanted to sell in the mornings. Also known as Taylor ham, pork roll is a cured, smoked and cooked meat product that has the tightly pebbled appearance of engineered stone, like a Corian countertop made of flesh. Pressing sliced pork roll on a hot griddle intensifies its saltiness while giving it a hint of a crust that contrasts attractively with the slightly spongy interior. Griddled pork roll, combined with a cooked egg and a slice of American cheese, is eaten across New Jersey as a breakfast sandwich. Usually it is found on a kaiser roll. Sometimes it is seen on a bagel. But some Shelsky's customers requested it on a freshly baked bialy, and others followed, and now pork roll sandwiches made on bialys are nearly as popular as the ones made on rolls, with bagels a distant third. The bialy might have been custom-made for the job, particularly the ones at Shelsky's, which are baked to a darker brown, their thumbprint divots filled with a more robustly caramelized onion confit, than garden-variety bialys. Both traits are intensified if you have the bialy thoroughly toasted, as the person behind the counter will almost certainly recommend.

The area is marked by a cluster of restaurants. Some have a washed-up feeling, as if they'd all been drifting along in Bedford's currents and had been stranded there. A few stand out in the landscape. In the fall, Cherry Point took a decisive turn into the second category when a new chef took over, but not everyone in the neighborhood seems to realize it yet. People still tumble in for happy hour, when servers whose hairstyles take a minute to adjust to will pour three-gulp martinis, manhattans and Rob Roys (due for a revival) in little Nick & Nora glasses for $8 each, and then after happy hour ends at 7 p.m. most of the crowd generally drifts out to find somewhere else for dinner. The space, with its old-timey wainscoting and its central bar, is easy to mistake for a tavern. Let's say you were among those who stayed put. Contemporaneously with your cocktail, you worked on a few smoked olives, green and warm; swirled a few of the golden, bite-size pig's head croquettes in a pale-pinkish ketchup made from pears; and became curious about what else this kitchen was up to. At one point you noticed that the dining room suddenly smelled like an herb garden in August, and a minute later Belon oysters on a nest of smoking rosemary branches sailed out of the kitchen opening that lights up the back of the restaurant. You ordered a plate of your own because you wanted to know how the warm oysters would taste under their yellow blankets of smoked rosemary hollandaise. From a short list of charcuterie you chose the squab and pork terrine, with a few prunes embedded into the pink and pleasingly coarse-grained slab. You spread this on toast with creamy whole-grain mustard, apricot-ginger mostarda or some of the pear ketchup, all of them made on the premises, like the pearl onions pickled in beer and the terrine itself. And you might have thought: If these are just the snacks, what is the food going to be like when this kitchen gets down to business? Whatever happens, odds are there will be meat on the table. Cherry Point opened in 2016, taking over what had been a Polish restaurant called Cinamoon. The charcuterie was made on site from the start, but the menu swerved in a more meat-focused and English-leaning direction last fall when Ed Szymanski was hired as the chef. This might have been predicted, if not from Mr. Szymanski's English upbringing and British citizenship, then from his work history. He has cooked at the Beatrice Inn , where various beasts of air and land are posed on silver platters for their roles in a fall-of-Rome spectacle; the Spotted Pig , in the days when it was still known for burgers basted in Roquefort and toasts buried under chopped chicken livers; and Pitt Cue , a London outpost of the modern, urbanized barbecue genre. For a panoramic tour of Mr. Szymanski's accumulated meat wisdom, you could call two days ahead and reserve a game-and-beef dinner, $65 for at least four courses along the lines of grilled tongue on watercress. The everyday menu, though, is not exactly made up of grain bowls. On any given night, you can drop in and marvel at the fried lamb ribs, their apple glaze augmented by broken coriander and fennel seeds and raw curls of shallot. The quail will be butterflied, grilled over charcoal and served on toast, with pickled prunes above it and a reduction swirled with port below. The duck breast will be seared down until the skin is a thin brown sheet next to pink and juicy meat. This is served with roasted, pur\u00e9ed celery root and br\u00fbl\u00e9ed pears. The plates are marked by a refinement and moderation that is not always achieved by other chefs in the guts-and-fat school of cookery. A creamy pheasant, leek and bacon pie is sealed inside a cast-iron pot by a beauty of a suet crust -- lacquered, scored in a starburst and very tender. Care is even lavished on the grilled rib-eye for two, which comes to the table with neatly sawed lengths of bone marrow under a tidy crust of parsley, chives, pickle shallots and buttered bread crumbs. Mr. Szymanski does not gesture toward fish and vegetables very often, but when he does he generally musters some conviction. True, the roasted pumpkin mash with toasted hazelnuts and fresh cheese has an obligatory air, as does the grilled bread with labneh and honey. But the smoked whitefish salad, with caramelized shallots and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and a side of saltines, is more energetic than you might guess. Grilled flatbread looks out of place on this menu, but it is a fine canvas for roasted hens-of-the-woods and other wild mushrooms that are fleshy and flavorful enough to get noticed on their own. Skate, a main course, comes with smoked German butterball potatoes and a soaring, fino sherry-laced beurre blanc. The salad of radicchio and other bitter lettuces is as crisp and refreshing as any plate of leaves can be in February. It is also a very good thing to eat with steak, as it happens. Anyone who has not caught on to the English theme so far will get a last chance with the dessert menu, which offers treacle tart, sticky toffee pudding, a posset and three cheeses, all from England. The treacle tart was dry when I had it. The sticky toffee pudding was surprisingly but not unpleasantly cakelike. The posset, though, is a small miracle, an eggless custard of sugar, lemon juice and cream scented with Earl Grey tea, dressed up with Cara Cara orange wedges and a few Earl Grey meringues. There should be more possets around town. There should be possets galore. And by the way, there should be more wine lists like Cherry Point's. Assembled by Garret Smith, who owns the restaurant with Vincent Mazeau, it consistently favors obscure and surprising over familiar and dull. By the bottle, there are oddities such as apple wine and mead, but also a few things you might have heard of: a cremant d'Alsace from Dirler Cad\u00e9, a Sybille Kuntz riesling, an Olga Raffault chinon and a lean, exact pinot noir from Enderle & Moll. Only two bottles, both sparkling wines, are over $100, and most of the others are closer to $50. At these prices, you could just close your eyes and pick something, which is lucky because the servers, though charming and truly unpretentious, haven't fully internalized the list's ins and outs. It's one of the ways in which Cherry Point seems not to have caught up yet with how good it has become. If you treat it like a bar, you might not notice. But if you eat the way I did, ordering half the menu at a time, you could be putting more stress on the infrastructure than it can handle. You might be in for a very slow meal. But it will also be a very good meal. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

They're easy to find these days, as consumers from around the globe fire off countless raves and pans about every known restaurant, cafe, chili counter, falafel cart and cr\u00eaperie, not to mention post offices and jails. These mash notes and spitballs rain down endlessly not just from traditional review sites like TripAdvisor and Yelp (171 million reviews at last count) and retailers like Amazon, but also from Facebook and Google, those all-purpose giants. Everybody's a critic, right? I happen to get paid for criticism, and I would like to criticize that old platitude right out the window: No, everybody is not a critic. What most of you are doing out there, online and in three dimensions, is complaining. When we complain, we experience something that we don't like and we say something about it. A critic doesn't write about his own dissatisfaction, or doesn't just do that. A critic has to poke his head out of his turtle shell, look around and gesture, with stubby legs, toward the sources of dissatisfaction. Done perceptively, with analytic thinking and an effort to connect the dots between this experience and others, this can be the beginning of a value system that readers might share, or reject, or at least attempt to understand. Complaining is as easy as breathing. Writing criticism is a real pain. That was a complaint, by the way. But criticism and complaint are closely related enough for me to know that there's a lot of complaining going on, and that most of the complaints aren't having any effect at all. This may not be the point. People who study complaints divide them into two categories, instrumental and expressive. An instrumental complaint is \"directed toward a specific target and intended to bring about a specific outcome,\" according to Robin Kowalski, a professor of psychology at Clemson University who has studied the social functions of complaining. Calling a restaurant's owner the next day to say that you waited an hour for dessert and don't intend to come back is an instrumental complaint. Texting a friend to say the polar vortex is making your skin peel off is an expressive complaint. We call expressive complaints venting, kvetching, griping or a number of other names. It's important to know which of the two types of complaint is right for you before opening the first can of invective. Venting has its uses. In one study, Dr. Kowalski and some colleagues showed that when we are asked to put our feelings of dissatisfaction with somebody into writing, our \"positive affect\" -- good feelings, basically -- will rise about 15 minutes later, after an initial downswing. In the same way, if a meal lets you down, taking a pair of pliers and a blowtorch to the restaurant on Yelp might give you a brief lift. But once the rush of having gotten it off your chest is gone, you'd realize nothing has changed. You're still out the price of dinner, and you won't find out whether your grievance has reached the right ears unless somebody at the restaurant responds. Some owners make a point of scouring review sites so they can do just that. Others use the review's date and details to identify and get in touch with the kvetcher. But there are more direct ways to get your gripe acknowledged than scrawling it on the walls of the internet. \"If there's something that's really bothering you, the ultimate benefits are going to come from targeted complaining ,\" Dr. Kowalski said. \"Telling the person or restaurant.\" I know, I know. This is the part I avoid, too, by saving all my criticisms for my reviews. I hate confrontations, I run from them, I'd rather pay the check, even with my own money, and walk out never to return. But let's say you want something out of your complaint. Maybe you just want a rib-eye that's still rare instead of the overdone paving stone you were served. Or you have a reason for wanting an item taken off your bill. Or (and I think this is what most people are looking for when they complain) you just want somebody to look you in the eye and say: \"So sorry about that. Is there anything we can do to make it right?\" Whatever you want, you're more likely to get it if you have a word with a manager either before you leave or later on. As a side benefit, you'll be helping the restaurant, too; when somebody is un happy at the end of a meal, almost any manager or restaurateur wants to know. \"We actually really welcome complaints,\" said Melinda Shopsin, a film producer who cooks and waits tables at Shopsin's, her family's restaurant on the Lower East Side. This may come as a surprise to anyone who has heard the numerous accounts of customers' being tossed out of Shopsin's for any number of arcane infractions. And yet, Ms. Shopsin says that when her mother was still alive, she would ask what was wrong when she saw an unfinished plate, and then take a bite to see for herself. At other restaurants, this exploratory bite may happen backstage, in the kitchen. If you're going to make an instrumental complaint, though, you still need to figure out whether the reasons you're unhappy are subjective or objective. Did Medieval Times undercook the chicken, or do you just not like eating with your hands? Even if you're pretty sure the problem is objective, it can be useful to pretend it's subjective, for the sake of diplomacy. The chef John Tesar recalls a night, soon after he'd opened his Knife steakhouse in Dallas, when he got into an argument with a customer about the weight of a steak -- an objective complaint if ever there was one. \"We had a 33-ounce rib-eye for two,\" Mr. Tesar said. One customer who ordered it wasn't convinced and began \"screaming,\" according to Mr. Tesar: \"\u2018This steak is too small! This isn't enough to feed all of us!'\" He went to the table, and the hostilities quickly escalated, he said, until \"I went into the kitchen, got a scale, grabbed the steak, weighed it in front of her, and said, \u2018It's 36 ounces!'\" The story ends happily, with the two combatants meeting again at a dinner party some time later and getting along swimmingly. \"We both realized how absurd and insecure we were being,\" he said. All this might have been avoided if the complaint had been cast subjectively: \"That steak looks smaller than we expected. Are you sure it's the one we ordered?\" Subjective complaints are still important data for restaurants. If one person doesn't like the new hot-dog lasagna, it's an aberration. If 15 people don't like it, the recipe probably needs to go back to the workshop. The chef or owner needs to know this, but also needs to hear it in terms that won't lead to a screaming match in the dining room . Perhaps you have seen Gordon Ramsay critique another chef's cooking on television? Don't do it like that. In general, the more specific your complaint, the more likely it is to be understood. The worst, most useless and potentially dangerous complaints are broad, sweeping condemnations. \"There is complaining that makes you think about what you're doing, and there is complaining where everybody thinks they're entitled to say anything,\" said Rita Sodi, the chef and owner of the Tuscan restaurant I Sodi in Manhattan. \"Saying, \u2018This is terrible' is not complaining. That is being rude. It's like, \u2018You're ugly.' It's telling me that I'm ugly. It's personal. It's my food.\" Even when the person you're grousing to did not cook your pasta personally, you should proceed gently, in nonconfrontational terms. It may be helpful to imagine that you are speaking with an air traffic controller trying to land 20 jets during a snowstorm; you would try very hard not to add to the overall stress level in the tower, even if your child was on one of those jets. \"If you can be patient, open and polite, that's really helpful,\" Ms. Shopsin said. \"The more collaborative and open you can be -- \u2018Excuse me, I'm sorry' -- even though it's not your fault that it got messed up. People have to understand that sometimes to fix a mistake is not easy.\" And sometimes, a restaurant can make customers happy by changing something that isn't a mistake at all. Occasionally, diners at Shopsin's who had ordered migas complained about finding cilantro in the dish. Initially, the response would be that migas are supposed to have cilantro. Which may be true, but perhaps wasn't the point. Now, Ms. Shopsin asks customers whether they like cilantro. If the answer is no, there won't be any in their food, even if, strictly speaking, it belongs there. \"Complaints do help change things,\" she said.

Typically simmered with chicken, mole poblano was a staple of takeout joints and lunch counters and restaurants before anyone took Mexican food in New York seriously. All the other moles -- Oaxaca's mole verde, say, which gets its green color from pumpkin seeds, tomatillos and fresh herbs -- were about as rare as a mandarin duck in Central Park. In recent years, as these once-exotic species have become regular features of the menus at Cosme , Empell\u00f3n , Claro and other restaurants, mole poblano has become something like the pigeon of Mexican sauces, too common and familiar to be worth noticing. If you share this low view of mole poblano, you owe it to yourself to have the one at Casa Enrique . The chef, Cosme Aguilar, calls it mole de Piaxtla, after the Pueblan town where his father grew up, and as a reminder that there is not just one mole poblano but many. Some have apple in addition to raisins. Some are thickened with animal crackers. Mr. Aguilar remembers that in his childhood home, plantains were allowed to hang until they were black before they could be pounded into mole. Maybe this explains the particular sweetness of Casa Enrique's version, which is not the candy-bar sweetness of some. It's deep and complicated. The character of this mole de Piaxtla unfurls as you eat, whether the sauce has been soaked into enchiladas filled with chicken or simply pooled on a plate over and under a quartered chicken and yellow rice cooked with peas. Mr. Aguilar has been frying, blending and stirring mole de Piaxtla since Casa Enrique opened in 2012, just off Vernon Boulevard, in Long Island City, Queens. In fact, he has barely changed his menu since our Hungry City critic, Ligaya Mishan, reviewed it the next year. Mr. Aguilar says he is emulating the restaurants he likes best in Mexico, ones whose kitchens make the same dishes year in and year out. Whether despite this or because of it, the restaurant seems to have improved in subtle ways. Acoustic panels tacked to the ceiling make conversation easier. Servers, always welcoming, have become experts at anticipating the meal's ebb and flow. They'll step in just when you're ready for a fresh drink, maybe a margarita with some tamarind this time to offset the raw-sugar syrup. They'll gauge the precise moment when you're ready to have dinner plates cleared to make room for dessert. Or they'll break away from your table just long enough to join in a full-throated singing of \"Happy Birthday\" around a slice of tres leches cake with a candle stuck in it on the other side of the room. This may happen three or four times a night, probably not because Casa Enrique looks particularly festive -- from floor to ceiling, it's done almost entirely in white -- but, I'd guess, because regulars know it regularly outperforms any number of other restaurants that might seem to be more special on the surface but aren't, really. Also, the tres leches cake, if not as soggy with condensed milk as it could be, is still pretty good, though I think the flan is almost mandatory, and it, too, is a perfectly credible birthday-candle holder. Although the guacamole is freshly mashed and pleasingly minimalist, I tend to skip it as long as the people I'm with don't mind. Instead I'll head straight for the two-bite sopecitos topped with refried beans and loose chorizo, or the albondigas in cumin-laced chipotle sauce, each of the three meatballs stuffed with hard-cooked eggs. The best Mexican seafood dishes often come from restaurants that specialize in them. Mr. Aguilar, though, seems equally at home with fish and meat. The market fish offered as a main course -- lately a black sea bass -- has always been seared to a crisp on the skin side. Still, in all these years I've never been convinced that the corn under it compares to the best street-corner esquites, or that it and the fish really add up to a whole dish. The seafood appetizers, on the other hand, are some of my favorite things at Casa Enrique: the delicately fried oysters sitting in a mayonnaise that gets its tangerine color from ground chiles; the ceviche, freshly tossed with lime and herbs; the crab tostadas, loaded with a thin slice or two of Serrano chile, chopped tomato, leaves of cilantro, smooth avocado salsa and a spoonful of crab meat, pure and clean; and the shrimp cocktail, which gets its roundness and slight richness, I think, from orange soda, just the way you'd hope. Mr. Aguilar is not one of those chefs who set up masa factories in their basements. Casa Enrique's corn tortillas do not have the pretty floral aromas of Cosme's, or the sweet, focused corn flavor you taste in Claro's. But they are better than you'd find almost anywhere else in New York. They give a boost to the tacos, made with braised tongue or brisket; crumbled chorizo; or fried, battered fish, and they are especially delicious soaked in salsa verde and wrapped around roasted poblanos in cream to make enchiladas Do\u00f1a Blanca. And while Cosme's more modern approach has soaked up more media attention, I've encountered more bloops and wobbles eating there than I have exploring the far more traditional menu at Casa Enrique. It isn't necessarily the more interesting restaurant, but it's the one where I'm more confident that if I went there tonight, everything would taste exactly the way it was supposed to. The pozole will be dark and intense, though not especially spicy, with tender strands of pork in the broth and all the usual mix-ins waiting on the side. The pork ribs will be slowly braised, in the style of Chiapas, in a thick cooked salsa built on a foundation of guajillo chiles. These ribs are not to be confused with the baby back ribs, cooked in an even thicker, creamier pipian rojo, that sometimes turn up as a daily special. Best of all, perhaps, will be the chamorro de borrego, or lamb shank stewed with chickpeas; it will be very tender and very flavorful in its rough sauce of pulla chiles with crushed guaje seeds. The name of that sauce is huaxmole, or sometimes guaxmole, or even mole de guaje. Yes, it's a mole, and one that rarely flies as far north as New York City. At Casa Enrique, it has found a permanent perch. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

I could see this because the car and I were sharing a room on West 14th Street. The car was in the back and I was in the middle, sitting at one of the cafe tables near the stairs to the second floor, where there is a bar shaped like a wheel and a restaurant with a menu devised by Gregory Marchand, the chef of the Frenchie restaurants in Paris and London. The employees in all of these rooms work for the Union Square Hospitality Group , which I suppose means that Danny Meyer, the group's founder and one of the world's best-known restaurateurs, is now also in the business of polishing automobiles. The whole operation is called Intersect by Lexus , which gives you a good idea who made the car and was paying to keep it shiny and free of dust. Intersect by Lexus is one of those modern places where brands, instead of asking you to buy one of their products then and there, instead try to make you feel the kinds of emotions about the brand that may lead to a sale later on. This is a job formerly performed by advertisements. In fact, Lexus used to publish a print magazine and mail it to its customers, back when that seemed like a good way to persuade people to have emotions about a car. Now we live in the age of the \"branded experience.\" A toilet-paper manufacturer will send you a wheeled toilet on demand . A mattress company will encourage you to sleep inside a roaming \"napmobile.\" Makers of a crunchy orange snack open restaurants, lasting just a few days , where chefs put the crunchy orange snack into meatballs, tacos, cheesecakes and everything else. You cannot get Anne Burrell to sprinkle a Lexus over the top of your mac and cheese, however, and not just because the cheapest one costs $33,000 more than a bag of crunchy orange snacks. Intersect by Lexus takes a different approach, closer to that of A/D/O , a \"creative hub\" in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, owned by the car brand Mini. A/D/O offers temporary exhibitions, talks, performances, work spaces for designers and a sun-filled, roomy Scandinavian cafe whose kitchen was, for a time, overseen by the chef Fredrik Berselius and the restaurateur Claus Meyer . (Mr. Berselius is no longer involved.) When I ate at the cafe, shortly after A/D/O opened, the food barely dented my consciousness, although I remember thinking that if I worked nearby I probably would drop in for lunch or a cortado. In the same way, if I find myself in the meatpacking district by day, I might join the Wi-Fi philosophers who occupy the spindle-backed chairs downstairs at Intersect, just so I could get a maple-bacon scone, a recipe imported from Frenchie to Go on the Rue du Nil in Paris. On the other hand, I'd go well out of my way to eat upstairs at Intersect again. It's not a restaurant in three dimensions -- the service, while skilled, is a bit anonymous, and the interior is a hodgepodge of expensive, subtle design and bric-a-brac that might have been ordered from a catalog. But the food is some of the most engaging I've come across in the past few months, and it will go away after the end of March, when Mr. Marchand's menu will be replaced by one devised by another chef from somewhere else in the world, chosen by representatives from Union Square Hospitality Group and Lexus. (A formal review, with stars, would be obsolete almost as soon as it was published.) I've never made it to Frenchie or its branch in London. Many New York chefs have, however, and working my way through Mr. Marchand's dishes at Intersect helped me understand what other restaurants around town have been trying to imitate: the charred leaves, the cooked grains, the gently swirling patterns that suggest the chef has been plating food on a turntable. Grilled baby leek greens angled out around a pile of barley topped with what looked like a deviled egg. It was, in fact, a smoked and lemon-spiked yolk plopped in the center of some \"whites\" made of Parmesan sabayon. Spice and crunch came from puffed barley dusted with piment d'Espelette. It was just tricky enough, this dish. And I loved the way a caraway brioche, pickled mustard seeds and cucumbers completed the deli allusions begun by a foie gras terrine with layers of soft, smoky pastrami. There was a very welcome spin on skate grenobloise in which the fish was replaced by creamy white halibut under a golden bread-crumb crust; sea beans extended the briny flavor of capers in the brown butter sauce. And if this all sounds a bit cerebral, the big, pillowy, pan-seared gnocchi with fried sweetbreads and veal-glazed mushrooms proved that Mr. Marchand knows the appeal of animal instincts. What to make of those few dishes that did not come together -- the pebbles of cauliflower under a layer of seeds and nuts that looked as if it had spilled from a bird feeder, or the lukewarm chocolate mousse at the bottom of a deep bowl? Was the problem Mr. Marchand's recipes? The way the Union Square Hospitality kitchen crew, led by Nickolas Martinez, had carried them out? The local terroir? Mr. Martinez and Dylan Shipsey, the general manager, say they want customers to feel as if they are walking into Frenchie in Paris. Intersect does not have the premodern limestone wall and ceiling timbers of the Rue du Nil, but Mr. Marchand tried to sprinkle some Right Bank pixie dust on West 14th Street by choosing the plates and bowls, consulting on flower arrangements and sharing his Spotify playlists. Maybe those things help. But the dining room, by the design firm Wonderwall , mostly looks like money to me, apart from the shelves half-filled with coffee-table books, black crow figurines and other eerily generic knickknacks. At least somebody had the good sense to keep the car downstairs, by the restrooms, before it was rolled out last weekend to make room for another temporary exhibition. In what may not be a good sign for Lexus, nobody paid much attention to it when I was there, but somebody was always marveling about the toilets, the Japanese kind that seem to know exactly what you are going to do before you do. The chef-in-residence conceit is not unique to Intersect. On Mulberry Street, Chefs Club also turns its permanent kitchen crew over to somebody else's menu; a new restaurant in Houston, the Decatur Bar & Popup Factory , gives its entire space to prospective restaurateurs for three months at a time so they can test-drive their ideas before going out on their own. The chefs of Contra , in Manhattan, and other restaurants sometimes turn over the menu to friends of theirs for a night or two. The most ambitious experiment in this vein may be In Situ , the restaurant inside the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art that on any given day faithfully reproduces a dozen or so dishes that are strongly identified with other restaurants around the world. To understand the appeal for chefs of these pop-ups and residencies, think about the Instagram posts, the email-address caches, the preview news items, even the occasional reviews they generate. For a few months' or even a few nights' work, a restaurant can refresh its aura of newness and relevance. In an era that feeds on novelty, chefs who just keep plugging along can seem older than they really are. The events make the host restaurant look cooler, too. (It's been a while since Union Square Hospitality Group hired a chef who got menu analysts chattering the way Mr. Marchand does.) And of course, people who go to these dinners can boast about them on social media. It's a big, beautiful marketing ecosystem in which everybody from predators to bottom feeders gets to believe they're at the top of the food chain.

It's as if the past 15 years in food never happened. The menu seems to be stuck in some time between 1994, when Thomas Keller bought the French Laundry, and 2004, when he opened Per Se with a young Jonathan Benno leading the kitchen. The restaurant will probably be a tough sell to those diners who expect all restaurants to fall on a continuum between Noma and the Salt Bae place . But I prefer it to any number of newer, self-consciously modern restaurants, some of which are so determined to be of the moment that they might as well have a time stamp. Benno is not trying to be contemporary. It's trying to be delicious. And it is, from start to finish, almost without exception. Benno is the third of three dining operations that Mr. Benno opened last year in the Evelyn Hotel , on East 27th Street. It is the one where the prices, and presumably the stakes, are highest. We know it is a statement restaurant because Mr. Benno has put his name on it, for the first time in his career. Whatever the statement is, it is not forward-looking. Most of the statement is in French (barigoule, mousseline, t\u00eate de veau, b\u00e9arnaise), a significant part is in Italian (carnaroli risotto, garganelli verde, pecorino ginepro) and not one word is in Danish or Mandarin. The statement has a lot to say on the topics of stocks and pur\u00e9es and accurate chopping and patient skimming; it is entirely silent on the subjects of fermented vegetables, or foraging, or immigration, or food deserts, or hashtags. The statement is delivered in a windowless hotel dining room to people sitting comfortably on black-leather chairs or velvet banquettes the color of a pinot noir from the Loire Valley. It takes the form of a fixed number of courses, three or four or five, your choice. One will be dessert and one a main course. None of them is a small plate meant for sharing. None is a large-format plate either, unless you count the veal sirloin chop that arrives on a silver platter in slices that are as pink and delicately shaded as the cheek on any blushing young aristocrat Fragonard ever painted. The presentations are not overly dramatic. They can be disarmingly modest, like the cold slice of fish terrine that appeared before the appetizers one night looking pale and somewhat lost. I barely noticed it. Then I tasted fennel and other bouillabaisse flavors and -- excuse me, what was your name again? -- I started to pay attention. It is not news that the liquid yolk of an egg tastes good trickled over baby leeks, fingerlings, black-truffle froth and pioppini mushrooms the size of shirt buttons. But just how good it is makes an interesting item. Lamb saddle, with grill marks that could come from a steakhouse, is served with fairytale eggplant and Thumbelina carrots. Each vegetable in this miniature garden is planted in a pur\u00e9e or a reduced essence of itself. Each is very good, and the carrots are fantastic. Alongside them sits lamb breast that has been pressed into a rich little brick coated in bread crumbs. One corner of this brick sits in a dark-green spread that tastes like gremolata. Not one combination of flavors on this plate is original, and it doesn't matter at all. The Italian food that Mr. Benno made at his last restaurant, Lincoln Ristorante , could be impressive, but I sometimes had the sense that he was cooking from the outside in, trying to unlock the flavors of Italy through process and method. The results didn't always match the evident effort. I still got a bit of that feeling from his food at Leonelli Taberna , in the back of the Evelyn lobby. It's supposed to be the hotel's casual Italian restaurant, and it would be if you didn't sometimes catch the food trying to relax. Only a lasagna with green noodles below a dark field of browned b\u00e9chamel seemed completely comfortable with itself. (On the streetside end of the hotel is a pastry shop and bakery selling two-foot-long flatbreads called focaccia that have more in common with Roman pizza al taglio.) The cooking at Benno, overseen by Justin Skribner, the chef de cuisine, doesn't appear to be plagued by a similar anxiety. The French ideas, like a drum of pig's trotter under a fried quail egg with flageolets and other beans, or the darkly seared duck breast with melting foie gras and a savory triangle of duck leg, dates and pistachios in brik pastry, have an easy inevitability. Pasta is unlikely to become the thing Benno is known for. Still, when the kitchen stretches to Italy, nice things happen. Lobster fra diavolo, with the bent shells called lumache, is a tribute to an American pop hit made over, in the Thomas Keller tradition, with maximum clarity and precision. Spaghetti made with grano arso, or burned-wheat flour, tasted pleasantly toasted rather than incinerated as it soaked up the liquor of tiny hard-shell clams and a soft mass of very fresh sea urchin roe. Technique never overplayed its hand in these dishes. The only time it came up short was when a drum of steelhead salmon poached in olive oil arrived slightly mushy and underdone. A week later, the fish was cooked more successfully. The scope of the Evelyn's dining operation is big enough to support a full-time baker (Lisa Kalemkiarian, responsible for Benno's needle-tipped mini-baguettes, among other items) and pastry chef (Lindsey Bittner, whose desserts include a rosemary flan with candied cranberries that I ordered every time I went, so I could watch other people try it for the first time). You couldn't call the wine list dated, with its unwashed, uncombed natural types among other groomed, sedate numbers, and some fine values between $50 and $75 tiptoeing among the super-Tuscans and 2005 Bordeaux. All this should persuade some skeptics to give Benno a try. The restaurant's greatest challenge is that the food seems to come from an era that's too old to seem fresh but too recent to feel nostalgic about. When pop music is that age, we cringe. When buildings are that age, we knock them down before they can be landmarked. But sometimes one chef cooking what he believes is better than 10 chefs cooking what somebody else believes.

Its opening, in 2003, may have marked Manhattan's capitulation to a retail landscape ruled by chains rather than independent, homegrown businesses. For diners, the mall is best known for its eating-and-drinking zone named, with matchless pretentiousness, the Restaurant Collection. This brought us Per Se and Masa , which overnight made the city's other high-end restaurants seem as affordable as Veselka . It was the start of a new class of restaurants where dinner would be priced like a luxury good, with entry-level meals that today cost $300 or more. Much more, in Masa's case. The purpose of this exclusivity was to signal to people with money to spend that they would be comfortable spending it in the Shops at Columbus Circle. For the same reason, businesses that were too far down-market were not welcome as tenants. This is why there's a Whole Foods Market but not a Family Dollar. So those of us who follow David Chang's mind along its switchbacks and cul-de-sacs have to wonder if he was being subversive when he decided to install Bang Bar , which is essentially a shawarma stand, on the mall's third floor. Mr. Chang is a close observer of the ways society assigns high status to the food of some cultures and devalues the cooking of others. One of his greatest hits is a riff about New Yorkers who complain about $17 bowls of ramen while paying $30 for spaghetti. If he has a routine about vertical rotisseries I've never heard it, but surely he is alive to the associations they conjure, from Greek diners to taco trucks to the Halal Guys carts parked near Columbus Circle. If anybody grasps the cultural implications of bringing $6 street-meat sandwiches indoors where they can perfume the air breathed by consumers of Pink shirts and Floga furs, it is Mr. Chang. Bang Bar might make more sense as a provocation than a business concern. It begins serving at 8:30 a.m. and closes when the food is gone, usually by 1 or 2 p.m. In the weeks after its opening, on Halloween, the lines were worthy of the Department of Motor Vehicles. Employees tried to appease the horde by handing out off-the-menu snacks, like rice porridge with fermented shiitakes, and asking whimsical survey questions. (\"Do you keep peanut butter in the fridge?\") After Mr. Chang opened a Momofuku Noodle Bar in the space next door, Bang Bar's crowds grew somewhat more manageable, and when I showed up for breakfast at the end of December, there was no line at all. Maybe Deutsche Bank employees will keep Bang Bar's early shift afloat, but right now its success seems to hinge on the lunch rush. There are two rotisseries. After 11 a.m., one spit is buried deep inside a missile of dark chicken marinated with a yakitori-style glaze. The other is at the center of a red, dripping, gochujang-rubbed tower of pork. Ideally, whichever meat you choose will have built up a dark outer bark that can be lopped off with a few knife strokes and stacked on to a disc of griddled flatbread. The bread, thicker than a tortilla and less oily than a roti, will be rolled tight, like a cigarette, then bent in half, with both open ends at the top. This is called, in Bang Bar parlance, a U. The chicken or pork can also be piled over a bowl of rice, but the bread is really very good. A close relative of the flatbread Mr. Chang's crew originated at Majordomo in Los Angeles, it is perceptibly tangy and salted, without being salty. A couple of condiments -- including habanero salsa and the brick-red Ssam Sauce used, in various iterations, to italicize Noodle Bar's pork buns and a hundred other creations in Mr. Chang's Momofuku restaurant group -- are kept out on a counter alongside the moist towelettes. But they're hard to apply once a U has been rolled. What I did want was a spoonful or two of raw white onions, some chopped cucumber, maybe parsley or cilantro -- the kind of simple salad that is almost always lobbed into a shawarma or a doner kebab. Both the chicken and pork are slightly sweet, and could use a lift. The lunch menu also has two dips -- a darkly fascinating, spicy eggplant spread, or whipped chickpeas whose sharp, pecorino-like flavor betrays the presence of Hozon, the fermented chickpea paste invented in a Momofuku laboratory. They are alluring enough, but the real reason to order them is the bread, puffier and softer than the one that wraps the U. A smaller version of this, maybe five inches across, is folded in half like a taco to make a \"mini,\" which replaces the U at breakfast. It is no great shock that this bread works nicely with smoked salmon and scallion cream cheese blended with just enough soy sauce to make it arguably Asian. It is more flavorful than a bagel and better at holding everything together. But it is somewhat surprising how delicious a freshly griddled mini is with caper-scallion cream cheese, salted cucumber, tomato and fresh dill inside. The whole thing tastes alive in a way that a bagel with a schmear of veggie cream cheese never will. I've saved the breakfast mini with mortadella for last, although it's been the subject of the most rapt online attention. Building logs of mortadella layered with lardo and roasting them on spits is exactly the sort of thing the Momofuku group was put on this earth to do. I am glad this revolving meat torpedo exists. I respect Bang Bar's cooks -- this collaborative effort has no chef, Mr. Chang said in a phone interview -- for realizing that the proper garnish for caramelized mortadella shavings is a slice of yellow American cheese and hot mustard. I appreciate the respect the sandwich pays to both fried baloney and Taylor Ham. And if I were in the habit of turning up at Columbus Circle with a hangover in the mornings, I would probably become a regular consumer of mortadella minis with Ssam Sauce. With a clear head and stomach, though, the saltiness can be a little too bracing. At either meal, Bang Bar offers a cinnamon roll modeled on the kkwabaegi, the twisted Korean doughnut stick. It is baked rather than fried, making it a rare example of a Momofuku dish that contains less fat than its inspiration. It is a fine pastry to have with Bang Bar's Vietnamese coffee, even after you learn that the cream cheese icing contains fermented chickpeas. By the way, bang, or bbang or ppang, depending on how you like your Korean words transliterated, means bread. So this shawarma joint inside a mall is officially a bread bar, which makes sense given how pleasant the bread is. Still, I can't help wondering how the people in charge of the Restaurant Collection felt about welcoming a place called Bang Bar.

Bulgogi folded into tortillas has been handed out through the window of a roving truck . Smoked kimchi has been draped over pulled pork between halves of a cheese-glazed doughnut to make an outdoor food-stall sandwich called the Chonut . Hwe, raw fish eaten with condiments that typically spread across an entire table, has been streamlined to one or two bites in a tasting menu administered by servers in sci-fi tunics. The pork belly dish bo ssam has been reimagined as a whole roasted pork shoulder that a gang of hungry people could use in a bonding ritual involving heads of lettuce, a platter of oysters and a pair of tongs. More often than not, the audience for these items is young. Youth, in fact, has been a key part of the story of how kimchi and other dishes spread from immigrants' kitchens to the Instagram feeds of diners without a single Korean ancestor. You might get a Chonut at Smorgasburg with your roommate, take down a bo ssam at Momofuku Ssam Bar with your friends from college and sit at Atomix's U-shaped counter to celebrate your first anniversary. Hwaban , which opened in Chelsea in August, is something different. It's the modern Korean restaurant where you'd take your mother. The dining room is spare, sleek and uncontroversial. The brick walls have a recent coat of white paint, and there is plenty of light by which to read the menus. The banquettes and benches have gentle curves and soothing neutral colors. The only vaguely menacing items in sight are the canteloupe-size eyeballs hanging on the walls, but they turn out to be high-tech speakers, and the cocktail jazz they play never rises above a murmur. Just inside the front door is a lattice of shelves holding simple, geometric bowls and teaware. These give Hwaban the look of a cloistered Parisian salon de th\u00e9, which it resembles in other ways as well. Exceptional green tea from South Korea is brewed along with tisanes -- made from mulberry leaves, mistletoe stems or dried wild pears -- that Korean mothers brew in winter for sneezing and sniffling children. And while some restaurants are saving money by doing without pastry chefs, Hwaban needs two of them to keep up with its obsession with Western-style sweets. One, Ahram Song, is a buttercream specialist who tints and shapes frosting into botanically detailed flower arrangements decorating chocolate or honey-pecan cakes. Another, Lauren Kim, makes the fleecy cheesecake that is carved into slivers the length of a dinner plate; pretty, well-tailored French numbers like a passion-fruit Pavlova or a drum of white cake filled with fresh strawberries and frosted with whipped cream; and the cookies and toffees that are sold by the box, for takeout. The illusion that you've wandered into a tearoom somewhere on the Right Bank is extended by the drinks list, which has only two Korean sojus and a handful of Japanese sakes but several pages of wines from France. The rest of the menu is unmistakably Korean, and very often it is based on Korean family cooking. \"This is my mother's recipe,\" Mihyun Han, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Key Kim, will say on one of her frequent circuits around the tables. She said it one night about the shaggy white meatball of chicken, tofu and mushrooms -- the menu calls it a dumpling -- sitting in a warm and transfixing soy-milk broth. Another time, she was talking about what she calls \"snowy bibimbap,\" a gentle, agreeable wintertime variation on the classic rice dish made with strands of mung bean jelly and shaved burdock, bellflower root, and other vegetables in shades of ivory, cream and bone. The chef, Woong Jang, does very fine work in white. One of Hwaban's most luxurious dishes is a length of king crab leg with spinach and a poached egg, all surrounded in a rich pine-nut sauce the color of hotel sheets. Like the Manhattan restaurants Atomix and Jungsik , Hwaban de-emphasizes the sweeter and spicier side of the Korean palate so other flavors can come through. Coins of poached pollock roe are sliced over a block of soft tofu in a clear, subtle dried-seafood broth. Soy-braised abalone is served in an anchovy broth that is, if not exactly subtle, at least soft-spoken. One of two pork belly dishes on the menu involves ssamjang, the potent soy-chile paste now sold in supermarkets throughout the land, but the other does not. In that one, you eat a slice of simmered pork belly together with a pickled mushroom and a square of cabbage kimchi. There is, of course, a sharp little kick to the spicy fish stew known as maeun-tang, and a fair amount of chile paste in the daktori-tang , a spin on the classic braised chicken and vegetable dish, both of which Mr. Jang makes very well. But there is also the surprise of tasting ginger and carrots along with the chiles in a bright orange sauce for seared salmon. Ms. Han and Mr. Kim also own Kosaka , a chiaroscuro lair for omakase sushi on West 13th Street. I was a little put off by how active the servers were there; just as I was focusing on the piece of fish in front of me, somebody would dart in at one elbow or the other to ask how I was enjoying it all. The service style is similar at Hwaban, but it plays better there. A meal at Hwaban is also about three times less expensive, at $55 for an appetizer and two main courses. The mains are served at the same time, which Ms. Han says is her attempt to reproduce the abundance of Korean family tables like her mother's. Her mother also gets credit for the two-sided fritters of minced shrimp pressed against zucchini coins on the short \u00e0 la carte menu. They're served with a crisp pair of fried shrimp and little cubes of jelly that melt into dipping sauce on contact with the warm fritters. The same soy jelly accompanies a kimchi-jeon that's topped with browned mozzarella -- in other words, a kimchi pizza. It would fit right in at Smorgasburg.

Maybe the people in charge have been taking management cues from Prime Minister Theresa May's government, which has approached its Brexit plan like a class of first graders trying to build a working jet airplane out of Lego pieces and a flying-squirrel sock puppet. Or maybe the mess back home has just sapped the restaurant's spirit. Whatever the cause, what was meant to be a cheerful gift from London has turned into the Bluebird of Unhappiness. Sir Terence Conran opened the original Bluebird in 1997 inside an Art Deco garage built on King's Road in Chelsea for the Bluebird Motor Company. It was one of his \"gastrodomes,\" those soaring complexes like Quaglino's and Bibendum that embedded restaurants within a busy hive of shops, cafes and bars. The gastrodomes' designs were talked about more often and more enthusiastically than their menus, which aimed for unthreatening familiarity. The current owners, D & D London , have managed to keep the London Bluebird in circulation by changing upholstery and chefs, but it is not at all clear why they or the Time Warner Center believed that a Bluebird clone would play in Manhattan in 2018. True, the retail shop has been dropped. But up front, next to the desk where the hosts have mastered the art of checking reservations without making eye contact, is a cafe-slash-wine bar. A glass case there serves as a temporary prison for aging pastries and tragic snacks. Beyond is a lounge followed by a bar, the centerpiece of which is an enormous plexiglass sculpture of a ponytailed woman's head that doubles as a shelf for weird liqueurs. Just before the ramp that descends to the main dining room is a console with two turntables which, a note on the website says menacingly, are operated on weekends by \"live DJs.\" At other times, the restaurant stages such events as a workshop in the art of making \"a seriously chic wreath.\" The poster-size menus drawn up by Nicolas Houlbert, the chef, cram so much copy onto a single page, and are organized so randomly, that they are best approached as if you were doing a word search, by unfocusing the eyes and waiting until the letters organize themselves into recognizable patterns. Look, here's butternut squash soup. This must be fluke -- no, fluke crudo. Long Island. Burrata. Long Island burrata? When you have finished the puzzle, please savor the warm feeling of accomplishment for a moment, because it goes away once the food arrives. The \"crispy shrimp\" have the limp, expired quality of tempura that's been doing laps all night at a conveyor-belt sushi place. Yellowfin tuna poke has been tossed onto a big, damp heap of unseasoned quinoa, which must be there to soak up any seasoning that accidentally attaches itself to the fish. At lunch there is a lobster Cobb salad with lettuce and round, red objects that are probably supposed to be tomatoes. Because you are in an English restaurant, you will be curious about the English food. Because you are in Bluebird London, you will regret this. A prawn and monkfish curry is presented on a thali with mango chutney, basmati rice and paratha, which run the gamut from unnecessarily sweet to ridiculously sweet. The fish half of fish and chips is golden and crisp on the ends but pale and soggy in the middle. At least the minted peas that come with it are crunchy. This is more than can be said for the potato chips that come with an order of beef tartare. They are pale, cobweb-colored, not fresh, and undercooked so they sag and fall apart beneath any amount of beef. The tartare, by the way, is seasoned with ketchup, which is not as wrong as you might think. If something comes with a pastry crust, exercise caution. On top of an allegedly Cornish chicken pie, sealing in dry chicken and mushrooms coated in grease that is trying its best to be mistaken for sauce, is a dome of puff pastry; it doesn't taste like butter or salt, but it is cooked. The thicker crust around a farmhouse pork terrine, served with a chill that brought out its Spammy qualities, is on its way to being cooked. The very, very thick football of crust encasing beef Wellington is cooked only on the surface; deep inside, where it meets the tenderloin, is a mass of wet, gluey dough. This costs $95 and will serve two people, both of whom had better like the taste of raw flour. All is not doom and gloom in the pastry department, though. The pull-apart cheese straws are thick, puffy and warm, bronzed on top with baked Montgomery's Cheddar. Most of the sweets are likable, particularly the cube of sticky toffee pudding and the wedge of Bakewell tart with a layer of orange marmalade between the frangipane and the pastry shell. The only real hazard on the dessert menu is the barely congealed Pimm's jelly at which somebody has hurled fistfuls of chopped cucumbers and strawberries. It's like a stray plate of salad that you might pick up at a party before you realized that somebody had dumped the warm dregs of a drink into it. The servers seemed eager to oblige, but gave the impression of struggling in the face of unseen enemies. One night, asked \"Still or sparkling?,\" I chose the sparkling water. My server began to walk away, then turned on his heel and said, \"I'm sorry, we're all out of sparkling.\" \"That's fine,\" I said. \"I'll just have the BrewDog I.P.A. instead.\" \"I apologize,\" he said. \"We don't have any draft beer.\" After the main course was cleared, I asked him for the Chocolate Bluebird. \"That is our signature dessert,\" he said. I nodded. I had read that this was a chocolate mousse inside a blue-chocolate shell in the shape of a vintage racecar once made by the Bluebird Motor Company. \"Unfortunately, we do not have it tonight,\" he said. His courtesy went a long way. Ultimately, though, I preferred the blunt approach that one of the bartenders took with one of my guests. Looking over the long list of old and new cocktails, she asked the bartender which he would recommend. \"If you want to drink something that tastes good,\" he said, \"I wouldn't order anything off our menu.\" Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

Mr. Niccolini has operated the restaurant with Alex von Bidder since the mid-1990s, first at its original home in the Seagram Building and now, after a two-year hiatus, in a smaller berth on the other side of Park Avenue. Over that time, he has frequently been celebrated for his charm. Less frequently, he has been a defendant in civil and criminal actions arising from things he was accused of having done to women inside the restaurant. In 1991, one of his waitresses sued Mr. Niccolini and the Four Seasons , citing sexual harassment. She claimed that for more than three years he had repeatedly rubbed up against her, told her in vulgar terms about his sexual urges and called her \"slut,\" \"lesbian\" and other things. Mr. Niccolini denied the charges. In 2014, a former assistant manager filed suit against Mr. Niccolini , Mr. von Bidder and the Four Seasons, alleging discrimination. The ex-manager said that after she returned from a maternity leave, the restaurant made it difficult for her to pump breast milk during work hours and, about three months later, fired her and replaced her with a man. In a response filed with the court, the defendants denied the allegations. Both suits were settled under terms that have not been divulged. In 2015, Mr. Niccolini was arrested on a felony charge of sexual abuse. According to a prosecutor, he had attacked a woman at the Four Seasons bar \"with such force that he ripped her bra open and caused significant scratch marks on her back and bruising on her hip.\" After pleading guilty the following year to a reduced charge of misdemeanor assault, Mr. Niccolini was given a \"conditional discharge,\" avoiding jail. I know people who will never eat at the Four Seasons because they don't want to give Mr. Niccolini their money. I understand this. I also know people in the food media who think the Four Seasons should not get any coverage as long as Mr. Niccolini owns a piece of it. I understand this, too, but it's not my view. [Julian Niccolini has since been forced to resign from the restaurant.] Their stance rests, I think, on the idea that writing about powerful men who have been accused of abusing women amounts to condoning the abuse and helping the abusers stay in power. While it's true that media attention is often like oxygen to restaurants, critics have the power to tell a story other than the one the restaurant is pushing. Even when we're not writing a pan, a fair assessment often requires weaving shining threads with ugly ones. The ugliest threads at the Four Seasons happen to be ugly enough to make many people stay away. But there is beauty in the fabric, too. The Four Seasons has been a significant force in dining: a pioneer in championing American ingredients and wine; an innovator in bringing contemporary design into the restaurant world; a cultivator of an eclectic scene that treated political power, financial success and creative talent as coequal branches of a high society that was peculiar to New York. Most of this happened some time ago. In its last years in the Seagram Building, the Four Seasons had become a shabby but lovely museum of midcentury architecture and design, with martinis that I didn't mind overpaying for and food that I did. I was curious about its new incarnation, which opened in August, and curiosity is as good a reason as any for a critic to swing into action. If I were writing the next chapter in a long history, I'd mention how gracefully Diego Garcia has grown into his new job as the restaurant's chef. I enjoyed Mr. Garcia's fish cookery at his last restaurant, a small, bare-bones place in Hell's Kitchen called Gloria , but he seemed limited by the kitchen's size. He works on a grander scale now, with more expensive ingredients and more delicate treatments that still betray his creative streak. He roasts duck because the Four Seasons is famous for it, and makes fresh pasta and risotto because the captains in their black jackets need some place to shave all those white truffles. For all intents and purposes, though, he has turned the Four Seasons into a seafood restaurant, and a very good one. It's not hard to believe he was once a sous-chef at Le Bernardin when you taste, say, the raw scallop slivers in citrus juices, elegantly equipped with tart apple and caviar, or the intensely smooth chowder of tiny, just-cooked clams in a New England-style cream broth that's pale yellow with butterfat. He knows when to show restraint and when to go all in, taking sea-urchin ravioli that are already head-spinningly rich and draping lobes of sea urchin over them. Some of the cooking is boring in the right way. I don't want surprises in Dover sole \u00e0 la meuni\u00e8re, and I didn't get any. It was flawless. The duck will surprise only people who don't know that duck meat cooked to well-done bastes in its own fat until it is almost a warm confit. Other dishes were boring in the usual sense. The mustard sauce poured around the golden crab cake tasted like cream that was shown a picture of a mustard jar. The chapter would also depict the return of Bill Yosses. Anybody who ate his desserts before he disappeared into the White House won't be surprised by how good they are here. They do have a slight Rip Van Winkle quality, suggesting that Mr. Yosses allowed several new waves in pastry to pass him by, but that's no criticism. He makes a better baba au rhum than almost anyone in town, his chocolate tart with a salted stripe of caramel is both powerful and precise, and his hazelnut financier balanced over roasted pears is more delicious than almost any almond financier you can find. He has even improved the restaurant's signature, the Kate Pierson beehive of cotton candy that sails out to the tables of valued guests. (Apparently I've joined that club.) This being the Four Seasons, the history would have to mention the new restaurant's interior. It reminded me of the old Philip Johnson dining rooms without making me sad to be here instead of there, a trick I had thought was impossible. The bronze bead curtains have transformed into strings of gilded glass baubles; the flatware and glasses pay homage to the vintage designs used at the original restaurant; and the bar is once again a four-sided island in the middle of a lounge. For the first time you can eat a real meal there, while you watch the Grand Central-bound commuters outside and the cotton candy-bound regulars inside, generally a mature group in tightly knotted ties or heels that echo down the corridor to the dining room like the ticking of a grandfather clock. All of this and a generous budget (the prices are as exclusionary as ever) could make for a few hours of celebratory sightseeing of a kind that is quickly disappearing from the city. The Four Seasons offers an escape from the outside world. Escaping from what's inside, however, takes a mental effort that is beyond me and will probably be beyond many others as well, whether Mr. Niccolini is in sight or not. During my three meals, I never saw him. Restaurants, even grand ones like the Four Seasons, are intimate places; eating is an act that requires trust and a sense of safety. We want to get up from the table feeling restored on all fronts except the financial one. Mr. Niccolini's actions have done serious damage to his power to provide that feeling, even as he and Mr. von Bidder have made the restaurant better than it has been in years.

They went on to get married and, as joint chefs and owners, opened a string of compact, intimate, slinky modern-Spanish restaurants that are still in business. Their one misfire was a small, intimate non-Spanish coffee shop in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. After dusting themselves off, they replaced the cafe tables with taller and longer ones, traded the pastry cases for a bar, installed a stripe of backlighted glass blocks that cast a subaqueous glow on the room, and in September reopened as Saint Julivert Fisherie . And what is a fisherie, you ask, having quickly consulted your French, Spanish and English dictionaries and found no such word? Saint Julivert is my first, but if it is anything to go by, then a fisherie is a seafood establishment that aspires to be more than a raw bar but does not want to be mistaken for a full-bore restaurant. Wines come mostly from coastal regions (and are organized by the nearest body of salt water). Small plates abound. And if you guessed that they are something like the tapas that Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero explore at El Quinto Pino , Txikito and La Vara , but without the running Spanish theme, you are not far off. Not that the menu is entirely un-Spanish. The octopus carpaccio from Txikito makes a special guest appearance at Saint Julivert Fisherie, the way the Fresh Prince once turned up on an episode of \"Blossom.\" Under marjoram leaves and pinprick grains of Espelette pepper, the carpaccio is as good as you remember; the warm plate halfway melts the fattier bits of octopus into delicious goo. There is another cameo: El Quinto Pino's very fine combination of pink-fleshed anchovies with cold vanilla butter. The butter soothes the anchovies the way the vermouth in a martini helps the gin settle down. (On a related topic, the short cocktail list includes a deceptively soft-spoken number called the Kanpai Martini. It's a variation on the Vesper, which itself is the amended martini that Ian Fleming had James Bond order in \"Casino Royale.\") At times Saint Julivert reminds me of Cal Pep , in Barcelona, Spain, whose plain, cramped counter looks like the last place in the world where you are going to have an epiphany of the taste buds, right up until the moment the txipirones and thumbtack-size clams knock you off your barstool. Like Cal Pep, and unlike nearly every other New York restaurant, Saint Julivert serves gooseneck barnacles when they're available, boiling them with bay leaves and salt and mounding them on a cloth napkin before they cool so that when you twist the wrinkled sheath of skin away from the sweet, edible meat inside there is a good chance somebody in the vicinity will get hit with a squirt of hot barnacle juice. Mostly, though, any Spanish-ness in Saint Julivert has more to do with its spirit than its recipes, which come from all over: the deep-fried Puerto Rican cylinders of cornmeal known as sorrullitos; a kanpachi collar whose juicy meat is shockingly white under a black rub of jerk spices; tender slices of warm beef tenderloin on a fist-size roll, known in Portugal as a prego sandwich. There is also the crispy tuna bake, a peculiarly satisfying hybrid that crosses a tuna noodle casserole by way of India with fideu\u00e0, the Spanish dish that treats pasta like the rice in paella. The noodles, short ridged tubes, are toasted and cooked with oil-cured tuna in a tomato sauce that is seasoned with turmeric and curry leaves. It is one of the most fearless, not to mention filling, dishes on a menu that could use a little more of both qualities. Although Saint Julivert works with exceptional seafood, and treats it with the care that fans of Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero have come to expect, the menu plays it safe more often than it should. Like all of the couple's restaurants, Saint Julivert toggles between innovation and tradition. But the other places explore Spanish cuisine, so when they toss off a straight-ahead classic like patatas bravas, there's a reason. When Saint Julivert serves fluke ceviche or a crab and avocado salad dressed with yuzu juice and trout roe, it can seem to be grasping at ideas that other restaurants are already doing -- even when Saint Julivert does them better. The saut\u00e9ed skate splashed with Manzanilla could not be fresher or more skillfully browned, but do the garlic chips and sliced dried chiles on top make this version of a well-known standard one I'll remember a month from now? Maybe not, although at the time I was very happy to have it, not least because it was one of the few things on the menu the size of a standard main course. Even if you're an old hand at navigating the shallow waters of small plates, it can be unnervingly easy to spend more than $100 on food and drinks at Saint Julivert and still wonder whether you've actually had dinner. Seafood this good is expensive, but the menu doesn't stray very far above $20; the result is that portions can seem somewhat airy. When there's an inexpensive opportunity to pad out a dish, Saint Julivert doesn't always take it. I understand why I can't have more than three excellent wild shrimp in a $21 bowl of red pozole, but couldn't there be more than a spoonful of hominy kernels? Saltines fried in canola oil are served with the ceviche and with a cold and highly appealing bowl of pickled shrimp under pink pickled onions; grilled bread slices accompany the mackerel whipped into a hummus-like orange spread with piri-piri oil. Still, each time I went, somebody at my table asked for more bread. None of Saint Julivert's issues are insoluble. The lighting could be warmed up so the room looks less like an aquarium. A few more dishes you won't see anywhere else, like the tuna bake, would make it harder to resist. Another two or three large plates would make it a place you think of when you're hungry. The excellent $19 prego sandwich is more snack than dinner, until you pay another $7 to have fried oysters tucked into the roll beside the beef, making it into a kind of crunchy carpetbagger. On the other hand, that's worth doing even if you're not hungry. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

Modernization is the theme unifying many of the Indian restaurants that have taken root around the city over the past few years. At the rarefied end of the spectrum, we have Indian Accent bringing the cuisine into line with the intricate techniques and plating that can land restaurants on the itineraries of list-clutching gastrotourists. At the populist end, we've seen Indian cooking gastro-pubbed by Babu Ji and other new places that try to make non-desis feel at home with house-party vibes, beer in a self-service fridge, and dishes like naan pizzas and samosa burgers. New York hasn't seen nearly as many recently opened restaurants devoted to the pure, original stuff that is getting modernized. The snacks pitched together in a blur by hawkers at folding tables and rolling carts by the side of the road; the gravy-soaked stews and sauceless dry curries patiently made from 25 or so vegetables and seasonings, all of them chopped, ground, fried and simmered at home by those keepers of the culinary flame known collectively as the aunties -- we've seen interpretations of this food, squeezed from eyedroppers and prepared for their photo shoots with edible flowers. But new places cooking the genuine article have been scarce. There is a problem of missing context here; twists on tradition don't really resonate when tradition is hard to find in its untwisted form. And for anyone who truly loves Indian cooking, there is a more pressing problem of missing flavor. Five dots of tandoori-spice oil just won't land on the taste buds with the impact of a full plate of charred and steaming tandoori chicken, no matter how evenly spaced those dots are. I hadn't given much thought to either problem, to tell the truth, until I made it to the out-of-the-way patch of Long Island City where Adda Indian Canteen operates. This is not the part of that neighborhood where high-rise apartments grow overnight and Amazon will soon tiptoe in with 25,000 employees. Adda is east of all that, under a National Guard recruiting office, surrounded by a thicket of railroad tracks and highway overpasses. Unless you are looking for it, you are not likely to end up in the small dining room, in which Indian tabloids have been upcycled as wallpaper. Once I'd found it, one of the first things I ate was the kaleji masala, chicken livers in a dark gravy seasoned with fresh ginger and garam masala. Right away I realized that this was the kind of Indian food the city has been hungry for, or at least the kind that I'd been hungry for: made with care but no pretense; seasoned for people who love the interplay of spices; presented without apology in all its brown, lumpy glory; and complex in ways that demand full attention. Adda (ah DAH) Indian Canteen was opened in September by Roni Mazumdar, who owns it, and Chintan Pandya, who is the chef. The two men already run Rahi , in Greenwich Village, perhaps the best of the casual, modernizing Indian restaurants, where Mr. Pandya serves original notions like tandoori skate and sends almost everything out of the kitchen decorated with edible flowers. They've taken another angle at Adda, mining family recipes and the lessons Mr. Pandya absorbed from civilian cooks around India. The menu travels beyond the standard north Indian dishes most New Yorkers already know, but even those dishes, when they appear, are prepared so emphatically that they don't resemble anything else in town. Adda is a lusty, full-throated defense of traditional cooking. Saag paneer, the grayest of old gray mares in many Indian restaurants, is coltishly energetic at Adda. The cheese is made in the kitchen, and it's gorgeously soft, while the saag is a tart and peppery mix of wilted arugula, sorrel, spinach and mustard greens. Mr. Pandya does very well by the class of sidewalk treats called chaat. Each delivers the messy riot you'd hope for, busy with crunchy hieroglyphs of fried noodles and splattered with yogurt and tamarind sauce. One chaat is anchored by a big kale fritter, another by several smaller chips of battered, spiced lentil cakes, and a third by fried smashed potatoes and chickpeas. But discerning chaat lovers should probably go directly to the dahi batata puri, soft potato packed into hollow globes of fried dough that you can pick up and eat with your fingers, like chocolates. Anything that passes through Adda's tandoor is worth investigating. Seekh kebabs, made with lamb that's coarsely ground by hand, come out of the tandoor juicier and pinker than the usual; Mumbai-style tandoori macchi, a skewered pompano rubbed with ground mustard seeds and cilantro, is lightly charred and smoky after roasting, but still moist; bhatti da murgh, a double-marinated chicken thigh and drumstick, is so thickly crusted with coriander and cumin that it crunches when you bite it. My server expressed an enthusiasm about the poussin -- plunged into the tandoor in one piece after marinating in vinegar, yogurt, fresh red chiles and kala namak, the sulfurous black salt of India -- that you typically find in new converts to a cult. After tasting it, I was ready to join. He was enthusiastic about almost everything, as it turned out; the service at Adda is nothing if not eager to talk up the food. (Getting your water glass refilled is another story.) Placing a dish of yogurt and pomegranate seeds next to the goat biryani that is steamed under a lid of dough, he said, \"This is going to be your best friend when the spice in the biryani starts to hit you.\" It was, in fact, one of the fiercest biryanis I've ever met, and the yogurt tamed it so that I could taste the tender goat meat and crisp, bittersweet fried onions. Few things on the menu are quite as chile-drenched as the biryani, but Mr. Pandya definitely favors India's more intense flavors. Adda is not big on soft-spoken cream sauces; the coconut milk in the Malvani prawn curry from the South Konkan coast, for instance, has a pronounced kick. (It's very good if you get it on a night when the prawns are firm and not spongy.) And while Adda does serve some vegetables, it would not make my list of the 20 best local Indian restaurants for vegetarians. It would, however, be the place I'd send you if you want to know how good Delhi butter chicken can be. Or if you don't yet believe that rara gosht, chunks of lamb stewed on the bone with spiced minced lamb, is not redundant but luxurious. And Adda is the first restaurant I'd tell you about if you woke up one morning hungry for bheja fry, goat brains cooked with onions, ginger and a considerable number of fresh green chiles. \"Like soft scrambled eggs,\" our server said, accurately. I might point out that a typical Indian bheja fry is drier, with a higher ratio of brains to sauce. But I would not necessarily mean that as a complaint.

That's not quite right. Yes, Ms. Robbins has given half of her menu over to long noodles and short ones; strands of linguine with chopped garlic and a double dose of fish in the form of chopped anchovies and drizzled colatura; circles filled with ricotta whipped until it is as soft as cream; pinched rings of tortelli stuffed with mascarpone and spinach; the deeply ridged Sardinian shells known as malloreddus; and other Italian marvels of starch formation. True, anybody who has been to Ms. Robbins's other restaurant, Lilia , also located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, knows that the pasta there reliably steals the show from everything else on the table. When those people show up at Misi, odds are good that they will not have chosen that day to start a keto diet. Moreover, Misi has a greater variety of pasta than Lilia, so many that the architecture makes space for them. Misi is across the street from the old Domino refinery on the East River, where the cranes used to unload sugar from barges in the open air so that on days when the wind was right you could taste it on your tongue a mile away. Next to the dining room, facing the factory's remains, is a separate, glassed-in workshop where the temperature and humidity are kept at consistent dough-friendly levels. There, the long noodles, etc., are rolled out and cut long before 5:30 each night, when Misi's front door is unlocked and the crowd waiting in line for walk-in seats begins to snake eagerly forward. And to be sure, if you watch Ms. Robbins and her kitchen crew at the end of one of two long dining counters, you'll see the same quick motion over and over: an almost surreptitiously quick trip of hand to mouth, a sharp bite and an appraising chew to decide if that batch of pasta is ready to be pulled from the water. Some chefs show their mastery over pasta by pressing it thinner than a screen protector for an iPhone. Ms. Robbins likes hers to have body and heft, and the chew test is the most reliable way to tell when thick pasta like that is ready. You are very unlikely to get a piece that is undercooked at its core, or one that doesn't fight back enough to let you know it is still alive. You get this just-in-between texture in the stubs of mezze rigatoni with a simple, glossy, ripe tomato sauce that's been stewed with whole garlic cloves -- 30 to a batch, according to the menu. You get it again in the corzetti, discs about the diameter of a Red Bull can that are pressed with a wooden stamp to give them a target pattern. In October, Misi served these ridged coins with another tomato sauce, this one barely cooked, just some Sungold tomatoes warmed until they broke open and their yellow pulp spilled out. Fresh basil, thyme and chervil were scattered over the top, as good an illustration as any of how Ms. Robbins makes her food stand out without deviating from an Italian reliance on simple, unmanipulated ingredients. But to call Misi a pasta restaurant would be to overlook its highly impressive work with vegetables. They are the subject of the menu's other half, sneakily headlined \"antipasti.\" This is where you will find a globe eggplant roasted until it is as soft and easy to spread as cream cheese; the cut surfaces are dressed with Calabrian chiles, and the taste of lemon juice seems to have found its way to the center of the eggplant. There are fleshy and firm chanterelles, too, lightly pickled and preserved in olive oil until they're brought to the table crisscrossed with rosemary needles. Grilled runner beans with garlic and chiles have been around lately, too, in a big heap that I would have enjoyed more if a few stringy, leathery beans had not gotten past the inspectors in the kitchen. Like the pastas, Misi's vegetables tend to bring together only a few ingredients, often applied in ways you don't quite expect. I don't know where else you will taste pistachios and anchovies combined with skinny, leaf-bud-green leeks marinated in vinegar, or a kind of panzanella made with grilled bread, capers, fresh oregano and chunks of zucchini that are still tender after a quick poaching in olive oil. And though the gently roasted tomatoes won't come back to the menu until next summer, you can try imagining how their dusting of fennel seeds and cracked coriander seeds responds to a last-minute squirt of spicy honey. There are enough of these vegetables, and enough meatless pastas, that a vegetarian could eat extremely well at Misi just by watching out for things like bottarga and staying away entirely from the creamy pork sugo tossed with strangozzi. (Meat eaters, on the other hand, may find the sugo helps restore chafed nerves.) Although Misi doesn't let its kitchen range as widely as Lilia's, it is a more successful restaurant in several ways. The menu has been distilled down to essentials, and the whole enterprise seems more carefully thought through. The restaurant is on the ground floor of a new apartment building by SHoP Architects , who chose to leave a hole in the middle that you could fly a helicopter through. The developer, Two Trees , recruited Ms. Robbins and her business partner, Sean Feeney, and gave them a chance to build the virgin space to their needs. The acoustics are better than at Lilia, and traffic between tables flows more smoothly. The interior is unusually good, with narrow horizontal wall tiles in white and nooks for stacked plates that make them part of the d\u00e9cor. As at Lilia, the wine list practically begs you to take something new for a whirl: a catarratto from Sicily, a Corsican niellucciu, or a croatina-ughetta blend from Lombardy softened with some uva rara. Of course, you could stick to a $45 Lambrusco, or get a $250 Champagne from David L\u00e9clapart, after which you can try flying through the hole in the building yourself. If we are striving for total accuracy, though, we need to call Misi a pasta-vegetables-and-gelato restaurant. Its gelato is made in house; there are about six kinds at any given moment. The flavors open up right away, in part because Misi serves them just below the melting point and in part because the ingredients are used prodigally. There are a lot of almonds in the almond, and the espresso could keep you up an extra hour. But even the unflavored fior di latte, made with milk, cream and sugar, comes at you in a rush. There are no desserts other than gelato. The only decision to make at the end of the night is which one you're going to have.

Yes, pizza in the city has been accessorized with toppings from crayfish (not bad) to Buffalo chicken (hmm) to Caesar salad (no, no, no, no, no). But the foldable, portable triangles of cheese, sauce and dough themselves were generally held to be a natural resource that was perfect as is, much like the soft, unfiltered city tap water claimed to be the source of their excellence. Some pizzerias try to make a better slice. Very few try to make a different slice. Mama's Too makes a different slice. It combines some of the most appealing elements of a Neapolitan pie with the most satisfying aspects of the archetypal product sold on paper plates from sidewalk windows. It is as if Frank Tuttolomondo, the owner and pie architect of this informal but very serious pizzeria on the Upper West Side, has learned how to genetically modify pizza. The bulge of crust at the edge of what Mama's Too calls the \"house slice\" is brown, more rough than smooth and baked to a ferocious crackle. You could tear it off and enjoy it on its own, or maybe with butter or olive oil, just as you can with the best Neapolitans. Yet the flat layer of crust on the bottom is firm, without the soupy center of the Neapolitan style. True to New York form, you can hold it in the air by the curved rim and it will stay flat and parallel to the floor. As they do at Totonno's and some other brick-oven pizzerias, Mr. Tuttolomondo lays the cheese down before the sauce. Rather than drippy, milky discs of fresh mozzarella, though, he covers the raw dough (after priming it with olive oil) in shreds of a slice-friendly variety that is known in the trade as low-moisture mozzarella and that the rest of us call pizza cheese. Over this, he ladles a few blots of tomato pulp. This helps the crust to bake through without getting soggy, keeps the cheese from sliding off the crust, and most of all lets you taste the tomatoes, which are very good. You could, I suppose, think of the house slice as a white pizza with tomato-sauce topping. After the pie comes out of the oven, Mr. Tuttolomondo sprinkles it with grated two-year-old Parmigiano-Reggiano. Basil leaves are the last to go on. At this point, you can pay, walk out the door and amble toward Broadway and 106th Street cradling your slice in a paper plate and taking bites as you go. In other words, you can have the traditional sidewalk pizza experience, but you will be tasting flavors you normally find only in high-minded sit-down pizzerias like Sorbillo , Ops or Una Pizza Napoletana . Those bloodhounds who follow the city's melted-mozzarella trail will recognize that Mama's Too is part of a great reawakening of slice culture. Unlike brick-oven pizza, which came from Europe and relied on preindustrial technology, the New York slice is a lowly American hybrid. It is baked in gas ovens, and the sheer number of places selling it suggests that it requires no special skill. When it is praised, we don't talk about its artisanal roots; we call it the humble slice, the street-corner slice, the slice of the common man and woman. The ordinary slice and its heftier cousin, the Sicilian-style square, were probably first rehabilitated with superior ingredients and a sophisticated understanding of baking by Best Pizza in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 2010. Today, serious pizza hobbyists talk about their favorite slices by reeling off the dough's rising time and hydration levels. North Brooklyn is still the center of the neoclassical slice movement, with L'Industrie and Williamsburg Pizza and, most recently, Paulie Gee's Slice Shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, but the forward-thinking slice is found in Manhattan, too, at Scarr's on the Lower East Side and Corner Slice in the Gotham West Market. The goal of the neoclassicists is, essentially, to return to the golden age of New York takeout pizza, which survives at places like Di Fara in Midwood, Brooklyn, one of the holy sites of the neoclassical church. Paulie Gee's Slice Shop, Scarr's and other neoclassicist joints cultivate a self-consciously vintage atmosphere, styling their logos and signs and interiors so they look like a place where Johnny Boy and Charlie in \"Mean Streets\" might have gone for a pepperoni slice and a Coke. Mr. Tuttolomondo does not fetishize the past. Perhaps this is because he lived it. For almost 60 years his family has owned a series of old-school slice joints in the neighborhood. The current incarnation is literally on a street corner, at the intersection of 106th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. It is called Mama's Pizza . He didn't open Mama's Too a block away to outdo his parents; he's bringing their product into a new era. If the neoclassicists are like the folk revivalists who collected old acoustic 78s, he is Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. When Mama's Too opened in December, it also served housemade pasta. It's still on the menu board that hangs on one wall, but Mr. Tuttolomondo has stopped serving it to concentrate on pizza. Besides the house slice, he also makes squares that he sees as a marriage of rectangular Sicilian pizza with Roman pizza al taglio. The crust is much taller than the Roman style, and taller than some Sicilians, too, but it is airy and chewy. On the bottom it has the bronze color, the cratered surface and the pan-fried crunch of the bread on a grilled cheese sandwich. The edges, where the dough meets the pan, have a gold fringe of browned cheese, known among students of pizza styles as a \"frico crust.\" This fringe is, of course, crunchy and delicious. The most impressive square is, I think, the pepperoni. Unlike most of the others, it incorporates tomato sauce. The mozzarella is baked until it begins to brown. The pepperoni slices are small and concave, like contact lenses made of meat. Crunchy around the rims, these little cups are half-filled with spicy red oil. It may sound as if I approached this slice with cool, analytical detachment. The truth is I ripped into it like a pack of hyenas. The other squares tend to be white pies with toppings. Again, tomato sauce is one of the toppings. In one case it's a thick and creamy layer of vodka sauce, one of the ideas that separates Mama's Too from the neoclassicists. Mr. Tuttolomondo also makes a cacio e pepe Sicilian pie, essentially a four-cheese pizza in which one of the cheeses is pecorino; the whole slice hums with black pepper. The square topped with Gorgonzola dolce and pears works in a way that combination often doesn't, although half a slice was enough for me. The shop is small, and if you sit at one of the handful of red counter stools you will share the small tiled floor up front with neighbors waiting for takeout and delivery guys. There are no vintage soda refrigerators or letterboard signs, but there is a small photograph of Robert De Niro eating pizza and a much bigger one of John Travolta in \"Saturday Night Fever,\" biting into his double-decker slice. The picture is in black and white except for the pizza. Tinted orange and red, it glows like a beacon.

You wouldn't know it to look around the place on any recent night at 8, when a seamless playlist of hip-hop and R&B unspools as servers carry stacked beef ribs to what seems like every third table. What changed? In August, the chef Joseph Johnson , better known as JJ, was made a partner and assumed control of the kitchen. What he has done is less a makeover than a takeover; his imprint radiates out from his Afrocentric menu to animate the whole enterprise. The playlist, which can run from noon until 8 the next morning without repeating a track, is his. Mr. Johnson's initials now hang in the front window, flooding the nearby tables with pink neon. The initials have migrated to the restaurant's website as well, where its name is now given as Henry at Life Hotel by JJ . These are not subtle gestures, but subtlety has rarely saved a restaurant on the brink of failure. Mr. Johnson has been busy hiring new employees for the front and back of the house, and the racial mix he has already achieved is as impressive as it is rare. Diversifying a restaurant's service staff is one of the surest ways to diversify the audience, and on many nights brown faces and white faces, topknots and braids, headscarves and headbands, sit side by side, giving Henry more the appearance of a restaurant in Harlem than of one just off Herald Square. It was in Harlem, as chef de cuisine at a slinky neighborhood hangout called the Cecil and the history-drenched jazz supper club Minton's , that Mr. Johnson made his name. Fleshing out a notion suggested by Alexander Smalls, the consulting chef in both places, Mr. Johnson explored the African diaspora, the imprint that Africans have put on cooking around the world. He does something similar at Henry, although his view has grown to embrace flavors from, say, India and Southeast Asia that turn up in Africa and in diasporic countries like Jamaica and Barbados. He calls the menu at Henry \"Pan-African.\" [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] This is a big story -- too big to be told in full by one restaurant, or two for that matter. But it's an important story, and it certainly beats Henry's original idea of tying the restaurant to the history of Life magazine, which was once published in the same building, and to Henry Luce , who bought it in 1936, then radically remade it and moved it to other quarters. This concept was so wispy that Henry's first chef, Michael Vignola, resorted to an all-things-to-all-people menu of foie gras sliders and meatball pizza. Just how vast Mr. Johnson's scope has become will be clear by the end of the appetizer course. (Here I am assuming that you have chosen a traditional two- or three-course meal rather than eating all 15 items on the menu, in full and in order; this route costs $390 and is called \"It Was All a Dream,\" after a Notorious B.I.G. lyric.) There are littleneck clams, battered with rice flour and crunchy with shaved fennel and Asian pear. All of this is dotted with a tangerine-colored fluff of piri-piri sauce that is less ferociously spicy than the scalding piri-piris of Angola, Mozambique or South Africa. You are welcome to get a half-dozen, but at my table a full dozen went quickly. Benne seeds, the heirloom variety of sesame brought to North America on slave ships, add a flavor that is something like toasted almonds mixed with coffee beans to tuna tartare. The tuna is topped with a chip of curried peanut brittle and spooned over shiso leaves; you pinch the leaf and pop it in your mouth, where good things start to happen. And as you're adjusting to this cross-pollination of Africa and Japan, Indo-Caribbean cuisine appears on the horizon: a plate of folded roti with dips. The spinach chutney is a little joyless, but the inky pur\u00e9e of eggplant sweetened with dates is a terrific idea. Why Mr. Johnson puts a fried egg on the roti is unclear. When your meal at Henry is over, you may wish you had been sent home with a world map showing the history of forced African migration and spice-trade routes. While it's going on, though, you generally flow with the inner logic the way you can get into a hip-hop track without being able to name every last sample. Generally, but not always. I believe I understood some of the reasoning behind chopped collard greens and cashews tossed with a coconut dressing, but I still find raw collards somewhat rough going after the first few mouthfuls. Is the seared salmon with rice noodles, edamame and bok choy a reference to the Vietnamese community in Senegal? To me it tasted, not unpleasantly, like something one of the better Asian fusion restaurants in Manhattan would have served 20 years ago. Henry's shrimp and pork dumplings, on the other hand, are nondescript little blobs; they sit in an aromatic \"Harlem curry,\" informed by Bengali cooking, that deserves a better dance partner. You could say the same about the intensely herb-scented seafood broth in a seafood boil that Mr. Johnson calls the Afropot; the clams and king crab legs were very good, but the prawns were unappealingly soft and the mussels not quite fleshy enough. The cooking, though, has been getting tighter over the past month, picking up from a first and somewhat droopy meal on a night when Mr. Johnson was not in the kitchen. Tamarind jerk chicken had no spice to speak of. A parcel of rice supposedly inspired by Dominican conc\u00f3n had as much crunch as if it had been left out on the counter overnight, and the eggplant curry ladled over it tasted more like a halfheartedly seasoned tomato sauce. The second time I tried it, the rice had a golden crackle and the curry was worth paying attention to. Apart from the seared scallops in a remarkably good hominy broth with cilantro pistou, those bone-in ribs are the most rewarding main course. The rewards are not so much the short ribs themselves, though they are flavorful and tender; the thrill of the dish is in the battery of little sides like stir-fried millet, spiced black beans and a hoisin sauce I wanted to take home to keep on hand for Chinese-food emergencies. I also thought about pocketing a Foie Crispy Treat, and I would have gotten away with it because everybody else at the table thought they were too weird. Weird they are, but interesting, too. Maybe you'd be happier with the sweet potato pie in a crisp butter crust, very old school apart from the purple yam in the filling. True, at some point in your meal a hotel guest may decide to march through the dining room with a full set of luggage. But under Mr. Johnson, Henry is under no risk of being capsized by that kind of distraction. He has pulled the restaurant back from the edge of failure, and that's a rare trick.

Chongqing chicken and mung-bean jelly proliferated as skilled chefs flocked to the city. But while the miles of dan dan noodles and mountains of Sichuan peppercorns have been exhilarating, they have tended to overshadow the cuisine of another great chile-haunted region, Hunan. Part of the problem is nomenclature. The word Hunan on a restaurant's front window tends to say as much about the actual cooking inside as pandas and bamboo on the sign. At first glance it can be hard to distinguish Hunan Garden, say, from Hunan House until you see the menus and learn that the former name signifies egg rolls while the latter promises the red-braised pork that Mao used to dote on. Fake Hunans outnumber real ones, which is one reason to celebrate the appearance of Hunan Slurp . Operating in the East Village since May, Hunan Slurp lives up to both halves of its name. When people in Hunan get hungry for a bowl of noodles, what they have in mind are mifen: long, white strands made from pounded rice, so smooth they may slither right out of the chopsticks of inexperienced slurpers. Chances for New Yorkers to practice their antiskid chopstick techniques have been limited, generally speaking, to the rice noodles of other parts of Asia. When you could find Hunanese noodles around town, they tended to be tucked away on larger menus with so many other Hunanese opportunities that they were rarely given a chance to slither. Hunan Slurp offers some of those opportunities, too. The chef and proprietor, Chao Wang, comes from Hunan's second-largest city, Hengyang, and fills the menu with both traditional Hunanese dishes and his own innovations. But noodles are the heart of the restaurant. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] They peek out from underneath slices of beef, tofu and barbecued pork, all fanned out like a hand of poker, in a soup-less wonder called Hometown Lu Fen. The sauce is in the bottom of the bowl, and should absolutely be augmented with some of the chopped pickled red chiles in oil served in a small dish on the side. In the string bean mifen, the noodles weave around a fried egg and a scattering of ground Berkshire pork, stir-fried to a crackle with little rounds of sliced, pickled green beans. There is no slick of chile oil on top, and the pale broth looks harmless enough, but once the soup is stirred together it will take the crease out of a pair of newly pressed trousers. A little red sheaf of dried chile threads bobbing in the wild pepper and beef soup gives you an idea what you are in for, if the name hasn't already given away the game. But with Hunan Slurp's noodles, as with Hunanese food generally, heat is part of the message; it's never the medium. Stock is to the cook what pitch is to the opera singer, goes a Chinese proverb. Hunan Slurp's soup stocks are rounded and cloudy from long-boiled bones and meat, and they tend to get better the longer they linger with their toppings. (So do the noodles.) A master class in the art of broth subtlety is provided by the two-part soup that goes by the under-promising name fish fillet mifen. Part One is an oversize ceramic bowl of milky white pork-and-fish stock strewn with flower petals, pea shoots, purple basil and other fresh herbs. It arrives on a wooden tray next to Part Two, the noodles, which get their own bowl. The broth's flavor was elusive at first, more a texture than a taste. Within minutes the steamed fish in the broth, together with the herbs, had transformed it into something splendid. Like many of the new Chinese restaurants that have sprouted in the East Village, Hunan Slurp pays attention to appearances. Under a backlighted logo that spells out SLURP in elongated, noodly letters, a sheet of glass on First Avenue frames the long, tunneled dining room, designed by New Practice Studio . The interior is sheathed in wooden slats that run up one wall, arch their way across the ceiling and fall down the opposite wall. Depending on your frame of mind, eating at Hunan Slurp can feel like sitting under a rack of drying noodles or finding yourself inside the belly of a particularly tidy whale. A glassed-in kitchen lies in the back, its shelves stacked with colorfully glazed modern Chinese plates and bowls that you won't find in the restaurant-supply shops on the Bowery. Once you leave the noodle section of the menu behind, it is possible to find cooking that doesn't necessarily live up to the standard set by the crockery. I'm told that the bands of cumin-seasoned beef speared with toothpicks can be crisp and well-browned, but the ones I got were gray and floppy. And the sweet-and-sour spareribs, an appetizer, were far more sweet than sour, and tough, too. On the best available evidence, Mr. Wang's palate skews a bit sweet. This is unusual in a Hunanese kitchen, but only those spareribs were off-puttingly sugary. A multicolored salad of chilled cherry tomatoes was bright and refreshing despite a fruity marination in plum juice. (A similar dish sometimes turns up at Hao Noodle and Tea by Madam Zhu's Kitchen , where it is sweeter, and still very enjoyable.) And the hint of sugar in stir-fried chicken did not soften the toothy bite of young ginger, or hide the ginger's natural sweetness, either. You may not notice the bias toward sweetness anyway, given the kitchen's open embrace of chiles. An electrical current of heat crackles through the dim-sum-style chicken feet, cooked until they are falling-off-the-toe tender. Bright green chiles animate a stir-fry of julienne potatoes, cooked so fast they're still stiff. They also bring not just spice but crunch to a classic Hunanese saut\u00e9 of pork and garlic topped with an egg fried to a ruffled, golden crisp. The chiles knocked around in a very hot wok with sweet, juicy cabbage are small, red, sun-dried and noticeably fruity under their mouth-zapping heat. The spice level is more subdued in the excellent stir-fry of pork and smoked tofu, and it's almost undetectable in a very likable preparation of skinny eggplant sections topped with discs of bell pepper; the skins are left on the eggplants, which gives the appetizer something of the appearance of tuna maki wrapped with purple seaweed. Meals tend to move quickly. For this you may be thankful on busy nights when those wood slats go from attractive design elements to unnervingly effective sounding boards. As in other Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood, the crowd tends to be young, bright, quick and eager to get on with the rest of the evening. As the dinner rush ends, the howl subsides. Maybe ice cream is on the agenda, or a classic dessert soup of mung beans and barley in syrup. Or maybe a pot of tea, loose-leaf, brewed at the table while you think about chiles and rice and pork and wonder how many more Hunanese chefs can be persuaded to settle down in New York.

Each is printed with a boldface transliteration of a Korean word under an abstract design of geometric shapes and lines. They look like flashcards from a school run by progressive graphic designers. \"Your first course is guk, which means soup,\" a server will say. \"This card is for hwe, Korean for raw.\" \"Jorim is next. Jorim means it's been braised.\" This sounds as if it would get old, but it doesn't. Very early on, you learn that on the other side of these vocabulary exercises lie dishes of wonderful intricacy, sophistication and beauty. One after another, each of the 10 courses in the $175 meal opens up new ideas about Korean cuisine and culture. In the Atomix pedagogical method, instruction is followed closely by reward. (While we are working on vocabulary: The restaurant's name is pronounced, somewhat counterintuitively, a-toe-mix.) [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] Many of the rewards are the kind you eat, of course. Guk-which-means-soup is a shimmering broth that Mr. Park, the chef, makes from fermented tomatoes and kelp; chilled and poured over scallop slices layered between slivers of green tomato that have been marinated in Korean fig vinegar, the broth has an electrifying sweet-sour balance. The dish may not scream \"Korean cuisine,\" but the next one does. This is hwe -- Korean for raw, you'll recall, and also the term for Korean-style sashimi. The fish is striped jack, brushed with plum vinegar sauce. Slices of it are folded around a mild fermented chile, a few drops of sesame oil and bits of kimchi made from cabbage and ramps. Sitting over each slice of jack is a crisp square of gim, which the Japanese call nori. Pinch some fish inside the gim and eat it, and the flavors that unspool are some of those that are brought to the table with Korean sashimi, but they're put together with a harmony that's hard to achieve when you swab them yourself under the influence of a few glasses of soju. Inspired by a poem from the Choson era, Mr. Park summoned an entirely different set of flavors for the hwe on Atomix's opening menu, which ran from late May to early September. Then, the fish was sea bream, firm and chewy, marinated overnight with ginger in a magnificently good tangerine vinegar from the island of Jeju. Eaten with sea urchin, plain spinach, sparkling shards of jelly made from pale young soy sauce, and Chinese-mustard leaves fermented in some wonderful way, it was so deeply harmonic I wouldn't have minded if Mr. Park had served it over and over for the rest of the meal. Centuries before it became the fashion among American chefs, fermentation was a pillar of Korean cuisine. Atomix exploits it in all kinds of ways. Fermentation bends a mix of juices from Korean pears, green apples and pineapple toward a cidery direction that makes it a thrilling marinade, braising liquid and sauce for exquisitely rich Wagyu strip loin. It's the foundation for an array of vinegars you won't find on the average table in Koreatown: cherry blossom, persimmon, mugwort, birch. And, of course, fermentation is behind the restaurant's arsenal of pickled vegetables, the most interesting of which may be the tart brussels sprouts that Mr. Park serves in banchan format alongside roast duck with a mole sauce that could pass muster in Mexico if Mr. Park did not up the funk level with gochujang. Some of these ingredients were fermented or otherwise preserved in South Korea. Many more were put up for storage at Atoboy , the Parks' other restaurant, over the past year or more as the Parks prepared to open Atomix. Atoboy's food is woven around traditional banchan dishes, and while Mr. Park gives himself room to play, the cooking there stays true to the fairly simple origins of banchan. His tasting menus at Atomix make a quantum leap in complexity. It's like seeing the guy who strums the 12-string guitar on the L platform pick up a conductor's baton and lead an orchestra through a Mahler symphony. On the back of Atomix's flashcards he lists the components of each dish, and each of their ingredients -- around 20 on average, very few of them ordinary and none of them out of place. Nothing at Atomix tastes confused or overburdened. The dishes are even more elaborate than those at Jungsik , the rarefied Korean-inspired restaurant downtown where Mr. Park was the chef de cuisine before he and his wife struck out on their own. And while Jungsik seems determined to stuff Korean flavors into an outdated French formality, Atomix is warm, contemporary and Korean at just about every turn. The Parks, who were raised in South Korea, hired a Seoul architecture firm, Studio Writers, to remake two floors of a secretive-looking townhouse on East 30th Street. Upstairs is a small bar where you can slither into a pale-leather booth to idle over smartly conceived snacks like soy-marinated scallop jerky; beef tartare, mixed with red and black pepper, and under a snowfall of pecorino; or fried wings stuffed with fried rice and dusted with ground Sichuan peppercorns. Stairs descend to a bright, skylit lounge of upholstered benches where the tasting menu kicks off with a couple of hors d'oeuvres and drinks. The idea must be for you to leave the shuffle of Manhattan behind in stages, but I always spent my few minutes in this way station eyeing the comfortable, dark, wood-clad den a few steps away where the rest of the meal is served at a 14-seat counter. The natural materials and simple lines in the tasting room seem to bow toward Korea's long Zen tradition, and a kind of purposeful calm reigns there. Servers and cooks all wear flowing, boat-neck shirts in a shimmering pewter color that gives them a slight science-fiction look; they are the work of a Korean-born New York designer, Sungho Ahn. Ms. Park, who goes by Ellia, glides behind the counter, smiling and holding out a cloth case to offer a pair of the Korean-made chopsticks she collects. They're beautiful objects, and so are the handmade plates and bowls that begin to file out of the kitchen, each made by a potter or glass worker or wood carver in South Korea. These artisans are identified on the menu cards, whose abstract designs are the work of a South Korean artist. Tasting menus can be arid and sterile when a chef doesn't have much to say. The format comes to life when a restaurant is overflowing with ideas, like Atomix. The way the Parks put Korean culture in the foreground recalls the early days of the Four Seasons, which moved beyond European models of formal dining by hiring an American architect and American industrial designers to go along with the American ingredients and even American wines. The Four Seasons had a Swiss chef, though. Atomix is more thorough: It has the Parks. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

The Rainbow Room had Art Deco razzmatazz and its revolving dance floor; Windows on the World, before terrorists destroyed it, served cocktails in a room named the Greatest Bar on Earth. Manhatta , which recently opened on the 60th floor of an International Style tower downtown, doesn't follow their lead. It is the least show-offy skyscraper restaurant you've ever seen. The whole operation is very orderly and well behaved, apart from its refusal to spell its own name correctly. (The reference is to the Lenni Lenape name Manahatta, or Mannahatta, meaning \"island of many hills,\" but without the second \"a\" the name just looks incomplete. It's like a child named Henr.) A dedicated door around the corner from the building's main entrance brings you into a foyer that, with its sleek chairs and coffee tables, looks like the lobby of one of those 1960s white-brick apartment buildings in the East 40s and 50s. When you get out of the elevator -- it goes to just one floor, the top -- a short walk leads to another sparsely furnished sitting area, this one looking out the windows toward the harbor and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. When the lounge hasn't been rented out for parties and sealed off, it's busier than the foyer downstairs, but it still appears to have been designed for people who are waiting for their dates to get back from the restroom. In the other direction are Manhatta's bar, a longish counter whose seats face uptown, and its dining room, which looks both north and east toward Brooklyn. The color scheme, navy-blue leather and dark wood, might strike the Knickerbocker Club 's board as a little too conservative. An open kitchen has been dropped down into the middle of all this, but the overall design strategy is to sit back and let the windows do the work. Danny Meyer, whose Union Square Hospitality Group runs Manhatta through a management contract with the building's owner, told The New York Times last year that Manhatta would not be as flamboyant as a typical top-floor restaurant. \"Those kinds of places often do not live up to expectations; they try too hard to live up to the view,\" he said. \"I expect to conceive of it like a ground-floor restaurant, as a place people might want to visit regularly.\" You can't blame Mr. Meyer for not wanting to open a mediocre splashy restaurant, but Manhatta flirts dangerously with being a mediocre unsplashy restaurant. The chef, Jason Pfeifer, doesn't quite let that happen. His French menu, grounded in seasonal flavors, is fairly priced at $78, including tip, for a three-course prix fixe. A good amount of it is very likable, but there are more spongy patches than there probably should be. At their best, Manhatta's better appetizers and main courses are fleshed out with fruits and vegetables so ripe and pristine they seem to come from a Greenmarket stall that only Mr. Pfeifer can see. A melon and cucumber salad with fluffy curds of feta was an exploration of melonic potential; each section of fruit was a bit different, some infused with citrus, others dripping with unfiltered garden-patch sweetness, all of them tangy with white balsamic vinegar. An admirably cooked brick of halibut was paired with bittersweet fennel bulbs and a mustard sauce with a gentle but effective bite. Raw nectarine crescents, braised lettuces and tender thin wheels of immature corn on the cob augmenting a main course of chicken were their charming selves, and all the better for their slinky dressing of chicken jus. Sweet black figs stood in for apples in a memorable little tarte Tatin garnished with raw pale-green figs. (Jennifer Bretania and Vanesa Beltran share the pastry duties.) Gently marinated hen-of-the-woods mushrooms made an exquisitely woodsy counterpoint to ruffles of shaved La Marotte sheep cheese. But generous applications of produce don't always save the food from seeming a bit safe, conservative and slightly dated. Mr. Pfeifer, who spent eight years in the kitchen at Maialino , Mr. Meyer's Roman-inspired restaurant, is now cooking French food in the post-nouvelle mode that Daniel Boulud has been artfully fomenting for years. Mr. Boulud has earned the right to keep working in that groove as long as he likes, but it's strange to find a young chef at a new, high-profile destination doing it when others around the city are pushing ahead with contemporary interpretations of French cuisine. And when Manhatta turns to the classics, its use of French idioms seems skin-deep compared with Laetitia Rouabah's light touch and sophisticated technique at Benoit , or Marie-Aude Rose's painstaking elevations of cafe cooking at La Mercerie , or Daniel Rose's intelligent, neoclassical excavations of silver-cloche cuisine at Le Coucou . Where Le Coucou brought back quenelles as helium-light pike dumplings in dizzyingly rich lobster-brandy sauce, Manhatta turns them into quivering balls of pudding distantly scented with seafood. Of all the ways a modern chef might grapple with cassoulet, the sublimely burly Languedocian assault on the digestive system, upending it over a crisp and golden chicken paillard has to be one of the strangest. Manhatta isn't the first restaurant to update veal blanquette with meat that's roasted rather than stewed, but the sauce is so blandly milky that it's hardly there. And while modern desserts can stray into savory territory more than they did in Escoffier's day, a vanilla souffl\u00e9 with butterscotch sauce probably shouldn't taste salty. Some of this was dispiriting, but I never got up from the table in a bad mood. There are grace notes throughout the restaurant, like the dark, shiny little canel\u00e9s that show up with dessert. This being a Union Square Hospitality production, the servers seem to be trained mind readers. A pair of the mismatched binoculars scattered around the restaurant materialized just when I was trying to locate the clock tower in the Consolidated Edison Building; before I'd had a chance to point out a fruit fly in my wine (did it ride up with me in the elevator?) a sommelier spirited the glass away and brought a fresh one. Mr. Meyer was probably right to take a dialed-down approach to the top-floor restaurant genre. It dates from a more innocent age, when people could look at the financial district's unblinking grids of lighted windows as the bland face of high-stakes cheating that we've come to recognize from \"Margin Call\" and \"Billions.\" At the time of the financial crisis, Manhatta's building was the headquarters of JPMorgan Chase -- a relatively minor player in the three-card-monte game of mortgage-backed securities, but a player nonetheless. Ten years have gone by, but it's still too soon for revolving dance floors. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

At best I might have spotted the tiny parking lot in Midwood, with tattered red, blue and silver streamers flapping over its 10 or so spaces, giving it the appearance of the world's smallest used-car dealership. In the back is a wide, single-story structure that looks like the trailer office where you would sit down to discuss loan options with Marty from financing. But that building is an Azerbaijani restaurant that stands out among the dining outposts of former Soviet republics that stretch north from Brighton Beach, and each time I've gone inside I was given not a credit check, but a test of my appetite's limits. This is not just because almost every platter of food that leaves the kitchen at Village Cafe seems intended to feed an actual village. I run into trouble because there are so many things I want to order and so few things I am willing to leave on the table as the meal winds down. There will never be a time when I go to Village Cafe and decide not to have at least one qutab, if not all three. The menu gives the name of this delicate Azerbaijani flatbread, the diameter of a pita but thinner, as kutaby. Either way, it is very good when stuffed with minced, quietly spiced chicken or lamb. It is exceptional when filled with greens: spinach, scallions, and dill and cilantro, two fresh herbs that turn up again and again in Azerbaijani cooking. I will always want the crimped dumplings, the size and shape of chicken drumettes, that the English menu calls ravioli and the servers call pelmeni. Filled with chicken or lamb, these dumplings can be boiled, but the urge to ask for them fried is overwhelming, and the fried ones are better dunked in the tomato-pepper sauce that I would call salsa if I were not in an Azerbaijani restaurant. There will be liver on my table, too. Maybe it will be Turkish style, little fried cubes under a tart purple dusting of ground sumac. Or the liver may be added to bits of lamb hearts, kidney and testicles, and cooked with onions and potato cubes in a fantastically oily hash called djiz biz. Whether I will eat guru hingal will depend on how far in advance I've planned my meal, because it generally has to be ordered a day ahead. It is a noodle dish: very thin, wide sheets of pasta under a sauce of onions and ground lamb fried in its own fat until it is magnificently crunchy. If you poured chile oil over guru hingal, it would taste Sichuanese; stew the lamb with tomatoes and you could mistake the sauce for Bolognese. But it's from Azerbaijan, and it's good with yogurt. And I will have soup, even if nobody else does, because Village Cafe's kitchen understands how to make it. The kufta-bozbash is a strong, well-skimmed lamb broth with chickpeas and a single, tender lamb-rice meatball, as big as an apple. The broth for dushbara soup is similar, but the ballast is provided by miniature lamb dumplings about the size of M&Ms. Cilantro and dried mint are added to both soups at the last minute, and the mint is especially helpful. Village Cafe's hot borscht, strong and decidedly unvegetarian, outperforms some I've had in Brighton Beach. Instead of sour cream, it comes with a spoonful of yogurt. The cuisine of Azerbaijan often echoes those of its neighbors Georgia, Armenia and Iran, but other dishes, like borscht, were hauled down from Eastern Europe in the strong arms of Mother Russia. We can also thank Russia for the insane music videos that play on Village Cafe's two televisions, typically with the volume off while American pop of the '80s plays on the sound system. You sit at what appear to be varnished picnic tables with chairs instead of benches. The rest of the d\u00e9cor looks like a Brighton Beach yard sale: a mushroom cookie jar, an embroidered peasant smock, a camouflage cap, a samovar or two, a collection of beaded handbags, several ceramic cows, three statues of fat chefs with toques and mustaches, and two giant forks mounted on the wall. For atmosphere, Village Cafe is roundly beaten by my second-favorite Azerbaijani restaurant in Brooklyn, Old Baku in Kensington. Walk past the awning that says \"private club,\" past the curtained booths in the front dining room, past the open kitchen where chefs scoop burning coals to keep the fire under the kebabs going strong, and you enter a courtyard from another country. Almost everybody at Old Baku is smoking under the arbor of grape vines that weave around strings of white lights. If you go in the fall, you might be brought a plate of purple grapes, newly picked a few feet away. But Village Cafe gains its edge on Old Baku in the kitchen. The stewed fruit ladled over saffron rice in its plov, for instance, is a richer and more varied compilation of dried plums, apricots, chestnuts and deeply browned lamb. The salads are brighter, too, if you can get over some of the names. The menu was evidently written by someone with a weakness for poetry, so the salads are called things like \"Journey to Baku,\" \"Winter Fun\" and \"Unexpected Guests.\" The Journey to Baku is worth taking; it's a sharply seasoned, smoky eggplant mash with peppers and tomatoes. The kidney beans in a traditional lobio salad are creamy, salty and well-oiled under their topping of chopped walnuts and cilantro. Main course names incline toward the allusive as well, with one chicken cutlet called \"Miracle of Village\" and another -- buried under a white pillow of cheese and cream sauce -- that goes by \"Mother In Laws Chicken.\" But really, the best place to go once all the amenities have been polished off is the kebabs. The quail may be a bit wizened. The grilled testicles with a hint of lemon in their lightly browned surfaces will always be a niche proposition. But the lamb ribs, the marinated lamb chops known as chalahac and the flatbread-wrapped Azerbaijani version of kofte called lulya kebabs (made from chicken or lamb) are extremely good. The vegetable skewer choices begin and end with blistered tomatoes and softly collapsing eggplant. Both are worthwhile. So is the side dish called \"homemade potatoes,\" if there is any room left on the table. Sliced and fried with onions, they narrowly beat out the pretty good fries. A cup or two of strong dark tea will speed your recovery from this onslaught. Dessert may not. Still, there is something to be said for trying a Napoleon made like baklava and a baklava made like a Napoleon. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

Starbucks, the company he joined after that trip and would eventually lead , might teach its employees the fine arts of Malaysian kopi, brewed by pouring hot water over grounds in the bottom of a sock, rather than show them how to operate an espresso machine. Instead of white-chocolate mocha lattes, we would drink bek-kopi, white coffee, brewed from beans that are lightly roasted in palm oil margarine. Venti would just be Italian for a number, while kopi-C kosong, or strong black coffee with unsweetened condensed milk, would have entered the American lexicon, along with kopi tarik, the same drink made with sweetened condensed milk. There would be no competitions where baristas drew swans and elephants in milk froth, and in their place we would have exhibitions of coffee and tea pulling , the art of cooling the beverage while coaxing the milk in it to form a foamy head by pouring it from one pot to another in long, swooping, steamy cataracts. In other words, the places where we get our caffeine fix might look a lot like Kopitiam , on East Broadway in Chinatown. Kyo Pang founded Kopitiam three years ago as a homage to the coffee and tea parlors of Malaysia, where she grew up. A typical Malaysian kopitiam is a ramshackle hangout where people drop in to read the morning paper, grab breakfast, catch up on neighborhood gossip and do all the other things that classically accompany a cup of tea or coffee. Something of that spirit pervades Kopitiam, too. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] The original Kopitiam, reviewed by Ligaya Mishan in a 2015 Hungry City column, was situated around the corner on Canal Street and had just four seats at a single counter. In June, Ms. Pang and her new business partner, Moonlynn Tsai, relocated to a larger, if still fairly intimate, space a few steps above the sidewalk. You order at the counter and receive a number on a metal stand, a kind of promissory note for the food and beverages. If you show up on a weekday in the morning or afternoon, when seats are not hard to come by and the room has a languid, unhurried air, you could get just a cup of bek-kopi and linger over it with a newspaper. You will probably want more than that, though. From 9 a.m., when the doors open, until 10 p.m., when they close, you can get nasi lemak, Malaysia's national dish and a particular favorite at breakfast. I don't know another kitchen in the city where the fragrances of coconut and pandan leaf infuse the rice as elegantly, or where the tiny dried fish, which Kopitiam fries with peanuts, form a caramelized crust that erases the distinction between sweet and savory. Or your breakfast could be a bowl of two eggs boiled just long enough to turn the whites opaque while leaving the yolks free to billow into mushroom-soy broth underneath. Or it might be fish ball soup, grape-size globes of ground fish in a cloudy white broth; if the grains of white pepper on the surface aren't intense enough for you, you can stir in a little fish sauce spiced with bird's eye chiles. Rice vermicelli can be added, too, but the soup is easier to appreciate in pure liquid form. For mornings when nothing but a cannonball dive into sugar will do, Kopitiam is ready with a sculptural pile of thick-cut French toast battered with Milo malt-chocolate powder, a Malaysian passion, with streams of sweetened condensed milk playing the part that in this country is normally taken by maple syrup. Eat the whole stack and you will know the answer to the musical question posed by the Cramps: How far can too far go? At 10:30 a.m. Ms. Pang, the chef, adds a gang of new dishes to the breakfast crew, and all of them stick around until closing time. There are fresh little oysters embedded in a thin browned omelet, rice noodles in a chilled sesame-oil broth with a growl of chile heat and spicy skate steamed in banana leaves, the classic acoustic version of the dish that Max Ng plays with amplifiers and wah-wah pedals at Momofuku Ssam Bar . Any of these could make a small meal. But one of the most inviting aspects of Kopitiam is Ms. Pang's fidelity to the Malaysian love of snacks. Pandan leaves wrapped around a kind of chicken sausage; ground five-spice pork rolled inside bean-curd skins and fried; fried strips of mackerel sausage with a curry-leaf sauce -- any of them makes a fine appetizer, but each could just as easily be the entire goal of a between-meals stop at Kopitiam. For that matter, so could the small sweets like pulut: triangular, pandan-wrapped bundles of sticky rice tinted with blue morning glory flowers and spread with toasted coconut sugar or house-made coconut jam. Ms. Pang is devoted to cakes as well. You get the sense that if it were physically possible, she'd bake every cake she knows every day, but she settles for one or two in an unpredictable rotation. You may find the caramel-brown honeycomb cake, with its intriguing structure of hollow vertical columns at the bottom, or you may find her coconut cake, or there may be some fresh surprise. Snacks and sweets tend to get edged out of the spotlight in New York restaurants, where there's always pressure to order something big. This is, after all, a city that turned the casual tapas bar into the peculiar genre known as the tapas restaurant. There is no such pressure inside Kopitiam, at least on weekdays. Weekend brunch is another story, as it often is. The menu is the same, but the crowds thicken. A sign-in sheet is kept outside the door, next to the pink pay phone (25 cents; it works), and hopeful customers sit on ceramic garden stools at the top of the stoop listening for their names. When you're finally called, you may feel silly getting nothing more than tannic milky tea and a bundle of blue sticky rice. And when demand peaks, chaos can creep in, suggesting that Kopitiam is still figuring out the mechanics of its larger space. Servers may pop by anxiously to ask, \"Did you get all your food?\" and the answer may be no. Drink orders may stack up. Once the white coffee was off the menu; another time, no coffee at all was being poured; and for a short time one day, both coffee and tea were unavailable, an awkward state of affairs for a coffee and tea parlor. Even with a backlog of tickets, though, the food trickling out of the kitchen is almost unfailingly terrific. Maybe the stir-fried duck tongues I ate last time could have slid from their cartilaginous framework more easily. Then again, maybe I wasn't in the right mood for duck tongues.

The restaurant was empty, too. I sat alone on one side of the counter, and on the other stood Mr. Wilcox, alone, as he usually is even when customers occupy all 12 chairs. Although assistants work in the wings, the restaurant is essentially a one-man show. In the broad view, having the place to myself was unjust. In the year since Mr. Wilcox took over the restaurant -- at first his work there was termed a residency or pop-up, but in June the owner, Idan Elkon, announced that he'd put a ring on it and made the arrangement permanent -- he has firmly placed it in the top tier of the city's Japanese restaurants. On the basis of sushi alone, Shoji has few plausible rivals, and for sushi embedded within a longer, kaiseki-derived menu, it has no parallel. There should be no empty seats, no matter how many New Yorkers are off lolling at the beach. Taking a selfish view, though, I wasn't particularly unhappy to be the only customer. Mr. Wilcox, who grew up in Virginia, cooked at a kaiseki restaurant in Kyoto called Kikunoi for seven years and then spent three more at a traditionalist sushi parlor in the Ginza district of Tokyo. You might think of this as the equivalent of earning a master's degree followed by a Ph.D. in Japanese cuisine, and one side benefit of a meal across the counter from Mr. Wilcox is the chance to hear what he learned studying abroad. Show some curiosity and you could get a short education in the mineral-rich clay used by potters in the town of Shigaraki, or the various aliases and false names under which a particularly delicious, pink-fleshed fish known as akamutsu in Japan travels under when it is away from home. On this August night, I was about to get a two-hour schooling on the pleasures of summer sushi. Mr. Wilcox's opening move was a squiggle of what looked like short, thick noodles and turned out to be lengths of chilled eggplant; Mr. Wilcox had given them a cool bath in the light sauce in which icy coils of somen noodles are dipped in summer. Laid over the top were two tongues of bafun sea urchin, a species with the color of a nearly ripe persimmon. With one dish, he had shooed away the heat outside, shown off the uncanny harmony of urchin and eggplant, and introduced a minor theme of the night, the summer urchin harvest in Japan. This overture out of the way, Mr. Wilcox lifted what appeared to be a machete. This was a hamo knife, a heavy swath of sharp steel that can reduce the daggertooth pike conger's dozens of tiny bones to edible smithereens; before the first one was forged in the 19th century, he explained, the eel had to be fully cooked and separated from its skeleton. This hamo would be quickly scorched on one side and served with a lick of wasabi and pur\u00e9ed salt-cured plums thinned with dashi. Sashimi came next in the form of shioko, or kanpachi caught when it is young and its flavor is leaner and softer than it will get later in the year. This was followed by a local fish that in the spring Mr. Wilcox had told me he didn't like, striped bass. He had been working with it, though, salting it overnight and then grilling it until the skin crackled. Now I don't want striped bass cooked any other way. After this was Mr. Wilcox's nod to the kaiseki tradition known as takiawase, a plate of simmered vegetables and, in this case, seafood: a small potato, some Japanese eggplant, a crisp pink ginger shoot and the most flavorful piece of octopus I have ever put in my mouth. After my first meal at Shoji I learned to hope that chawan mushi, a bowl of steaming-hot tofu custard, was on the menu. In spring Mr. Wilcox made it with spot prawns, but tonight, in homage to clambake season, he was serving lobster chawan mushi. To this point, the menu had faithfully followed kaiseki's ritualized sequence of courses and its stopwatch-precise attention to seasonality. It was about to veer in a different direction, but it was enough to suggest that Mr. Wilcox could open a kaiseki restaurant that would set a new standard in the city. I'm not sure the city would support it, but it would be spectacular while it lasted. The different direction, of course, was sushi. Accounting for just about half the Shoji menu, the sushi portion is briefer and offers less variety than the full monty at, say, Sushi Amane or Ginza Sushi Onodera . But I'm not sure any competitor outflanks Shoji on the quality of the seafood it does serve, or in the timeliness with which it serves up exactly the specimens most worth tracking down at any given moment. In spring, when bioluminescent firefly squid are spawning in Japanese bays, Mr. Wilcox gets them. In August, when cuttlefish are thumbnail size, unbelievably smooth and as meltingly soft as the thinnest sheet of nova at Russ & Daughters , he will lay three of those over a single finger of rice. He tracks bluefin that has been caught from healthy stocks, like the o-toro from Ireland that he served last spring and that was so seductive it could have been captioned \"the guy she told you not to worry about.\" While in Japan, Mr. Wilcox learned to make fresh ikura from sacs of salmon roe, a slow process that requires massaging the eggs apart by hand in many changes of water. Normally the roe is then heavily cured with sugar and salt, but the roe he was serving last month was very lightly seasoned before being spooned into a shot glass and served as is -- sticky, fatty, sweet and fresh. After the last piece of fish, the kaiseki format kicks in again with a soup, which may be as simple as a classic bowl of miso or may break with tradition, like the extraordinary corn soup I ate in August. There will be something cold and refreshing, maybe a granita made from ginger or matcha, and finally a more substantial dessert. Sometimes this is a sort of tart with seasonal fruit -- candied kumquats, maybe, or white peaches and blueberries -- arranged in a mochi wafer called monaka. For all this the charge is $252, service included. A shorter menu is available at $190, or a longer one at $295, again with service included. That service is somewhat minimal; lately it has meant a single employee assiduously refilling water glasses and taking orders from a drinks list whose cheapest item is a $12 bottle of beer. Could my server have been more adept at deciphering the wines, sakes, shochus and Haitian rums Mr. Elkon and Mr. Wilcox have put together? Perhaps, but I wouldn't necessarily want the scene cluttered by a sommelier in full pocket-square-and-cuff-links regalia. More employees hovering at the counter might take away from the bond Mr. Wilcox builds with the people he feeds. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

Unfair to the cuisine and unfair to would-be eaters. If you want a symbol for the state of the cuisine in New York City, Taste of Persia NYC will fit the bill. Until recently I might have called it the city's most promising Iranian kitchen, if the word kitchen weren't such a stretch. Taste of Persia is a takeout operation squeezed into the front window of a Chelsea pizzeria, except during the two months when fire damage forced it to take up temporary residence in a holiday market. It does show off some of the pleasures of the Iranian table, but not the table itself. So a new Brooklyn restaurant called Sofreh , which joined the Iranian ranks in June, would have caused a stir even if the cooking weren't quite as good as it is. The dining room is spare and modern, with exposed rafters, molded plywood chairs and shades of soft white. You have to look carefully to see the breaks with garden-variety minimalism, like the echoes of medieval arches behind the bar and the Persian calligraphy carved into the plaster in the back, where a small deck hangs above a garden. Minimalism surrenders entirely in the bathroom, papered in a pulpy collage of posters from pre-revolutionary Iranian cinema. All summer, Iranian expats and hopeful fans of Iranian cuisine have been filing in, armed with questions: Does the saffron rice stand high in voluminous heaps of discrete grains? Are nigella seeds embedded in the dimpled, golden crusts of the oval loaves of barbari? Do the cold shards of sorbet frozen around threads of noodles in Sofreh's faloodeh contain just enough rose water to soften the bite of lime syrup? Check, check and check. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] The main dining room is on the street level of a Prospect Heights brownstone just off Flatbush Avenue, and the food is largely in a domestic mode. Nasim Alikhani , who owns the restaurant with her husband, Theodore Petroulas, is responsible for the menu. Ms. Alikhani has never worked in a restaurant before. Rather than following the plating fashions of more trend-conscious chefs, she models the cooking after the things she might make when company comes over. Platoons of kebabs dominate the menus of other Iranian restaurants around town, but home kitchens are rarely built with vast indoor grills; Sofreh's cooking, entrusted to two chefs named Ali Saboor and Soroosh Golbabae, revolves around the oven and stovetop. A loaf of barbari, its crust baked to a Roman-pizza crackle in a revolving oven, is served with many of the appetizers, and it is always gone so soon that I end up ordering one or two more. This flatbread is of course ideal for tearing and swishing into the thick yogurt dips, one mixed with golden raisins and shredded cucumber, another with minced shallots and chives. It is indispensable with the eggplant mash enriched with walnuts, strained yogurt and sweet fried onions. A loaf of barbari is also spread with herbs and feta that is more creamy than briny. Earlier in the summer Sofreh offered an appetizer of dry, underseasoned beef meatballs with sour cherries. One of the only things on the menu that was hard to warm up to, it has been replaced lately by beef kofte, made light and tender by rice and stewed split peas. The kofte sit in a gentle saffron-tomato sauce that is another natural partner for Sofreh's bread. Ms. Alikhani, 59, grew up in the sprawling desert city Isfahan, and moved to the United States in her early 20s. For years she cooked Iranian dishes from memory, and it would be decades before she traveled back to Iran to learn more about its food in preparation for opening Sofreh. Her version of ash, the herb and whole-wheat noodle stew, stands out on the menu because it stays so close to tradition. Other dishes show the acclimatizing effect of New York. It's an article of faith for chefs in the city that any dish can be improved by putting a poached egg on it. I'm not so sure that Sofreh's smoked eggplant halves with their sweet, garlic-drenched tomato sauce need one, though. Is the watermelon feta salad familiar from restaurants that have nothing to do with Iran? Maybe just a bit, but Sofreh's version stands out for its intriguing sauce of nigella seeds crushed into mint oil. And while the Shiraz salad isn't chopped to fine bits in the traditional way that makes it something like Iran's answer to pico de gallo, its sour purple flecks of sumac distinguish it from the herd of tomato-cucumber assemblages. The menu is fairly concise, and occasionally I wished that it plunged into tradition with less restraint. For a dish called \"catch of the day,\" Ms. Alikhani has adapted ghalieh mahi, a tamarind-soured stew of fish and fresh herbs from southern Iran. In her version, a pan-seared hunk of whitefish -- halibut and cod have taken turns in the role -- is set over a long-cooked sauce. Dark with caramelized onions and fried cilantro and fresh fenugreek leaves, the sauce is hypnotically complex. Still, a sauce sitting under fish is not the same as one that has been cooked with fish so the flavors can get acquainted. A simple flattened and griddled half chicken, though, is a wonderful foil for a topping of tart barberries and a captivating sauce of dried Persian plums and saffron. And there's lovely simplicity to the braised lamb shank with roasted garlic and sizzled onions; the turmeric- and cinnamon-scented sauce might have been put on this earth to be spooned over fluffy rice. There is no shame in ending the meal with a goblet of thick yogurt parfait with jam and pistachios. But there are harder-to-find sweets, too, like the rose-water custard, grainy with rice flour, transformed into a sort of tart by a crust of chopped nuts. Saffron and rose-water ice cream is luxuriously rich despite a few stray ice crystals. And the faloodeh, one of the world's oldest frozen desserts, will put to rest all doubts about the wisdom of embedding sorbet in a nest of vermicelli, if there were any doubts to begin with.

When it opened in 1994, it was the first restaurant outside Los Angeles to offer Nobuyuki Matsuhisa 's startling new liaison of sushi and other Japanese food with Peruvian flavors. The herds of imitators were still to come. If you wanted to try raw yellowtail in ponzu under a green jalape\u00f1o wheel, or fried rock shrimp shimmering with spiced mayonnaise, or broiled black cod in miso so sweet it might have been maple syrup -- and for a few years it seemed as if that was all anybody wanted -- you either went to Matsuhisa in Beverly Hills, Calif., or you went to Hudson Street. Now you can eat Nobu ceviche in Dubai, Budapest and Cape Town. If you want Nobu sashimi salad for dinner followed by a night in a Nobu hotel, you can do that in Marbella, Manila, Miami or Palo Alto. When the United States Space Force establishes its first lunar base, the generals and majors will no doubt find a Nobu there, with tuna tataki on the menu and a line three-deep at the bar. This is because after the success of Nobu in TriBeCa, Mr. Matsuhisa and his partners made a strategic decision. The food would stay roughly the same -- more on this in a minute -- but the surroundings would grow bigger, boozier, louder, more theatrical. If Nobu did not exactly invent the Asian Party Temple restaurant genre, it certainly drew the blueprints. At these new Nobus, Mr. Matsuhisa's food was still a major event, but not necessarily the main event. And the question was not just whether you felt like eating at Nobu but whether you felt like being at Nobu. The Malibu location in particular has a reputation for intense good-time vibes that can drive away customers who merely want to eat. All this was encapsulated for me in two brief scenes from my recent meals at Nobu Downtown and Nobu Fifty Seven . The first episode took place while I was sitting at the sushi bar of Nobu Downtown. This location, inside the old AT&T tower on Lower Broadway, is theoretically the successor to the first Nobu; it opened last year a few weeks after the original closed. The sushi bar was the heart of the TriBeCa restaurant. The chefs behind it prepared or touched at least half the food, and seats there were so coveted that during the 1990s, when even celebrities complained about how hard it was to get in, a mostly sushi restaurant called Next Door Nobu was opened simply to contain the overflow. (It closed last year, too, and won't be replaced.) At Nobu Downtown, the upstairs sushi counter is on the far side of the cocktail bar that the design firm Rockwell Group slipped in among the enormous fluted limestone columns that fill the building's ground floor like a petrified forest. I had just eaten a piece of Japanese scallop sushi with a dangerous streak of wasabi when an animated group of four new arrivals appeared next to me. The sushi chefs eyed them warily, because they appeared to intend to cluster around a single stool, the way people do at a bar. Soon it became apparent that they thought they were at the bar. But the people they mistook for bartenders were all busy slicing raw fish, so eventually the group moved on to look for somebody to make them a drink. Moments like this didn't tend to happen at the original Nobu, but they do bring Nobu Downtown in line with Nobu Fifty Seven. In business on 57th Street since 2005, Nobu Fifty Seven is another two-story proposition. Between 5 and 7 p.m. its ground-floor lounge acts on young Midtown professionals like the fishing nets evoked by Rockwell Group's design. At the time the second scene took place, the bartenders looked as if they were struggling not to get caught. My cocktail, a Negroni-esque thing with sake in it that was ferried to my upstairs table from the downstairs bar, was neither shaken nor stirred; it was, in fact, almost hot. While I was waiting for the cocktail to be cooled by its single ice cube, a server was struggling to open a bottle of Champagne for a table of at least 10 men next to me. When the cork came out, he managed to spray the room in a manner usually seen in the Super Bowl champions' locker room. Everybody nearby got a little wet, including me and my guests, but nobody seemed to notice. Servers at both addresses have the brisk, well-drilled, impersonal and slightly numbed quality that comes of waiting on hundreds of people a day. At Nobu Fifty-Seven, one told me, \"Our menu is kaiseki style, so it's like tapas. Everything is meant for sharing.\" I must have looked confused because he added, \"Some dishes are going to be bigger than others.\" Nobu Fifty-Seven was given three stars in its last New York Times review , by Frank Bruni in 2005. That's what Ruth Reichl gave the original in 1995. After three recent visits to each location, I decided that, apart from minor menu variations, any qualitative difference in the food between the two branches is too subtle for me to make out. The chefs uptown are Taku Sato and Matt Hoyle. Downtown was led by Ricky Estrellado and Ryo Hasegawa until June, when Mr. Estrellado died suddenly. His successor has not been named. Both kitchens are models of superior ingredient shopping and consistent performance. When those classic Nobu dishes appear, they will be exactly like the last time you had them. In the case of the mayo-bathed fried shrimp, that may not be an entirely good thing. And I still think the flavor of the caviar that crowns tuna, or salmon, or yellowtail tartare gets elbowed out of the way by the wasabi-soy sauce. But the tiradito, slices of yellowtail squirted with lemon and yuzu juice, then dotted with pur\u00e9ed rocoto pepper, is always wonderfully bracing. The candylike black cod is as hard to deny as ever, even if the extra sweetening Mr. Matsuhisa gives this traditional Japanese dish strikes me as somewhat shameless. The sashimi salad and the lobster shiitake salads are both better than any salad from a global chain has the right to be. I don't know who orders the dishes marked Nobu Now, but I tried a few. Umami Chilean sea bass: not worth it, even for the slightly exotic return of a fish that hasn't been seen much since the '90s. Kumamoto shooters: a thrilling series of flavors that will recall the way you felt the first time you ate at Nobu. Michele Goldsmith's desserts, served both uptown and downtown, are modern and playful and don't try too hard to follow the theme, whatever that is. Over the years, the Hudson Street Nobu became something unusual, a restaurant that could serve tourists and families from around the corner with equal aplomb. But a meal at Nobu is still among the best, although not the cheapest, ways to introduce children to raw fish. And sitting at the sushi bar can still provide the intimacy that the rest of the place lacks. The chefs behind the counter may not draw the kinmedai cultists who flock to Sushi Zo or Sushi Ginza Onodera , but they know what they're doing, and they light up when they get a customer who can tell.

With its shelves of records, tapes, books, newspapers, dyed Easter eggs, the beeswax styluses used to give those eggs their symmetrical patterns, white smocks and blouses with red and black embroidery, and local honey, Surma Book & Music Company had operated on East Seventh Street since 1943. At other addresses, it went back to 1918. Two summers ago, it closed , going the way of Ukrainian butcher shops selling wrinkled sticks of hunter's sausage, Ukrainian restaurants offering starchy knobs of halusky, and Ukrainian bars where the customers were downing shots of vodka before that was cool, and kept going after it wasn't. The East Village is a less interesting place without Surma. But the chain-store monoculture that might have seemed inevitable as the Ukrainian community fell away hasn't been the neighborhood's fate. Not yet. New Chinese restaurants have sprung up in the area over the past few years faster than the old Eastern European business have died off. In January, one of them moved into Surma's old address. It's called Le Sia, and it's thriving. Walk in any weekend night between 6 and 9, and a small throng will be waiting for seats by the entrance, below the kayaks that are stowed up by the ceiling as if this were the garage of somebody's summer house. During the week, Le Sia takes reservations, but that doesn't ease the demand by much. On some nights, the crowd is almost exclusively Chinese people of college age or slightly older, many of them lured out of their nearby New York University dorm rooms for steaming pans of shellfish, especially Le Sia's specialty, crayfish. Although a server there described the restaurant to me as \"Cajun seafood,\" Le Sia is not serving Acadiana-style crayfish. Nor is it seasoning crayfish with the magical, butter-drenched combinations of Southeast Asian and Louisiana flavors like Thai basil-tamarind and lemongrass-ginger that were spawned in Vietnamese kitchens along Bellaire Boulevard in Houston. Yang Liu and Tianye Chen, who own the restaurant along with its chef, Zac Zhang, are following a separate, unbuttered Chinese tradition that they enjoyed before moving to the United States. It's a fairly young one, as Chinese food traditions go. Crayfish, or xiaolongxia, arrived in China sometime in the middle of the 20th century. After regarding the novel ingredient warily for a few decades, cooks built a cuisine around it. Eaters took to it so enthusiastically that by 2016 the Chinese crayfish industry employed five million people and was worth $27 billion. One major farming center is Hubei province, which recently unveiled a 59-foot-long crayfish sculpture that is said to be the world's largest. Its bright-red pincers are raised victoriously . Le Sia cooks crayfish and other shellfish -- lobster, shrimp, and Dungeness and snow crabs -- by boiling them first and then clacking them around in a hot wok with one of seven sauces. Each sauce can be further customized to one of four chile-heat levels, from mild to \"fire.\" Whatever combination of sea animal and seasoning you ask for, it will arrive at the table almost before the words have left your mouth. For many customers the go-to order seems to be \"crayfish hot and spicy, spicy.\" Hot and spicy sauce, as far as I can make out, is based on soy, miso and garlic; the firepower comes from sliced pickled chiles, but the soy and miso give it a muscular heft. It may be my favorite Le Sia sauce, although it's a close call between that and its near relative, \"numbing and spicy,\" which is propelled into tingling ma la territory by Sichuan peppercorns. I'm fascinated by the kimchi-lime sauce, which conforms to no seafood-boil tradition I know of; its flavor is angular, hybridized, invigorating and not as fiery as you might expect. The garlic sauce hits just one note, and there will be no prizes for guessing which one. There is also a sauce called \"thirteen special-flavor herbal spices.\" I tried it twice, with wildly divergent outcomes. The first time it was a wonderful, nuanced aromatic blend of expected and unexpected Chinese spices. On a second try, it tasted like spiced seawater. The star ingredient can vary, too. Honesty compels me to note that the California crayfish Le Sia has been serving lately have a sweeter, finer flavor than the ones it was getting from Louisiana in the late spring. This will no doubt cost me some friends in New Orleans. On the other hand, those friendships are already on the rocks over my newspaper's insistence on calling the crustacean in question crayfish, rather than crawfish. Le Sia's shrimp, in my encounters with it, was bland and powdery. Dungeness crab arrived overcooked, the meat desperately stuck to the shell. Snow crab was much better: sweet and flaky in the legs, although the white bits at the joints were slightly broken down. But every time I ordered lobster it was juicy and sweet. It may be the safest choice, although I haven't completely given up on the crayfish entirely. At $15 for what looks like a very generous pound, it's worth taking a chance. As for the risks of eating without a pair of plastic gloves, kept in plentiful supply in sealed pouches on the table, or one of the synthetic-fabric black bibs with their swirling red claw-and-antenna designs, that is up to you. A vast stretch of the menu is taken up by northern-Chinese skewers of vegetables and animal parts of many kinds. These tend to arrive even faster than the other dishes, if that's possible. They are not bad as quick, casual snacks, particularly the \"King of Kings\" hot dog, carved into pink lobes that stick out like cat tongues. But other skewers suggest an assembly-line approach that you don't find among the better street-corner grills in Flushing, Queens. The application of the cumin and red pepper seasoning is often just as heavy on delicate ingredients as full-flavored ones, and the grilling times don't seem to be monitored closely. Tiny squid legs, lamb kidneys and enoki mushrooms were all dry and overdone. So was a main course of quail, purportedly smoked over lemongrass and pine cones. Wok-fried clams in garlic sauce were delicious, though, as were many of the cold appetizers, like a rose formation of pickled radish slices; smashed cucumbers in garlic sauce; and Harbin sausage. A specialty of northern China, Harbin sausage immigrated there from Eastern Europe. Pink and dense with smoked pork and fat, it is deeply reminiscent of kielbasa. It's right at home in the East Village.

He was 16 at the time, but he'd been charging money for tasting menus since he was 13, running an early version of Eureka in his mother's house in the San Fernando Valley in California. Earlier this year he opened a restaurant on the Lower East Side that is meant to be permanent, or as permanent as any business venture in Manhattan can be. This one is called Gem, which if nothing else proves he's better at choosing names now that he's 19. I haven't yet seen the new documentary about him, \"Chef Flynn,\" but over the past six years my media diet has not been lacking in news about Mr. McGarry's productive adolescent years. I first learned about him from a brief New Yorker piece written when he was 13, by which time he had made many of the recipes in \"The French Laundry Cookbook\" and cooked for a week at Eleven Madison Park. He was working several days a week in a Los Angeles restaurant and had apprenticed at Next and Alinea by 15, when he was the subject of a Times Magazine article . When he moved himself and his pop-up to New York at 16, I read that his cooking was influenced by his time in the kitchens of Maaemo in Norway and Geranium in Denmark. Still, as I walked into Gem the first time I was wondering, at some level, whether everyone had been too polite to tell him that his brownies needed more time in the oven. Of course, it would be nice to have the answer to that before you buy advance tickets for the eight- to 12-course meal at $155 a person, the only way to reserve a seat. But it doesn't take more than a few minutes at Gem to see that the adults weren't just humoring Mr. McGarry. His cooking is nuanced, his plating is often lyrical and the flavors, at least this spring and summer, have been delicate, subtle and very fresh. The vegetables and fruits he uses in profusion look and taste as if they had dropped off the vine right on to the hand-spun, earth-toned ceramic dishes. My favorite Gem dish so far, delicate and self-assured, was a morsel or two of grilled king crab legs lightly glazed with rose petal miso and set beside soft chamomile-scented potatoes for ballast, red currants for zing and some fluttering rose petals on top for the heck of it. A close rival was the chilled bowl of barely vinegared mackerel interwoven with grilled cucumbers, sliced plums and salty red dabs of mashed fermented plums. The harmonies were right on key, with a Japanese mood that didn't cross the line into outright imitation. White asparagus, an ingredient that seems to flummox some American kitchens, was subjected to a wonderful treatment, patiently browned and basted in butter, then finished with a reduced chicken jus that had a glimmer of vadouvan in it somewhere. Strewing the plate with tender, pale-green pine needles seemed like an affectation at first, but their flavor lifted and brightened the whole package. Mr. McGarry does fine work with deeper flavors, too. Each menu crescendos in a complicated, multicomponent spread, and the best of these featured lamb: barbecue ribs rubbed with cracked coriander seeds and XO sauce, plus a skewered grilled lamb kebab and a tomato salad. Another night built up to an exhibition of squab. A leg, perfectly cooked and sweetened by a maple jus, was very good, but the high point was a very thin and hearty rye cracker spread with squab liver, cherries and pickled ramps; the fruit's bright notes were played off against earthier ones so skillfully they almost shimmered. Back in the family home, and at the Eureka pop-up, Mr. McGarry used to make everything himself. Now he works alongside two cooks, bringing the kitchen team at Gem to the same size as that of my neighborhood slice joint. Some small defeats could be attributed to Mr. McGarry's lack of experience with weather patterns in the Northeast. A warm beet, languorously braised in smoked beet juice until it is soft and sticky like salt water taffy and then basted with a beet-based bordelaise sauce, was impressive in June. In July's heat wave it was as welcome as a space heater. And maybe he wouldn't have served starchy grilled peas if he'd known how quickly the summer sun can make them tough. By the way, Mr. McGarry doesn't make brownies, at least not at Gem. Dessert after each of my three meals was more or less the same thing: bowls of ripe berries, served one night with whipped cream infused with chamomile and rose hips and another time with bay leaf and bee-pollen ice creams. You couldn't ask for a more refreshing course on a hot summer night, but at the same time it's clear that he has room to grow as a pastry chef. Dessert is served on low coffee tables in a loungey space called the Living Room, which by day doubles as a cafe selling pastries and sandwiches on housemade bread. Rousting diners from their tables in the dining room (called, aptly enough, the Dining Room), probably seemed like a good idea on paper, but in reality it's a bit silly. It's one of several hiccups that keep a meal at Gem from gliding smoothly along. Servers may shoot their cuffs before fiddling with some small detail of the table setting, a fussiness that is not in keeping with the graceful, relaxed tone of the cooking. Wine glasses could sit empty for long stretches and the wines themselves, both whites and reds, were almost always too warm. That Mr. Flynn is more polished as a chef than a restaurateur is understandable. He may need a more experienced partner to straighten out the dining room, and to help him edit the menus, too. With each meal, I had the sense there were at least two superfluous courses, and occasionally Mr. McGarry seems to be straining as he reaches for the sort of razzle-dazzle you'd get at Alinea or Eleven Madison Park. An elaborate lobster course one night looked amazing, but wasn't. An attempt at eggplant carnitas, with an underseasoned salsa of green strawberries and a charred, papery tortilla, was enough to make you wish Mr. McGarry had eaten more tacos before he left California. At times Mr. McGarry seems like a creative-writing student who fills his pages with footnotes because David Foster Wallace did it. It's too bad that he came of age in an era when many people believe that tasting menus are the highest form of kitchen artistry. Like the style of \"Infinite Jest,\" those menus have to be the result of ideas that can't be contained any other way; they're not a blank space to be filled in. Mr. McGarry obviously learned a lot from his mentors, but he can cook in his own voice now, and it may be time to leave his idols behind.

Then he rewrote it. French chefs who covet Michelin stars study the restaurants that get them, and the ones that don't, before deciding where to devote their money and attention. If there is a formula behind the rating system, which for many chefs is an article of faith, almost no one figured it out the first time. Jo\u00ebl Robucho n, who died on Monday at 73 , came closer than anyone . Mr. Robuchon's first restaurant, Jamin, was given one Michelin star in its first year. It got another in its second, and the next year it climbed to the top step, a three-star ranking. Mr. Robuchon was still in his late 30s. What could he do for his next trick? There were new dishes to invent, new honors to win, new employees to terrify. The chef Eric Ripert, who was one of them , has said that he still has nightmares about covering plates with the precisely sized and spaced dots of sauce that were a Jamin signature. Playing the kitchen tyrant, regularly berating young cooks for mistakes nobody else would notice, Mr. Robuchon embodied the old order. At the time, this boot-camp style of running a kitchen was state of the art. But it had already come to seem counterproductive, disrespectful and unprofessional long before his death. In retrospect, the internal forces that he gave vent to when he screamed at his cooks must have also tormented Mr. Robuchon. For most of his career he was restless, unsatisfied. At 51, he tried to retire; of course, it didn't last. In 2003 he returned, and this time he seemed determined not to give the Michelin inspectors what they wanted. L'Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon , his comeback, was staged in a former sushi bar in Paris. He retained the basic setup. Diners sat at a counter, and rather than nigiri and maki, they ate his spoonable pommes pur\u00e9es and langoustines fried inside a single leaf of paper-thin pastry. There were no tablecloths, no chandeliers, no elaborately carved and upholstered chairs that might have come from a garage sale at Versailles. Food was cooked behind the counter by chefs dressed in the same black tunics the servers wore. Sometimes the chefs even placed the dish in front of the diner. The French daily Le Figaro summed up the general reaction when it proclaimed, \"C'est une revolution!\" If you think the Figaro was overreacting, it's because the revolution succeeded. Today, expensive dining is more likely to mean stools and a counter than dining tables on a sea of carpeting. The trappings that Mr. Robuchon stripped away -- the linens, the large dining rooms, the kitchens kept out of sight -- were not just costly to maintain but, by that point, increasingly off-putting, especially to younger diners. Today we don't expect -- or even want -- carpeted, hushed spaces when we go out for meticulously prepared food. Mr. Robuchon was not the only chef of that era hoping to add to the restaurant experience by means of subtraction. In the same year, Paul Kahan and Donnie Madia opened Avec in Chicago, a long skinny restaurant dominated by its counter. Sitting on a bar stool was synonymous with eating at the chef David Chang's Momofuku restaurants in the first few years of his career, from Noodle Bar in 2004, to Ssam bar in 2006, to Ko in 2008. The project of burying the old-fashioned signifiers of luxury and replacing them with new ones has been, in fact, one of the major themes pursued by chefs over the past 15 years. But nobody made a splash doing it like Mr. Robuchon. And in the second stage of his career, he planted Ateliers around Asia, Europe and North America, accumulating 31 Michelin stars . No other chef has as many. This time, he had set the formula. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram , Facebook and Pinterest .

Those of you who did not eat out in Manhattan in the 1990s have no idea what I'm talking about. Those who did may now be having flashbacks to a rustic-chic Tuscan-esque restaurant, Coco Pazzo, which got a three-star Times review from Marian Burros in 1991 , and to its three New York siblings, all long gone. A restaurateur's name may be emerging from the mists of time -- the name is Pino Luongo -- and linked to it, the names of other vanished restaurants, Le Madri , Mad. 61 , Amarcord and Tuscan Square. For readers of tabloid gossip columns, images of pasta-twirling models and executives in Armani suits may be coming into focus, along with bold-face-laden squibs about the social scenes at Mr. Luongo's establishments in Wainscott, N.Y., and on St. Barts. If you have trouble believing that spaghetti and fettuccine once attracted what The Times critic Bryan Miller, reviewing Le Madri in 1989 , called \"the hugs-and-kisses-I-love-your-hat-Ciao-baby crowd,\" it may be useful to remember that this was an era when pasta was commonly thought to be a health food. Nobody has seen the Ciao-baby crowd in a while. (We'll have to send out a search party if it's not back in 10 more years.) So far that is not who goes to Coco Pazzo Trattoria , which is shaping up to be a reliable and fairly priced neighborhood canteen on the SoHo corner that used to house a deliberately unstylish bar called Milady's . On balance, Mr. Luongo's version of Tuscan food retrofitted for American appetites may be easier to see for what it is now that it has lost its fashionable gloss. (He is the executive chef; Pedro Cruz is his chef de cuisine.) When you order pappa al pomodoro and taste the juicy olive oil that slicks the warm, basil-flecked, bread-thickened tomato pulp, you're not earning bragging rights. You're eating soup, and a very good one. Nobody will think you're a culinary trailblazer if you get the cacciucco, either, but you can console yourself with the tender shrimp, scallops, cod and clams in the faintly spicy and fennel-scented broth. There are two ways to approach dinner at Coco Pazzo Trattoria. (By day the place is a casual outfit called Coco Pazzo Kitchen.) One is to order what Mr. Luongo calls a piatto unico, a helping of pasta next to a related something-extra on one rectangular plate. Baked littlenecks wobble next to a twirl of linguine and, nice surprise here, ribbons of zucchini soaking in a fine white clam sauce that is made with just the firm, sweet bits. Soft chicken-and-ricotta polpettine sit next to rigatoni in sugo, not on top, so you can have pasta first and meatballs second and tell yourself you're eating like a real Italian. Alternatively, you might go with the main courses marked \"Per La Tavola.\" For once these plates really are meant for sharing: a substantial stack of spiced and roasted baby-back ribs under a warm slaw of cucumbers and tomatoes, or a spread of grilled rib-eye slices served with a separate plate of \"Tuscan fries,\" distinguishable from the regular kind by their fried rosemary needles. Those fries may be awesomely browned one week but ghostly and uncrisp the next. The tagliolini cooked in the cacciucco broth as a second course after all the seafood has been eaten might be 60 seconds away from being al dente. I am not enthusiastic about the slightly tough squid in moist bread crumbs, baked rather than fried, although the dish has a following at Mr. Luongo's other restaurant, Morso, next to the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge. The souffl\u00e9s that the servers try to sell halfway through the meal can be a little soupy. But the blueberry crostata is a genuine pleasure, its crust likably sweet and tender. And you'll appreciate the clean, bright flavors of a shot of Aperol dumped over grapefruit granita if, like me, you veer off-script and follow your piatto unico with a couple of main courses. SPEAKING OF laid-back restaurants where you can enjoy a pleasant and unpretentious summer meal, have you been to Yves? It opened without much of a splash about two years ago, despite occupying a handsome, spare dining room whose white interior makes the most of the afternoon sunlight that hits its TriBeCa corner, opposite the restaurant Locanda Verde. I missed the original chef's tenure, but lately I've been intrigued by the cooking of Alex Baker, who took over in February. She is Paris-trained, having gone to culinary school and worked at Spring and Le Chateaubriand there, before coming to New York to help open Rebelle in 2015. At Yves, she interprets French food with an appealingly relaxed, seasonal attitude. In early June she brought little bright-green favas and sticks of asparagus together with fresh-herb pappardelle, and if you're wondering what makes that French, the answer is a pistou loaded with tarragon and chervil. There was also a reassuringly gentle navarin of lamb, with a small spring garden in addition to the customary carrots and potatoes: grilled baby leeks and asparagus stalks, and tender chard stems. Pan-fried steelhead trout is on the menu now, with a smooth, pale-green sauce of cucumbers, melons and avocados pooling beneath a jumble of warm young cucumbers. So is a side dish of recently picked pole beans and string beans charred on the grill and dressed with toasted-almond vinaigrette. As interpreted by Ms. Baker, mussels Proven\u00e7al are not the usual mound of black shells in thin pink liquid with a few slices of baguette; the shells are gone, the mussels are good fat ones and their sauce is more concentrated, augmented with tomato paste and roasted cherry tomatoes and garnished with thick-crusted cubes of toasted bread. The snails are more traditional, parsley-garlic butter sloshing around in their shells. If these land snails wondered what they were doing on a bed of seaweed, they didn't show it. There is some unevenness in the kitchen to be worked out. The fluke meuni\u00e8re may be saut\u00e9ed to a textbook golden crackle, or it could arrive looking as pale as a fish belly. The country ham sandwich could use bread that's easier to chew than the crust-armored baguettes from Bien Cuit. The restaurant is large, and service tends to arrive in rapid bursts separated by long pauses. The wine list is very lopsided in favor of three-figure bottles, an irritating move for a fairly casual spot. But Ms. Baker seems to be making the best of it. It's hard to be cross with a restaurant that makes its own boursin and brings it out in a dish so big I could never manage to finish it, even with a stack of toasted baguette to smear it on.

One thing that sets it apart is that it doesn't have a name. Credit-card receipts call it \"Momofuku Ko,\" even though it operates in its own little room with its own entrance. The door, a few steps past Ko's along the East Village alley known as Extra Place, is marked \"Ko.\" The menus don't give a name at all. They don't look much like menus, either. They're notebooks in which the items available, presented in a short \u00e0 la carte list (in contrast to the hourslong tastings offered for $255 at Ko), are handwritten on a fresh page each day, by different employees using different pens. The date is at the top over a list of dishes that you will not find together anywhere else. Lately there has been a lucid, refreshing plate of raw sea scallops, sliced cold and mixed with fresh green shiso and folds of pineapple, red with ground chiles. Lightly cured fillets of sardine made a thrilling appearance last month in a brick-red oil flavored with paprika, cayenne, and other components of tandoori paste. Both were solidly in the tradition of Momofuku small plates that the world has known since Mr. Chang's Ssam Bar began remixing various Asian ideas after-hours. Both were wonderful. The savory pie stuffed with fresh-made pork sausage patties comes from another place entirely. You could tour the city's proudest French restaurants without coming across a more skillfully done puff pastry crust, notched like a pinwheel and baked to a deep mahogany. The pie costs $45 and typically serves two, sliced into half-moons. It is plated with a reduction sauce, as classical and French as it gets but with an insistent vein of acidity that somehow makes it modern. Even if you're used to the signature Momofuku move of white-knuckle bungee jumping from the high end to the low, certain juxtapositions may call for Dramamine. Alongside the masterly pork pie, you can find a $5 sandwich of pickled daikon and cucumber sticks inside a grilled and buttered Martin's hot dog roll. The pickle sandwich is just the thing to eat with the cold fried chicken that is battered three times, fried four times, brushed with a spicy mirin-yuzu glaze and served nearly at refrigerator temperature. I don't believe I've used that phrase approvingly in a review before, but then I don't think a restaurant has served me cold fried chicken as good as this before. By flipping through the menu pages you can pinpoint the dates when dishes were first served, and see others that came and went. The idea is for Ko's executive chef, Sean Gray, to use the bar as a \"field for research and development for our culinary team,\" according to the website. Ideas are auditioned or refined before they graduate to Ko, which I gave three stars in a 2015 review . Most menus, at least the ones that change over time, are works in progress, but few make that explicit the way the one at Ko's bar does. The cynical way to look at this is that bar customers are paying to serve as lab rats. This will not be everyone's idea of a fun night out. One recent evening, the menu was as meat-heavy as at Ssam Bar in the era when its menus still proclaimed, \"We do not serve vegetarian-friendly items.\" Among the more substantial dishes that night was a mixed-meat sausage stuffed into a chicken neck and grilled. One end of the neck was open. The other was still attached to the chicken's head. It was a sensational sausage, but it did nothing to make Ko's bar the kind of place that you'd take your new pescatarian friend. The bar, run collaboratively by Mr. Gray and Su Wong Ruiz, the general manager, works best for diners who don't need a multitude of choices to be happy. To the extent that it resembles other places, it's probably most similar to a wine bar, with its tight menu, its casual drop-in-and-stay-awhile air and its carefully considered list of wines by the glass, which it shares with Ko. Anyone who wants a whole bottle can order one from the full Ko list, a virtual who's who of cult winemakers in certain specialties such as grower Champagne, chenin blanc from the Loire Valley and Burgundy of all stripes. On the notebook page facing the handwritten menu are two more wines that Ambrose Chiang, the beverage director, is pouring by the glass for one day only. Recently I've lucked into a precisely shaped C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie from Domaine Jasmin and a Saumur from Romain Guiberteau whose self-assurance I envied. These specials can cost twice as much as the regular by-the-glass pours, which tend to fall between $15 and $25. I can't figure out why the wine-geek crowd doesn't bring tents and sleeping bags to camp out at Ko's bar. And I don't understand why the place is almost never crowded, despite getting a fair amount of press after it opened. The experimental nature of the menu can't be keeping people away; people expect that from Momofuku restaurants . The only dish that I thought wasn't totally successful was the fried zucchini made in the style of the fried chicken, and I was still glad I tried it. The prices are all over the place, but a meal here doesn't need to be expensive. While you are welcome to spend $100 on a sourdough crepe with 50 grams of white-sturgeon caviar, you can just get the crepe alone for $8. It is excellent: shiny with tangy cave-age butter, speckled with oregano cinders and crunchy from a pass over hot Japanese charcoal. The chicken, meanwhile, is $7 a piece. The only reason I can think of for the empty seats is that the place is so hard to sum up.

(Want to get California Today by email? Here's the sign-up .) The police briefing on a hostage-taking at a Trader Joe's in Silver Lake that gripped Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon had just ended. But as Mayor Eric M. Garcetti started walking away, reporters stopped him for one more question. What did Mr. Garcetti have to say about the death of Jonathan Gold? Mr. Gold, 57, was the restaurant critic for The Los Angeles Times. For anyone outside of Los Angeles, it is difficult to appreciate what kind of an outsized figure Mr. Gold was in the fabric of the city he called home: much more than just another restaurant reviewer or hometown institution. It was not at all surprising that Mr. Gold's death merited a question to the mayor, followed by an official tribute from City Hall. Or that it inspired a day of tributes from shocked admirers. (He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in early July.) \"We are all so heartbroken,\" Roy Choi, the chef behind Kogi, a Korean taco food truck, said on Instagram . For many people, the joy of Saturday mornings was turning -- even before coffee -- to Mr. Gold's latest inside the Saturday section. The more devout of his fans plucked the reviews off the internet the night before. His reviews sent people scurrying to all corners, and produced lines-out-the-door waits at what otherwise might be unknown restaurants, like Jitlada or Chengdu Taste. You could tell they were Jonathan Gold patrons by the way they peered at their phones, consulting his review before ordering. His annual list of the best 101 restaurants was a road map: Working through it (or claiming you did) was a competitive rite of passage. (And so was arguing over some of his rulings: Was Vespertine in Culver City the best restaurant of the year?) In a world of anonymity, Mr. Gold was unmissable: A friend described him as \"a combo of Falstaff and Custer.\" He was a celebrity, but he was warm, engaging and lacking pretension.

In name at least, this is the fourth incarnation of the pizzeria that Anthony Mangieri founded in 1996 in Point Pleasant Beach, N.J. He has never run more than one Una Pizza Napoletana at a time; each time he moves to a new location, he closes the old one. In the East Village ( 2004 - 9 ) and San Francisco ( 2010 - 17 ), he essentially stuck to the routine he had established in New Jersey. At the two-month-old location on the Lower East Side, though, he is in business with two chefs, Jeremiah Stone and Fabi\u00e1n von Hauske Valtierra, whose sensibilities are wildly different from his own. Their two other restaurants, Wildair and Contra , are very contemporary and European in outlook. A meal at either one makes it obvious that Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have carefully studied Copenhagen's foremost exponents of fermentation and foraging. Nothing about Mr. Mangieri's rigorously traditional pizza indicates that he could find Copenhagen on a map. The three of them do have common traits. They take their cooking extremely seriously, favor simplicity and aren't interested in easy ways out. So their collaboration -- Mr. Mangieri is the pizza guy, of course, while his new partners handle appetizers, desserts and drinks -- might not be doomed, but it isn't exactly off to a promising start. The problem isn't the common one of strengths in one area undermined by bad performance in others. Una Pizza Napoletana is almost all strengths, but they're at war with one another. Mr. Mangieri is a purist's purist. His dough runs on wild yeast. For each batch, he mixes a lump of starter into Sicilian sea salt, finely ground Italian flour and water. With this he makes a crust that is delicious on its own, a minimum requirement for great pizza. He makes pies in only one size, a wheel about 12 inches across. There are five on the menu most nights. None are topped with more than four ingredients, or six if you count oil and salt. On Friday and Saturday nights a sixth, more complicated pizza is offered. Requests for substitutions or added toppings are not entertained on any night. There is no point asking Mr. Mangieri to put pepperoni on a margherita or Buffalo chicken and blue cheese on a marinara. You would have better luck persuading the driver of the M5 bus to pop a wheelie on Fifth Avenue. The pies are at least as extraordinary as the ones he used to make in the East Village. They may be better. I don't remember the imported buffalo mozzarella's giving the pies the flavor of melted cultured butter back then, the way it does now. And did the tomato sauce -- pulp, really -- always have the same natural, sun-ripened sweetness? Especially on the marinara, unobscured by cheese and seasoned only with dried oregano, fresh basil and raw garlic, it's almost hypnotic. The Concetta pie, which has four varieties of tomato treated four separate ways, probably would have been beyond his abilities as a chef in the Jersey Shore days. He makes it only on Fridays, which is too bad, because it's great. The everyday pie called the Filetti, made with buffalo mozzarella and ripe red cherry tomatoes, manages to be surprising while sticking to Mr. Mangieri's strict principles. It's a personal creed that achieves transcendence -- his \"My Way,\" to put it in New Jersey terms. I ate one non-transcendent pie at the new Una Pizza Napoletana, a Bianco, which is topped with buffalo mozzarella, raw garlic and basil. It was excellent the next time I had it, and I immediately knew what had been missing: salt. All the pies are $25. That is a lot for pizza. On the other hand, it is only about $2.50 more than what Mr. Mangieri charged when he first came to Manhattan in 2004, once you adjust for inflation. Then again, people said he charged a lot for pizza in 2004 . Mr. Mangieri and his wood-fueled oven are located at the back of the dining room, enclosed by glass on three sides. No doubt this helps keep the wood fire from wilting the customers like basil leaves, but it's hard not to see it as a metaphor for the restaurant. Mr. Mangieri's pizzas leave the glass box, but his sensibility doesn't. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have put their own point of view on everything else, and it's not the point of view of a pizzeria. Everybody knows how to eat in a pizzeria; most of us have been doing it since we were kids. The choices are few and relatively predictable. Even when the pizzas are topped with weird stuff, you basically know what you're getting. At the new Una Pizza Napoletana, only the pizzas are predictable. What are bland chunks of white asparagus under a yellow powder of cured egg yolk and bottarga doing here? Not making new friends, I promise you. There's a fine, tender panna cotta with fresh fruit for dessert. One night the strawberry syrup spooned over it was essentially strawberry vinegar; on another night, its sweet-sour ratio was back in alignment. The other desserts I tried -- a bittersweet tiramis\u00f9 with a welcome crackle of caramel hidden in its layers, and some pure-tasting, impossibly smooth, eggless ice creams, including a pistachio flavor that has to be tasted to be believed -- won me over from the beginning. None of the other appetizers were as charmless as the white asparagus. A freshly shucked sea scallop seasoned with translucent strips of lemon peel and individual dots of couscous was exceptional. And raw lobster surrounded by chickpeas was wonderfully jittery with an Italian citrus-chile paste. But the chefs serve it in a form -- a chopped mass of unidentifiable goo -- that can't help but look off-putting. That dish would fit right in at Wildair; here, among the tomatoes and mozzarella, it seems to be trying too hard. The same goes for the wine list. As they have done in their other places, Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske focus on natural wines. These wines can be mercurial, and the way the list is written only adds to the confusion. Almost no varietals are named, and you can't tell much from the Italian regions, which include such major hubs as Irpinia and Solicchiata. When, helplessly, you accept a server's offer of assistance, you'll be asked what you intend to eat with your wine. Are there any people other than sommeliers who want to talk at length about pairing particular wines with particular pizzas? I've never met them and if I do, I'm sending them off to be deprogrammed. Discussing the list, tasting a few samples, trying to find something that fits your idea of a good pizza wine (yes, for some reason there are wines on the brief list that don't taste especially good with any pizza) -- all this slows down the pace, which isn't especially brisk to begin with. By the end of the night, your meal can last twice as long and cost twice as much as it would at almost any other pizzeria in town. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske aren't doing bad stuff at Una Pizza Napoletana, but often they're doing the wrong stuff. They and Mr. Mangieri have taken one of the most accessible styles of restaurant dining and made it complicated and a little intimidating. Una Pizza Napoletana doesn't need to be predictable. But it could be more intuitive.

The song is about what you do once you figure out that you're not going to get the real thing, and Mr. Johansen's answer is simple enough. \"Let's just dance,\" he sings. Never mind love. Frenchette , which opened in TriBeCa in April, isn't fake French, but it isn't the real thing, either. Since 1997, when Keith McNally hired them as the opening chefs at Balthazar , Mr. Nasr and Mr. Hanson have cooked side by side, building a kind of brasserie-steakhouse hybrid out of standards from both genres. Mr. McNally kept loading them up with new restaurants, giving them joint command of Pastis, Schiller's Liquor Bar and Minetta Tavern , none of which could really be called chef-driven. Frenchette, their own place and their first without Mr. McNally, takes some liberties with the formula, but not enough to get them recognized as visionaries on the level of Pierre Gagnaire . Frenchette says: Never mind art, let's just cook. The restaurant is divided into two chambers. In front and on display to the street is a lounge with Art Deco curves, where bartenders percussively clack shakers behind a long river of zinc. If you have a seat, this room is the height of metropolitan civility. If you are waiting for one, as many people are on any given night, it's purgatorial. The dining room is in back, behind a pair of arches and up a step so slight that its only conceivable purpose is to raise the insurance premiums; every time I approached it a worried server materialized to tell me to look out. The small tables are too small and the big ones, encircled by red-leather banquettes the size of living-room sofas, give you enough space to spread out a map while you eat. The room is grandly scaled and conspicuously underdesigned, a simplification of the brasserie archetype that doesn't try to reproduce every chipped tile and nicotine stain. It's a room for people who have outgrown illusions. That must describe half the people in New York, judging by the number of times I've been asked how to get a reservation at Frenchette at an hour when an adult might reasonably be in the mood for dinner. Even well-placed magazine editors with highly resourceful assistants can end up eating at 6 or 10 p.m., as I did. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] In the brasserie mode, the menu rambles. It goes on too long; not everything on it is worth rambling about. But once you sort it out, it's full of dishes worth planning a night around. Some of them don't look wildly impressive unless you know how they're made. For each order of brouillade, a pan of eggs has to be stirred constantly over a small flame for a long time, until they look like grits. (There's a reason you don't see brouillade on many menus.) Dropped on top are a few excellent snails in parsley and garlic, a buttery garnish for very buttery scrambled eggs. Calf's liver was sweet and custardy, the goal in cooking it, and one that's not often reached. Sweetbreads with creamy white insides were fried to a pale, crinkled gold, then served with a brown, French, lovely and anachronistic sauce made from veal jus and crayfish. Lobster was roasted on a rotisserie, sending some of the shell's flavor into the meat, which was then given a very luxurious bath in curry butter. The entire roast chicken is juicy without tasting of brine, a rare thing these days. Hidden under the drumsticks and thighs are rafts of baguette that sat under the rotisserie, imbibing every drop that fell from the bird. Some diners might say bread wet with drippings is too homespun for a dish that costs $68. They don't know what they're talking about. The menu is full of things that take years of practice to get right. Duck breast with a side of fries sounds ridiculously simple, but look at the crackle on that duck skin, and listen to that echoing crunch on the fries. If these chefs learned anything from Mr. McNally, it's that people will overlook many lapses if you feed them great French fries. At Frenchette, they overlook the peculiar steak knife brought out with the duck; its sharp side is straight and its dull side is curved, and everybody who picks one up makes a joke about slicing open a finger. That would be one way to turn tables faster, but I never saw any casualties. The kitchen is at its most sure-footed with big pieces of animals, whether they're classed as appetizers or main courses. (The guinea hen terrine appetizer is a chunky pink brick that could serve as dinner.) All those meats, combined with the chefs' fondness for fat-enhanced sauces that cling to your lips, give the menu a wintry feel, something that the recent proliferation of peas and artichokes on the plates here doesn't quite hide. So far, Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr have responded to the hot weather by changing ingredients but not the menu's spirit. Green celtuce stems can be a nice crisp side dish for summer, but Frenchette serves them in a steaming-hot gratin, slick with bone marrow; it's perfect for January. The blood sausage slab on top of a buckwheat galette that surfaced at the end of June was as seasonal as earmuffs. Reversing the natural order of the universe, the appetizers and the smaller \"amuses\" often seem more tentative than the main courses. Blowfish tails brushed with mustard and spice-bearing bread crumbs are terrific when they're available, and the chefs should get some kind of award from the French government for serving iced oysters Burgundy-style, with peppery finger-length chipolata sausages. But gumball-size smoked eel beignets with a cr\u00e8me-fra\u00eeche ranch dressing called \"Franchette\" didn't taste much like eel; pig-foot croquettes were a washout; and a bowl of oily whole-wheat spaghetti with bottarga needed to be slapped with more lemon and salt. With desserts, Frenchette tries the blunt approach that works so well for its main courses, and comes up short. Not very short, but enough to make you wish more attention were being paid. The mille-feuille doesn't shatter on impact like the ones at Le Coq Rico or Benoit , and the pastry crust under the long band of cooked fruit in the apple tart needs to be crisper or more buttery. One of the more clever moves Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr made is hiring Jorge Riera to shepherd a list of natural, biodynamic and organic wines. Not every sommelier who has become infatuated with these labels knows where to find the good stuff, but he does. This means, though, that you will probably not end up drinking what you thought you wanted to drink. There are few safe harbors of familiarity; even if you just want sparkling water, you have a choice of Vichy Catalan or Mondariz. You'd have to be delusional to wager money on the longevity of a restaurant in New York, but Frenchette is the closest thing to a safe bet that I've seen in years. Mr. Nasr and Mr. Hanson seem to be in it for the long haul; if one of them hasn't held the other's head down in a pot of French onion soup by now, it's probably never going to happen. More than that, they know how to flatter New Yorkers with food that doesn't scream for attention but that smiles back when you notice it.

The details were hazy in my mind until a few weeks ago, when a woman sheathed in a kimono carried a pot of it to my table at Restaurant Nippon on East 52nd Street. There it was: the onions, shiitake caps, bok choi stems, tofu blocks and the frizzy mop of noodles under a cloud of steam. The thin slices of beef going from red to pale pink. The hot broth that is based on soy and mirin but that strangely, magically tastes like French onion soup. The raw egg that, thanks to some long-forgotten cook's flash of greatness, serves as a dipping sauce. This refresher course would have been unnecessary if I'd made myself a regular at Nippon years ago. The restaurant opened in August 1963, a few doors west of its current address, and has offered sukiyaki since the beginning. That summer radios across the country were playing \"Sukiyaki,\" Kyu Sakamoto's oblique protest song that sounded like a love song but was, in the United States, renamed after beef stew for the simple reason that it was one of the few Japanese words almost all Americans knew. The dish was that popular. For modern New Yorkers who chase Japanese thrills at Shuko , Uchu , Tetsu and other restaurants that look and act like cocktail bars, Restaurant Nippon might seem anachronistic -- Kyu Sakamoto in a Cardi B world. Over the years, though, it has served as an unofficial cultural ambassador, using its dining room and its menu to make a case for the Japanese way. The restaurant is designed in the shoin style of a traditional Japanese house. Surrounding a main dining room with Western tables and chairs are the private zashiki rooms where shoes are left outside, floors are hidden under tatami mats and servers materialize at the sliding doors with the push of a button. Many details, like the wallpaper that evokes the opulently stylized folding screens painted by Ogata Korin , are lovely. A few, like the drop ceilings, could use attention. Nippon introduced or championed so many dishes that today the menu preserves the recent history of Japanese food in the United States, the way the rocks of certain canyons in the West record the history of the prehistoric world. Tora fugu, the potentially toxic tiger puffer fish, made its first regular appearance outside Japan at Nippon in 1989 , when the owner, Noboyushi Kuraoka , finally prevailed in his yearslong campaign lobbying the Japanese and American governments to allow importation of the fish. Mr. Kuraoka died in January; now the restaurant is in the hands of Yasuhiro Makoshi, the manager for more than 40 years, and Akira Azuma, who has been the chef for almost that long, and it probably remains the best place in town to try fugu. As sashimi, fanned out in transparently thin slices, it is lean and very firm, like fluke but slightly richer. Nippon sends it out with chives and a spicy daikon mash, which complement its quiet flavor, and cooked fragments of fugu, which don't. The least expensive serving, what is called a \"half portion\" for $70, is just big enough to give four people a couple of bites each. If I were going to spend money on fugu again, though, I would make a beeline for the sperm sacs, or shirako. Barely broiled, either plain with salt crystals or brushed with a miso glaze, Nippon's shirako is as smooth and thick as fudge, with a flavor that recalls buttered crab meat, among other things. Many firsts have been claimed by or on behalf of Nippon. Some of them may be true. Did it have the first sushi counter in New York? I am not convinced. In a 1963 Times review , Craig Claiborne wrote that Nippon had a tempura counter where sushi, \"the traditional service of raw fish,\" was also available. Today the sushi is respectable, if not on its own a reason to visit. Is it a fact that no other New York restaurant was making soba noodles in 1988, when Nippon began to do so? Certainly few places have gone to the same lengths in pursuit of soba as Nippon, which imported not just buckwheat seeds but also a buckwheat farmer from Japan , and planted both in a field outside Montreal. (For years the farm also supplied a sister restaurant, Soba Nippon , now closed.) Restaurant Nippon's soba noodles are nutty, bouncy, springy, slightly rough and very good. I like them chilled, dunked in ponzu. Against my better judgment I even like the odd, Americanized soba salads, with a pile of noodles and meat or tofu on a platter with a fistful of lettuce. The custom-farmed buckwheat also goes into an astoundingly good thing called soba miso that comes smeared on a small wooden paddle. A black sludge of fermented buckwheat studded with buckwheat kernels, it looks like brownie batter and tastes a little like chocolate, too, as well as roasted nuts and espresso and cooked mushrooms. Whether negimaki was invented at Nippon or simply made its first United States appearance there, it's hard to see why tough beef wrapped around undercooked scallions captured America's imagination. More intriguing is another original, beef oroshi, essentially shabu shabu except that it is cooked offstage and you get nothing but meat and broth with some spicy grated daikon. This is also the birthplace of agedashi mozzarella. If you have ever wondered what fried cheese in dashi would taste like, you will find the answer here. The backbone of the menu, though, is traditional Japanese food, nearly all of it good and some of it better than that. There is fluke for those who won't pay up for fugu, and it is just what you'd want it to be. Broiled eel over rice makes a wonderfully soothing meal. The kamonabe is a duck hot pot cooked over a burner set on the table. The duck may not be entirely tender, but it is flavorful. The broth is a symphony. For scale, theatricality and deeply reassuring flavor, its only rival is the sukiyaki, but the kamonabe comes with a dividend: a bowl of rice cooked in the leftover broth as a second course.

Upstairs was a cramped, angular, shadowy dining room with a few tables under a ceiling so low it made tall people stoop. Downstairs was a cramped, angular, shadowy kitchen where oxtails, goat curry and other Jamaican dishes were cooked and sold. To the right of the door, behind a counter, was the restaurant's single stove. It had three burners that were almost always going. No matter when I went there it seemed that about a quarter of the things on the menu had not finished cooking, but complaining would have been cloddish, both because the limitations on capacity were obvious and because whatever was finished was bound to be both nuanced and powerful. The whole operation was one of those precarious marvels of adaptive survival, like a pine growing from a crack in the side of a cliff. So the outlook was grim when news came two summers ago that the structures housing the Islands and another business were being torn down so a new apartment building could be constructed. This neighborhood and the ones to the south between Flatbush and Ralph Avenues owe much of their character to black- and immigrant-owned businesses, including a large swath of Caribbean restaurants such as the Islands. With developers sniffing at this part of Brooklyn, many of them are at risk. Marilyn Reid, who owns the Islands with Shuon Letchford, had other ideas. She had had other ideas since 2001, when she opened the restaurant. \"We were always looking because we had outgrown it by the second day,\" she said in a phone interview. \"We knew.\" Before closing the original space in March 2017, she and Ms. Letchford had found a much bigger one downhill on Washington Avenue. Preparing it took a few months more than she had hoped, but the second incarnation of the Islands has been up and running since January. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] The new kitchen has two stoves and 10 burners. Nevertheless, what's available when I've gone has always been several dishes shy of the complete menu. The stewed okra with cod is especially hard to pin down. At the same time, the comfort of the bigger dining room and the table service, an impossibility in the first space, have encouraged me to branch out beyond my usual favorites. The Islands is best known for long-simmered stews but the kitchen also knows a thing or two about frying. The flattened fritters of salt cod seasoned with fresh hot chiles, known as stamp and go, were crunchy and golden. Some Caribbean cooks deep-fry fish escovitch to oblivion, on the theory that spicy vinegar heals all wounds. The escovitch I had at the Islands was a whole red snapper, obviously fresh and fried just until firm. The vinegar dressing, meanwhile, was seasoned with not just hot chiles but pickled bell peppers, carrots and cucumbers, making this escovitch more interesting than usual. From the old days, I knew the curried goat would be very tender and richly seasoned, although like most of the cooking at the Islands, it was never scalp-piercingly spicy. Now I've found a new standby in the curried vegetables -- a very different thing, of course, but the golden raisins, turmeric and allspice may do even more for cabbage and carrots than they do for goat meat. Barbecue chicken was ordered in a rush verging on panic because whatever I'd first wanted wasn't ready yet. The sauce is nothing like the ketchup-based sludge I'd imagined. Made with raisins and allspice, it tastes more like a glaze for a holiday ham, and it's lovely. I prefer it to the jerk chicken, which will sound like heresy to some customers. Like barbecue, jerk can describe either a sauce or a process, and the process needs to involve wood smoke. The Islands bakes its jerk chicken in the oven, and while I like its sauce, when I want jerk chicken I will cross Eastern Parkway and keep the windows down until I smell burning allspice logs. But I have no quarrel with the jerk shrimp or leg of lamb at the Islands -- there's no place to get an allspice-smoked version of either, as far as I know. The lamb is especially alluring, stuffed with jerk spices and slowly roasted until its outer crust falls, upon slicing, into a dark rubble that in New Orleans would be called debris. Rice and peas, fried plantains and stewed cabbage, slippery with coconut oil, are all mandatory in my book. Others insist on baked macaroni and cheese, served in a brick the size of a pound of butter. When I taste the bread crumbs on top, and wonder if they've been seasoned with dried onions, I think those people may have a point. All of this food is brought to the table on oval platters that could hold a small Thanksgiving turkey. Since opening in January, the new dining room has been embellished bit by bit. The walls are painted in watermelon and aquamarine. Small hurricane lamps decorate the tables. A couple of weeks ago, plaid cloth napkins made their debut in the middle of dinner service. Menus, which used to be kept inside a clear plastic sheath, are now presented inside folders made of textured handmade paper, held in place with stickers of bumblebees and butterflies. The bar, across the dining room from the kitchen, is still unoccupied while Ms. Reid waits for a liquor license to come through. A rumored roof deck has not materialized, either. In the meantime there is an excellent limeade sweetened with demerara sugar and a dark purple, fruity sorrel punch, which can give the impression it has been lightly spiked with rum. Credit for the food at the Islands is shared. There are two chefs, Delroy Henry and Ronald Porter. Most of the recipes, though, are Ms. Letchford's, and she does a lot of the cooking. Like Ms. Reid, all of them were raised in Jamaica before moving to New York, but only Ms. Letchford did any professional cooking there. Ms. Reid is often in the kitchen too. \"I do the light stuff,\" she said. \"I tend to stay with salads, seafood.\" Is the food as good as before? I used to be impressed that anything at all could be cooked at the old Islands. That so much of it was actively delicious seemed like a miracle. It's less astonishing now that the kitchen has 10 burners and room to turn around. But I suspect the only thing that's changed is me. And when I'm in the mood for something miraculous, I'll just remind myself that the Islands is still in business.

They don't wait anymore. If there's no Florent or Schiller's Liquor Bar around, they simply have one built, synchronizing the opening with the move-in date of the first new apartments. This is the tactic being used by Hudson Yards , the glass-and-steel mountain range rising above a one-time dining wasteland where soon not just restaurants but an entire \"restaurant collection\" will flourish, including new projects from David Chang, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and others, all \"curated\" by Thomas Keller . And it is the approach taken by Henry Hall, a tower of rental apartments just north of Hudson Yards on West 38th Street. To give the place the atmosphere and the hangout opportunities of a boutique hotel, Henry Hall has turned its first two floors over to a wine shop, a cocktail lounge, a private dining room and a restaurant. I am telling you all this because that restaurant, Legacy Records, is unusually good and very popular and if somebody invites you there, you should know why you are having dinner down the street from the Javits Convention Center and a stable where Central Park carriage horses go to be hosed down at night. And you will also know why Legacy Records seems eager to suggest that it has local roots -- so eager that it has essentially ginned up a history for itself that brings together sloppy research with a superficial tribute to black culture. It's not a combination that will appeal to everybody. Like the bar and the wine store, Legacy Records is run by Delicious Hospitality, the company behind Pasquale Jones and Charlie Bird . The menu, as it is in those two restaurants, is essentially Italian, but less rustic and more expensive. This is the first time the group has routinely charged more than $30, and as much as $46, for main courses. (The prices, like the ones at Pasquale Jones but not Charlie Bird, include service.) I don't know for sure whether Ryan Hardy, the chef and one of the three partners, has upgraded to better purveyors, but I do know I was taken aback, often, by the quality of the raw ingredients at Legacy Records. There was the raw sea scallop, so intensely fresh that its slices clung together stickily; Mr. Hardy had dressed it with dots of yogurt, tiny oval basil leaves, toasted almonds and tart little pink cells of finger lime. There was chilled Dungeness crab, a few pristine white chunks under sea urchin foam, to be spooned from a shot glass. And tiles of yellowfin tuna belly, not as fatty as bluefin but very rich all the same, under bits of salted lemon peel and a splash of colatura, the Italian fish sauce. Again with the main courses, I stopped and wondered: Where did Mr. Hardy find lamb (with snap peas and smoked cream) that tasted as if it had never eaten anything but fresh herbs? How did he find a rib-eye that's so tender and deeply flavorful without being flabby? Mr. Hardy has been quick to make the most of what the market says is the first month of spring and the calendar says is the last. Creamy new-crop potatoes deserve a little appreciation before they're sent off to root cellars, and Mr. Hardy built a fine appetizer around them with leggy broccoli sprouts and melting chunks of fresh mozzarella spiked with anchovy. Charred snap peas made a tangy salad together with ramps in a peppery buttermilk dressing. But sweet English peas were swallowed up by a too-sharp risotto; seasoned with prosciutto, the rice took on more of the ham's saltiness than its sweetness. Legacy Records doesn't say anything particularly original, but it has a finesse that's new for this restaurant group. There's an exceptional plate of grilled pigeon, neatly carved and served with swooshes of nettle pur\u00e9e. It is at least as impressive as the dish that's becoming a breakout star for the restaurant: a duck breast, its skin rubbed with pepper, chiles, honey and fennel and then roasted until it has a deep, crusty bark that a Texas pitmaster would be proud of. Ordering wine is an event in itself. Robert Bohr and Grant Reynolds, who are Mr. Hardy's partners and the resident wine soothsayers, have seen to it that cultists can rub elbows with the Agraparts, Raveneaus and Gajas, while the rest of us will still find a few bottles under $100 from some of the most expensive arable land on earth. Oddly enough, the wine list makes less of an impression than the ones at Charlie Bird and Pasquale Jones, simply because you'd expect an ambitious cellar in a restaurant this expensive. Then again you might also expect a smart, artful dessert menu; if so, you're out of luck. There is ice cream with strawberries, a dark chocolate meringue and a selection of gelati, served in a cone; all perfectly pleasant, but there's more wit and creativity in the excellent cocktail roster administered by Jeff Bell. I'm sure there are people who are reluctant to go to Legacy Records because of how relentlessly noisy this team's downtown restaurants are. But they seem to have sent the acoustics to obedience school, because all the sound waves do what they're told: Conversations stay at their own tables, while the music stays in the background. Ken Fulk, who designed all the public spaces in the building, covered some wall panels with grasscloth, put glove-soft leather on the tabletops, and found other ways to dampen the noise. Legacy Records certainly doesn't look like any other restaurant; Mr. Fulk went to extremes, using some motifs from the 1980s -- emphatic grids, metallic finishes, whites and country-club greens -- that not everybody is ready to see resurrected. Hanging in the bar is a 2006 photograph by the artist Mickalene Thomas of a black woman with an Afro and a giraffe-print shirt posed in front of albums by Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross. It has a counterpart on the second floor, a mural behind the bar based on the Ernie Barnes painting seen on Marvin Gaye's album \"I Want You.\" Along with the constant hip-hop and vintage soul soundtrack and the restaurant's name -- taken, we are told, from a recording studio that once stood on this site -- Legacy Records tries to present itself as a homage to another era in music. If Legacy Recording Studios had been used by Mr. Gaye, Mr. Wonder and Ms. Ross, that homage might make sense. But it didn't. Lasting just from 2001 to 2009, the studio was built for and mostly used by orchestras, Broadway cast recordings and commercials. Legacy Records has taken this shred of history and turned it into a fantasy of black American music. Exhibited in a museum or gallery, Ms. Thomas's photo might be taken as a comment on the different postures and personas available to black women. Hanging it next to the counter where pastries and coffee are sold by day strips out some of its meaning; it looks like an attempt to buy a personality for a restaurant that doesn't have one of its own. If anyone gets to decide who can use black culture for what purposes, it surely isn't me. But Legacy Records uses it in a gratuitous and offhanded way that made me uncomfortable. Stevie Wonder will always be cool, but a restaurant dreamed up by real estate developers doesn't automatically become cool by putting him on the wall.

With no time to make a roast or stew, the legend goes, the Great Khan's chef carved very thin slices of raw mutton and plunged them into hot broth for a few seconds. Besides serving as an inspiration to those of us who believe there is always time to eat, the chef's impromptu recipe is said to have given China its ancient and delicious hot pot tradition. Hot pots did not jump to Japan until shortly after World War II, when kelp joined the broth and the name was changed, onomatopoetically, to shabu shabu. But like hot pots in China, shabu shabu is a do-it-yourself bash where everybody around the table gets to dunk and swish the ingredients they like best. Chefs are not required. Then on Delancey Street last fall, a new shabu shabu restaurant appeared where a chef standing behind a counter does all the cooking for no more than eight people at a time. Her name is Mako Okano. Out of a style of dining that has always been a big, informal free-for-all, she has built a quiet, refined, intimate spot called Shabushabu Macoron . Usually backed up by two other women, but occasionally working solo, Ms. Okano moves deliberately. She will gesture to the place mat, where the night's eight or 10 courses are written out in Japanese, right to left, and then to another slip of paper with the same courses printed in English, again right to left. The price is $128. There are no choices to be made. Ms. Okano has modeled her restaurant on omakase sushi bars, where the chef calls the tune. When I first arrived, I admit that I couldn't see the point of having a chef do the cooking when I was perfectly able to do my own dunking and swishing. Ms. Okano quickly poured two or three mouthfuls of yeasty, warm unfiltered sake into a little saucer. This arrived with a snack -- cured salmon and salmon roe seasoned with fermented rice -- that artfully underscored the sake's flavor. Then she turned and quietly addressed a saut\u00e9 pan over the stove. When she turned around again she had cooked an omelet and flicked it into a roll in the Japanese style. Served in a bowl of hot, clear dashi, the egg was as tender and delicate as its garnish, a tiny piece of mitsuba stem tied into a knot. Next she poached two pieces of abalone for a few seconds each in abalone broth. One she dabbed with a small, intense blip of the Japanese spice paste yuzu kosho. Over the other she spooned a sauce made from the abalone's liver. I ate them both, and was flooded first with pleasure then with embarrassment that I'd thought simmered food wasn't worth a chef's time. By the time I'd eaten a small tongue of sea urchin combined with silky rags of yuba still dripping with soy milk, I was on board for anything Ms. Okano wanted to cook. For some time the bubbles in an iron pot of dashi set over a countertop burner had been getting bigger and faster. Thin strips of Wagyu beef, streaked with so much fat they looked like stained glass, were stretched out on black slate with pinkish bands of pork belly. Raw vegetables -- cabbage, lettuce, enoki and shiitake mushrooms, half a brussels sprout and a cherry tomato on a wooden spear -- waited on a nearby plate. Before I knew it she had cooked the first piece of beef -- was it the A5 from Miyazaki or the A4 from Kagoshima? The flesh had twisted itself around, and now dusk-gray outer curls hid inner curves of faded pink. The flavors moved in rapid waves: first a few clinging, savory drops of dashi, then some already-melted beef fat, followed by the flavor of the lean meat itself, sweet and refined. Finally came a second helping of fat, freshly melted now. When Ms. Okano fished out a piece of beef, she would suggest seasoning it with one or more of an almost comically large assortment of condiments and pur\u00e9es that she makes herself. She seemed to favor her ponzu, and so do I; it's more radiant with yuzu than any I've had before. I also liked the sweet soy once I learned to doctor it with a few drops of what Ms. Okano calls \"gravy sauce,\" a dark liquid that makes meat taste meatier. Many dismal meals would be saved if I carried an eyedropper of gravy sauce around with me. Swabbing the pork belly in the sticky, thick sesame paste with toasted sesame seeds produces an effect similar to, but more subtle than, the combination of peanut butter and bacon. It's even better with a smear of salted plum, or a few drops of the yuzu-olive oil sauce that seems to have jetted in from Italy. The vegetables were spotless and fresh. A meal without them would be off kilter, perhaps to a degree that would cause grumbling from the digestive system, but on their own they are not a reason to go to Shabushabu Macoron. The chicken meatballs are, though. So are the green tea soba noodles that Ms. Okano somehow manages to cook in between everything else without seeming to leave the few square feet behind the counter. Soba is not standard with shabu shabu, but it is something she has experience making from her time in the kitchen at Cocoron , a soba-ya across Delancey Street. When she began talking about her dream of opening what she hoped would be the world's first omakase shabu shabu restaurant, Cocoron's owners listened. When she came back from a dunk-and-swish tour of Japan, they signed on as her partners. At times, it seems as if Ms. Okano can't believe it all worked out. After she'd cooked me three nearly identical meals, I wondered if she'd still be as giddy a year from now. Will she be able to change the menu with the seasons to keep things interesting? Can she stash surprise ingredients below the counter for repeat customers, the way sushi chefs do? None of these questions occurred to me the first two times I ate at her restaurant. I just sat there in something like a state of wonder while she cooked for me. This is, bizarrely, a rare experience at tasting counters, where chefs are often intent on intricacies of plating. The physical setting of Shabushabu Macoron strongly suggests a shoestring budget -- the paper towel roll in the restroom hangs from what may be an actual shoestring -- but sitting there while Ms. Okano stands a few inches away and makes your dinner is one of the most luxurious experiences this city currently offers.

It was the part that everybody remembered from his first published work, a long essay about the unglamorous and sometimes unsavory work of cooks and dishwashers that ran in The New Yorker in 1999 and that made it almost impossible for waiters to sell seafood between Sunday and Tuesday for at least a decade. And the advice gave Mr. Bourdain, a journeyman cook and chef nobody had heard of, a new career. Before he was found dead on Friday , in what the authorities were treating as a suicide, he was the witty, connected guide who, in memoirs, cookbooks and television shows, would tell you things that others wouldn't. In the glossy, cheerful, relentlessly promotional realms of food and travel writing, that left him a fair number of truths he could claim as his own, and he took full advantage of the situation. A close reader of Orwell , he modeled that first essay and the book that grew out of it, \"Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly,\" on Orwell's \"Down and Out in Paris and London.\" While other restaurant writers had helped build the cult of the creative, artistic chef, Mr. Bourdain made folk heroes out of the dishwasher and the line cook -- a job description previously known only to restaurant employees. He described their lives and their day-to-day work in concrete, indelible detail. When kitchens were being wrapped in a shimmering gauze of glamour, Mr. Bourdain got busy unwrapping them, revealing the injuries and addictions, low wages and high tempers that took a toll on workers. Among other things, he was one of the first writers to tell the dining public that many high-profile New York restaurants would cease to function without the work and talents of Mexican employees. It was almost a casual aside, yet it suddenly opened new subjects to the purview of food writing: immigration policy, labor conditions, racism. He identified with the grunts, portraying himself as a slinger of cheap steaks and French fries. The grunts, in turn, identified with him, not because of his contributions as a chef -- who can name an Anthony Bourdain dish? -- but because he told the world what the work was really like. And once he left kitchens behind for a career in travel television, he didn't lead his camera crews on a tour of the world's most luxurious resorts. He went to Detroit and the Bronx, Libya and Beirut. \"Good food, good eating, is all about blood and organs, cruelty and decay,\" he wrote in the opening sentence of that New Yorker piece, and it set the tone for all the work that followed. [Read more of our coverage on Anthony Bourdain's death: Anthony Bourdain, Chef, Travel Host and Author, is Dead at 61 \u2018 Tony Was a Symphony': Fans and Friends Remember Anthony Bourdain ] Mr. Bourdain was a blood-and-organs kind of guy, and he became identified with his unflinching, at times ostentatious, descriptions of life, death, sex and digestion. Footage of fly-speckled goats' heads in open-air markets was to his travel shows what harbor sunsets were for other programs. Although he wasn't immune to hyperbole, he had an old-school chain-smoking newspaper editor's hatred of self-serving hypocrisy, particularly in other television hosts. He delighted in mocking celebrity chefs like Guy Fieri (whose Times Square restaurant he called \"the Terrordome\") and Paula Deen (\"the worst, most dangerous person to America\"). At times Mr. Bourdain's capacity as truth-teller could bleed into other, less salutary roles: the attention-seeking bully, the purveyor of well-polished shtick, the lecture-circuit fixture who, on cue, would curse like a line cook who has just chopped off the tip of his finger. \"I do a lot of speaking engagements and sometimes I feel like I'm being paid to curse in front of people who haven't heard it in a while,\" he said in a 2008 interview . In the past few months, as accusations of sexual harassment and predatory behavior have shaken the restaurant industry , Mr. Bourdain's swaggering accounts of kitchen life have come in for re-evaluation. He certainly took pleasure in telling outsiders what it was like. Was there some pride in there, too, in belonging to a band of misfits and rule-breakers? Had he helped to popularize a workplace culture in which misogyny and abuse were overlooked, tolerated and sometimes even celebrated? \"To the extent which my work in \u2018Kitchen Confidential' celebrated or prolonged a culture that allowed the kind of grotesque behaviors we're hearing about all too frequently is something I think about daily, with real remorse,\" he wrote on Medium in December. Having regularly heaped disgust and outrage on Harvey Weinstein (who was accused of rape by Asia Argento, Mr. Bourdain's partner), he was also confronted with serious and deeply unsettling allegations about Mario Batali , a friend. \"In these current circumstances, one must pick a side,\" Mr. Bourdain wrote. \"I stand unhesitatingly and unwaveringly with the women.\" But if the feminist perspective was relatively new to his repertory, speaking out about sexual abuse was not. Long ago, in \"Kitchen Confidential,\" he had written about a union shop steward who had inserted his fingers into Mr. Bourdain's rectum every day, in front of the other kitchen workers. Experiences like this may be common for male cooks, but they are not commonly discussed in public. Mr. Bourdain was too unsettled, his moral compass too twitchy, to have written an account of kitchen life that was purely celebratory or purely accusatory. \"Life is complicated. It's filled with nuance. It's unsatisfying,\" he once said. \"If I believe in anything, it is doubt.\" ", "rec_dishes": 0}, {"id": 106, "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/dining/don-angie-review.html", "review_text": " Ever since Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone began rehabilitating chicken Parm and Neapolitan cookies around 2010, I've been waiting for other restaurants to carry the torch of Italian-American food boldly into the future. This is a major branch of American cuisine, too important for its fate to be left to the Olive Garden. For the most part, though, the torch has gone uncarried. I have been told that Palizzi Social Club, in Philadelphia, may qualify, but because Palizzi is a veritable club -- members and guests only, no new applications accepted -- I don't expect to eat there before the nation's tricentennial. Then in October, a place opened in the West Village that seemed to hit all the right tropes. It's called Don Angie . Two chefs share the kitchen -- Angela Rito and her husband, Scott Tacinelli -- and they make versions of chicken scarpariello , antipasto salad and braciole. The dining room brings back the high-glitz Italian restaurant d\u00e9cor of the 1970s and '80s, the period when Formica and oil paintings of the Bay of Naples went out and mirrors with gold pinstripes came in. The floor is a black-and-white checkerboard. The bar is made of polished marble the color of beef carpaccio. There is a house Chianti, and it comes in a straw-covered bottle. There is hope for a red-sauce renaissance, after all. Unfortunately, more or less from the day it opened, having dinner at Don Angie has been only marginally less difficult than eating at a private club. That has something to do with Ms. Rito's and Mr. Tacinelli's knack for cooking things that Instagram can't resist. The two spent three years running the kitchen at Quality Italian in Midtown, where they engineered, among other pieces of shutterbait, a chicken Parm that looked like a pizza. There was some wonderful stuff at Quality Italian and some less wonderful stuff, and almost all of it either arrived on trolleys or was prepared at tableside or set on fire while you watched. The restaurant group behind Quality Italian, Quality Branded , is also backing Don Angie. So as I resigned myself to eating at Don Angie close to 5:30 p.m., when I managed to get an unreserved table, I also braced for a dose of abracadabra. It arrived right on schedule with my first drink, which a server strained into a glass through a coffee filter cone lined with espresso ice. It was called Americano, Americano, and combined at least three meanings of the word: a highball, an Italian aperitif wine and a diluted shot of espresso. The Americano highball, so simple that just about any bartender can make it, doesn't need much improvement. But I have to admit that the coffee did give it some ballast. I'm also happy to report that this was one of the last bits of stagecraft I saw at Don Angie. Ms. Rito and Mr. Tacinelli have a few tricks up their sleeves, but they save them for the kitchen. The result is food that is creative in a more interesting and more consistently successful way than it was at Quality Italian. And it arrives at the table without the aid of trolleys. When you get a Caesar salad, the server doesn't whip together the dressing on the spot. It's been done in the kitchen, where the chefs replaced romaine with tender chrysanthemum leaves that taste like some newly discovered herb. (The feathery leaves firmly grip the dressing and the fluffy rasped cheese, too.) I can't remember seeing chrysanthemum in an Italian restaurant before, and it shows the chefs' skill for cross-pollinating with other cuisines, especially Asian ones. While the Torrisi-Carbone axis is generally faithful to Italian-American standards, using more expensive ingredients and more modern techniques but leaving the basic ideas intact, the Rito-Tacinelli approach is more radical. They trample on tradition when they feel like it. Prosciutto and honeydew melon are tossed with candied hazelnuts and mint leaves in a lime, tamarind and fish-sauce dressing. This very good salad, which obviously glances toward Southeast Asia, is a smart way to handle an antipasto standby that is usually pointless except when melons are in season. Their garlic bread turns out to be a very thin disc with garlic chives and melted cheese inside and sesame seeds on top. Lightweight, salty and irresistible, it's modeled on Ligurian focaccia di recco, but it may also bring to mind Turkish gozleme, Azeri kutab or even a Chinese scallion pancake. There's China again, in the pepperoni fried rice served under barbecued squid. Ignore the squid unless you like it leathery, and just focus on the rice, stirring it with labneh when the heat starts to rise. The dish everybody has seen on Instagram is the pasta called caramelle. In Italian it means caramel, as in candy, but the shape will remind most Americans of an elongated Tootsie Roll, with twists at either end of a drum that's filled with buffalo ricotta. Cameras come out because the dough is striped, with black sesame-flour bands alternating with ordinary egg pasta. The sesame barely registers; the fun of the dish is the sauce, a peppered, pickled cantaloupe that tastes like it's still percolating. But the dish that could be Don Angie's lasting contribution to the pasta sciences is the garganelli with meatball rag\u00f9. The central problem of red-sauce restaurants is this: Pasta and meatballs are always served together, but they remain stubbornly separate. Ms. Rito and Mr. Tacinelli have found a way out of this conundrum by crushing meatballs into a tomato-guanciale rag\u00f9. It's not quite as simple as I've made it sound, but you don't know that when you're eating it; you just think you're magically eating meatballs and pasta at the same time. They've also tried to salvage chicken scarpariello, a dish that is almost always overcooked. Their solution is to make a kind of pie with chicken meat pressed down into a kind of crust made of sausage. The flavors are accurate, and for once it's not dry, but it's not as engaging as other main courses, like the veal cutlet with speck and pickled mustard seeds, or the grilled fillet of orata next to herbed fregola, with buttermilk as the sauce. Reworking tiramis\u00f9 almost never improves it, but as a change of pace I did like how the one at Don Angie shifted the emphasis from espresso to bittersweet cocoa. There's a delicious, if more conventional, plate of tender, light zeppole with tangy whipped robiola under an Andy Warhol mop of spun sugar that people go wild for. I was charmed by a smaller, quieter dessert: a mochi cake stuffed with fior di latte ice cream, with sea salt and a fragrant scribble of olive oil. It's like eating a mozzarella ball that wanted to become a dessert when it grew up, and did. Follow NYT Food on Facebook , Instagram , Twitter and Pinterest .

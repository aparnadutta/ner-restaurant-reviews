 Restaurants hide in all kinds of ways. There is the coy, unmarked-door hiding of the neo-speakeasy. There is the romantic hiding of restaurants whose positioning at, say, the end of an alley allows men to seem clever and their dates to seem impressed. There is the snooty hiding of exclusive restaurants that behave like private clubs, an affectation that is going out of style and won't be missed. Then there is Botequim, a fine new Brazilian restaurant that seems to have been hidden away against its will in the basement of a hotel on Fourth Avenue. You descend to Botequim in one of two ways. The first is weird. You walk into the Fourth , the street-level all-day restaurant of the Hyatt Union Square New York, past disoriented travelers at the bar, and take the stairs that unwind beneath a dangling helix of children's beds suspended from the ceiling. The second is weirder. You open a glass door on Fourth Avenue that says Botequim -- so far, so good -- and descend a staircase that deposits you in a backstage area between the kitchen and the dining room. Taking this route one night, I landed in the middle of a hushed, tense conference between two employees, who fell silent when they saw me. I felt like Lord Grantham stumbling upon a downstairs bitchfest. The hotel's efforts to keep Botequim out of sight since its September opening may account for the half-full dining room. Once you make it inside, though, things quickly start to look up. Graffiti-style murals zigzag across the walls, samba rhythms ripple all night long, and a glass of cachaça is never more than a few minutes away; the bartenders upstairs will shake it with muddled lime hulls for a classic caipirinha or stir it with a cube of frozen coconut water, a stupefyingly simple drink that I will be copying at home next summer. Most of all, Botequim has Brazilian food, under the direction of the chef Marco Moreira, that is too good to be trapped in a basement. To start, have a few globes of pão de queijo, Brazilian cheese puffs that are something like gougères crossed with mochi. Springy and lightly chewy from tapioca flour, they are delicious eaten in alternating bites with toothpick-speared lengths of grilled calabresa sausage, spicy and tinged with garlic. Or with a plate of pastelzinhos, wonderfully crisp turnovers whose thin pastry shells are not even a little bit doughy. Some are filled with cubes of unmelted cheese from the state of Minas Gerais, and you may need to come from there yourself to appreciate its squeaky blandness. But the pastelzinhos holding ground beef with tomatoes and olives are instantly lovable. So are the rough and flaky fried croquettes of salt cod, light but not insubstantial. They come with a lemon emulsion, which is to be ignored in favor of a few potent drops of the bright-red hot sauce made on site. It's terrific stuff. The main courses make it obvious, if it wasn't already, that Botequim's kitchen cooks with far more finesse than the remaining restaurants of Manhattan's Little Brazil or the outposts of those all-the-grilled-meat-you-can-eat chains that turn up every few years and are never as much fun as they sound. Mr. Moreira, who with his wife and business partner, Jo-Ann Makovitzky, owns Botequim along with Tocqueville and 15 East , was raised in São Paulo. The kitchen is in the hands of Jason Hall, his chef de cuisine, but you can tell that Mr. Moreira put considerable care into the recipes. He may have lightened some of Brazil's more bruisingly rich dishes, but he kept the flavors true. Botequim's cube of suckling pig plays a recurring role in one of my hungry daydreams, in which I break the thin roof of crackling skin into chips to scoop up swirls of lime-brightened pork, soft enough to serve as a dip. In other idle moments between meals, I flash back to the short rib, roasted in extremely slow motion until a dark and satisfying crust wraps around woozily tender meat. It's like smokeless barbecue, and once I had tried it, I stopped flashing back to Botequim's roasted top sirloin, called the Brazilian, a fine steak but ultimately just a steak. My private visions of moqueca may feature a more varied mix of seafood than black sea bass and a single prawn. But the coconut-tomato broth in this Bahian stew would taste a lot like Botequim's, with every mouthful slicked by a palpable slug of red dendê oil. And when I imagine feijoada, it looks the way it did my first night at Botequim, when it was loaded with smoked pork and sausages and the black beans tasted as if they, too, were on the verge of turning into meat. On a second try, it was more soup than stew, and the beans tasted like beans. Maybe it was just the luck of the ladle. The high point of dessert was always a tres leches-style coconut cake grandly slouching under the weight of all the milk and cream it had soaked up. When I tried anything else, the meal never ended as well. Sonhos, the doughnut holes whose name means "dreams" in Portuguese, had an undreamlike heaviness, though a quick dunk in guava sauce helped. For reasons I can't imagine, the rice pudding, which was allegedly made with bananas and passion fruit, tasted like stewed onions. And my coffee, which seemed like a sure thing in a Brazilian restaurant, was awful, a thin and watery broth. If you want a drink with dessert, try some sherry from Roger Dagorn's list, which is strong in all departments, down to the rarely seen Brazilian beers. But weak coffee and iffy desserts can be fixed; they're no reason to hide Botequim away from people looking for dinner along Fourth Avenue. Mr. Moreira and Ms. Makovitzky also operate the Fourth and a whiskey and wine bar called Singl , both on the street level. I don't know anything about the hotel business; if I did, maybe I'd understand why hotels have such strange ideas about spelling. But a bar seems like a natural inhabitant for a snug room in the basement. My message to Mr. Moreira: Set the moqueca free! Let the cod fritters come upstairs!

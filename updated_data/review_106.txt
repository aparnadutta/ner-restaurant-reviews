 The name means "the fifth pine," a Spanish idiom for the boondocks, which was probably a stretch even seven years ago when El Quinto Pino opened on West 24th Street, across from the canyon wall of London Terrace. The thumbnail curve of the sardine-can tapas bar is just the way it's been since the beginning, packed, every seat there and on the opposite wall a few inches away taken almost any time you show up. Turn right at the door, though, and you'll find something new. Last fall, El Quinto Pino's owners and chefs, Alex Raij and her husband, Eder Montero, took over the lease on the apartment next door and filled it with tables, making their sardine can a real restaurant. "It won't make a bid for your entire night: You will snack at El Quinto Pino and almost inevitably eat more somewhere else," Peter Meehan wrote in a " $25 and Under" column in 2007, its last review in The New York Times. With a reservation for that side room you won't need to go anywhere else for dinner. You won't want to, either, once the food starts zooming out of the kitchen. Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero also own Txikito, across Ninth Avenue, which digs into Basque cuisine, and La Vara, in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where the menu is a master's thesis on Moorish and Jewish imprints upon Spanish cooking. A short "menú turístico" at El Quinto Pino investigates a different region of the country every few months, which gives regulars a reason to keep coming and gives the kitchen a launching pad for dishes that may hit the permanent roster. Other than that, the two chefs haven't tied themselves down. Having laid down their Iberian credentials in their other restaurants, they've given El Quinto Pino a passport to roam around. Among the bar sandwiches tightly wrapped in paper is a visitor from New Orleans, a po'boy with closely packed, terrifically crunchy fried squid legs at its core. Another is a fortified Cubano, in which the ham and crisp pickle have more oomph than usual, the cheese doesn't taste processed, for once, and the braised pork is supplemented with a red wallop of blood sausage. The chefs do a takeoff on Catalonia's version of the croque monsieur, the bikini, but they aim a double-barreled blast of Mexico at it, topping the melted cheese with roasted poblanos and huitlacoche, the flamboyantly weird, mushroom-tasting black fungus that grows on corn ears. Geographic freedom between pieces of bread was written into El Quinto Pino's charter from the start, when Ms. Raij brought out (all rise, please) the uni panino. A pressed ficelle filled with creamy sea urchin, melted butter and a lashing of mustard oil, it became one of the city's essential sandwiches. It still is, even though one night mustard-oil supplies must have run low and the panino wasn't the same without its throat-catching rumble. The rest of the menu is made up of tapas-style plates, and the servers are careful not to overload the small tables, bringing just one or two at a time. The kitchen mostly presents these dishes as tangles that are easily shared, and resists the impulse toward multicomponent platings. With Raij-Montero portions, four people seems to be the breaking point at which you're not so much eating as nibbling. I enjoyed El Quinto Pino more in a party of three, and best of all with just one accomplice. Some of the seafood is so appealing and out of the ordinary that dividing it can test your ability to play well with others. I hated surrendering the last fried lump of sea anemone folded into soft scrambled eggs. Called ortiguillas, they tasted almost like fried oysters, but not quite, and I wanted to get to the bottom of that "not quite." My curiosity and my appetite also wanted a few more runs at the Catalan salad xató, which mixed chicory and canned bonito with raw salt cod, soaked to pull out the salt and to reveal a flavor of quietly intensified fish. Dressed with both romesco and an uncooked tomato sauce, this salad seemed to get more lively with each bite. Tender, apple-blossom-pink gambas al ajillo get a little fresh ginger along with the garlic, an addition that made me want to eat them twice as fast. (Mashed and sliced avocado don't have the same effect on an oddly inert salpicon of shrimp.) Smaller shrimp from Cadiz, the size of a paper clip and intensely flavorful in their shells, are pressed into a tortillita, a wonderful fritter that looks like a latke cooked under a brick. Fried on their own, these shrimp turn up again to bring a marine undertow to a jiggly poached egg with slivered snow peas. The kitchen's hand is so steady that it's easy to pass over its occasional bobbles, unless you're unlucky enough to be served two or three in a row. My disappointments were spread out: dully spiced lamb skewers; underseasoned bits of fried pork whose name, "bag of bacon," raised undue expectations; seafood fideua, like paella made from noodles, that lacked the oceanic depth I loved when I had the same dish at La Vara. And it's unclear how the xocolata dessert is meant to be served. One night the salt-sprinkled ingot of chocolate ganache was filled with fruity green olive oil that spilled out at the touch of a fork; I don't think I've ever enjoyed the pairing of the two ingredients more. On another, the oil was cold and congealed like Vaseline. Fortunately I had the excellent crema catalana, roused from its usual custardy slumber by cinnamon and lemon zest, to fall back on. Everything I know about dating could be carved onto the head of a pin with a butter knife, but a younger man who lives down the block from El Quinto Pino assures me it's a great date place. He didn't mean the bar, with its was-that-your-foot? dimensions, but the new dining room. Separated from the drinkers by a galley kitchen, its 30 seats feel secluded and romantic, but not in an obvious way. The architect Silvia Zofio gave it a quietly domestic, midcentury look, with an earth-toned tapestry covering one wall and a chandelier that suggests the swoosh of a flamenco dancer's skirt in mid-twirl. It's a room for talking, and if it's not exactly the boondocks, it's easy enough to get lost there for an hour or two.

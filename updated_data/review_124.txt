 On April Fools' Day 2008, a former music publicist and retired dominatrix named Erin Norris signed the lease on a derelict Brooklyn storefront where she intended to open a sausage restaurant called Grindhaus . Almost immediately, the universe began sending her a message: don't. The space had structural weaknesses, and propping it up would become a long, expensive project. Gas burners would not be an option. Nor would the grinding and stuffing of sausages in bulk; as it turned out, there wasn't enough room. Ms. Norris ran out of money, raised more, blew through that, scraped up a little extra, spent it on the best kitchen equipment she could afford, and announced that she would open soon. The universe, surmising that the message wasn't getting through, sent a flood. The night of Hurricane Sandy, water filled the streets of Red Hook and filled Grindhaus, too, wrecking all that kitchen equipment. By this point, the signs had to be clear. Evidently Ms. Norris didn't care, because she mucked the place out, banged in new, mold-free walls, began a Kickstarter campaign to fund repairs and fresh equipment, and hired Aaron Taber, a chef she had met at the dog run. The 20-seat restaurant she opened last December, without the sausage theme, is still called Grindhaus. This may be a sign of Ms. Norris's stubbornness, or it may show that she grasps a basic principle of business: When you have a restaurant name that suggests a lost Russ Meyer film set in a German wurst hall staffed by karate-kicking supervixens who are barely contained by their black-leather dirndls, you don't give it up because you can't serve sausages. Grindhaus is not entirely sausage-free. I did eat a few pinches of fresh merguez there once. It was terrific stuff, rich and spicy, folded inside fresh cappellacci. Around these pasta bundles, Mr. Taber had set a snake-curve of charred scallion, confidently seasoned chickpeas and yogurt for a sauce. There were also balls of chickpea cakes called panisses. Panisses may not seem to go with pasta, but these were good enough to go with any dish they wanted. In his short cooking career, Mr. Taber has worked at the Pines in Brooklyn and made dough for a mobile pizza oven. At Grindhaus, his first post as chef, he cooks alone in a kitchen almost exactly the dimensions of the restroom. He makes the kind of earnest, fashionably austere, handsomely arranged food that is signified on menus by sans-serif lists of ingredients, with no capital letters, verbs, articles or hint of how one thing may relate to the next. In some restaurants, they don't relate. At Grindhaus, they do. The first thing I ate there was written this way: rutabaga carrot, sorrel, grapefruit Was it a salad? A soup? A purgative juice blend? No. It was a delicious and ingeniously simple vegetable tart. A buttery pie shell was just big enough to contain a thick, soft wheel of rutabaga held in place by a layer of pur√©ed carrots. The lemonlike bite of raw sorrel and the true citrus of grapefruit acted as welcome rays of sunlight breaking into this ode to the root cellar. Mr. Taber's style of cooking is often found in druidic, wood-filled restaurants with tasting menus, cupboards stacked with hand-thrown pottery and painfully earnest names derived from natural materials, like Resin. Grindhaus isn't as high-minded as those places. It has some rock 'n' roll in its trousers. A steel silhouette of a broken wine glass hangs in the front window, and the jagged shards attached to the stem look like the fingers of a hand raised in a heavy-metal salute. The framed sketches of the heads of Keith Moon and Brian Jones were drawn in high school by a friend of Ms. Norris's whose later work, under the name Cynthia Plaster Caster, would depict other regions of rock-star anatomy. On the bar is the stuffed head of a white horse, its gaping mouth now a vase for eucalyptus branches. Like most things in Grindhaus, the head has a story. It was made to Ms. Norris's specifications by a taxidermist who waited three years for a dead horse in the right color to come along. "The throat was to open up so it could have a lot of ephemera and antique drug paraphernalia, prescriptions from the 19th century," Ms. Norris said. Even if you never figure out what's in the horse's throat, the head with its flowing mane still works its spell as part of Grindhaus's invitation to let it loose and come on down. It's not a rowdy place, but it is one where classic rock may play all night. It's a place where I felt quite at ease singing along to "Volunteers" while tearing off a fistful of sourdough bread, which Mr. Taber bakes inside a cast-iron pot to give it a crust that is as stiff, crisp and dark as bread crust can get without being burned. It's a place where certain flavors, like the seared foie gras with ripe strawberries in warm strawberry-rhubarb juice, or the duck breast with morels and rye berries, were so intense that I called over the server and asked for the same dish again, please, before another course left the kitchen. Ms. Norris buys the wines. Almost all come from the natural school, and a few were chosen with more enthusiasm than discernment, so it's wise to taste before committing to a bottle. As they are all poured by the glass, this is easy to do. Wines that didn't seem quite ready and a slightly undercooked monkfish were the only tastes I regretted. I could also wish for more than one dessert on the menu. Recently it was a chocolate mousse with a caramel-like strawberry cream, cacao nibs and puffed rice; I liked it just fine, but the people at my table who didn't would have appreciated an alternative. Mr. Taber, no doubt, would appreciate a bigger kitchen and someone to share it with. Like the romance in a screwball comedy, though, Grindhaus gets its energy from the meeting of opposites: Mr. Taber's large ambitions and his tiny work space, the carefully considered cooking and Ms. Norris's wild paraphernalia. She hasn't decorated the place with canes or masks from her dominatrix days, but she believes the dungeon helped shape Grindhaus. "That's also the hospitality industry, in a way," she said, adding: "So it finds its way into how things are run and taking care of people. Making sure no one leaves scarred. Or unhappy."

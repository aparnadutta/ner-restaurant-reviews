 Mu Ramen has always been elusive. When Joshua and Heidy Smookler were serving noodle soup by night inside Bricktown Bagels in Long Island City, Queens, the hours and reservations policy seemed to change week to week. Then the location changed, as the Smooklers began serving guests in their apartment or at other addresses that were disclosed upon making a reservation. On Wednesday morning, Mu Ramen became even more elusive. It stopped serving ramen anywhere at any time. The ramen, when you could still get it, was superb. When I made a list of my favorite bowls of ramen in the city, I put it in first place. Mr. Smookler told Eater that he had received more than 2,000 reservation requests after the list appeared online on Tuesday. But he also began getting offers from people who were suddenly interested in going into the ramen business. He cleared his calendar the next morning, canceling all reservations and putting off new ones until he could talk to these prospective partners. "I literally got inundated with investment opportunities," Mr. Smookler said in a phone interview on Thursday. "I was trying to meet with all those people, so I had to stop that anyway," referring to the existing reservations. A few weeks ago, the Smooklers signed a lease for Mu Ramen's future home, at 1209 Jackson Avenue in Long Island City. They plan to open in July. Mr Smookler said there is a chance he will be ladling out his tonkotsu and miso broths again in the meantime, if he can find a temporary home for Mu, perhaps in another restaurant.

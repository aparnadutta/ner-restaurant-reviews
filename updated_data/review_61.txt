 When serious, reputation-making restaurants run out of room on the walls to hang all the awards, chefs open a cheaper, more casual restaurant nearby. Like a dutiful younger brother, the second restaurant is supposed to work harder, please more people, make fewer demands, be more pragmatic and smile as the firstborn sucks up all the attention. There is rarely any confusion about these roles. Bouchon Bakery & Café doesn't try to waylay customers toddling toward Per Se 's blue door and tempt them into having a quiche and salad instead. Sometimes, though, younger siblings who follow the rules can still pull off some quiet subversion. This summer, the chefs Jeremiah Stone and Fabian von Hauske opened a wine bar two doors down Orchard Street from their showcase restaurant, Contra . The new place, called Wildair , plays its part exactly as written. And somehow, in a subtle and charming way, the kid upstages his big brother. Contra does laid-back refinement as well as any downtown restaurant, and the two chefs pack an impressive amount of nuance into its six- or seven-course set menus. Wildair is the one I want to go back to, though. I want to camp out at a high table, taste everything new on the menu to see whether it clicks and pillage the stash of natural wines like Genghis Khan. Format matters. Contra's is a concise tasting menu, and tasting menus are the parchment scrolls on which chefs inscribe their Magna Cartas with goose-quill flourishes. Wildair borrows its format from contemporary European wine bars such as Manfreds & Vin in Copenhagen and Le Dauphin in Paris, places that extend a hand inviting us to try something new, drink a strange gamay bottled by an ornery old hermit, eat a little of this and a little more of that while we catch up, unwind and make plans. You visit Contra. Wildair is a restaurant you can live in. The food isn't necessarily better, but it's often more inventive. You wouldn't guess that from scanning the menu, reading down from oysters and cheese to fried squid and steak. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske are serving familiar, likable food. But instead of tying them down, this seems to have given them permission to lift off with extra altitude. The squid is fried along with sliced lemons and sections of green onion. Everything is contained in a golden shell that is implausibly light and crunchy, with no hint of sogginess. Potato flour mixed with masa is the secret of the batter. A garlic-powered squid-ink aioli gives the dish some staying power. The secret of Wildair's white shrimp with celery is probably the shrimp themselves, netted off the coast of Georgia. But the kitchen augments their unmistakably wild flavor by patiently stewing them in garlic-pimentón oil, heads and all. On my first two outings at Wildair, I passed up the pork rillettes, suspecting that they were outsourced. They are not. They are beautifully made on site, smooth and pinkish and creamy in a glass bowl sealed with a white blanket of fat. I spread the rillettes on thin toast and took a bite, letting the fat and its warm, holiday flavor of ginger and other seasonings melt on my tongue. I almost skipped the lettuce, too, suspecting that it was lettuce. I was right about that but wrong about skipping it. With squiggles of butter-and-caramelized-lettuce dressing insinuated into its folds and some chopped pistachios on top, the sweet Little Gem lettuce makes for one of those ideal salads that is as complicated as it needs to be and no more. The dream date for that lettuce would be the dry-aged Wagyu steak, slick with melted beef fat and so tender it doesn't seem entirely real. It might have made me dizzy if I hadn't already been reeling over the price, $70 for roughly 25 ounces of meat, sliced from the bone, that two companions and I ate while luxuriating in the oak-and-steel embrace of Wildair's stools. (The discomfort is more acute at the narrow counters on either side of the dining room.) For the average mortal's budget, the beef tartare is a more accessible lettuce partner. Chopped into bits that are big enough to chew, the meat is crunchy with toasted buckwheat, hot with fresh horseradish, and sharp with gratings of tangy smoked Cheddar. Though the two chefs seem liberated by cooking for a simple wine bar , this freedom sometimes leads them off the path. Wet blobs of below-par sea urchin had no business glopping up an excellent potato cake I ate in the early summer. The texture of whole clams and flabby cubes of lardo over griddled bread with spinach wasn't as appealing as the flavor. The kitchen may also want to cut the squid and green onions into smaller pieces; you want to eat them with your fingers, but they're so big you almost need a knife and fork. Mr. von Hauske is the baker of the two. The dense white sourdough with the fantastically crisp crust that he makes at Contra is sold at Wildair, too, this time with a dish of salted olive oil that catches nicely in your throat. For dessert, he has come up with a very likable panna cotta; the sweetness comes from soft shavings of watermelon granite and a crumble of caramelized milk. There's also a chocolate-peanut butter tart that tastes exactly the way I've always wished a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup tasted. One sign of how well Wildair works is that nearly everybody I know who has dropped in has a story about discovering a new wine. The central character in most of these stories is Jorge Riera, the wine director here and at Contra and a soft-spoken but ardent advocate for winemakers who believe in letting nature have its way. I owe him for introducing me to a biodynamic fino sherry from Andalusia and an elegantly honeysuckle-scented grenache blanc from Catalonia, among others. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske named their wine bar for a prizewinning racehorse that lived in the neighborhood before the Civil War. Mr. von Hauske believes it should be pronounced "willed air," but almost everybody calls the place "wild air." Maybe everybody is wrong, or maybe this is just a case of a younger sibling claiming its own identity.

 I'll get to the heftier items on Oiji 's menu. I'll praise the pine-smoked mackerel that a mackerel-conscious friend and I have been emailing each other about for a month now. I'll reminisce about the bowl of buttered rice and stewed beef that seemed boring at first and then not boring at all. I'll try to explain what makes the bubble-cluster of crust on the fried chicken so good. All in due time, all in due time. First, I need to tell you about the honey butter chips. As faithful readers of the South Korean dailies know, about a year ago the snack company Haitai introduced the country to a new potato chip flavored with "sweet, sweet honey from beehives" and "gourmet butter" from France. Mass hysteria ensued. Few stores could keep them in stock and those that did rationed one bag to a customer. The snack's social media presence was Kardashian-esque. On eBay, two bags of the chips sold for more than $100. An anxious nation was soothed to learn that Haitai is building a chip factory outside Seoul, and disappointed to hear that it will not be completed until next year. Frustration was mounting in the East Village as well, where Oiji's two chefs, Brian Kim and Tae Kyung Ku, wanted to pay homage to honey butter chips, but couldn't get their hands on any. Undaunted, they took to the kitchen. The chips they came up with have not ignited a citywide panic, but they are not a joke. They come to the table straight from the fryer, translucently thin and shimmering all over with honey and brown sugar melted into butter. Cayenne keeps the syrup from overstaying its welcome. They are crisper and more lovable than wet potato chips have any right to be. The chefs grew up in South Korea in the innocent times before honey butter chips. They met in culinary school in the United States, then went off to learn their trade -- Mr. Kim worked at Bouley , and Mr. Ku at Gramercy Tavern and at his family's restaurant back home. Getting back together years later, they leased a room with a lineage, the former site of Dok Suni, the pioneering modern Korean restaurant on First Avenue. Made over as Oiji, it is a warm and orderly space of exposed brick and wood. Half the dining room is taken up by a table that looks as if it came from the reading room of a college library, with benches on either side. Oiji helps take the sting out of Dok Suni's demise. In some ways it continues its predecessor's mission of updating and translating Korean cuisine with respect. It may also remind you of the chef Hooni Kim's places, Danji and Hanjan ; like them, it adjusts traditional recipes for the small-plates era. Those places draw harder on Korea's more intense flavors, while Oiji aims for a little French-style nuance. I promised you buttered rice and beef. Oiji's braised beef is a variant on a classic banchan, but its version is less salty and soy drenched. You take your wooden spoon and stir it into the rice with half a soft-cooked egg and some low-key radish pickles. The mixture is so subtle it barely registers until the butter's tractor beam switches on and you find yourself thinking that you could eat this every night. The mackerel that Mr. Kim and Mr. Ku smoke over pine needles may fit into your Sunday mornings. It's soft, a bit creamy, and tastes like something Barney Greengrass might sell if it relocated to a forest in Maine. The fish comes with a soy-based sauce. You're supposed to brush this on using a cluster of pine needles tied with a string. I liked the mackerel very much but this tiny broom made me feel as if I were having dinner under the floorboards with the Borrowers . As for the chicken, it's a genuine achievement. Typically Korean fried chicken has a hard, crackling shell, but Oiji's is dressed in a puffy, pale, blistered cloak that crunches like newly fried chicharrones. At the other end of the texture spectrum is the superb terrine of pigs' feet, firm pink meat held in a thin lattice of gelatin. The terrine is underpinned by French aromatics (thyme, maybe allspice). Korea enters the picture through the precise, clear flavors of the spicy citrus vinaigrette. Mr. Kim and Mr. Ku have a spin on yuk hwe, but in their kitchen the chilled raw cubes of beef with egg yolk and sesame oil are augmented by pickled mustard seeds. It's very good, although cooking the yolk to a soft jelly seemed like an unnecessary flourish. A hot soup of ground perilla seeds is gloopy and grainy in a way that some guests at my table never got used to. I wouldn't put it at the top of my list, but I liked the way the chefs used oyster mushrooms to deepen the flavor of the seeds, which can taste a little flat on their own. The risk with this kind of cooking is that people who know their way around traditional Korean restaurants, where the only small plates are the free banchan, may walk away feeling they've paid more for less. I didn't get as much of the tender squid, shrimp and mussels in truffled seafood broth as I wanted. And if the gochujang-braised drumsticks were twice as spicy I doubt shrieks of pain would fill the dining room. But most of the time, when I knew the Korean original, it helped me enjoy the renovations Mr. Kim and Mr. Ku have made. The cocktails aren't quite as clunky as names like Thyme to Samba suggest. Wines are respectable, but the most rewarding thing to drink is soju. Oiji offers more styles and prices than you usually see in one place, including a garnet-colored soju made backstage with pomegranate vinegar. All but two dishes are under $20. Most can be shared by two or three people, but if you make a solo dinner of the mackerel for $14 and the house-made cold soba with pickled ramps for $10, you'll be eating and spending well. Another $5 will get you honey butter chips and the satisfaction of finding a bargain not available on eBay.

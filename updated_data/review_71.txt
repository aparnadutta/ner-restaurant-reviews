 If George Mendes did not have such a strong grip on the flavors and aromas of Portugal, Lupulo might have slipped away from him. It can be a confusing restaurant at first, its messages mixed, its fairly simple concept fuzzed over with complications. But give the place a chance, and you can find clarity in the smells of garlic and wood smoke that fill the dining room; in the way sweet paprika and cilantro sidle up to each other in olive oil; and in the fresh, firm seafood, the grilled sardines and carabineros, red as a lobster, their heads dripping with juices that are as rich and intense as any sauce. The restaurant may be unfocused, but the cooking isn't. Mr. Mendes's basic idea for Lupulo, which opened a few blocks south of Herald Square in April, was straightforward enough. The name means "hops," and the place is his take on the beer-centered Portuguese taverns called cervejarias. The nearest American equivalent is probably a brewpub, which Lupulo resembles with its hard, low wooden chairs, its high ceilings and its U-shaped dining bar stretching off into the distance. The menu gets right into the beery spirit with food that's left a little rough around the edges. The skin on chicken piri piri is black from the grill, but the meat is juicy right down to the bone. It shows up at the table with skinny French fries and a squeeze bottle of piri piri, the hot sauce that suggests Portuguese people have an advanced understanding of pain's pleasures. Manila clams steamed open in vinho verde with cilantro and chopped spring garlic are simple and wonderful, especially when you soak some grilled bread in the pan sauce. Purists may be let down to find that Lupulo's caracois are meaty Burgundian snails lying naked on a plate, not the smaller variety that people suck from their shells one by one on any summer afternoon in Lisbon. But wait until the purists get a taste of the rustic olive oil sauce, spiced with smoked paprika and chopped garlic that is warmed but not tamed. The Portuguese are masters of what Italians call cucina povera, the discipline of squeezing enjoyment out of inexpensive ingredients. Maybe you have wondered why anyone would choose to eat bread porridge? Try Lupulo's version of açorda -- mushy and crunchy at the same time, topped with a few carabineros and saturated with a shrimp-head stock that makes the room reel -- and wonder no more. Mr. Mendes works the same humble sorcery on sweet spring peas cooked with choriço. The liquid yolk of a sunny-side-up egg waits to be poked and swirled around until it joins up with the fresh herbs laced into the peas. It has a close cousin, just as satisfying, in the bowl of bright-green favas with crunchy knobs of blood sausage and morels. At other times, the kitchen veers off message, with artsy swooshes and swirls that seem as if they'd be more at home serenely perched on the tablecloths at Mr. Mendes's other, more formal restaurant, Aldea . You can spot these exiles from Chefville on the menu at a glance: the raw sockeye and darkly glittering caviar in buttermilk froth under radish wheels sliced thin enough to blow away, the grilled asparagus with dried and fresh sea urchin. From a branding standpoint, Mr. Mendes should probably ship these dishes off to Aldea . But I hope he doesn't, because his forays into fussiness are at least as flavorful as the more broad-shouldered plates. And some, like the raw snapper with the stormy heat of fermented serrano peppers calmed by waves of coconut broth scented with makrut lime, are at least arguably Portuguese in a post-colonial sense, if you care to play those games in the face of inarguable deliciousness. Of course there is Portuguese wine, a short and solid list, but there is more energy and excitement in the beer menu. This document can be disorienting, though, at least on a first visit. Why open a cervejaria and turn over all the taps but two (recently there was one for a Spanish cider, another for the dry, likable Sagres lager from Portugal) to American craft breweries? Mr. Mendes has said in interviews that he features the United States simply because it makes more of the carefully, intelligently made beers he enjoys than Portugal, where small-scale brewing is a newer phenomenon. He gave Ryan Mauban, most recently seen fussing over the bottles and kegs at Torst in Brooklyn, the job of tracking down innovative brews from around the country. His list is short but packs in a lot of stylistic diversity: goses (see Eric Asimov's Pour column this week ) more tart than lemonade, Belgian-style ales with a barely-there hint of Thai basil. With dessert, Mr. Mauban may suggest a South Carolina stout brewed with cocoa, cinnamon and a flicker of habanero. It tastes like chocolate soda that grew up into an alluring stranger with a dark secret. In fact, it had more going for it than some of Alexander Zecena's sweets, like the sleepy vanilla rice pudding, now off the menu, and the pasteis de nata, bite-size tarts of egg custard that were somehow both floury and not quite firm. But there is no point trying to resist the pudim Molotov, like the child of a flan and a marshmallow, or the eggy sponge cake next to a slice of soft, mildly sour sheep's milk cheese. The menu, to give this dead horse one last whack, is kind of confusing. It is divided into Small Plates, Fish, Meat and Garden. Simple enough, until you're told that all but the last four Fish entries are also small plates. That quirk is easier to get used to than the roar of Lupulo's dining room at full tilt. The wall of traditional blue-and-white Portuguese ceramic tiles is pretty, but combined with the two walls of soaring window panels and all the bare wood, it guarantees that by 8 p.m. everybody will end up talking about how hard it is to talk. Full-tilt dining rooms may not be a problem for long if Lupulo doesn't get an acoustic adjustment soon. It would be a shame if noise drove the crowds away, because Lupulo gets almost everything else right. On that point, there shouldn't be any confusion.

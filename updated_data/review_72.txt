 The night was humid, and I was drinking cold rosé at the black-veined marble counter that faces the kitchen of Rebelle . The couple on my left had rosé in their glasses, too. I did what one member of the pink wine fellowship does when encountering other members, and offered them a taste. Patrick Cappiello, the wine director of this worthwhile modern French restaurant on the Bowery, provided the introductions. My Bellwether pinot noir was not, he said, technically a rosé, though it was translucent, the color of raspberry juice, and as highly drinkable as any Provençal pink. The grapes were grown on the east coast of Seneca Lake and turned into wine with a minimum of hocus-pocus by Kris Matthewson . Mr. Cappiello called him "a rock star of the Finger Lakes." My neighbors knew the fellowship's code and offered me a pour of their sparkling rosé, Ultramarine. With its precise, almost etched framework of acidity, it was a thrill. The pinot noir grapes were grown along the Bohemian Highway in Sonoma County, and fermented by Michael Cruse who, according to Mr. Cappiello, is "a rock star of California sparkling wine." It was starting to sound like a winemaking supergroup, the Velvet Revolver of pinot noir. But this is just Mr. Cappiello's way of talking about the 1,600 or so bottles on his list. He likes to knock the crust off the rituals of buying something to drink by casting a favorite producer as a poet of barrel fermentation, a virtuoso of natural yeast, or, to give this restaurant's name in English, a rebel. The assault on tradition implied by the name turns out to be fairly tame stuff, but you bump into it all over the restaurant. The unforced, intermittently French food is inspired by one particular rebellion. The chef, Daniel Eddy, comes to Rebelle straight from the Paris restaurant Spring , a member of the loosely bound bistronomy movement. Bistronomy isn't a style of cooking; it's a reordering of priorities across the restaurant. The idea is to strip out expensive Michelin bait like linens so prices can come down and everybody can pay attention to the food again. While bistronomy put an extra shine on the copper pots in Paris, it hasn't really resonated in the United States. So Rebelle, despite its bistronomic pedigree, won't strike most New Yorkers as a huge departure. It should, however, strike them as a very good place to eat seasonal food that flirts with French ideas in exciting ways. The sauce on an appetizer of sliced raw fluke is brown butter with a flicker of lemon and a handful of capers, fried until crisp. Say hello to your old friend skate Grenobloise, but reimagined as chilled sashimi, and approximately 10 times better than that sounds. And here are leeks in vinaigrette, but not the comfortable old mush you've cozied up to before. Snipped into bite-size cylinders, these leeks are younger, firmer, their onion character not completely subdued. What the black filaments of leek ash are doing on the plate I can't say, but the scraps of soft-boiled egg are there to help when the grains of mustard tug at your throat. Like Spring's chef, Mr. Eddy is American born and raised. Sometimes it's hard to tell what distinguishes his contemporary French cuisine from the international style in food that stretches from Copenhagen to Mexico City and beyond. In the case of the excellent roasted monkfish with a pale pink blush at the core, it must be the butter emulsion that insinuates itself about the sea beans, the mussels and the sliced razor clams. In the case of the seared scallops with raw green apples and crisp turnip coins in a bright-tasting juice pressed from herbs, apples and celery, who knows. Nothing, maybe? It's smart, original and not quite like any other scallop dish I've had. So far the meatless main courses I've tried could be described as a collection of vegetables sharing a plate. The beet bourguignon (beets, pearl onions, braised carrots, raw mushrooms) needed a sauce to tie everything together, ideally one with some fat. And I'm not sure anything could tie Rebelle's carrots together with morels and peas, but the dish has some distance to go before it will be compared to Narcissa's carrots Wellington . Or, for that matter, to Rebelle's monkfish, or its roast chicken, a long strip of bird under a crackerlike roof of skin. Absolutely everything about this plate seems to have gone right, down to the golden, papery slices of potato fused in butter-fried unity. A second rebellion takes place in the realm of interior design. The nostalgic French restaurant clichés that New Yorkers love have all been bagged up and left at the curb with the potato peels. Rebelle has no Pernod posters, no zinc bars, no walls painted the color of Serge Gainsbourg's teeth. The 90 chairs are black, the tables are black, and, high above both, the ceilings and ductwork are painted black, too. At times Rebelle reminds you less of a brasserie on Boulevard du Montparnasse than of a strip club on Queens Boulevard, especially when you start hearing classic pole-dancing hits of the 1980s by Naked Eyes and the Human League. The owners, who include Mr. Cappiello and who overlap with the partners behind Pearl & Ash , one door north on the Bowery, were probably going for a sexy nightclub look. They overshot the mark by a gyration or two. The murk may be an accident, but the servers' upselling is so consistent it must be scripted. The menu is divided into small appetizers for $12, less small ones for $16, main courses for $24 and desserts for $9. This seems to require no explanation, but a server will still tell you that "our menu is designed for four courses." No. Your menu is à la carte, which means it is designed to let people decide how many courses they want. They should be able to make that decision without any Jedi mind tricks, like being told that a $22 foie gras torchon (billed as a special but available every night, in my experience) is "ideal as a precourse, for the table to share." The gently marked-up wine list can rinse out the bad taste of these check-fluffing techniques. Although there are four-figure bottles from prime real estate in Bordeaux, Burgundy and Napa, so many others are clustered just over and under $50 that I lost count. For this modern French restaurant with an American chef, the wines are largely made in the contemporary, hands-off style, and they all come from France and the United States. If you've written off all American wines as big, galumphing, overpriced beasts, drink one or two of the lithe and inexpensive creatures Rebelle has picked up in the Finger Lakes, the Pacific Northwest or the Central California Coast. A few glasses should convince you that, following France's lead, the United States is now going through a delicious, small-scale winemaking rebellion.

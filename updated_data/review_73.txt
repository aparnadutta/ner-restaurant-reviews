 In the summer, for a dinner of rib-eye and cabernet, I want air-conditioning. Otherwise, I prefer to sip my rosé with some cool vitello tonnato at a table on a patch of pavement -- or better, in a quiet verdant garden or on some breezy rooftop. Here are some possibilities. The spacious tree-lined front courtyard of the High Line Hotel has an Intelligentsia coffee truck by day. But after 5 p.m., a team from the group that owns L'Apicio is in charge with a bar set up to dispense aperitifs, including frozen negronis. A must on the nice Italian menu are shatteringly crisp fried artichokes that taste like pastry: High Line Hotel, 180 10th Avenue (20th Street), 212-933-9735, altalineanyc.com. This may be the lowest-rise rooftop of all, on the restaurant's third floor. It's also one of the more gracious, tucked among towering neighbors and facing north so there is never hot sun. The full lunch menu is served, followed later in the day by bar food that is as minimal as pigs in blankets and as substantial as sliced steak: Aretsky's Patroon, 160 East 46th Street, 212-883-7373, aretskyspatroon.com. It's a funky little backyard garden strung with sparkly lights and set with a couple of communal tables. Erin Norris's latest chef, Joe Macchia, offers sophisticated plates of sockeye salmon or scallop crudo, a green salad with crème fraîche and bread crumbs, excellent gnocchi and an Armagnac savarin. Drink beer or uncommon wines: 275 Van Brunt Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, to text reservations: 718-909-2881, grindhausnyc.com. This grand garden is shaded by cherry trees and furnished French style. There are light and savory selections served with summery cocktails, some sporting signature macarons: 398 West Broadway (Spring Street) or, after 7 p.m., 72 Thompson Street, 646-392-7868, ladureeus.com. Only the ninth floor? The skyscraper view makes this roof seem higher. Seating is clustered in different areas for Tim Cushman's Mediterranean-accented fare, which includes pizzas: Park South Hotel, 125 East 27th Street, 212-204-5222, roofatparksouth.com. The Rainbow Room complex has been made even more spectacular with the soaring outdoor terrace that wraps the SixtyFive bar. Elegantly presented dishes on the new menu often have inventive touches like the jaunty brioche served alongside creamy pâté packed into a little jar. Classics and new creations are on the cocktail list: SixtyFive, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, 65th floor (49th Street), 212-632-5000, sixtyfivenyc.com.

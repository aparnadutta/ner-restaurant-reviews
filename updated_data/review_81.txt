 The revolution ran on grits, ham hocks, ribs, black-eyed peas and biscuits. When he opened Minton's Playhouse in Harlem in 1940, Henry Minton, the first black delegate to the local musicians' union, knew that jazz players were frequently in need of a meal and a place to give their instruments a workout. He gave them both. Minton's extended a tricky welcome to its jam sessions: Musicians could eat free soul food and take a solo as long as they could keep up with the house band, anchored by Thelonious Monk and Kenny Clarke. (The house band!) This gang of nonconformists delighted in bizarre chord progressions, obscure keys and melodies that ran upside down. Their bucking-bronco tactics threw some musicians right off the stage. The ones who stayed put included Dizzy Gillespie, Coleman Hawkins, Don Byas, a Juilliard student named Miles Davis and Charlie Parker, who had a notable ability to put away fried chicken. Writing in Esquire years later, Ralph Ellison described Minton's Playhouse as " a musical dueling ground ," and quoted a bartender who remembered when "Lester Young and Ben Webster used to tie up in battle like dogs in the road." The radical sounds that came out of the duels at Minton's and a few other clubs made a sharp break with the swing of the big-band era and formed a new style that would be called bebop. When assessing the role that Henry Minton's soul food played in the birth of bebop, it is worth keeping in mind that most of the testimonials to it come to us from hungry jazz musicians whose meals were on the house. Still, African-American music and cooking were a potent mix at Minton's once, and this was one reason to pay attention to the revival of Minton's as a jazz supper club that opened 18 months ago. Another reason came along in November, when Joseph Johnson, known as J J, took over as chef de cuisine after making a name for himself at Minton's sister restaurant next door, the Cecil . And a third, highly compelling reason takes the form of Mr. Johnson's Lowcountry gumbo. At the bottom of the bowl are broken grains of Carolina rice, with its irreplaceable flavor. The meat is smoked chicken and the seafood is wild shrimp, as tender and sweet as you could hope for. Two shrimp lie on top, crisscrossed, and their heads are still on. The base that holds it all together tastes of shellfish and tomato, of course, but a deep, mysterious oceanic note lurks down there. It comes from dried shrimp, and it makes for a haunting bowl of gumbo. Mr. Johnson does some bold, original cooking at Minton's. There are also dishes, particularly some appetizers, that could use more verve, and others that can go seriously out of tune when the kitchen has an off night. In the face of that unpredictability, the success of dinner at Minton's depends on how much you like to hear jazz musicians skittering around a tune, toying with a rhythm, tying and untying knots of harmony. If your ears don't bend that way, you have no business paying the cover charge at Minton's. If they do, I don't know a better place in the city to get them reshaped while you eat. The place is extremely welcoming, and manages an old-fashioned graciousness without strain. A dress code for men urges but doesn't positively demand jackets; the website boils the advice down to three words: "Dress Sharp Gents." No customer outsharps the front of the house, though. Male servers wear black bow ties and vests, while the managerial types favor tailored suits and pocket squares. One of these, spotting a recently drained cocktail glass on our table, stopped short in mock indignation. "This is empty. This is an outrage!" he said, and came back in a minute with a freshly mixed drink. The tables are lined up along walls hung with cocoa-toned curtains and framed photographs of Billie Holiday and other innovators, in black and white. At one end of the room are the stage and the only item from the original Minton's that wasn't ruined by water used to put out a fire upstairs decades ago: a 1948 mural of a late-night jam session in a small bedroom lighted by a kerosene lamp. On the brass bed, a woman in a red dress has passed out, face down. If she ever comes to, she may want to fortify herself with a plate of warm biscuits and whipped butter sweetened with sorghum and vanilla. Or, if she's lucky, the kitchen will send out some hush puppies, with black-eyed peas and pickled okra mashed into the cornmeal. Black-eyed peas are a refrain in the kitchen; lightly fried, they sit alongside the crab cake appetizer, an excellent deviled version, racy with lemon juice and mustard. When she is firmly on the ground again, I'd suggest the smoked pork chop with a lightly candied glaze of pralines and a scoop of bourbon yams. Mr. Johnson works out his menus with Minton's executive chef, Alexander Smalls. Both men are African-American, as are the restaurant's principal owner, Richard Parsons, and pastry chef, Mame Sow. Mr. Smalls, a South Carolina native, is a particular exponent of Lowcountry cuisine, which carries lasting imprints of West African and Caribbean cooking. There are direct quotations from South Carolina, like smooth she-crab soup or the crab and shrimp on fat, fluffy grains of grits. And there are riffs on the African theme, including collards cooked so they keep some of their crunch and dressed with a spiced peanut sauce. It's just a side dish, but I haven't stopped thinking about it. The less said about the kitchen's weakest night, the better. I'll just express my doubts that octopus and unripe strawberries were meant to be joined in ice-cold union, along with my strong feeling that tiny, dense, sweet corn muffins are neither "popovers" nor a good thing to eat alongside smoked trout, and leave it at that. What matters is that we left the table happy, an unusual outcome after a rocky meal. Ms. Sow's desserts helped, especially her elegant baked alaska with a foundation of graham cracker cake and a filling of smoked and toasted marshmallow ice cream -- s'mores with a Dress Sharp attitude. So did the young musicians working out nuanced, intricate compositions in this sophisticated Harlem room. When you hear Harlem, you picture one of two places: the great hive of African-American ideas and culture that flourished and disappeared, like Atlantis, or the modern neighborhood of wine bars, construction cranes and million-dollar apartments. The two Harlems meet at Minton's when a serious band is onstage and gumbo is on the table.

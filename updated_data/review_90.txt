 I'm starting to worry about the steakhouse. It used to be a rock of stability. The shifting winds of fashion did not bend it. Its basic formula was so firmly set that you could go to a steakhouse in San Bernardino and then one in Baltimore and have the same meal without looking at the menu. Now steakhouses are swerving all over the road. Their menus read like competitions to see who can stray furthest from plain beef and potatoes. The more desperate they grow in their attempts to prove they're not like the staid steakhouses of yore, the more they seem to converge. Take two examples that opened last year: Knife, in Dallas , and Bowery Meat Company , in Manhattan. Knife has duck risotto on the menu; Bowery Meat Company has duck lasagna for two. Knife has a whole roasted chicken; Bowery Meat Company has half a roasted chicken. Knife has half a roasted pig's head with Mexican salsas and tortillas; Bowery Meat Company has pork belly Chinese-barbecue style. After a while, reading these menus is like seeing your dad twerk. But the hey-we're-cool-no-really menus aren't as troubling as the way these places insist that they don't want to be called steakhouses anymore. Knife, according to its website, is "a reinvention of the steakhouse experience." And here on First Street just off the Bowery, the chef Josh Capon and the restaurateur John McDonald, the team behind Lure Fishbar and El Toro Blanco , have brought forth a "meat company" whose website says it is "not a traditional steakhouse, but a balanced meat-centric menu." Just between us, Bowery Meat Company is not, in fact, a menu, balanced or otherwise. But it does have a menu, and on it you will find seven cuts of beef and a burger, potatoes cooked at least four ways and a spinach side dish. Mr. Capon appears at certain tables presenting masses of raw beef draped on a cutting board. And while the wine list has admirable and enticing range, its foundation is a cache of broad-beamed cabernets that are obviously meant to be married off to bricks of dry-aged beef. Is it possible that Bowery Meat Company doesn't know it's a steakhouse, the way Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense" doesn't know he's a ghost? The dining room, by Meyer Davis Studio , could go either way. The right angles, the horizontal grain of the glossy paneling, the broad stretches of simple geometric curtains and the collection of midcentury chairs by Eames and other designers call up the heyday of Palm Springs and gibsons and Pall Malls and, yes, steak, along with other meats. In this retro room, prime beef makes as much sense as Mr. Capon's swell nods to old-school Italian-American classics, like shrimp scampi, woozy with garlic and butter, or broiled oysters under slightly scorched bread crumbs, New Orleans style. His zucchini carpaccio dotted with creamed feta, chopped pistachios and fresh mint is very good now; it will be excellent when squash is in season. He also makes a terrine of chicken livers and foie gras, smooth in all the right ways and served with onion jam and toasted brioche. This is true luxury, not the mock luxury of a garden-variety deviled egg trying to pass itself off as a $25 appetizer by dressing up in caviar. Mr. Capon is not given to rash experiments. He knows where the pleasure centers are and how to tickle them. (So does his pastry chef, Katie McAllister. Her desserts are unabashedly sweet, sometimes to the point where you lose interest, although the s'mores sundae is uncannily precise, down to the ice cream that tastes exactly like a campfire marshmallow.) So his duck lasagna is not some bold invention but a gooey casserole in which the duck ragù is essentially a seasoning and the bulk of the work is done by loads of melted caciocavallo. It is meant to serve two but could probably bring four people to a dead stop. And there is more. Much more. In the end, I barely put a dent in the menu, though it left its mark on me. Connoisseurs of ultratender burgers will go wild for Mr. Capon's hefty but loosely packed version on an extremely yielding bun. I like a burger that puts up more of a fight, but I loved the flavors of the melted raclette and caramelized onions. The most imposing of the meats is the veal chop, thick and quartz-pink. It's rubbed with paprika, coriander and fennel seeds for a whiff of the souk, but what gives it energy is the juice of a grilled orange half. That citrus-spice alchemy is a terrific solution to the boredom sometimes caused by plain broiled lumps of animal muscle. Another solution may be a smaller chop costing less than $52, but Bowery Meat Company understands that one of the jobs of any steakhouse, traditional or not, is to help carnivores spend lavishly. There is, as you'd expect, a proprietary cut of meat from the celebrity butcher Pat LaFrieda, the $54 "Bowery steak." (Imagine the things "Bowery steak" might have been a euphemism for 20 years ago.) A mosaic of trimmed rib-eye cap, it's intensely flavorful, but I wish Mr. Capon would leave the garlic-heavy raw chopped herb sauce on the side. The 14-ounce New York strip is $55, is served naked except for some roasted shallots and has a fine dry-aged tang. It was missing only a rough, satisfying crust of the kind the kitchen put on the côte de boeuf, a 38-ounce marvel of careful dry-aging and extensive marbling that costs $138. Demand for expensive beef rises with bull markets in stocks, and the current one just charged into its sixth year. The natural outcome of this is more steakhouses, but lately there have been complicating factors. Women don't take to the traditional steakhouse the way men have. Many people have ethical and environmental concerns about beef production. The most recent challenge is the rise of the small-plates culture, which has made portions of meat larger than, say, half a pound look a bit unseemly. This is why (he said, adopting a Viennese accent) the steakhouse has been acting so peculiar lately: It is trying to unite what's left of its core audience with the new herd of refugees from the small-plates revolution. Maybe Bowery Meat Company and places like it should just forget about defining themselves in relation to the steakhouse. Instead, they could come up with a new name for a place where you eat an appetizer followed by six or more ounces of meat, poultry or seafood. There used to be a word for this: restaurant.

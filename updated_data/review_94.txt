 "You like spicy?" Jimmy Lau asked from behind the counter at Shuko , the new restaurant just below Union Square where he and his partner, Nick Kim, prepare an elevated and memorable species of Japanese food. Before I could answer, he handed me a spicy tuna roll that would casually knock over my ideas about spicy tuna rolls, and spice, and tuna. Pickled red Thai chiles sat on top of the roll, chopped to bits and ready for action. The tuna underneath was soft sinew cut from the belly of a bluefin. It was grilled until the fat ran, until it soaked through the rice in its crisp nori wrapper and dripped out the bottom of the roll and into my palm. "Actually, it's not too spicy," Mr. Lau said. Ten seconds later, Mr. Kim leaned over and said almost the same thing: "Actually, it's not that spicy." Actually, gentlemen, it was really pretty spicy. In run-of-the-mill sushi bars, the spicy tuna roll is a cheap firecracker of questionable provenance. Nobody who has had Shuko's version, though, is going to forget it. The heat comes in gusts that keep getting stronger until you can't do anything but hold on. The chiles scour your tongue, cauterizing it. The melting oils from the tuna belly blanket your entire mouth, trying to restore the peace. The two sides, almost evenly matched, fight for control, and you are the battlefield. Mr. Lau and Mr. Kim were last seen sharpening their knives at Neta , a few blocks away. It was their first perch after leaving the truffled nest of Masa Takayama , who put Mr. Lau in charge of the kitchens at Bar Masa in New York and Las Vegas and made Mr. Kim head chef of Masa itself . Neta, though excellent, had a well-defined comfort zone right from the start. Compared with Shuko it looks like a restaurant on training wheels. Meanwhile, Mr. Takayama's operations, particularly now that the overpriced and underperforming Kappo Masa has been added to the fold, have begun to look like assembly lines where golden hooks are baited with two- and three-figure delicacies to dangle before whales. (Would you like the truffle maki roll topped with caviar or the caviar roll topped with truffles?) Those and other guaranteed bell-ringers do put in appearances at Shuko. Fat-streaked tuna belly, prone on a bed of rice, was one in a long volley of sushi pieces chosen by the chefs, at a cost of $135. Toro appeared again in the $175 kaiseki meal, a string of mesmerizing little plates followed by a shorter sushi recital. This time it took the shape of a homage to Mr. Takayama, a pure and tightly chilled tartare under a green-gray hump of Osetra caviar. During the five minutes or so it took to smear this on toasted milk bread and eat it, no force on earth could have stopped me short of hot lava flowing under the front door, and even then I would have made a guess at its speed before deciding to get up from the counter. What's impressive about Shuko, though, is how many times the chefs ring the bells without resorting to clich√©d indulgences. One of the most memorable pieces of nigiri in my sushi omakase was an intense, livery, chewy bite of squab cartilage with sansho pepper. Another was a slab of Mediterranean dorade so rich and fatty it reminded me of shrimp. Another was simply a grilled shiitake cap folded around a pinch of warm rice. On the kaiseki menu another night, finely shredded Japanese mountain yam, burdock and carrot had been flattened with slivers of scallop beard to make a crisp, airy, hand-held latke. Toward the middle of both meals, a chef began to lay down pickle slices, silently, one after another, like a blackjack dealer. Shuko had piled these carrots, radishes and so forth into wood barrels to ferment when they were still in season, not just to save their flavor but to expand it. New York State produce preserved by traditional Japanese methods makes a fine emblem for Shuko's blending of cultures. Another may be the facade on East 12th Street, where the windowless wall is finished with sand and particles of hay, and the door is marked only by a handful of dried flowers tied with a string. It could be an ancient house in Tokyo, if not for the classic New York cast-iron column running right down the middle. Open the door and you enter what could be downtown's latest version of cocktail hide-outs like Angel's Share or Milk & Honey. And in fact, once you sit down at the long and carefully buffed ash bar, a bartender in a beard and necktie will offer to stir up a drink for you. This is an offer worth accepting. Another server, in ripped bluejeans, pours house-made sparkling water. The music is very slightly louder than in most sushi bars and spans the decades from Debbie Harry to Sky Ferreira. Ice Cube is having a good day, but Lorde is over getting told to throw her hands up in the air. Some purists may feel that all this desecrates the temple of sushi. They can go eat in a temple. Mr. Lau and Mr. Kim, both young and fluent in several cultures at once, have taken all the preciousness out of omakase and kaiseki dining and replaced it with a relaxed, sophisticated cool. They were already moving in this direction at Neta, but with Shuko they've arrived. Everybody seems to feel comfortable here. (Some feel a little too comfortable; one night, a couple who seemed to have been married for several centuries carried on a long and inscrutable argument, while a young tycoon at the opposite end of the bar rattled off his company's revenue figures for the last five years.) Both menus offer an in-depth look at how good these two chefs are at bringing out flavors without appearing to be doing much to them. My sushi omakase, but not my kaiseki meals, included a flight of sea urchin, starting with pale, creamy blobs from Santa Barbara, Calif., then moving to Monterey, where the lobes were more compact and had a cleaner sweetness, and ending with uni topped with a lacy swirl of shirako tempura, the hot and buttery seminal fluid of a cod. The kaiseki doesn't delve as intimately into marine biology, but in recompense it offers a slightly wider variety of surprises. One of them is an ending too good to give away, a dessert that is so unluxurious and un-Japanese and wonderful that the chefs seem to be smiling to themselves every time it's served.

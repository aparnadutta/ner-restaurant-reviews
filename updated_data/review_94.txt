 LAS VEGAS -- Guiding a table of first-time diners through the menu, a server said, "The idea of the restaurant is that Giada wants you to feel like you're in her home." Not many homes have seating for 260 or wraparound views of the synchronized emissions from the Bellagio's fountains. But if domestic intimacy is rare at Giada, the restaurant that the Food Network star Giada De Laurentiis opened in June inside the Cromwell Las Vegas hotel, there is little doubt whose place it is. Ms. De Laurentiis is invoked so often that it can seem she wants you to feel as if you're in her museum. The board of flatbread and grissini is announced as "Giada's bread selection," and the plate of thumbprint and "mega-chip" cookies is "Giada's cookie selection." "Giada" is stenciled on a large pink canvas that hangs on a wall. Her words, familiar to her television audience, are even repeated in six chandeliers around the dining room, cut out in silhouette so that light beams from behind: "I eat a little bit of Everything and not a lot of Anything." As a quotation for posterity, this is not exactly "Et tu, Brute?" But it may describe Ms. De Laurentiis's philosophy for the food at Giada. All of it is in a relaxed, approachable California-Italian mode, and none of it is very hard to leave on the plate. A medium-size twirl of flaccid bucatini in bland fresh tomato sauce ($24) made the case against the common view that simple food is the best. The margherita pizzette ($10), soft as a Parker House roll and covered with mozzarella that had the pale-yellow color and elusive flavor of processed cheese, might have come from the children's menu of any restaurant in America except an Italian one. Sold as "Giada's signature dish," the chicken cacciatore for two ($55) was a puzzle whose pieces didn't fit. First, a server brought out a pan with a trussed and roasted chicken, colorful peppers, cipollini onions and mushrooms. This was taken away. What was served sometime later was a stack of browned, dry chicken pieces that seemed to have no relationship to the original bird, along with a dish of tomato sauce made from some vegetables, but not (as far as I could tell) the ones I had seen earlier. Something was missing here -- maybe the commercial that on television would have run between the first chicken and the second. In May, two weeks before Giada was scheduled to serve its first meal, Ms. De Laurentiis fired her executive chef. She has been looking for a permanent replacement ever since, but the restaurant stays open. The ideal candidate should have experience with pizza and pasta.

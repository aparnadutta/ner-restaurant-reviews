 NEW ORLEANS -- The busiest meal of the day is still breakfast, which for many customers still begins with a cocktail and ends with dessert. At tableside trolleys inside the many dining rooms, bananas still go up in flames every few minutes. The stucco facade on Royal Street in the French Quarter is still pink, although the paint manufacturer prefers to call it Tomato Cream Sauce. (The trim color is Mayonnaise.) At a glance, Brennan's seems to be rolling along just as it has since it was founded in 1946. Over the last two years, though, the restaurant has been the subject of a foreclosure, a bankruptcy and a visit by the New Orleans Police Department, called in to pacify a shareholders meeting. Brennans inveighed against Brennans. Brennans sued Brennans. The restaurant was sold off in pieces: the building for $6.85 million, the name and other accouterments for $3 million . An estimated $20 million more was poured into fixing up the 18th-century structure and building new kitchens and dining rooms. When the pieces were put back together, Brennan's was in the hands of a new Brennan from another branch of the family, Ralph Brennan, and the kitchen was turned over to a new chef, Slade Rushing. Since reopening the restaurant in November , the two have tried to keep many Brennan's traditions alive. At the same time, they live in the modern world. Mr. Rushing spent the last seven years as chef of MiLa here, and Mr. Brennan runs six other restaurants. They agree that Brennan's won't survive if they can't give it two things it hasn't had in recent years: a reputation for good food, and the local following that goes with it. It had both in the early days, when Owen Brennan started the business, and his sister Ella helped manage it. To stand out from its more established competitors, Brennan's began to specialize in breakfast. It did this by encouraging diners, starting as early as 8 a.m., to pack more courses, more sugar, more fat and more cocktails into the morning meal than most Americans consumed in an entire day. One might begin with a glass of brandy milk punch as an eye-opener and end with bananas Foster, finished with a huge shot of flaming rum. This was nominally dessert, although in New Orleans, the line between drinking and everything else is often a blurred one. "If you haven't had breakfast at Brennan's, you haven't really been to New Orleans at all, you know, che?" the novelist Peter S. Feibleman wrote in 1971, sliding into local dialect for his contribution to the Time-Life "Foods of the World" series, the volume on Louisiana. "Well, go there, you hear? Go there." By that time, the Brennans, led by Ella, Dick and their siblings, were opening restaurants in other neighborhoods and cities, starting with Commander's Palace . There was dissent in the ranks, though, and in 1974 the various branches agreed to a family divorce. Owen's children kept Brennan's. The other Brennans would run everything else. Neither side would explain, but it was clear the split was traumatic. "When the family broke up, it was a huge deal," said Emeril Lagasse, the chef of Commander's Palace from 1982 to 1989. "My experience with Ella and Dick over eight years was that the love that they grew up with, they wanted to express that. For Saturday and Sunday brunch at Commander's Palace, there was a lot of feeling and dishes on the menu that were really memories of Ella being at Brennan's on Royal Street." Outsiders who hope to understand the importance of Brennan's to the family, and the importance of the family to New Orleans, should bear in mind that after Brennan's had changed hands and Ella Brennan returned to the building in November for her first visit in 40 years, The Times-Picayune sent a reporter to cover it. Until the name began to appear in headlines, the subject of Brennan's rarely came up for many locals except in connection with the prices. "At one point, it started getting really outrageously expensive," Mr. Lagasse said. "I heard that a lot from people at the end of the last regime: ‘Wow, it's super-expensive for eggs.' " My breakfast there at 8 on a recent Sunday morning seemed fairly priced for a meal that included, in the fitness-minded Brennan's style, some grilled shrimp followed by pan-fried veal grillades over grits and then dessert, interwoven with a cocktail or two. For the menu, Mr. Rushing had dug into the restaurant's archives: There were crepes with a bright satsuma sauce, and there were baked apples with sugary lids of pecans and oats, both suggested as appetizers; eggs Hussarde and eggs Sardou; a mixed-seafood gumbo thickened with filé; and a generously sherried snapping-turtle soup that was almost the color of black beans. Our server had an impressive ability to read the table, talking slowly and quietly in the beginning and picking up the pace only once she had gotten two Bloody Marys and a French 75 into us. I've eaten a morning feast this substantial, served with this level of sympathy and formality, just once before; that was at Commander's Palace, and technically it was brunch, not breakfast. Creole stalwarts also anchored Brennan's dinner menu, but one page was given to something you won't find at Galatoire's or Antoine's : a five-course chef's tasting. "Brennan's is known for breakfast, and you can't really mess around with breakfast," our server said, by way of explanation. "So this is where the chef gets to play around a little bit." Without strapping myself in for the full tasting, I still managed to eat most of Mr. Rushing's playing-around dishes. Remaking New Orleans barbecue shrimp with a very un-New Orleans ingredient, lobster claw, seemed like a delicious joke. I was impressed, too, by how much flavor white soy, threads of tart fermented mustard greens and browned coins of fried Japanese eggplant brought to slabs of raw amberjack without overshadowing the fish. One of the best things I ate at Brennan's was a duck-confit-studded rutabaga cake, Mr. Rushing's version of a Chinese-Vietnamese pan-fried turnip cake. To his mind, cooking Creole cuisine means being alert to flavors that new immigrants are bringing to the city's gumbo pot. In these early innings, Mr. Rushing's menu sometimes seemed to stretch too far in its effort to straddle the old and the new, without really doing justice to either. A surprising number of dishes were undone by one small detail: The turtle soup needed more brightness; the fried rabbit seemed to have lost its crunch after leaving the oil; the pompano didn't take on much color or flavor from the griddle; the lemon-butter sauce was a bit too thin to cling to its crab meat. The ideas and flavors were sound, though, so they may all come together once Mr. Rushing has all the cooks he needs for his three kitchens, which can serve up to 350 people at once. (By contrast, Mr. Rushing first received notice when he was cooking in a 28-seat Manhattan restaurant called Jack's Luxury Oyster Bar .) No such problems surfaced among the sweets, although now that I've tasted bananas Foster in its natural environment, I have to agree with Ella Brennan, who recently called the dessert "very ordinary" despite having a hand in inventing it. Almost everything else containing sugar was beautiful and refined, from the simple Creole crepes to a somewhat abstract version of bread pudding that was mostly a rich vanilla custard made even richer by big shards of praline. A few dots of French bread seemed to have been scattered around solely for propriety's sake. The dessert won't fool bread-pudding traditionalists, but it should please them. At the very least, it should help bring bread pudding into the 21st century. The French Quarter has become something of a Jurassic Park for Creole cuisine, a contained area in which to see shrimp rémoulade, oysters Rockefeller and other giants of a former age in all their lumbering glory. At Arnaud's, Antoine's, Galatoire's and Tujague's , evolution stops at the kitchen door. "That's what happens to our institutions," said Liz Williams, the president of the new Southern Food and Beverage Museum , in the Central City neighborhood. "They are not allowed to change. You might go to Antoine's once a year, but you don't want the menu to be any different than it was a year ago." That dynamic, she said, abandons restaurants to the tourist trade, which leaves them vulnerable. Mr. Rushing believes that's how the old Brennan's slouched into bankruptcy. "They got stuck in a rut and they took things for granted," he said. "Restaurants die if they're not progressive. You've got to have some sort of push for innovation."
